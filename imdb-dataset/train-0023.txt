<START> what's with <UNK> musical movies never have i seen <UNK> musical movies like the ones made in bollywood they miss the spirit of the story and just a bunch of <UNK> they <UNK> poetic lines br br this story about love of two kids who are separated and then meet again after a few years of changes has no special remarks it's a simple story plot but it's quite focused though with <UNK> to <UNK> musical story lines here and there br br confusing characters that should be saved by brilliant acting are neglected the main actress may try to live up the character but it's the best that she could do trying as for the casting i don't feel the necessity to put a <UNK> student in that story and of course that's not the only unnecessary characters br br the strange thing is why would i want to watch this movie maybe because of the <UNK>
<START> mary pickford becomes the <UNK> of a scottish clan after the death of her father and then has a romance as fellow <UNK> snow <UNK> said the film is rather episodic to begin some of it is amusing such as pickford <UNK> her <UNK> to church while some of it is just there all in all the story is weak especially the recycled contrived romance plot line and its climax the transfer is so dark it's difficult to appreciate the scenery but even <UNK> for that this doesn't appear to be director maurice <UNK> best work pickford and <UNK> <UNK> once more in the somewhat more accessible 'the poor little rich girl ' <UNK> pickford as a child character
<START> this is how movies are supposed to be made a fascinating setting characters about whom you come to care deeply writing and editing that move the plot <UNK> and build suspense this is a wonderful film deeply moving without being sentimental highly recommended
<START> <UNK> was on late last night at first i didn't think i would like it but seeing i didn't feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on i continued watching and felt myself intrigued by the young <UNK> a virgin pure and passionate her romance with the older <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> feelings even though the film is based on a very <UNK> level and not reality i loved it a lot more than the usual <UNK> or costume <UNK> great play great <UNK> great music and <UNK> i loved it and i want more of it
<START> after <UNK> the high rating on imdb i decided to go see this movie beyond that high rating i intentionally avoided reading any of the reviews i wanted to go into the theater with a clean <UNK> without knowing the plot or having <UNK> expectations br br given my rating you can see that i was disappointed i enjoyed the development of the main character mike <UNK> i also enjoyed how the hotel manager attempted to talk him out of entering the hotel room by the time <UNK> entered the room i was ready for some scary stuff br br first <UNK> appear on the <UNK> and the toilet paper is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a believable manner he's freaked out i'm encouraged and think to myself this is going to be good the people who made this movie understand that less is more br br but it's what happens next that was a big let down the <UNK> is quickly replaced by the predictable shotgun approach just blast the audience with every hollywood scary trick in the book and hope that something works let's see a clock radio that turns on by itself good that's always scary objects that move around in the room good you can't complain about that blood dripping from the walls and sink great ghosts that commit suicide good anything else how about loud noises shaking fire more shaking messing up the room more blood etc etc it's all good and it's all been done before <UNK> our attention <UNK> <UNK> audience with all kinds of stuff in quick succession and they won't be able to look away br br well it didn't work for me and you know what else when i go see a horror movie in a theater it's typical to hear several groups of girls in the audience yelling in fear at scary moments but this movie had no scary moments the audience was silent and <UNK> i felt no chill down my spine nothing the shining was <UNK> what this movie tries to be br br so who are all these people who are saying that it is one of the best horror movies ever friends of the director sorry i just don't get it
<START> the little girl <UNK> is so adorable i cant think of a more beautiful story then this one here it will make you cry laugh and believe knowing that this was based on a true story just made me gasp and it also made me realize that there are nice people out there great cast and an overall great movie
<START> i'm not going to <UNK> over <UNK> obvious <UNK> flaws instead i shall take a look at the positive aspects of this overrated celluloid <UNK> of a film br br 1 peter bogdanovich managed to make a movie that can be endured in its entirety this fact alone places the movie high up above and all the way up to the top of his lame filmography br br 2 bogdanovich had shown how amazingly generous some lucky boyfriends can be by sharing <UNK> <UNK> his then gal fabulous body and breasts with his male audience and not just on one but on two occasions <UNK> the <UNK> highlights of this cinematic <UNK> del <UNK> br br 3 <UNK> has barely a scene without stereotypical country music <UNK> in the background peter tried to make the obvious point that the movie is set in america's deep south as if it weren't <UNK> obvious so he <UNK> that point on and on and on how is this an advantage you might ask well when the movie finally ends and the monotonous country music finally <UNK> <UNK> your tired ear drums you start experiencing a strange <UNK> the movie's finally over it's pure joy br br 4 the movie gives all women who look like <UNK> <UNK> hope hope that they too may one day snatch a much younger and maybe even good looking boyfriend br br 5 <UNK> <UNK> biography which i realize isn't technically a part of <UNK> gives hope to all women that look like that that they too may one day win a miss chicago beauty <UNK> provided they have enough money to <UNK> the jury with br br you think i'm joking <UNK> <UNK> having won a beauty <UNK> huh well check out her bio and then we'll see who laughs last br br 6 the movie was shot in black and white which <UNK> us the sight of <UNK> <UNK> face in its original natural non glory
<START> really awful lead actor did ok the film plot etc was completely crap and inaccurate it may as well have been a sequel to well anything it had little or no relevance to <UNK> way and should be avoided like the plague by any carlito's ways fans no mention of <UNK> in fact he ends up with some other bird no mention of <UNK> no mention of how he got caught no mention of how he ended up in jail they attempted to make it like the original with flash backs at the beginning but to be honest when rating it i was looking for a zero mark unfortunately i had to rate it higher br br its a terrible attempt to cash in on what was one of the best films of the 90's overall it was approximately <UNK> and 2 hours of my life wasted for all the action in it it was truly boring slow and predictable again to any <UNK> way fans avoid this fiasco
<START> otto <UNK> noir classic works almost as a flip side of laura while that film was <UNK> and features the high <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this film is a whole lot <UNK> dana andrews is a less than good cop who accidentally kills a man only to have it potentially <UNK> on the father of the girl he loves preminger keeps things moving at a <UNK> clip so that <UNK> in logic are easily overlooked andrews is quite fine a lot less wooden than he's been in the past and the stunningly beautiful gene tierney is stunningly beautiful creepy craig stevens plays the unlucky victim where the sidewalk ends is a must see and a terrific companion piece to <UNK> equally lurid <UNK> also starring tierney
<START> for paris is a <UNK> feast ernest <UNK> br br it is impossible to count how many great talents have <UNK> paris in paintings novels songs <UNK> short but unforgettable quotes and yes movies the celebrated film director max <UNK> said about paris br br it offered the shining wet <UNK> under the street lights breakfast in <UNK> with <UNK> in your glass coffee and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and prostitutes at night everyone in the world has two <UNK> his own and paris br br paris is always associated with love and romance and paris je t'aime which is subtitled <UNK> romances is a collection of short films often sketches from 18 talented directors from all over the world in each we become familiar with one of the city of light 20 <UNK> and with the <UNK> of all ages <UNK> colors and backgrounds who all deal in love in its many variations and stages in some of the <UNK> romances we are the witnesses of the unexpected encounters of the strangers that lead to instant interest <UNK> and perhaps relationship like for <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in the street of <UNK> in the opening film or for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as a white boy and a muslim girl whose cross cultural romance directed by <UNK> <UNK> begins on <UNK> de <UNK> i would include into this category the humorous short film by gus van <UNK> in le <UNK> one boy <UNK> his heart out to another boy <UNK> of sudden unexpected <UNK> asking <UNK> to call never realizing that the object of his interest does not understand french br br some of the vignettes are poignant and even dark in walter <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> du <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> amazing oscar nominated debut for maria full of grace is single working class mother who has to work as a <UNK> in a wealthy neighborhood to pay for <UNK> where she drops her baby every morning before she goes to work one of most memorable and truly heartbreaking films is place des <UNK> by oliver <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> co star as two young people for who love could have happened there were the promises of it but it was cut short due to hatred and <UNK> that are present everywhere and the city of love and light is no exception another one that really got to me was <UNK> written and directed by <UNK> <UNK> starring sergio <UNK> miranda richardson and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has fallen out of love with his wife richardson but when he is ready to leave with the beautiful mistress the devastating news from his wife's doctor arrives br br i can go on <UNK> on all 18 small gems i like some of them very much the others felt weak and perhaps will be forgotten soon but overall i am very glad that i bought the dvd and i know that i will return to my favorite films again and again they are place des <UNK> that i've mentioned already <UNK> <UNK> directed by wes craven that involves the ghost of one of the <UNK> and <UNK> men ever oscar <UNK> alexander payne the director of <UNK> who would save one troubled relationship payne also directed <UNK> <UNK> in which a lonely middle aged post worker from denver co explores the city on her own providing the voice over in french with the heavy accent <UNK> entry is one of the most moving and along with hilarious <UNK> by joel and ethan <UNK> with who else steve <UNK> is my absolute favorite in both shorts american tourists sit on the <UNK> <UNK> in the park and steve in paris <UNK> after visiting <UNK> <UNK> the life around them with the different results while <UNK> may say my <UNK> sad and light my sorrow is bright <UNK> character will find out that sometimes even the most <UNK> and useful tourist guide would not help a tourist avoiding doing the wrong things in a foreign country
<START> a brilliant movie about family guilt sacrifice betrayal and love macy is such a great actor it was almost a shame to see him in the same scenes with campbell who looks the part of a neurotic sex object but doesn't have the chops to work with him on the level the script called for but he's such a good actor that he played down to her level to make the scenes work i highly applaud the casting of <UNK> <UNK> as the neglected wife who knew sutherland is also very good the way he moves makes his character look <UNK> and even younger in some scenes almost everyone knew what they were doing br br <UNK> portrayal of the only situation in which his character is not able to be careful is nothing short of complete <UNK>
<START> i had heard some bad things about cabin fever almost as much as i heard the <UNK> hype as it turns out the first film from the new <UNK> eli roth it's just a so so effort with the iq points dropping as the film progresses there are worse movies out there and surely more gory ones while i'm not sure how the hype <UNK> got so high on the blood count for hostel there is a good amount for genre fans here the premise isn't necessarily bad either though kids go to a cabin for a week of <UNK> only to come across a very sick man covered in blood whom in a panic they set on fire he winds up dead in the water that <UNK> the <UNK> and soon the characters all <UNK> to the flesh eating virus one way or another the characters either the lead college kids including rider strong as the hero and james <UNK> as the goofy side bar or the supporting <UNK> folks are <UNK> to the point of <UNK> if not painfully so br br as they meet their <UNK> the <UNK> get pretty weird and it just seems to be non <UNK> thrown together without the many laughs <UNK> <UNK> comes out of nowhere and maybe might have been funnier in another movie or by itself but in the context of the rest of the movie it just doesn't work there's also a young police character who is even dumber and less convincing than the others and the family that goes after <UNK> following an incident has some possibilities that aren't realized but all the while roth <UNK> up his script with common sense out the window and sudden scares and <UNK> with people <UNK> up blood on one another and a killer dog rambling around which isn't all for not either now unlike lesser troma horror movies or even lesser ones of the 70s or 80s to which i'm sure roth is a die hard fan he doesn't make it unwatchable it's also smart to not have any explanation for where the virus comes from br br but unlike those films too he also doesn't really have a fine idea of what makes for great campy horror times his film tries for that of course and only once or twice does he make it a goofy bloody time i did like the random bunny strong sees while on the <UNK> it's not even very poorly shot a lot of the time albeit with its own contrived style choices ala red <UNK> on the lens or that story with the <UNK> alley worker it simply contains a lot of illogical scenarios and choices made <UNK> your legs with a deadly virus uh huh and it aims for fairly typical ground if that's your cup of tea more power to you but at the end i found it to be actually un exceptional genre territory that doesn't offend audience sensibilities ala saw but doesn't swing for the fence either as a clever b movie roth also has the <UNK> to end the movie on a true note of <UNK> the <UNK> as the santa claus <UNK> <UNK> store clerk from earlier in the film serves a bunch of black people it could work if he followed up on it with something better or if he dropped it altogether same could be said for a lot of the movie c
<START> this film is harmless <UNK> fun something the recent tomb <UNK> film lacked i can't wait to get the dvd how can people give this a low score and still go and see titanic without a guilty conscience i do not know anything with karen <UNK> in her underwear has got to rate an extra point or two
<START> i was pleasantly surprised to find that how to lose friends and alienate people was nowhere near as <UNK> <UNK> a comedy as the trailer had led me to expect i rapidly became absorbed in the unfolding of the narrative and remained <UNK> throughout pacing of the more visual humorous content was i thought spot on i mean i got the impression i was witnessing <UNK> attempts at <UNK> lost control very much <UNK> real <UNK> so to speak at other moments there was time allowed to share the main <UNK> i e <UNK> and <UNK> reflection on how events were affecting them and what had led them to where they now found themselves all the characters were well cast to some extent interesting in and of themselves and generally quite likable any apparent ruthless ambition displayed tended to be <UNK> by a <UNK> good natured <UNK> an entertaining intelligently scripted brilliantly directed and superbly acted film that i would thoroughly recommend
<START> gender <UNK> the <UNK> br br a man or a woman who knows br br it turns out that <UNK> is both br br sleeping in clay br br then they all went away br br in one of their <UNK> br br gender <UNK> is another great season 1 episode i enjoy this one because the story is the kind where you are never really sure what's gonna happen next it is entirely original the <UNK> is very fun with the close up of the eye and the reflection of the disco lights i really need to learn my that thumb trick the <UNK> <UNK> does i really like the atmosphere at the <UNK> little village and <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> around in the middle of the night its very exciting this is one of my favorite season 1 episodes in fact i think the thing i like about it so much is how they turn out to be aliens in the end and left crop circles many people see this as a non mythology related alien episode kind of like the unnatural or space but i think this could easily be seen as mythology related maybe the <UNK> was just like the alien bounty hunter and could appear to look like anyone huh anyway i give the episode a 9 out of 10
<START> yeah well i definitely had regrets about giving up my saturday night watching this strange little yet very long movie apparently neither did the main character for stealing two hours of my life here's the epitome of the <UNK> in <UNK> regrets ' we have this jerk so messed up so wandering so selfish <UNK> and unlikable that it was extremely hard to get past the attraction a highly <UNK> <UNK> up and coming son <UNK> unless it was just that physical attraction he claims otherwise that it's love but after watching this it's like loving charles <UNK> because you dig the beard alright he's not that bad but still no real <UNK> characteristics i could never get past the reason <UNK> endless stalks <UNK> it was never shown just told that <UNK> loves <UNK> perhaps it's a culture thing that flew over my head crazy stalking mad love over in <UNK> it has to be because a little more than half the movie is one stalking the other and the last part is stalking back and forth to the point i thought this was turning into a screwball comedy i was waiting for a tiger named baby to make an appearance okay so <UNK> works two jobs while going to school so far so good on someone trying to better themselves but after his first taste of his <UNK> attraction he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring what ok well as previously mentioned the obsession doesn't stop due to the job career change and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters you get one messed up movie where unbelievable <UNK> just seem to happen without <UNK> basic movie not 100 terrible but you can do better with foreign gay themed movies
<START> <UNK> performance is aided by the brilliantly written script the <UNK> hollywood studios in the 30's and 40's were able to copy some of the german <UNK> film elements and <UNK> them into hollywood films very good use of shadows and light and <UNK> i really liked the scene where colman turns off the light in his dressing room near the beginning of the film and he starts <UNK> othello while his face becomes instantly dark and evil already the viewer sees the text and the drama of shakespeare getting a hold of tony and off he goes on his journey of doom i also enjoyed the dramatic death scene within the play when he becomes overwrought with emotion and accidentally <UNK> his <UNK> a little too hard for her to bear her <UNK> tony stop you're hurting me are chilling and suspenseful you just don't know if he is going to go over the top and kill her at any moment the cat and mouse chase to reveal the killer was nicely added 2 <UNK> of the way through the film to add some faster pacing and to also add to the narrative element of the film masterful work from george <UNK> he's such as <UNK> director excellent film too bad they don't make 'em like they used to
<START> contrary to another reviewer i think that this is well written especially the more fictional it is because greater imagination would be required and well acted because there were no other characters with whom to share the focus of these dozen minutes plus well done monologues but i'm just not entertained by such <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> everybody has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others everybody has problems and some are more intense than others these are just ten not very <UNK> stories and problems <UNK> how <UNK> life or part of it is fodder for film then again i think poorly of tv's reality shows too so if that's your bag you may like this it's the kind of stuff that would make for good <UNK> and or internet <UNK> but absolutely without other than verbal action and although each of the <UNK> is female i'm gonna leave gender outta this
<START> ah <UNK> i'm a huge michael jackson fan i grew up with his music thriller was actually the first music video i ever saw apparently believe it or not there was a time where michael jackson was like a god to people a time where women <UNK> at the sight of him before really <UNK> before seeing the sight of him sorry michael but <UNK> was what started to be a tribute to all of michael's success of the time right when he released his famous bad album that was record breaking was the first album to have 6 top ten <UNK> michael is an incredible artist there is no doubt he writes sings dances but when it comes to acting or keeping a story straight with his <UNK> not so much br br we start off pretty simple jackson's music life career success and the <UNK> that was the 80's biggest star in the world michael jackson later on jackson is a 30's style gangster who uses his powers as a crime figure to protect the children when jackson was allowed to be near children we cut to him playing in a field with the children and their dog the dog runs away and in their search for it jackson and the children <UNK> the <UNK> of mr big frankie <UNK> a drug dealing mobster with an army of henchmen who wants to get the entire <UNK> of planet earth addicted to drugs starting with the children mr big discovers jackson and the children but they escape jackson tells the children to meet him at club 30's which turns out to be a haunted nightclub abandoned since the 1930s the story goes back to the <UNK> attack on jackson and here it is revealed that jackson is actually a magical gangster who draws his power from shooting stars as one passes by the club jackson transforms into a sports car and <UNK> down several of mr <UNK> henchmen the story picks up on the children at club 30's and at first the children are afraid but when jackson appears the scary atmosphere of the club transforms and the children find themselves back in the 1930s the club is now filled with <UNK> <UNK> and swing dancers jackson <UNK> in a dance off with the other club members which serves as the music video for smooth criminal at the climax of the song mr big lays siege to the club and kidnaps one of the children katie jackson follows them back to <UNK> <UNK> and ends up surrounded by his henchmen mr big appears and mentally <UNK> jackson by threatening to <UNK> katie with highly <UNK> <UNK> while katie manages to just grab joe <UNK> glasses and get free from being <UNK> mr big decides he's had enough and orders his men to kill katie before finishing off jackson but not before a shooting star flies by jackson transforms into a giant robot and kills all of mr <UNK> soldiers <UNK> <UNK> you want more weirdness watch the movie br br <UNK> is fun for the first half hour seeing michael's success and all his hard work really makes his fans appreciate him once again is it mostly to hype up his album yeah i love how he spends the first 25 minutes <UNK> how awesome he is then we go to his song called leave me alone which is kind of <UNK> not that it's not a great song just a small turn of events then when we skip the crummy acting the story was incredibly weak the villain spells his name out loud while michael and katie are <UNK> on him lol michael is a <UNK> all of a sudden the <UNK> big monster plan is to make kids high also the villain has some sort of massive ray gun that would make marvin the martian <UNK> but if there is one new thing that is incredible that the movie gives us is the new video for smooth criminal this music video is perfection it's <UNK> it's setting it's song it's smooth style michael always goes above and beyond perfection and smooth criminal was incredible i loved <UNK> as a kid i still watch it for fun to this day but it's not the best movie by any means it's pretty silly but it's all good if you're a michael jackson fan as well br br 7 10
<START> this contains spoilers br br i have rarely seen a film that is as unbelievable as this one is and being french it tries for depth by being <UNK> nothing really makes any sense br br <UNK> is gay and has just announced at breakfast to his family that he is hiv positive the youngest brother marcel has not yet come down to breakfast and the first thing the family does is decide that at 12 years of age he is too young to be told maybe if he was four or five but twelve the first totally unbelievable thing is that the family doesn't even ask where or how he got the virus how long he has known about <UNK> nothing is asked they only worry about marcel finding out this is a very close <UNK> <UNK> family but although they decide not to let marcel know about <UNK> hiv positive status nor the fact of his being gay the rest of the family accepts all this news with absolutely no questions or reactions how many families do you know where the parents brothers wouldn't have at least some reaction to one of the members <UNK> that he is gay here nothing br br <UNK> decides that he needs to go to paris to see his ex lover and he decides to go on the trip with of all people marcel do you know anyone who would bring his little brother along to go see a lover again totally unbelievable especially since marcel is not supposed to know either of his medical problems nor of his homosexuality if this is the way the family has decided to let him find out it is rather brutal and again unbelievable br br <UNK> goes to find his lover <UNK> at his work in a paris bar the owner says that <UNK> will not be there until the early evening but why would <UNK> want to see him at work why not phone and <UNK> to see him in some place more private where they can really talk why not go and see him at his home but no <UNK> shows up later in the day with marcel in <UNK> and is surprised when <UNK> doesn't just drop everything to go walk with him for 5 minutes <UNK> tells him that he is no longer available that it was <UNK> who left him and that <UNK> hadn't <UNK> to any of his letters <UNK> says but i love you and then wanders off but if he really loved <UNK> wouldn't he have at least told him about his hiv status to warn him to get tested and maybe get <UNK> this would be the least he could do  but not a <UNK> he leaves and doesn't even warn <UNK> that he might have <UNK> the aids virus this is totally irresponsible of him  and of the film makers this film was apparently made for a french tv series for young people  it is the perfect way to show kids how to be responsible well not <UNK> i guess every man for himself is still the french way of doing <UNK> another aspect of the film which was totally unbelievable was the <UNK> <UNK> aspect everyone is always <UNK> against someone <UNK> someone or kissing someone inside the family and outside the family i have never seen anyone in france be this physical never mind an entire family <UNK> at the breakfast table one 17 year old brother has his leg <UNK> on the lap of his elder brother and the elder brother is <UNK> his leg as everyone sits around discussing something how many brothers do you know who are that physically close in another scene the same 17 year old comes into <UNK> room asking what's the matter can't you sleep then takes off his clothes and completely naked gets into bed with his brother and <UNK> up to him as if they were lovers this and another similar scene between <UNK> and marcel gave a somewhat incestuous feel to the film sorry again i don't believe that this is regular behaviour between teenage brothers br br the only good thing i can say about the film is that the actors are all quite <UNK> especially marcel in the main role but it wasn't really <UNK> hiv and aids are far too serious to be presented in such a vague and irresponsible light at the end of the film the family has gone to the cemetery to bury <UNK> but once again marcel has been left out of it  he has been left in the care of a cousin i think nevertheless he <UNK> out and watches the funeral from <UNK> is this what such a close <UNK> family would have done it is totally <UNK> that they would not have included him in his brother's funeral it was the last scene of the film and it was the last straw for this viewer
<START> i was kinda interested in this movie as a trashy cannibal flick i was thoroughly disappointed it was the same kind of disappointment i felt watching <UNK> the 13th jason takes <UNK> so much potential wasted br br the opening scene is a decent attention <UNK> then it <UNK> to a halt <UNK> breasts and <UNK> 80s fashion cannot help this movie the only things eating near this island of cannibal monks are the <UNK> i'm not asking for <UNK> <UNK> level of gore but i was looking for cheap over the top exploitative gore i got none of that br br i found a couple parts of the fight scenes somewhat intriguing hence the 2 stars i don't think its really worth the time it takes to watch it though i could see showing it at a party where nobody cares about what is going on and you just want something on in the background but i would not tell anyone oh dude you gotta see this movie it is neither good enough nor bad enough to warrant much attention
<START> and i really mean that i caught it last night on <UNK> and i was not expecting it to be so good this is now one of my favorites i must add that it has a killer soundtrack
<START> five passengers at a bus <UNK> tell each other their scary dreams while waiting to be picked up but is there more to these nightmares than meets the eye br br lucky me five bad movies for the price of one each segment features the very worst in acting special effects make up and music and these were supposed to be scary hmm i think i've been more freaked out during an episode of <UNK> i swear you'll sit there like i was bored to tears waiting in vain for something interesting to happen don't bother it never does in fact i even stopped fast <UNK> the commercials as they were a good deal more entertaining than the main feature and the ending is the ultimate cop out yep none of this actually ever happened if only the same could be said for the day i set my vcr to record this <UNK> 2 10
<START> when i tell people that i review movies as a <UNK> the first thing they say is what do you think of such and such movie there are a couple of problems here firstly there is the <UNK> chance that i've not seen it and thus i ruin my reputation secondly i could trash the movie in question without <UNK> that it's actually their favourite lastly i could be given dvds to watch so they can judge my opinion thus i find myself sat before the convent which is the sort of film i would ignore completely given the choice but unable to avoid here <UNK> the pity because this frankly dreadful horror is about as scary as a box of <UNK> br br following well worn clichés the convent focuses on a bunch of american high school students on a trip to an abandoned convent on a mission to get stoned laid and mildly <UNK> but you'll never guess what happens next a group of <UNK> demonic nuns emerge from the <UNK> who proceed to pick the kids off one by one in classic horror movie tradition will any of them survive and more importantly haven't you got better things to worry about br br the only thing that saves the convent from being a total waste of time is the fact that nobody is really taking this <UNK> seriously with the exception of <UNK> bizarre cameo as a <UNK> cop with an itchy trigger finger it's far too amusing to be properly frightening the zombie <UNK> who makes <UNK> noises for no reason the day <UNK> paint jobs that appears when you become a zombie but what really kills it as a horror is the fact that you can instantly tell when someone is going to jump out and get <UNK> murdered but even if they were trying i still doubt that it would work demonic nuns wearing the sort of make up you'd see in the buffy the vampire <UNK> tv show aren't really that scary the scariest thing about this movie really is that over 10 of voters gave this a maximum score i mean i know it's funny but i hardly split my sides to be honest i've had more fun in a dentist br br the convent isn't really a horror movie as such it's more of a comedy horror like scary movie or shaun of the dead but you're laughing at it instead of with it i honestly can't recommend this to anybody except the family of the cast and crew but even then i doubt very much they'd enjoy it i don't enjoy the so bad that it's good genre i personally feel that if the film makers can't be bothered to salvage a turkey then i shouldn't bust a gut trying to watch it yes it's a bad film and yes they really should have gone home and done something more <UNK> a <UNK> cube for example the dvd box has two price <UNK> one for <UNK> 99 and a reduced price of <UNK> but it was sold for <UNK> and that should tell you everything you need to know about this <UNK> cheap <UNK> bad flick sorry if you do like it but the convent really is a pile of <UNK> crap
<START> when i was <UNK> i genuinely believed elvis to be the king of rock and roll and not only did i wish to see all <UNK> of his character movies but it was my ambition to own them too what an exceptionally poor excuse for a <UNK> year old i must have been thankfully sense <UNK> and live a little love a little is the only elvis film i own br br the spotlight has fallen on this one recently since a <UNK> version of top song a little less conversation has been released as a single his first to reach the uk top ten in 22 years  his first uk no 1 in 25 even when i was <UNK> and in serious need of psychiatric help i realised that the songs for this movie weren't exactly first rate however a little less conversation <UNK> and 60s <UNK> aside is a real standout finding a lesser known song that only a relatively small few are aware of promoted into the mainstream produces a mixture of emotions it's nice to finally see faith in a song <UNK> but it's also <UNK> to see the <UNK> of your own private cult and what <UNK> lyrics too though what other elvis song contains the word <UNK> br br but what really bothers me about this film is not a little less conversation but the <UNK> minutes that surround it actually based on a novel kiss my firm but <UNK> lips what kind of lame novel would that be this one sees a bored elvis <UNK> up with a comedy dog and a <UNK> within 90 seconds of meeting him <UNK> carey asks would you like to make love to me quite a fast <UNK> by any standards i'm sure you'll agree br br i do seem to recall that some of <UNK> early movies most notably <UNK> rock and king <UNK> weren't too bad but this is just <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> being fired from a newspaper job can lead to a five minute karate fight with a couple of <UNK> causing a <UNK> pile up is good for a laugh and models dress as pink <UNK> there's even a dream sequence for god's sake maybe the only dumb stereotype it doesn't <UNK> to is in not having all that many songs with just four to choose from including the credits number you're waiting an average of 22 minutes between tracks some movies would become vapid by having too many tunes but here they might have helped to have <UNK> the pain of the remaining three tracks then the edge of reality isn't actually that bad though <UNK> dance to it must surely have been called the bear trap br br in one sense for a pg <UNK> film from 1968 then this is shockingly high on sexual content sadly however with talking dogs middle america sitcom values and the <UNK> dancing you'll ever see <UNK> dignity is <UNK> by this movie
<START> first off i would like to point out that the reason why i gave this movie 1 star out of 10 is because there is no option to give it no stars it really is that bad i was never eager to see this film after i saw the ads for it i ended up seeing it only by chance because some friends of mine had tickets and had one spare so i <UNK> along before seeing it i had a fairly good idea that it wouldn't be genius the premise seemed far too silly and stupid for anything good to come out of it but at the back of my mind i was thinking but there must be something good about it for uma thurman and luke wilson do to the film not that i think either of them are particularly terrific but they are big named stars who would normally only do films that would enhance their <UNK> however about 10 20 minutes into the feature i realized that the movie was probably worse than i had at first anticipated i was shocked at how terrible the script was it really gave the actors nothing to work with so much so that they really looked like they didn't know what they were doing especially luke wilson the story was completely predictable if you've seen the ad then you've pretty much seen the movie and there was nothing original about it it pretty much borrows from every <UNK> <UNK> story that has ever been which would be acceptable had the film been set up as a satire of that genre but alas it wasn't the direction seemed to be of realism i got the feeling that the director wanted the film to feel completely realistic and not satire at all and yet there were some moments in the film that were so unbelievably unrealistic that it would have worked if it were a satire at one moment in the movie two of the characters seem to die and one of the surviving characters has a line like oh well she's dead time to move on and he says it in such a <UNK> voice that it completely didn't make any sense i found myself checking my watch after about 40 minutes to see how much longer i would have to sit through it and then it struck me i began to think i wonder if the studio have made this picture as a test to see if they can make the worst possible movie ever made and still pull a large audience i couldn't think of any other reason why this film would be made for movies to be made these days the script goes to a massive screening process and very very few scripts actually make it to the production stage i can't comprehend how this one got past the first draft stage by the end and exceedingly dumb <UNK> <UNK> stupid climax i was laughing <UNK> just not at what the film makers wanted me to laugh at but instead at how ridiculous and stupid the movie was thank god i didn't have to pay money to see it because that would have really annoyed me oh and could i just add that of the two wilson brothers i have always preferred luke because i think he is a better more versatile actor but if he wants to step even further into <UNK> shadow then this is exactly the way to do it i doubt that he will get many more job offers after this crappy waste of 2 hours and remember it only got a generous 1 10 because i couldn't <UNK> 0
<START> it may or may not be considered interesting that the only reason i really checked out this movie in the first place was because i wanted to see the performance of the man who beat out <UNK> bogart in his casablanca 10 10 role for the best actor oscar i still would have given the oscar to <UNK> but paul lukas did do a great job and deserved the nomination at least well i'm glad i did check this movie out because i enjoyed it immensely i think the movie did <UNK> a little but not only did i not mind i enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with them br br the acting was outstanding in this movie i especially enjoyed paul lukas <UNK> watson rightfully nominated for an oscar bette davis <UNK> not nominated george <UNK> and oddly eric roberts who plays the middle child i really enjoyed his character an odd looking boy who talks like some sort of <UNK> he just cracks me up even the characters name <UNK> is funny br br the ending in which <UNK> character was forced to do something he considered wrong even though he was doing it for all the right reasons worked for me as well i agreed with why he felt he had to what he did and i understood why he couldn't quite explain it the message this movie makes is a good and noble one the scenery meaning the house is beautiful and the acting is the excellent watch this movie if you ever get a chance br br 9 10
<START> three <UNK> get their just <UNK> after wasting their lives in greed drugs ego and bad attitudes interesting and well done this style of film always makes me wonder where reality leaves off and imagination takes over even though these folks were the <UNK> of the earth i still found myself <UNK> them they never really stood much of a chance
<START> either or i love the suspension of any formulaic plot in this movie i have re visited it many times and it always holds up a little too stylized for some but i fancy that any opera lover will love it norman <UNK> a fellow canadian takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious as this one is i have often wondered at the <UNK> of <UNK> acting roles whether she has chosen to <UNK> this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on i have found her to be a superb actress who can <UNK> into a role as in this particular one or be loud and daring and fierce as in mask i found the comedic <UNK> broad at times a hair <UNK> called cinderella but this was the whole intent of both the writer and director nicolas page plays the angst ridden <UNK> of opera all <UNK> gestures at one point demanding a knife so as to <UNK> his own throat the brooklyn scenes are magical this is a brooklyn under <UNK> <UNK> and dramatic just like opera all in all a very satisfying film not to everyone's taste by a long shot i loved the ending everyone brought together like a greek chorus every part subtly nuanced and <UNK> with the others the camera pulling away down the hall leaving the players talking 8 out of 10
<START> dear dear dear dear dear me i had the strength to see it through but why br br the first two films where fun and actually somewhat good but this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing this was some kind of tremors for kids i can't believe this movie was made at all seems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind for kids and they just did whatever they could with it br br what audience is this movie for i can only think of 12 14 year olds if you're older than 14 you'll have serious problems with this movie it's not only slow but it's so utterly boring the characters are <UNK> not just a little either and so stereotyped it's fun for a while but not long enough to not make you want to <UNK> tomatoes at the screen you know everything that is going to happen too cause yes you've seen it a billion times before in any hero series on tv for kids i picked all the survivors and all the <UNK> fodder the second the characters got introduced it's so bad so wrong so crap br br but ok we did get a laugh now and then not just at the silly plot holes but some scenes where worth a replay or two or one scene that is where two baby tremors <UNK> themselves at one of the obvious <UNK> fodder guys it's really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh <UNK> still makes me grin when i think about it but that only happened one more time sadly and that's when the <UNK> <UNK> shows up and overacts his part wonderfully that and one comment they spring from the ground like some demonic <UNK> at this point we where almost crying with laughter but after that nothing could ever top that so it's pretty much downhill from there br br so tops here are demonic <UNK> and overacting if anybody ever tells you this is a good movie he's either a plant <UNK> or someone very evil this movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far looking forward to seeing tremors 3 it's bound to be box office hit compared to this this <UNK> no i'll leave it at that
<START> years have past since alex rain played by olivier <UNK> in the first movie stumbled onto the horrific plot that involved replacing humans with machines however since then a war between <UNK> and humans has emerged and we lost now a <UNK> of sorts who is the daughter of olivier <UNK> character she also <UNK> only half of his minimal acting ability which i think is the films minimal connection to the first however when the <UNK> is created she hides in 1980 while a bounty hunter from the future <UNK> her down in this confusing sci fi <UNK> nemesis became a cult hit that i can see why people liked even though i was no fan of said film nemesis tried very <UNK> to come up with different ideas develop a beautiful look and provide tons of action it almost worked nemesis 2 doesn't even have that ambition it's a cheap rip off of the terminator with a <UNK> female who is so low on acting ability she makes olivier <UNK> seem like a master <UNK> and the action sequences lack the explosive scope that was the main selling point of the original i'll admit i was no fan of the original but it deserved a better follow up than this the original also featured a good cast like tim <UNK> cary <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> james thomas jane and yes jackie <UNK> <UNK> this one features nobody and this time it's just a dull movie with a pretentious vibe in fact after i saw this it inspired to add a half star to the original br br out of 4 bad
<START> oh dear what a disappointment i've been watching old westerns on british tv for decades and i wasn't aware of this one until its showing yesterday most other scott westerns come around every few years or so and are usually worth watching again br br the rich colour and <UNK> sets were good but that's all i can say about this film i have to agree with most of the other negative comments already made several times i felt like turning it off and finally i did halfway through something i hardly ever do br br scott seemed unusually <UNK> in charming the girls his two <UNK> were annoying and so was the mexican <UNK> <UNK> and i've a feeling the army uniforms were 20 years or so too modern not that this has bothered makers of many other westerns br br perhaps it got better in the second half but i couldn't be bothered to wait and see
<START> i can't believe people are looking for a plot in this film this is <UNK> and hardy <UNK> up already these two were a riot their comic genius is as funny today as it was 70 years ago not a filthy word out of either mouth and they were able to keep audiences in <UNK> their comedy wasn't sophisticated by any stretch if a <UNK> <UNK> can't make you grin there's no reason to watch any of the stuff these guys did it was a simpler time and people laughed at stuff that was funny without a plot i guess it takes a simple mind to enjoy this stuff so i qualify two man comedy teams don't <UNK> we're just too sophisticated aren't we fortunate
<START> this film was one of my childhood favorites and i must say that unlike some other films i liked in that period the thief of bagdad has held on to it's quality while i grew up this is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well the only <UNK> there is is that one can not see past the <UNK> effects compared to the effects nowadays like one could when one was a child i remembered nothing of those effects of course it had been about ten years since i'd seen this film when i was about eleven years old who then watches effects one only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides in my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century coming to think of it i feel like the indiana jones films are quite a like this film there is comedy romance and adventure all in one which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern it succeeds in not being dusty and old all of that is mainly due to the great story the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors in that department <UNK> as abu and conrad <UNK> as <UNK> stand out providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part great film and although an <UNK> definitely a <UNK> i hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on dvd someday br br 8 out of 10
<START> this is one of the best hong kong action films around and it has a tense and exciting storyline as well as great fight scenes this sammo film has it all romance drama excitement and a great hero as well it is the only martial arts film that got me interested in the plot rather than just waiting for the fights sammo fans this is a must see see also eastern <UNK> shanghai express <UNK> <UNK> is ace dragons forever and enter the fat dragon
<START> this film provides us with an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many to get caught up in the busy <UNK> of doing nothing we as a people of african descent owe it to ourselves to make a change to this cycle of all talk and no action and start to realise in order to make a change there needs to be less talk and more action it is a powerful statement of the <UNK> of our people over small issues and our <UNK> to <UNK> the bigger picture and the need to <UNK> in order to make a difference despite its reference to the black community all viewers can learn something from the message this film seeks to portray
<START> 'the omen 4 the <UNK> is a made for television sequel to the original 'the <UNK> film instead of satan <UNK> the body of a little boy he possesses the body of a little girl adopted by rich parents who is <UNK> at school and who ends up getting revenge against those who do her wrong the film seems to struggle with any horror factor and a lot of the events that happen are simply silly rather than particularly frightening and it is difficult to believe that this little girl is satan even with all of the events that surround it i just did not find this film very suspenseful or frightening particularly when compared to the original
<START> the movie <UNK> religious <UNK> and ideals so much that it fails to create coherent argument against the death penalty on any level by presenting the <UNK> execution of a convicted murder as the <UNK> for the apocalyptic end of mankind the movie <UNK> a parent killer to the status of <UNK> for christ somehow according to the plot god is <UNK> that society has chosen to rid it's self of a fanatic who killed his own parents by starting them on fire while they slept <UNK> in their <UNK> yet this same god has no <UNK> for the acts of the killer the lead character an <UNK> pregnant <UNK> woman ultimately gives her own life in a <UNK> but implausible attempt to <UNK> save this convicted killer in other threads of the underdeveloped plot jesus comes back as a <UNK> and frustrated <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> the wrath of god the modern lackluster incarnation of christ not just <UNK> him but <UNK> the <UNK> ideal of all <UNK> as well he is unable to affect humanity for good and <UNK> <UNK> the edges of life waiting for mankind to destroy it's self meanwhile with little help from jesus the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to <UNK> herself into her newly born soulless child which somehow saves all of mankind from the wrath of the almighty i also interpreted that as a statement in support of abortion on some levels this movie which attempts to <UNK> many religious themes into a thriller fails to make any religious point that i could clearly interpret except to mock people's beliefs it raises many questions that it never even attempts to answer it <UNK> the religious values of its audience while attempting to portray an <UNK> version of their <UNK> silly
<START> ok so soldier isn't deep and meaningful like blade runner or as big budget as terminator 2 but on the whole i found it quite enjoyable br br the fact that kurt russell stayed in character not speaking and being virtually <UNK> made the moments when his humanity broke through all the more poignant i found his portrayal of <UNK> emotional development more touching than <UNK> in the t films and before i get comments yes i know that arnie was a cyborg and kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the same br br so to the film itself a reasonable us brit cast are able to flesh out this little story not really sure if gary busey and his two <UNK> were baddies or <UNK> so was unable to decide whether i liked them or not the colony was a little more realistic neither a misguided bunch of peace loving <UNK> cowardly <UNK> who get wiped out from the get go nor a group of <UNK> aggressive terrorists paranoid about <UNK> and each other br br kurt russell is good and unlike other comments i do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career unlike maybe escape from la sequels are such <UNK> creatures sean pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble sci fi <UNK> and the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too badly br br if you see this on your tv schedule i would recommend giving it a chance i don't think you will be disappointed
<START> the often reliable leonard <UNK> says this is a delightful romance and that sanders is superb <UNK> must have confused this movie with something else sanders is <UNK> and <UNK> and superb as usual  you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery sometimes the chains of <UNK> are so heavy they have to be carried by three <UNK> dull wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately the storyline itself an autobiography with sanders as a suave jewel thief <UNK> eugene <UNK> who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine <UNK> is entertaining enough but it has the same kind of hollow historical hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as marie <UNK> and certainly the <UNK> forever <UNK> which screams for a classy remake though in his defense sanders tries <UNK> to add some depth to his character it is all for <UNK> i am an <UNK> douglas sirk fan but this is 1946 and it is one of <UNK> earliest american efforts lacking many of the signature touches that would define his <UNK> breast <UNK> <UNK> sirk is just getting his feet wet here and made a number of <UNK> films over the next ten years until he struck gold with magnificent obsession and hit his <UNK> <UNK> us with such <UNK> <UNK> as all that heaven allows written on the wind and imitation of life but scandal in paris is hardly his best work  a relatively low budget affair with cheesy sets and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i first saw this movie about 4 years ago and i was expecting something funny similar to <UNK> i was blown away i was on the floor laughing my butt off this movie is so great way better than <UNK> the characters the songs the plot everything top notch independent film that was given two thumbs up by <UNK> and <UNK> and if two old white guys can understand the humour in this flick you know it's good
<START> intimate and specific yes a bit of a cinderella story but only after many convoluted turns <UNK> it's way deeper and deeper into <UNK> psyche only superficial viewing can <UNK> this film as superficial this is the stuff that <UNK> nations this is one of our great national stories <UNK> path to emotional health <UNK> a whole <UNK> of family history the history of slavery and its aftermath in his first directorial effort first of many i hope denzel washington <UNK> once again that he has a truly beautiful mind and soul
<START> michael <UNK> plays an <UNK> young man who <UNK> a thousand miles to visit his <UNK> millionaire father the creepy ray wise at a <UNK> <UNK> powered ranch and ends up <UNK> in the dangerous web of his young scheming and seductive stepmother from hell the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> thus causing trouble for the already dysfunctional family an edgy stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent straight to vhs and cable tv where i first saw it it is beautifully written <UNK> acted and tightly directed from a script that keeps you biting your nails i cannot believe the reviewers who disliked it ever actually saw it it is an <UNK> classic
<START> an incredible little english film for so many reasons first it's a rare look a laurence olivier in a light comedy while his performance is not up the standard he would latter set as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century he is perfectly believable as the <UNK> <UNK> historically this film is of great interest because of both where and when it was shoot being english it didn't have the big budget of the hollywood films of the same era and it often shows but more interesting is the fact this movie filmed just prior to the war and shows an england that would soon be gone when we watch it today we think in terms of modern morality and over look the fact that this movie and its closest american counter part it happened one <UNK> were in their day as <UNK> as fatal <UNK> was in our time but after watching and enjoying this movie the first time i can't help but feel sadness when i watch it today with half of film shoot before 1950 gone saving the remaining films means hard choices and unfortunately films like this are often passed over to save movies that we all consider important the color shifting lack of contrast and generally poor quality of the print most often seen is heartbreaking this movie along with it happened one <UNK> are perfect to <UNK> up with a love one under a <UNK> on cool a cool evening and watch or better yet why not a double feature
<START> this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen <UNK> seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he couldn't deliver his lines the plot was definitely not worthy of john <UNK> name no wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters i didn't even watch the whole thing i decided i didn't care who done it then realized there was no <UNK> to care about
<START> this is just horrible really horrible trash yes we've got beautiful naked women dancing and having sex but while this may work in the <UNK> of a porn movie  may have even been a hit as a porn movie  this tries to mask itself as a film with actual things to say with real emotion and struggle it isn't it's an excuse to get some girls naked and have a fun time i'm sure all of these women and men in this particular movie could have <UNK> <UNK> in the porn movie business of the 1970s but not in the actual movie business br br the acting was hackneyed so bad i mean real terrible the writing was even worse i can't lay all blame on these actors  they had nothing to work with the very broad structure or plot of the movie could possibly be done and done well with good writers and competent actors the very broad structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting people from <UNK> as a sniper these shootings were motivated from men not <UNK> their women enough if there was more writing better writing much better writing and less gratuitous sexual imagery we might have something to work with br br this movie should have been shot made and <UNK> a hardcore porn movie all along it would have made more money it practically is a hardcore porn film already and it remains the only non porn movie i've seen that shows a male <UNK> penis
<START> i knew my summary would get you how is this movie like a pet rock and disco well unless you lived through the 1970s or 80s you probably can't understand why anyone would like a new coke or own a pet rock and frankly at least in the case of pet rocks i still don't understand it completely they're just a couple things that seemed to make sense at the time but really <UNK> the younger generation the same can be said for kay <UNK> and his band at the time the 1940s mostly they were very popular and had enough <UNK> that the studio starred them with boris karloff bela lugosi and peter lorre in this film yet if you didn't live at that time it was well before my time you wonder why anyone liked this sort of entertainment after all <UNK> and his band mates are incredibly obnoxious and their humor is very very broad i e <UNK> and cheesy frankly i couldn't stand their antics nor did i appreciate that there were just too many musical numbers in the film because of these factors the great supporting cast was given a back seat and fans of these actors will probably be disappointed br br the film involves <UNK> and the band coming to a mansion where a young lady and her wacky aunt live once there the bridge is washed out and strange happenings begin eventually it <UNK> in some attempts on <UNK> life and a <UNK> of sorts it's all played for laughs and it's really not a horror movie despite the cast br br overall it's passable entertainment at best as a lugosi and karloff fan i sure felt cheated having to watch <UNK> and his <UNK>
<START> when i first heard about moon child i thought it was a joke after a few months i figured i guess it's for real the few reviews i read that weren't made by <UNK> <UNK> were not very promising br br when i was given the opportunity to watch it i was fully prepared to <UNK> <UNK> and otherwise need to close my eyes to avoid the silliness br br i was more than a little surprised and in a good way br br yes moon child has its moments of cheese camp and general <UNK> i think that's kind of impossible to avoid when it involves gackt <UNK> a man not known for his sanity but all in all it was wholly enjoyable br br no it is not a work of cinema genius but it is very very heartfelt amusing with fun choreography a touching score and a fun cast i know little of japanese cinema so i can't really judge the acting but considering the fact that the cast was speaking a language or extreme <UNK> foreign to them at one time or another and that a couple of them have almost no acting experience i was rather impressed br br if you can enjoy a good action movie a good drama a good comedy see this film at least rent it since it's coming to region 1 br br on a side note there is zero homosexual <UNK> content in this film i didn't even see much of a subtext don't let people that read too much into things ruin this for you
<START> in a woman under the influence mabel goes crazy but i can see why she does go crazy if i lived the kind of life she lived with the family she has i would go crazy too everyone in her family is off their rocker and not completely with it she is constantly surrounded by people yelling at her and telling her what is best for herself and people that aren't the <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> br br to start with the one person closest to her in her life her husband nick is a little off his rocker he is always yelling at her when he is home telling her how to live her life and to stop acting like an <UNK> the rest of the time he is working long hours at his job and he isn't there to support her when she needs support the one person in her life that should always be there for her is never there and if he is he is just making her feel worse she relies on him for support and always goes to him first when she feels she is acting wrong and he does nothing to support her when she comes home from the hospital all he does is tell her how to act instead of <UNK> her he just yells at her and tells her what to do br br the other major people in her life are her parents her parents do nothing in her life for her mabel basically runs their lives because they are afraid to stand up to her and stand up for her in the end she even asks her father to stand up for her and he doesn't understand and when he does get it he still does nothing they do nothing to help mabel recover or to keep her from going crazy because they do nothing for her period the only person that tries to do something for her is <UNK> mom <UNK> mom is <UNK> about having mabel committed she doesn't want to have nick deal with it so she has the doctor commit her it seems as though everyone is against mabel and they feel that having her committed is a good idea because then they won't have to deal with it anymore they all want to live their own lives and do nothing for mabel except for yell at her and make her feel like she is doing something wrong when she really isn't that is why she went crazy and why she had to be committed it was her family's entire fault
<START> it never <UNK> to <UNK> me how you can take an excellent actor and put him to waste in a film such as this robert de niro is one of the best hollywood stars of all time but even he couldn't save this movie in fact his character is much the same as the one he played in cape fear which was actually pretty good but i can't stand it when actors do the same <UNK> over more than one movie i believe it gets old and that is the case here br br there's nothing surprising in this movie but then the story has been told a million times before wesley snipes is your typical baseball player and his <UNK> shows through in his characterization de niro plays the obsessed fan but his role in this film is less than entertaining br br however because de niro is in this film that makes it a draw if you are a fan no pun intended who sees everything he does no matter how bad but to see de niro at his best see midnight run <UNK> or cop land or even go way back and check out taxi driver or godfather ii don't waste your time with this drivel br br my rating 3 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> covers similar ground as 'the member of the wedding ' to wit a <UNK> daughter tries to prevent a relationship from <UNK> between a beloved family member and an <UNK> while critics love <UNK> of the wedding ' i find julie harris to be a <UNK> drag and an <UNK> scenery <UNK> <UNK> in everything she's been in this portrays irritating rich idiots as in last year at <UNK> but this time it's a <UNK> br br in this preminger movie sequences develop but characters do not for the first 30 minutes he's content to <UNK> the father daughter relationship between <UNK> and niven making uncomfortable sexual <UNK> possible once the conflict is introduced <UNK> can't deliver the depth the part requires kerr pulls rank and turns the film into <UNK> love ' <UNK> vacuous narration is like something out of strange <UNK> it is not good i really wish someone other than niven was in his role he spends so much time <UNK> <UNK> british behavior in all his movies he never gets around to the character br br in the most memorable sequence an evening out dancing becomes a free for all in a harbor <UNK> steals the entire scene for his empty exercise 'the <UNK> ' kerr is on board to <UNK> her hands and portray another major pain as in black <UNK> night of the <UNK> king and i heaven knows mr <UNK> tea and sympathy etc etc really kerr was a horrible actress i wish every movie with her could end with a fatal car crash or even better start with one br br people uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid this
<START> a lot of horror fans seem to love scarecrows so i won't be very popular in saying that i found it to be rather boring the idea behind it was interesting but it seems to drag so much i think the main problem is that it is all set in darkness sometimes horror films set in darkness can work such as <UNK> but scarecrows is in darkness for the whole film a lot of the time it's hard to figure out what's actually happening and although some shots of the scarecrows were creepy most were hard to even see if a little more lighting had been used perhaps it could've been better br br there's not many films involving killer scarecrows to my knowledge apart from dark night of the scarecrow which is much better i would recommend that over scarecrows any day
<START> i've seen tons of hk <UNK> and this one is right at the top of the genre the action scenes are as exciting and <UNK> as anything you've ever seen in any action movie the kung fu is spectacular the <UNK> eye popping the stunt work <UNK> the editing is perfectly paced <UNK> the tension and <UNK> the fluid camera work this film is directed by old pro corey <UNK> whose resume is stuffed with some of the best work of the genre including the jet li vehicle the legend of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> if there is one thing lacking in this film it is the presence of a three dimensional character though martin the male lead comes closest to it this movie is full of <UNK> rather than characters the sexy killer the goofy thief and his bitchy girlfriend the <UNK> villains that said shannon lee has a terrific screen presence she's great with the fighting the stunts and the guns when she's <UNK> it's hard to take your eyes off her she's that good why isn't this woman a major star
<START> patricia hunter oh professor do you also make a habit of collecting <UNK> dr <UNK> why yes in a manner of speaking i find a coffin much more comfortable than a bed br br interesting bela lugosi <UNK> or glenda dracula vehicle where he plays the mad scientist i was especially <UNK> out when he appeared in the <UNK> of his guests when they were sleeping br br <UNK> <UNK> girls in prison was really appealing as a sensual reporter patricia hunter who was to be a victim but woman power <UNK> evil scientist every time br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and creepy frank <UNK> who liked to <UNK> the women's hair added to the film br br interesting look at a 40s horror film
<START> this is really a new low in entertainment even though there are a lot worse movies out br br in the gangster drug scene genre it is hard to have a convincing storyline this movies does not i mean <UNK> motives for example couldn't be more far fetched and worn out cliché then you would also need a setting of character relationships that is believable this movie does not br br sure <UNK> is drawn away from his family but why was that again what's the deal with his father again that he has to ask <UNK> to go out at his age interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of kids in upper class family but this movie does not go in this direction even though there would be the potential judging by the random <UNK> wasn't he already down and out why does he do it again br br so there are some interesting questions brought up here for a solid socially critic drama but then again this movie is just not because of focusing on cool production techniques and special effects an not giving the characters a moment to reflect and most of all forcing the story along the path where they want it to be and not paying attention to let the story breath and naturally <UNK> br br it wants to be a drama to not <UNK> abuse of <UNK> and violence would be political incorrect these days wouldn't it but on the other hand it is nothing more then a cheap action movie like there are so so many out there with an average set of actors and a <UNK> jones who is managing to not totally ruin what's left of his reputation by doing what he always does br br so all in all i just can't recommend it br br 1 for <UNK> and 2 for the editing
<START> when i watch a low budget film i know what to expect i expect the acting not to be as good budget reasons i expect the lighting not to be as good budget reasons i expect the sound not to be as good budget again stop judging these low budget movies like a big budget film i'm a filmmaker myself so i understand the budget constraints on a low budget film stealing locations shots etc the list goes on and on i don't want to say all the acting was bad jose <UNK> chris <UNK> victor <UNK> are good <UNK> <UNK> is a natural not sold on carl washington yet he has to understand that every line is not important some are throw away lines i say if a film makes you want to see what happens next it's a good film i liked this movie i gave it an 8 i wanted to see what was gonna happen next great job <UNK> brothers
<START> just cause is one of those films that at first makes you wonder quite why it was so heavily <UNK> when it came out nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from ed harris then you hit the last third and everything starts to get increasingly silly until you've got a killer with a <UNK> <UNK> to his <UNK> threatening to <UNK> sean <UNK> wife a typically mannered and unconvincing kate <UNK> and kid a very young scarlet <UNK> in an alligator <UNK> shack br br the kind of movie that's probably best seen on a plane and even then only once
<START> this is no doubt one of the worst movies i have ever seen this makes your run of the mill tv movie look like <UNK> dogs based on a book by the one and only britney spears and her mother this is trash with nothing bar a reasonable performance from virginia madsen i hope you got paid well to save it the story of a red neck country <UNK> who wins a <UNK> in a <UNK> music school is little but a vehicle to <UNK> ms spears pants music to the <UNK> and to generally agree that low brow must be the way there is nothing good going on here with all the beats as predictable as night following day never ever again
<START> it wasn't good the characters were underdeveloped and the only personality were from the memories i had of the previous movie which <UNK> with the <UNK> personalities or lack thereof i seriously thought the opening scene was a nightmare by ariel because of how absurd it was it was serious it just reminded me of all the annoying characters on the disney channel everyone is <UNK> and the story jumps from action to embarrassing scenes without any really connection br br the most disappointing part was the horrible songs not catchy not amazing in the original ariel had an amazing and powerful voice and all the song are catchy and fun you remember them and want to sing them but the songs in this movie weren't creative in the least it's as if they're talking in a annoying sing song voice quite <UNK> disappointing i don't have that want to sing them feeling you normally get from a disney movie br br it's as if not one wanted to do this movie so they barely made an effort this movie would needs a new story line new catchy songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without the annoying look at me look at me i'm so annoying mentality of this generation of disney '
<START> this film is one of the most dreadful things i have ever seen br br please do yourselves a favor and avoid this incompetent <UNK> br br shaking the camera and having your actors adopt <UNK> does not count as direction which this film needed in <UNK> not that the writing was all the wonderful rather we were left with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in that most artificial way the pseudo documentary style <UNK> by those who don't know how to direct br br this film gives the impression that it was done <UNK> to appeal to critics who don't know the first thing about film making which is most of them br br just terrible it says a lot about sundance and what it's become that victor vargas was <UNK> there
<START> i just saw this last night it was broadcast on the canadian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> series it has been screened recently <UNK> 2003 at the toronto international film festival as well as many others it is a quite remarkable film the filmmakers literally stumbled into the story being there to make a documentary about chavez himself instead they found themselves <UNK> in the middle of events as the coup <UNK> they had <UNK> access to events and people and for the most part let the story unfold as it happens they of course have their own <UNK> perspective which they make evident but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events the people and the background and history leading up to the coup as a film it is not ground breaking in a <UNK> or aesthetic sense and that is i think the way it should be what we get to see what <UNK> <UNK> should really be what we get to see is a remarkable account of a country struggling to <UNK> democracy a charismatic leader chavez who actually cares for his people a story about power and greed as a <UNK> of corporate military media interests combine to lead a coup of a <UNK> elected leader and <UNK> access to a historical event as it unfolds br br
<START> this documentary on <UNK> william castle takes a few cheap shots at the naive <UNK> '60s environment in which he did his most characteristic work look at the funny silly people with the ghost glasses but it's also <UNK> and lively with particularly bright commentary from john waters who was absolutely the target audience for such things at the time and from <UNK> daughter who <UNK> her dad and also is pretty <UNK> about how he <UNK> his craft we never find out what became of the other castle <UNK> the movies were not very good it makes clear but his marketing of them was brilliant and he appears to have been a sweet <UNK> family man fun people keep popping up like straight jacket 's diane baker who looks great and anne <UNK> whom she replaced at the <UNK> of star joan crawford <UNK> <UNK> all but explodes into <UNK> at the happy memory of working with castle on the <UNK> and there's enough footage to give us an idea of the level of <UNK> talent not very high but very energetic a pleasant look at a time when audiences were more easily pleased and it does make you nostalgic for simpler movie going days
<START> when this film was originally released it was promoted with the notably unimaginative <UNK> dirty harry is at it again whatever this pitch lacks in originality is more than <UNK> for by it's complete and total accuracy sudden impact <UNK> all the aspects that made the previous three dirty harry movies so successful tight pacing a compelling plot strong supporting characters endless <UNK> and bone dry humor some of these elements are not only <UNK> but <UNK> this is easily the darkest <UNK> and most overtly right wing installment of the franchise br br the plot is somewhat intriguing after killing a ridiculous number of <UNK> inspector callahan is sent on a forced vacation by his superiors to the sleepy <UNK> town of san <UNK> he is <UNK> to investigate the background of a recent homicide victim who was shot in the <UNK> before being put out of his no doubt considerable misery by a second shot to the head early on in the film the audience is made aware of the identity of the killer an artist named jennifer spencer sondra locke who is hunting down the thugs who gang raped her and her sister at a fun fair some ten years earlier this incident is shown in a very disturbing flashback snippets of which <UNK> before each new murder as more bodies start to appear with the same m o it becomes clear to harry that both the local police chief and his new love interest guess who know more than they are telling to make matters even more complicated the one time <UNK> realize who is hunting them and start to hit back hard br br sudden impact offers relentless action from beginning to end clint eastwood directed this film himself and expertly handles a series of set pieces that <UNK> in an <UNK> climax sondra <UNK> performance effectively conveys the blend of <UNK> and <UNK> that define her character that having been said it is fair to wonder if another actress who was not eastwood's off screen companion at the time could have brought more charisma and dramatic weight to the role <UNK> russell and <UNK> shepherd jump to mind as possible candidates members of the supporting cast that punch significantly above their weight include albert <UNK> as harry's partner <UNK> paul drake as the <UNK> mick and the truly scene stealing <UNK> j <UNK> who portrays the vicious ray <UNK> br br however the film has some notable problems some of the subplots the <UNK> between harry and a gang of <UNK> <UNK> a mob <UNK> against him take up too much screen time and don't really have any bearing to the larger story their only real use is to raise the body count to absurd levels in the first half of the film it sometimes appears that dirty harry shoots people more often than he has to use the <UNK> however the film moves into top gear as it progresses and the <UNK> cat and mouse game between callahan spencer and her former <UNK> assumes <UNK> this second hour makes it clear that a more stripped down and slightly <UNK> screenplay would have given sudden impact the potential to be a first class neo noir style thriller that could have taken the series to new levels but still have contained more than enough <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to satisfy the harry <UNK> instead we get the film that eastwood and warner bros clearly wanted to make a superbly executed but <UNK> eighties action flick that mostly <UNK> to particularly challenge the intelligence of it's intended audience br br this was by far the biggest <UNK> of the series at the box office and it is not hard to see why though not the film that it could have been this is still big trigger happy fun even after repeated viewings it's going to make your day
<START> this film originally released at christmas 1940 was long thought lost a very poor copy has <UNK> and made into a cd now for sale don't buy it the film is <UNK> terrible the casting is poor the script is awful and the directing is dreadful br br picture <UNK> young singing and dancing and that was the highlight br br perhaps this movie was lost deliberately
<START> with this film <UNK> <UNK> the viewer with all of film's might while stating clearly in the film that his work is one of <UNK> obviously it is not for one reason many scenes <UNK> by pure <UNK> are obvious set ups when that poor goat <UNK> falls off the cliff you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen for another his <UNK> of one important information the <UNK> people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at in the film that is <UNK> a sickness caused by lack of <UNK> salt this <UNK> is the cause of their <UNK> and had <UNK> only took the time to make his research heck if he checked <UNK> in a medical <UNK> he'd have found <UNK> he might have ended up telling the truth about these people still <UNK> instead with his film he judges them constantly talking about them as <UNK> again and again <UNK> the action setting up scenes to create the spectacle all of this very <UNK> for a <UNK> which claims to work for an all mighty <UNK> <UNK> talks all the time in this film not letting one word to the people he is filming he talks for them and even then judges them this piece is flawed to it's roots to it's ideology and it's a real shame it's considered a great film
<START> this film is the <UNK> effort of stephanie <UNK> and her new production company while it suffers from a few problems as every low budget production does it is a good start for ms <UNK> and her company br br the story is not terribly new having been done in films like the burning and every friday the 13th since part 2 but the performances are heartfelt so many big budget movies just have the actors going through the motions its always nice to see actors really trying to <UNK> their craft br br the story deals with the murder and possible return of a <UNK> <UNK> the others are <UNK> to <UNK> but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their <UNK> ten years later the friends are murdered one by one by a gruesome stalker known as the <UNK> who will survive you have to watch br br if you are roger ebert or any number of arrogant critics you probably shouldn't bother but if your taste run more towards joe bob <UNK> and you want to see a group of people <UNK> their craft then check out the <UNK>
<START> the first look on the cover of this picture it looks like a good rock n roll movie but don't let the cover fool you or the fact that alice cooper and <UNK> is in it the storyline is just horrible and so is the acting plain and simple bad br br it's not a movie about a <UNK> its just a thin love story so awful that you see right through it the only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack some good songs and that is why i give 2 out of 10 if it wasn't for the music it would of been 0 out of 10 meat <UNK> is a horrible actor at least he was in 1980 and the girl who plays the <UNK> isn't even good looking this movie was a huge disappointment for me because it makes a lot of good promises
<START> while the title before the devil knows you're dead comes from an irish <UNK> the film plays out like a greek tragedy it all starts with a <UNK> robbery and continues to spiral out of control as two brothers attempt to escape the mess they've gotten themselves into br br the cast is well assembled with philip seymour hoffman ethan hawke playing the aforementioned brothers notable support includes albert finney as their father and marisa tomei as the wife of one brother and lover of the other beyond these principals the acting is <UNK> br br the story is compelling and is told with a certain degree of <UNK> the narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent time shifts that being said the film's <UNK> is somewhat muted since it becomes apparent early on that this story is a tragedy through and through all in all a pretty impressive debut for first time screenwriter kelly masterson br br sidney <UNK> direction is well handled but i'm more impressed by the fact that he's still directing at over <UNK> years old i was less impressed by the score by carter <UNK> but it isn't a major distraction br br in the end the film proves to be compelling viewing and while the story presentation may have superficial similarities to other films this one remains a unique experience
<START> this movie was so gay like its a mom and son cat that have sex they also get scared of little kitty cats they get set on fire by them the mom cat alien thing kills a guy by stabbing him in the back with an ear of corn they are bullet proof invisible and what not the star of the movie <UNK> is the cops cat <UNK> leads the cops to find the mom alien and after the mom kills the cops <UNK> kills the mom by eating her head then she catches on fire this movie sucks it was way way more funny than it was scary it wasn't even <UNK> at all the girl hits the alien on the head with a camera it <UNK> him out she then goes and <UNK> her the then grabs her and begins to rape her once again <UNK> comes to the rescue
<START> i really didn't have high expectations and i must admit that i wasn't disappointed this movie is so terrible that i felt <UNK> to register an account here at imdb just to warn others not to waste their time the storyline is terrible and you keep asking yourself throughout the movie can it get any worse yes it can somehow they manage to make it worst by every minute and you end up thinking i want my 1 hour 35 minutes back somebody got to pay for this br br i dare you to find a movie which is worst that this br br i really didn't have high expectations and i must admit that i wasn't disappointed this movie is so terrible that i felt <UNK> to register an account here at imdb just to warn others not to waste their time the storyline is terrible and you keep asking yourself throughout the movie can it get any worse yes it can somehow they manage to make it worst by every minute and you end up thinking i want my 1 hour 35 minutes back somebody got to pay for this br br i dare you to find a movie which is worst that this
<START> this was so lame that i turned the dvd off maybe halfway through it was so weak i couldn't even pay full enough attention to tell you how far in i made it though i really wanted to believe that the depiction of the young carlito would be somewhat different i just couldn't buy it i don't really blame the actors because i think it was the script that may have fallen flat i did find myself laughing a few times but i don't think those lines were intended to be funny br br it's only saving grace is that i bought it in a 2 dvd set and i would have paid the price i did for the original alone this is one of those cases when they should have let the classic stand alone
<START> cinematography compared to 'the wrestler ' a degree of <UNK> and cinematic skill that <UNK> the viewer and then <UNK> as well br br acting the dialogue is minimal but the pauses and silence poignant br br story the conflict in a <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> as we saw recently <UNK> murders in the <UNK> and <UNK> in france while i harbor no love for islam the departure from the west from christian values holds no cause for celebration br br the director of this film managed to mirror the two societies in a way that <UNK> neither <UNK> the development of <UNK> as an individual who became a champion not so much in the ring but to all those around her even her worst i will stop here to avoid the spoiler
<START> after the already disappointing final conflict the series hits rock bottom with this very weak fourth entry at least the third film tried <UNK> to continue the story of <UNK> while this one simply <UNK> and copies ideas from the omen animals are afraid of the <UNK> the death of one man is very similar to the death of the photographer in the first film but what looked exciting and creative there looks just dumb here and the little girl looks simply like a spoiled kid
<START> a very good start i was a bit surprised to find the <UNK> not quite so advanced it should have been <UNK> to match we saw in the original series the cast is interesting although the <UNK> lady comes across as a little too human she needs to school on spock who after all is the model for this race too bad they couldn't have picked <UNK> ryan i like ms park the korean lady the doctor has possibilities haven't <UNK> out the other males except for the black guy he's a really likeable <UNK> needs to find his <UNK> in <UNK> his strong point was his sense of humor and his <UNK> to try anything he is of course big and strong enough for the <UNK> the <UNK> were ok although i didn't like their make up
<START> i really enjoyed this i got it thinking it was going to be a documentary but it revealed itself as a good piece of tongue in cheek fun br br i think this has been well done pretty much an extended tv show into a film but due to the characters or rather original actors <UNK> to have fun and be made fun off helps this work in a great old style innocent way br br if you are a fan of the original tv series then i am sure you will enjoy this br br q
<START> i just watched it a couple of laughs but nothing to write home about jason lee looked like he was having fun the long dvd gag reel consists almost solely of him having fits of <UNK> laughter <UNK> blair seemed to be <UNK> a time clock but then again her character was supposed to be a stick in the mud so well done i guess jim <UNK> was surprisingly funny being married to <UNK> can't be a <UNK> the soundtrack was hip and <UNK> larry miller who played julia stiles father hilariously in 10 things i hate about you is funny here as well he's great but the best aspect of this movie was the casting of julia stiles i could spend two hours watching her <UNK> <UNK> and i feel like i just did
<START> nothing could have saved this movie not even superman br br ten years ago the special effects would have been amazing better directing might have gotten some more feeling and better performances out of the actors but nothing but feeding the script to a dragon could have fixed it plot holes bad lines terrible pacing endless <UNK> of the same shots of a cgi dragon <UNK> through <UNK> ugh br br avoid this one at all costs br br
<START> every kid has that movie that he pops into vhs when he has nothing to do or when there is a babysitter around this was that movie for me br br i can tell you the whole plot exactly i must have seen it 100 times at least and i can say it is a good kids family movie br br i still have the tape i haven't watched it in 5 years but maybe i'll get around to it this week and be a kid for the day br br you just have to love the care bears and their <UNK> br br
<START> years after the fall of the last of the great <UNK> the world has fallen into a new dark age where <UNK> are <UNK> for their parts cash a female cyborg travels to a <UNK> doctor to receive news that she is pregnant on the run from <UNK> bounty hunters who hunt <UNK> cash tries to find her way to <UNK> the mythical <UNK> for <UNK> br br cyborg 3 the <UNK> is the third last so far entry in the cyborg trilogy the first film was originally planned to be a sequel to masters of the universe but was quickly <UNK> into a standard post apocalyptic martial arts fest that became something of a cult classic due to its cheesy action scenes cyborg 2 glass shadow was a sequel that actually improved upon its predecessor but was not widely seen was <UNK> by those few who saw it as cheap fodder br br this film for one thing tries to be a <UNK> of the first two films the first was a cheesy action film while the second was a smart <UNK> story but unfortunately falls short on both counts the budget was obviously lower than cyborg 2 with the film being set in the desert <UNK> like so many post apocalyptic action films of the 90s were shot around old industrial buildings to <UNK> costs br br the film's story <UNK> on a plot device that of a pregnant cyborg that is as interesting as it is absurd this film is not the first to try that idea the anime <UNK> series <UNK> iii uses it to a greater extent but the film falls into the same trap that so many low budget sci fi action films fall victim to in the fact that the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> featured are nothing more than <UNK> the visual effects amount to nothing more than <UNK> arms makeup effects br br the acting is pretty standard for this kind of film with the lead actress <UNK> <UNK> being the single worst performer on display instead of being <UNK> at the news she is pregnant she acts all whiny <UNK> her co stars are much better malcolm mcdowell being the usual gangster type who <UNK> the scenes he appears in richard lynch has a lot of fun as the chief villain of particular note is andrew <UNK> playing lynch's right hand man who would later appear in the texas chainsaw massacre remake its prequel
<START> may i start off by saying that <UNK> affleck is a very talented actor and i respect his work very much i wish he was in more movies that <UNK> his talent with this said soul survivors was a very very bad movie very bad br br i would have to say that i lay almost all the blame on the poor script affleck is a very talented actress wes <UNK> had an outstanding performance in american beauty melissa <UNK> did well and <UNK> <UNK> is currently the it girl in hollywood i don't think any of the actors really got into the script and i understand why to say that this movie belongs to the horror genre is an <UNK> it did have the twists and turns you would expect but they just didn't lead anywhere except to more confusion i just found the ending very anti climatic because it just didn't seem to make any sense or really answer any of the questions that i had about the storyline br br i wish i could give this movie a good review but i can't in all honesty the only thing i think you will find scary about this movie is that you paid for it
<START> i just saw this film tonight and i have to say that it's a mess i love vince vaughn but he ends up more annoying that funny here and the film is more than less a remake of the crappy 80's classic santa claus the movie but with out the camp or the bad <UNK> <UNK> song at the end the story is your run of the mill black sheep in the family who comes back to face his family for the holidays kind of thing but with north pole as its setting of course fred vince vaughn is the family screw up who comes home after a series of set backs that include his girlfriend rachel <UNK> in a cameo role <UNK> him so he comes home to face his parents and his more successful brother santa claus paul <UNK> and wacky high <UNK> follow with a bit of sibling rivalry and a bit of <UNK> as well that threatens all of christmas now if you think you know the ending of this film i think you would be right because it's <UNK> to the hill as for the acting vince vaughn plays the same lovable loser he always plays but this time he ends up more annoying than likable miranda richardson plays mrs claus but the role is more than less one note elizabeth banks plays <UNK> assistant but she's not much of a character at all other than a neurotic joke and poor kevin spacey ends up basically playing the same person he plays in the film <UNK> <UNK> ross but a little more <UNK> the only two actors who come out of this film with their dignity intact is paul <UNK> who brings a real sincerity and <UNK> to his role as santa claus but he looks somewhat embarrass to be in the movie and you can't blame him and rachel <UNK> who manages to do a lot more with a very small role than most of the main actors do with theirs which is a shame because both rachel <UNK> and paul <UNK> deserved a lot better than what this script gave them br br to put it in a nutshell a major disappointment
<START> when you add up all the aspects from the movie the dancing singing acting the only one who stands out as the best in the cast is vanessa williams her dedication energy and timeless beauty make <UNK> the perfect role for her never have i ever seen someone portray rose with such <UNK> <UNK> singing talent shows beautifully with all the songs she performs as rose and her acting skills never <UNK> to <UNK> me her dancing is so incredible even if as some people say the choreography was bad her dancing skills were displayed better than ever before i'd recommend this version over the <UNK> just because i find that although lengthy the acting by vanessa is superb not to mention the fact that jason alexander and the rest of the cast are very impressive as well with the exception of <UNK> <UNK> what in hell were they thinking when they cast her br br all in all i'd say this version is wonderful and i recommend that everyone see this version
<START> la <UNK> del <UNK> <UNK> forms a completely stand alone storyline which doesn't seem to fit in at all with the previous <UNK> <UNK> movies some have commented that this movie is supposed to take place before the events of werewolf shadow although it was released afterwards they may be right i'm not sure anyway in this movie <UNK> <UNK> is bitten by a yeti like creature in <UNK> great dialogue here it was a yeti but that's impossible i'm a scientist and these things don't exist it was a <UNK> that's all and although marked with the sign of the <UNK> he is able to prevent the change into a werewolf until he discovers that his wife has been cheating on him changing into the beast one night he kills both her and her lover before running out into a storm and being <UNK> it's not long before he's <UNK> by a <UNK> university professor who is <UNK> some kind of <UNK> experiments with mind control he is taken to the underground <UNK> of a castle where the subjects of these experiments live like <UNK> animals br br first of all <UNK> <UNK> paul naschy whatever you want to call him he's a fine actor and cared <UNK> about his work no matter how flawed these movies are you can always rely on him for a decent performance the rest of the cast seem good enough but it's hard to tell when they have a half <UNK> voice over dubbed over all their lines and that was really the main problem for me many of the voice over artists they used were just awful awful awful whenever i <UNK> during the movie it was at the inept way that they delivered their lines they seem to constantly refer to the hero as <UNK> but unfortunately it's almost impossible to find subtitled copies of naschy movies although they're sometimes available in the original language without subtitles br br the directing of jose maria <UNK> seems sort of hit and miss there are some great visual ideas in some scenes while others are badly constructed and poorly edited particularly in the final scenes when it really counts the reason for this was that <UNK> was apparently drunk most of the time while on set he allowed his <UNK> year old nephew to rewrite <UNK> dialogue used extras without his <UNK> and spliced several shots from <UNK> earlier movies all of this pretty much ruined any chance this movie had of being one of <UNK> best works and it's no surprise that the two of them never worked together again br br but it's not all bad news as there are some good ideas here some aspects of the storyline make an interesting psychological drama with the werewolf as a metaphor for jealousy and rage the <UNK> as a <UNK> idea is one that returned in <UNK> later work some pretty horrific and surreal stuff goes on down in the <UNK> and there's also a very memorable sequence about half way through the film where <UNK> runs from house to house through a village <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> as he goes one scene is particularly intense but it's actually lifted straight from <UNK> first movie la <UNK> del <UNK> <UNK> along with a few other shots i actually found the movie on the whole to be very entertaining although there are some problems with the front row entertainment version such as pretty obvious cuts although some of it may simply be due to the director's lack of continuity gods knows what <UNK> there are i'll probably try to get my hands on the uncut version at some stage in the future br br this is a overall a decent piece of vintage naschy which experienced fans might enjoy but it could have been much better and so probably wouldn't make a great introduction
<START> my wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story having read it to several of her classes it never sounded all that interesting to me though and i bought the dvd <UNK> this would be a movie that wouldn't really be up my alley br br the first half of the movie has a lot of set up and i found myself thinking that i was right it starts off a bit slow and i have to admit that i was a little bit bored but curious enough to stay with it boy am i glad i did because this ended up being a very satisfying and rewarding movie i would most certainly watch this again br br the casting was very good since i haven't read the book i can't <UNK> for accuracy but i have to say that jon voight was truly delightful you liked the characters you were supposed to like hated the ones you were supposed to hate and laughed at the ones that were supposed to be funny br br i can see how some folks might not like this movie it is tedious at times especially in the beginning all the flashbacks can be distracting though they are essential to the story once the story starts to come together at the end though i think you're paid back in <UNK> for your patience when all is said and done i think this is a very good movie 8 10 br br
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is one of those flicks that you keep hoping is going to get better but it never does it's the kind of <UNK> psychopath decides to menace an innocent <UNK> <UNK> so beloved of straight to video film makers br br the dialogue is clunky and in several places poorly translated the acting is uniformly poor especially from the villain of the piece played by <UNK> <UNK> park he seems to think that by not <UNK> and trying to talk in a deep voice he is making his character seem threatening when all it really does is make him seem a bit simple br br the plot deserves special mention as it is idiotic beyond all belief the <UNK> don't think it overly strange that their <UNK> threatens to kill them the <UNK> twice manages to miss seeing the villain when he is no more than a foot away from her the villain gets past a police <UNK> while wearing a shirt covered in blood and a bloody head <UNK> by showing the cops a burnt corpse in the passenger seat of the car he is driving the villain is <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> and stuck through with a <UNK> but never seems to be <UNK> by these rather serious <UNK> and don't even get me started on that terrible <UNK> ending <UNK> br br the only plus point in this film for me is sang <UNK> <UNK> who is very pretty but really no more than a mediocre actress br br overall this film comes off like a poorly written <UNK> acted and shockingly directed attempt to copy 'the <UNK> and <UNK> but it fails at every turn due to a lack of talent in everyone involved
<START> this show was absolutely great and i always look forward to watching it all the characters were funny and awesome in their own way each and every episode provided non stop laughter and it was completely entertaining and different from a lot of other shows everybody was just absolutely insane and <UNK> funny that you couldn't help but love this show there were a few dead weight episodes but that '70s show always managed to create some kind of likable atmosphere to where it just really didn't matter this was one of the best shows to ever be aired and i will watch this show anytime i can for it never gets old never gets unfunny and never gets uninteresting
<START> i saw this film at the <UNK> film festival <UNK> and was thoroughly intrigued for all <UNK> minutes i like documentaries but often find them dragging with about 25 minutes to go forbidden lie powered on though never losing my interest br br the film's subject is norma <UNK> a <UNK> woman who found fame and fortune in 2001 with the <UNK> of her book forbidden love a <UNK> story of sorts concerning a muslim friend of hers who was murdered by her family for having a relationship with a christian man a few years later though a few <UNK> started <UNK> holes in the story leading the public to believe it was fraud the film covers this quickly but thoroughly in the beginning and from there we spend most of our time in the company of norma as she tries to convince us that her novel is more than fiction br br director anna <UNK> has found a truly fascinating woman to study and she <UNK> endless interviews with <UNK> as she seeks the truth as always in life the truth is not so easy to find norma fears for her life worried about violent <UNK> over the <UNK> portrait her novel paints of <UNK> muslims she refuses to return to jordan and show us the facts <UNK> is not <UNK> however and slowly puts the pieces together in front of us br br the result is an incredible look inside the mind of a con artist naturally what we find there makes little sense and is extremely difficult to follow and ultimately we don't know whether to believe norma or not she's either a rather unfairly put upon woman trying to survive or a fantastic <UNK> the web of lies truths and half truths she turns through the film is brilliant br br the film uses much interview footage as well as <UNK> to tell it's story and <UNK> uses these <UNK> to show us why people like norma are able to exist we want to be <UNK> we go to the cinema every day and allow ourselves to believe what's happening on the screen is real that might just be me reading into things a bit too much it didn't come up in the q a with <UNK> after the film but that's what i took away from it br br this is a great australian film and must receive an international release and a <UNK> of awards if you ask me certainly the best film i saw at <UNK> br br go see it if you get the chance
<START> i remember reading all the horrible horrible reviews for this film when it came out i meant to go see how horrible it was but it was out of theaters in three weeks the only other movie to manage that is <UNK> br br when the movie came out on dvd i bought it to see how awful it was i couldn't think of the sheer horrible attention that this film was getting was possible after seeing it i can understand br br first off let me say that this film is not without some cool shots there's a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun which i thought was neat and the way the monsters in this movie die is sort of cool to look at but it gets old after the first time you see it br br let me start with the worst thing in this movie tara reid if bad acting was a sin then hell would've <UNK> tara reid right out since she's so unbelievably awful in this movie it's <UNK> and of all the roles she plays a <UNK> now if she played a dumb empty headed sex toy then maybe i might be able to forgive her for how she treats her character apparently uwe boll didn't realize that although he did seem to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie people would see it he just didn't realize that making her do that in the middle of the film at the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilariously bad and is that a mexican song or something during the scene of dry <UNK> i couldn't tell br br which brings me to my next complaint uwe boll shows off some of the worst directing skills you'll ever see in a movie i mean i'd give house of the dead an f and i only do that for very few movies but <UNK> would score at least a b compared to this screwed up piece of junk the movie starts off with a very very long narration that causes immediate confusion and read by a horrible narrator and from there the cuts are really really dumb there's this one point where slater and reid are looking around a building that's been destroyed and the screen <UNK> out when it comes back slater and reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly an entire army has joined them huh br br and someone did not bother checking the mistakes in this movie at one point a team breaks through glass but the glass breaks before they touch it tara <UNK> <UNK> switch colors in the middle of one scene and after slater walks away from a dead <UNK> you can see her begin to get up br br as for the story i was really lost something about an old tribe releasing darkness and someone opens the path or something and all the evil monsters pop out it's just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to <UNK> in this film that get quite simply boring br br i bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was i didn't laugh but i still think it's stupid very very very stupid
<START> i've seen this movie on several different occasions i find one of the funniest things to do is to just watch the reactions of the different types of people who go to see it br br type 1 old people a lot of old japanese men and women go to this movie because they think it will be a honest to goodness samurai movie with lots of <UNK> and medieval japanese dialogue as soon the two protagonists begin <UNK> horror movies while <UNK> <UNK> almost randomly throughout their sentences the old people walk out usually disgusted br br type 2 film <UNK> these people think that just because a movie bears the label of independent that it will automatically be a load of hard to follow <UNK> crap that may or may not be in english yet they see it anyway just to sing <UNK> about it later so that people will think they are intelligent and <UNK> they are really in for a surprise when they see this film as soon as the blood begins to <UNK> <UNK> from anime inspired sword battles or the over the top villain <UNK> <UNK> a dog with his <UNK> during a phone conversation these people will be so <UNK> they will walk out a few will stay just to see how bad it will get and later they'll rave about what a horrible film it was to their friends br br type 3 people expecting to see live action anime or matrix like special effects sorry folks the martial arts are pretty solid in the film but director <UNK> really doesn't have the budget for that kind of thing br br type 4 people with no expectations these are the people who really enjoy the film whether they had only heard of blood of the samurai picked it at random or stumbled into the wrong theater in an alcoholic <UNK> these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the movie for what it ultimately is entertainment this movie was not made to <UNK> or to <UNK> deep spiritual thought it was meant if i may borrow a line of dialogue from the film to really kick some ass and that's what it does br br so depending on what type of person you are you may or may not enjoy this film however if you appreciate the movie for what it is and can enjoy an excess of blood and acting then go see this movie and make sure to bring your friends
<START> i was expecting a lot better from the battlestar galactica franchise very boring prequel to the main series after the first 30 minutes i was waiting for it to end the characters do a lot of talking about religion computers programming <UNK> etc there are gangsters mafia types who carry out hits however caprica doesn't have the action of the original series to <UNK> the slower parts br br let me give you some helpful advice when viewing movies as a general rule if there is a lot of excessive <UNK> <UNK> then you know the movie will be a dud caprica has lots of this the director writer usually attempts to compensate for his poor abilities by throwing in a few naked bodies it never works and all it does is <UNK> the very young actresses involved and i feel sorry for them directors writers who do this should be banned from the business br br if you want to be bored for an hour and a half by all means rent caprica there's free porn on the <UNK> if you really want to see naked bodies otherwise move along nothing to see here
<START> the leap years stars some heavy <UNK> in the local and <UNK> film and television scene and yet they cannot save this movie it has so many things going against it over acting overly melodramatic poor script inconsistent direction and too few things going for it decent music good cinematography this comment is mainly for anyone who throws all local movies into one basket after watching this film and says all local movies are bad please do not judge the rest based on this one film this is a television soap opera <UNK> as a romantic feature film my hopes were high when i bought my ticket and my hopes were <UNK> five minutes into the film
<START> i have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up show off sexy models and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window with that said the bourne series has been fantastic doug <UNK> <UNK> in a new take on action by using a more cinema <UNK> style showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as <UNK> this is not the sci fi absurdity that was bond before they did an <UNK> in the style of this series no less there was a lot to worry for when the bourne supremacy came out with director paul <UNK> taking over what could have been a second hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair the stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it <UNK> needs to be given a ton of credit for being able to keep up appearances with the latest installment the bourne ultimatum in what is an amazing conclusion to a top notch trilogy the action is brought to a new level and story and performance are never <UNK> br br once again bourne is brought into the minds of the cia by false <UNK> someone has <UNK> information about the <UNK> <UNK> called <UNK> and once bourne is located trying to <UNK> with the <UNK> who broke the story he is assumed to be the mole only pamela <UNK> she who was on the case to find him in supremacy knows that he can't be the one <UNK> motive has always been to stay clear of the government and live his life in peace it has been the cia who keeps bringing him back into the open to <UNK> havoc on them what ends up <UNK> is that bourne wants to know the source as well to finally find out the truth of who he is and what made him into a killer the film then becomes a chase against time and each other to find the source and see if the government can close the <UNK> and tie off all loose ends or if bourne can get his revenge on those who took his life from him br br in what is probably the <UNK> storyline of the series with only one chase lasting the entirety of the story it has possibly the biggest cast of characters and turning over of <UNK> to expose the corruption that has been behind the full story progression this is not a <UNK> at all however as it allows for more fights and car chases that work in full context to the plot admission to this film is worth it for the apartment fight between bourne and the <UNK> second asset alone the chase jumping through windows in <UNK> is cool on its own but when they finally meet up we get a ten minute or so fight that is as <UNK> to watch as any scene you'll see also rather than using a massive car chase as a climatic set piece like in the first two films we instead get around three small scale road races just as intense but <UNK> enough to never <UNK> the action down into <UNK> br br after five years of waiting we also find out the origin of our favorite <UNK> with heart and feeling by the end of the film we will find out what has been the cause of all the espionage and destruction that has taken place around him no one could have done it better than matt damon he has the <UNK> and attitude to be believable in the action sequences but also the range to pull off the moments of intelligence and cat and mouse <UNK> with those against him joan allen <UNK> her role with the same amount of dedication to her job but also a bit more <UNK> for what is going on around her after how brian <UNK> character from the first two films took matters into his own hands needing a role in that mold we are given a nice turn from david <UNK> like cox he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision with as much trying to cover up any connections to his bosses of the <UNK> program as he is trying to do his duty to his country you can never quite <UNK> what he will be capable of doing even the little guys do a wonderful job like <UNK> <UNK> as the reporter who starts the <UNK> at the center of everything albert finney as a man from <UNK> past and possibly key to his origin and edgar <UNK> as one of the <UNK> <UNK> sent to take bourne out <UNK> is a nice addition to the role that has been successfully played by clive owen identity karl urban and martin <UNK> supremacy he doesn't talk much if at all but he has the look and robotic <UNK> down pat and hopefully will get more roles to show what he can do post a nice turn in domino br br in the end one has to applaud paul <UNK> for continuing to <UNK> expectations and bring this series to a conclusion that builds on the success of its predecessors rather than destroy them his skill at the close up hand held look is astonishing and has the same <UNK> energy as tony scott but without quite the <UNK> inducing cuts rather than feel like over production his use of hand held enhances the environment and puts you directly into the action let's also credit cinematographer oliver wood who shot all three bourne films he was able to work with both directors and work his style into a nice harmony with them
<START> i really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie but wow did it turn corny or should i say just plain stupid this is just another example of outdated humor it might have been funny in 1940 but not now not even close br br dick powell is always interesting to watch i especially liked him once he started switching from his <UNK> looks and high voice of the busby berkeley musicals to where he's mature and sounds it too br br he was fine as jimmy macdonald but the rest of the cast just played stupid characters the worst being the boss raymond <UNK> of the <UNK> house coffee company who did nothing but shout all the time he was brutal to hear and was a big <UNK> to the movie
<START> i saw this movie at a drive in in 1959 until howard the duck i considered this the worst movie i had ever seen this movie tried to combine all the <UNK> in one comedy horror teenage angst and the hot rod that must have <UNK> my mother the car maybe it deserves a second viewing to see if it is an accurate reflection of it's time
<START> i got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and didn't know what to expect the premise seemed silly and i assumed it would be a lot of shallow make fun of the virgin humor what a great surprise i laughed so hard i cried at some of the jokes this film is a must see for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor ok this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother jack palance or small children the language is filthy the jokes are very crude and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find anywhere what's amazing however is that the movie is still a sweet love story my girlfriend and i both loved it steve carell is terrific but like the office the supporting cast really makes the film work all of the characters have their flaws but they also have depth and <UNK> everyone pulls their weight and the chemistry is perfect i can't wait to get the dvd i'm sure it will be up there with office space for <UNK> and <UNK> lines
<START> as a fan of paris <UNK> i went to see new york i love you with very high expectations i gladly walked out with all my expectations met it was funny sweet fast paced and entertaining the film starts out with two cab <UNK> <UNK> cooper justin <UNK> trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go that was funny and then the film goes into some of the best skits i have ever seen anywhere there were four amazing ones out of all the good ones those four i will start talking about one features <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> at a hotel who finds love in an old lady the next one features orlando bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by christina <UNK> another one features anton <UNK> and olivia <UNK> as two people going to prom <UNK> character being handicapped the best one features eli <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> old couple i will bring to your attention that <UNK> portman makes an impressive directorial debut directing and writing a skit about a caretaker and ethan hawke and maggie q are excellent as a <UNK> man and a hooker new york i love you is definitely as good if not better than the 2006 paris <UNK> the skits are well paced and the film shows how indie films should really be the film however does not have as many famous directors as paris <UNK> which is why it was fantastic to live up to its excellence if you want to laugh see some great dramatic effects see an amazing amount of great performances and just plain be entertained then definitely go see new york i love you
<START> i rented this movie roughly 4 5 years ago and was instantly disappointed br br i wanted to see a b movie slasher flick but ended up with a <UNK> matter for my eyes the acting was similar to watching grass dry i've seen better acting in a <UNK> film br br the idea that a crazy killer comes out of nowhere <UNK> me how was this a horror movie br br this movie's production value was laughable at best there were no scares it seemed like a high school student got a new video camera for christmas the plot was all over the place if existent if you are bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent skip this one there are much better b movies out there
<START> realistic movie sure except for the fact that the characters don't look like to be scared when billy zane tries to kill someone he feels bad but he doesn't look like to that's why i don't like his performance in this movie tom berenger is again playing a soldier no good thrill realistic sequences not always shooting that is one great thing well filmed i hate the helicopter sequence cause only one terrorist kills almost the whole marine bunch i give it and a half out of
<START> watching beautiful women <UNK> around playing cops and robbers is one of the most delightful guilty pleasures the medium film lets me enjoy so the house on <UNK> street was not entirely a waste of time although the story is contrived and the screenplay uninspired and somewhat irritating br br there are many <UNK> to different hitchcock pictures not least the choice of kelly <UNK> in the starring role she is dressed up as grace kelly and she is not far off the mark not at all but her character is not convincing the way she is introduced to the audience she should be someone with political <UNK> and a purpose in life after all the movie deals with a clearly defined time period true events and a specific issue but the story <UNK> within the first minutes into a sorry run off the mill crime story with unbelievable <UNK> high predictability and a set of two dimensional characters this is all the more <UNK> as the performances of the actors are good as are the photography and the set design br br the finale in central station new york is breath taking it starts in the <UNK> section and then moves up to the roof the movie can be praised for its good use of architecture
<START> i fell in love with this silent action drama kurt russell and only kurt russell could have played this so well raised from childhood to know nothing but war and fighting todd kurt russell is dumped on a planet after being made <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> soldiers br br the stage is set and another classic icon of action movies was born soldier not rambo not <UNK> not bruce willis not mel gibson not jason <UNK> kurt russell owns this role and made it entirely his original daring and all too human i miss the fact that sequels were never made br br 10 10 br br <UNK> br br br br my faith http www <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK>
<START> let's go straight to the point this is the movie i would take with me on a desert island with dvd player it's just perfect if a reason for you to see a movie is that you love the actors you like to see them free to involve in the space and feelings this movie is for you see the scene when myrtle rowlands come on stage drunk and maurice cassavetes has to <UNK> because she doesn't follow the script anymore if you're sensitive to the <UNK> movements you'll be fascinated by the way the camera moves on stage the particular flow that give you the impression camera follow the actors as if it was lead by the theatrical principle of private space amazing and the story is just a brilliant mix of tale and realistic drama cassavetes is again arguing with hollywood and the <UNK> politics but this time he do it through broadway making one of the most exciting movie about theater well this movie is a bliss

<START> a top notch columbo from beginning to end i particularly like the interaction between columbo and the killer ruth gordon br br as an avid columbo fan i can't recall another one in which he doesn't set up the killer at the end as he does in other episodes in this one as he's trying to determine the correct sequence of the boxes and the message that the nephew left behind it finally <UNK> on him br br the music in this episode is very good as well as it is in many of other ones
<START> seriously i can easily stomach a lot of on screen blood gore and <UNK> but what really makes this film disturbing uncomfortable to watch is how the doctor character keeps on rambling about the physical damage done to raped women he john cassavetes of rosemary's baby talks about <UNK> <UNK> dry <UNK> and massive loads of <UNK> <UNK> like they are the most common little <UNK> in the world of medicine that being said <UNK> is an ultimately strange horror effort it isn't necessarily awful  although it isn't very good neither  but just plain weird the muddled incoherent script initially revolves on the hunt for a rapist killer of flesh and blood even though the title clearly suggests the involvement of a supernatural creature and it never seems to stop introducing new characters none of these characters especially not the main ones come across as sympathetic and for some never explained reason they all seem to keep dark secrets the aforementioned doctor has an odd interpretation of daughter love and continuously behaves like he's a suspect himself the town's sheriff john ireland appears to be in a constant state of <UNK> and doesn't even seem to care about who keeps <UNK> killing the women in his district the female reporter is even too weird for words and the <UNK> an old witch and her <UNK> are just plain spooky all together they desperately try to solve the mystery of whom or what exactly is destroying the <UNK> women <UNK> organs the sequences building up towards the rapes murders are admirably atmospheric and the vile acts themselves are bloody and unsettling basically these are very positive factors in a horror film but the narrative structure is too incoherent and the characters are too unsympathetic for <UNK> to be a really good film also there are quite a few tedious parts to struggle yourself through like footage of a bruce dickinson concert and the usually very reliable john <UNK> direction is nearly <UNK> the final shot is effectively nightmarish though for me personally <UNK> was a bit of a disappointment but there are still several enough reasons to recommend this odd piece of early 80's horror to open minded genre fanatics
<START> the rookie is based on the true story of a 40 year old school teacher in big lake texas reaching the <UNK> jimmy morris dennis quaid is a small town high school science teacher and baseball coach his team is losing terribly until the team discovers that their coach played in minor <UNK> and can throw a pitch 98 <UNK> br br after throwing <UNK> practice and a <UNK> is made jim agrees that if his team wins <UNK> he'll try out for the major <UNK> the movie tells the story from jimmy being boy to playing in his first game in the <UNK> it is a great underdog story and a very friendly family movie dennis quaid makes the movie worth while giving an emotional performance and is supported by an excellent supporting cast which includes brian cox rachel <UNK> and <UNK> t jones br br the story takes a little while to develop and some scenes are a bit slow but it all works in well by the end the baseball scenes are fun well filmed and portrayed excellently the movie really isn't about baseball but about one man's quest to reach his dream it's inspiring it's emotional and it's funny i liked it i hope you do br br the rookie starring dennis quaid brian cox rachel <UNK> and <UNK> t jones br br 4 out of 5 stars
<START> this was the only time i ever walked out on a movie years later i saw it in the cable <UNK> and thought maybe i should give it another try suffice to say that i was right the first time this ranks second only to godzilla 1998 as the worst movie i've ever seen
<START> minor spoilers as a bad movie <UNK> i must have viewed hundreds of bad movies and yet hobgoblins stands apart from all others in it's own unique way classic baddies such as the <UNK> terror the mighty <UNK> and <UNK> are uniformly bad from start to finish hobgoblins on the other hand starts off bad and gets <UNK> worse as it goes during my first viewing of the infamous <UNK> fight scene i thought to myself that this was a truly bad film i was <UNK> unaware that i had just seen the best that this movie had to offer the movie takes its most massive <UNK> into celluloid hell during the painfully inept club <UNK> sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another with just this one film director rick sloane proves that he deserves mention alongside the likes of coleman francis and bill <UNK> as one of the worst directors of all time how bad can a bad movie be watch hobgoblins and wonder no longer
<START> no spoilers here but i have been a fan since waking the dead started but the last series of which only 3 have been on so far is awful the stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series i found these 3 in the last series jaw <UNK> ludicrous as a bbc <UNK> <UNK> after the show i <UNK> bbc complaints to pass on my disappointment i'm amazed that actors of the <UNK> of <UNK> eve and sue <UNK> didn't object to the story lines these actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons <UNK> they can see it's lost all direction it's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of father christmas br br paul <UNK> west <UNK> england
<START> i was very excited about seeing this film <UNK> a visual <UNK> on the relation of artistic beauty and nature containing the kinds of wisdom the likes of rivers and <UNK> however that's not what i received instead i get a fairly uninspired film about how human industry is bad for nature which is clearly a quite <UNK> claim br br the photographer seems conflicted about the aesthetic qualities of his images and the supposed <UNK> duty he has to the workers occasionally <UNK> the images along the <UNK> and frankly the images were not generally that impressive and according to this artist scale is the basis for what makes something beautiful br br in all respects a stupid film for people who'd like to feel better about their <UNK> consciousness but not for any one who would like to think about the <UNK> of the issues surrounding it
<START> the movie had a good concept but the execution just didn't live up to it br br what is this concept well story wise it's dirty harry meets m a child killer has begun <UNK> a city the lead detectives dennis hopper and <UNK> forest have never dealt with a serial killer before the mayor and the police chief in desperation secretly hire the local mob to speed things up to go places and do things that the police wouldn't be able to in order to bring an end to this mess as soon as possible br br to be fair this film does genuinely have some good things to offer br br besides the concept i liked the look of the killer's <UNK> norman bates has his basement this guy has an eerie <UNK> in some of the shots the light <UNK> off the water and creates <UNK> <UNK> on the walls often giving these scenes a creepy <UNK> quality br br the acting was good too dennis hopper is one of those actors who gets better with age br br once you get past that however it more or less goes downhill br br the film is paced way too fast the actual investigation process from both teams feels very rushed as opposed to feeling intricate and fascinating this could have been fixed in two ways either make the film longer or cut out some of the many subplots either of these would have allowed the crew to <UNK> more time to the actual mystery br br for an example of how bad this is one of the crucial clues that helps them zero in on just the right suspect is this at one point in his life the suspect went to a pet shop that's right i'm being totally serious here it's like they went from point a the first clue to point z the suspect and <UNK> over all the in between steps br br then there's the characters the only ones i actually liked were two pick <UNK> you meet about half way through the movie considering that they're minor characters i'd call that a bad sign br br finally there's the mob angle this is the one that gets me the most because this is why i <UNK> up the 3 to buy the dvd in the first place i mean what a hook there's been an absolute <UNK> of serial killer flicks in the last 10 15 years the mob angle was a gimmick that could have helped it rise above the rest but it didn't br br i figured the <UNK> methods would be brutal but fun and thrilling at the same time kind of like a vigilante movie or something maybe they'd even throw in some heist movie elements too we are talking about criminals after all instead we're given some of the most repulsive protagonists committed to celluloid the detectives question witnesses what does the mob do they <UNK> and kill them it's not even like these witnesses are really even that bad either i actually found the criminals less likable than the killer they're hunting br br unless the good points i mentioned are enough to get your interest i'd say give this one a miss maybe some day they'll <UNK> the same story idea and do it right i hope so i hate to see such a good concept go to waste
<START> i'm not a big fan of most anime but gundam wing is truly something else gundam wing lacks all of that stereotypical melodrama that you might think of when you think of anime since the number of jokes made over the 17 hours would only be in the double <UNK> gundam wing gets right down to business br br gundam wing is as much of a political thriller as it is an action series large parts focus on the <UNK> <UNK> of a war not only the battles though battle animation lacks extreme detail in cases where it would just be a pain to <UNK> individual <UNK> between <UNK> are almost pieces of art considering the animated use of complex <UNK> and rapid movements br br to my knowledge this <UNK> episode plus one movie series was picked up by cartoon network in 2000 and then <UNK> dubbed by them too the dubbing is simply flawless not only does every word said match up but the voices use truly make the characters much more believable many believe that it is best to watch anime with <UNK> in english but i simply don't have the determination to do that br br not only are the voices good but the score used over the series is quite impressive i'll just say it left me <UNK> the net in vain to find a soundtrack br br the plot of this series is what will truly hook viewers and no not hook you like some prime time drama like lost which was only made for the purpose of <UNK> you explaining the plot deeply would lead to many spoilers since many of the characters do not even have names until quite a few episodes into the series the rough idea of the series is that earth and its now independent space <UNK> are having difficulty maintaining peace thus a war is started leading to military <UNK> and elaborate <UNK> situations i feel that any more detail would begin to give away information which is crucial to the plot br br i'll end here saying that this series is great for anyone that likes anime anyone that thinks all anime is stupid they have good reason to think so and anyone looking to get into anime with a serious tone to it
<START> good sequel to murder in a small town in this one cash and his police lt buddy unravel a <UNK> plot involving a nazi criminal a <UNK> witch and a family of screw ups and their <UNK> <UNK> as in the original the viewer is treated to a nice little mystery with distinctive sights and sounds of pre war america go see it
<START> one thing is for sure you should not watch this film if you are having a bad day the story is based around a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin that he cant handle the story is <UNK> fed to you rather than the usual <UNK> down explanation so it keeps you wondering what is going on eventually the <UNK> are joined up and the performances make sense all the characters were ok and <UNK> smith did another good day at the office br br there are no doubt a lot of moral questions to be asked but if you just accept and buy into his agony then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant the journey it takes you on is interesting enough if not overwhelming br br a good enough film that unfortunately leaves you a little sad at the end i would recommend this film if you like the sort where you have to think and not just watch explosions and fights
<START> i have not read the other comments on the film but judging from the average rating i can see that they are unlikely to be very <UNK> br br i watched it for the second time with my children they absolutely loved it true it did not have the adults rolling around the floor but the sound of the children's enjoyment made it seem so br br it is a true mel brooks farce with plenty of moral content how sad it is to be loved for our money not for whom we are and how <UNK> are our friends and associates there are many other films on a similar subject matter no doubt many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults it's hard for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family however br br hence for the children a 9 10 from me
<START> yeah the <UNK> of a simple but inspirational movie the very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a chill whenever i see it that's just brilliant joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life the way he <UNK> with danny glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is funny and <UNK> a very nice family movie with i <UNK> a rather corny happy end but hey it doesn't really matter the movie <UNK> its basic quality by the good acting and the inspirational themes
<START> as an old white housewife i can still appreciate that laurence fishburne is one of our finest actors anyone who <UNK> his work like in deep cover might enjoy watching the incredible acting range of this actor since i think this is his directorial debut it might prove even more interesting all of the acting is quite good if you can't take lower manhattan <UNK> worlds or the reality of crime life not <UNK> action shoot em ups then this is not a film you would enjoy it is mr <UNK> usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships i would love to see larry and anthony hopkins go at each other some day in a movie
<START> a scientist john carradine sadly finds out how to bring the dead back to life however they come back with faces of <UNK> eventually this all leads to disaster br br boring totally predictable 1940s outing this scared me silly when i was a kid but just <UNK> me now i had to struggle to stay awake with one exception the acting is horrible such <UNK> boring actors hopeless br br there are some good things about this carradine despite the script actually gives a very good performance and there are a few mildly creepy moments involving a ghost of a great <UNK> walking through walls there's also one of the worst looking <UNK> in cinema history still none of this is fun enough to sit through this avoid
<START> i grew up on this classic western series and as a child always considered it a treat being allowed to stay up late on sunday <UNK> to watch it bonanza is still infinitely re watchable in re runs br br the series chronicles the adventures of the <UNK> family who live on a ranch near virginia city <UNK> around the civil war era their ranch called the <UNK> is run and <UNK> by the widowed father ben and his <UNK> three sons adam <UNK> and little joe these three brothers have different mothers all of whom have passed away years earlier br br the <UNK> are a hard working <UNK> and <UNK> family highly respected in those parts the <UNK> is large so reaching its <UNK> requires a lot of <UNK> riding also <UNK> away are often necessary in order to buy or sell cattle and so forth needless to say few of these <UNK> pass <UNK> although <UNK> much of the <UNK> energy must be spent defending their ranch from <UNK> or protecting themselves from <UNK> jealous of their <UNK> and stellar reputation the <UNK> do a fair bit of firing their guns up in the air and such but only shoot to kill when deemed absolutely necessary they are involved in various town affairs even the political life of the <UNK> territory br br one of the main <UNK> of the series is the underlying warmth that is always present despite occasional <UNK> between ben and his three sons and despite frequent <UNK> between the three brothers now one brother might beat up another every now and then but generally has a good reason for it at the time and his anger never lasts long the characters are all very well drawn ben is portrayed as a successful and noble man of great integrity the oldest son adam the most rational and suave of the brothers left <UNK> through the series the middle brother <UNK> is a gentle giant of a teddy bear who has an <UNK> <UNK> for food and is a little shy around the ladies the youngest little joe is a hot headed handsome <UNK> who by contrast has quite a way with women this trio of brothers enjoy various romances but their love interests are typically killed off by the end of the episode or else marriage proves impossible for whatever reason br br the actors are all stellar in their roles including <UNK> roberts adam dan <UNK> <UNK> michael <UNK> little joe and of course <UNK> greene as the <UNK> family <UNK> ben i also love the ranch cook hop sing played by victor <UNK> <UNK> br br this is a wonderful action packed western with great values the <UNK> are always the noble heroes and most of the bad guys quite villainous if only there were more programs like this vintage western on tv these days
<START> darkness was entertaining to some degree but it never seemed to have a plot lacking one more so than other films that have been accused of this <UNK> i e bad taste it started off really good with a man running from something it was very creepy for these first few minutes but after a time the film just became entertaining on the level of gore which was hard to make out at some points due to poor lighting and horrible recording quality anyway the film was hard to believe because of the juvenile acting which most of the time seemed like some friends talking to a video camera making lines up as they went that with a lack of any plot whatsoever made it look like the film was started without and ended without a script of any kind as said before gore was this film's only drawing point which much of the time was hard to make out
<START> i was having just about the worst day of my life then i stumbled on this cute film watched it and now i'm ready to go out kiss a <UNK> br br i have to admit i only watched it for 2 reasons vera <UNK> legs but it's really so much more the plot is actually quite clever and <UNK> woven it's almost like a shakespearean comedy with all of its delightful <UNK> and of course there's also vera <UNK> legs br br the only unfortunate aspect of this film is that the version i purchased the 100 family classics collection by mill creek entertainment doesn't have the best video quality and i've heard the same about the <UNK> release the <UNK> and contrast are a bit too high so a lot of the scenes seem <UNK> out especially when vera is dancing in a white dress but i suppose you can <UNK> with the controls of your tv set to compensate i can only imagine how it looked on the big screen back in <UNK> the stage sets costumes colours are otherwise dazzling delightfully creepy sort of in a <UNK> of dr <UNK> vein br br as far as the romance goes this is just perfect not sappy not contrived not melodramatic just 100 <UNK> too bad you poor <UNK> your miserable lives will never be as charming as this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wait what am i laughing at my life sucks just as bad as yours oh hell time to watch this movie again
<START> the title alone along with the poster is enough to give away the projected man as an obvious rip off of the fly and <UNK> <UNK> while much better than the typical imdb review would have you think is <UNK> idea of an acceptable stand in for vincent price although come to think of it who would be unless micheal <UNK> was available still if you are in the mood to watch a british hammer style movie with a science fiction theme about a <UNK> experiment gone horribly wrong well you still might want to give the projected man a pass and <UNK> around in the <UNK> bin at your local wal mart for another <UNK> accident movie because this one just isn't all that good br br <UNK> caught a lot of good natured <UNK> from the mst3k crew for his part in this movie and in devil doll but he is actually the best thing in <UNK> maybe he can't carry the movie but he gets practically no help here from the screenplay the script <UNK> down any forward momentum the plot may have in a <UNK> of nonsense about funding and university politics and a guy named <UNK> and some sinister <UNK> who want the <UNK> machine to fail so they can steal its secrets or something so all the dramatic sequences in the first half of movie involve either phone calls or unconvincing special effects with transparent <UNK> machines and <UNK> rats then when poor <UNK> gets <UNK> by his machine he has to spend the last part of the film wearing a <UNK> over half his face and rubber <UNK> over the rest while he <UNK> various <UNK> who chance across his path tom cruise and eric roberts using <UNK> couldn't have made this screenplay work br br meanwhile all the other actors <UNK> try to <UNK> life and interest into their roles for this turgid little project but the screenplay just <UNK> their efforts whole the corrupt project <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> into the phone to his <UNK> all the while failing to notice that he looks like a werewolf <UNK> in a <UNK> suit and a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> research assistant and ex girlfriend have the least convincing romance in the history of british horror cinema his secretary is forced to parade around in her <UNK> none of it really works or <UNK> into a real movie and it all just kind of stops dead leaving the viewer going eh excuse me wasn't there supposed to be an ending here br br still for all its problems i can easily name a dozen horror movies from the same period that were as bad or worse and so could anyone else who follows movies or who has ever <UNK> the imdb bottom 100 i wouldn't actually pay money to own projected man but if it were included in some <UNK> along with a dozen other movies in a dvd collection i'd probably feel ok about having it it's a harmless <UNK> perfect for a horror movie film festival to watched with friends while <UNK> many beers and <UNK> on a saturday evening
<START> <UNK> 1990 is a very rare horror <UNK> from 1990 released here in the uk on the new world video label br br it's a desert based horror film about a group of young friends who are <UNK> for the weekend only to be killed off one by one by an unknown force who drives a menacing black truck this film has some creepy scenes and some gore here and there but i have to say that the acting was so lame even by low budget standards but the film was oddly <UNK> and i liked it and i never fell asleep or turned it off which is always a good sign i nearly gave this movie 6 10 but seeing as it built up steam along the way had some good moments of gore and suspense had some good nudity and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was a <UNK> too i'll give it 7 10
<START> dr mccoy and mr spock find themselves trapped in a <UNK> past ice age while capt kirk is in the same <UNK> colonial period however it's the former pair that has the most trying time besides the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to be found only in <UNK> there is a third <UNK> the beautiful and so sexy <UNK> <UNK> hartley as spock spends more time in this era he slowly begins to <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> of his <UNK> feeling a natural attraction to <UNK> and throwing caution to the wind about ever leaving this place only with dr <UNK> constant <UNK> does spock hold on to some grasp of reality br br this stand as one of the few times when the character gets to show some emotion and <UNK> spock plays it to the <UNK> coming close to knocking the <UNK> out of <UNK> kelly mccoy surprising to previous installment captain kirk william shatner wasn't allowed to get the girl another plus for this one br br <UNK> old man ian <UNK> <UNK> the role of mr <UNK> the <UNK> responsible for sending the trio into the past
<START> this movie begins with an ordinary funeral and it insists so hard on this ordinary funeral feel that i lost interest within 5 minutes of watching and started skipping scenes it seems to me <UNK> made this movie is <UNK> to the extent of becoming trapped in a permanent morbid <UNK> unable to contemplate anything else but death and destruction well i ain't one of the dark kids from <UNK> i want a movie that within 10 minutes gets me well into an interesting story i won't sit and watch 10 minutes of nothing but <UNK> for a funeral my grandma on her last years was fascinated by <UNK> perhaps she might have enjoyed this movie
<START> this film is absolutely horrific one of the worst movies i've ever seen the story does nearly not exist the characters are full of stereotypes and the special fx only make you laugh the only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the <UNK> <UNK> as some kind of police officer br br if this film was supposed to be a comedy i didn't quite get the point if you want to watch this movie please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good laughs especially when the first special fx appear on the screen br br but if you like trash movies made on the cheap this film is a must see for you
<START> i gave this two stars for the awesome <UNK> shot clarity which lends to the cold and dark <UNK> of its character that was being generous i know br br this film fails on all accounts i can not recommend this for it is neither poetic nor blunt neither dramatic nor suspenseful neither controversial nor ordinary it is just a wretched piece of trash that no horror or exploit fan can recommend in good faith br br do not watch this whoever you are please just stay away from this awful product br br thank you
<START> let me start by saying that i consider myself to be one of the more most open minded movie viewers movies are my passion and i am a big regular at my local cult movie rental place i also feel the need to add that they often ask me for advice about movies whenever i get there and i never seem to be able to leave the place without having had an elaborate discussion or exchange of ideas about what is going on in the cult movie area i love to rent strange stuff and that is exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the guys at the cult movie video place he told me he thought i had to see this and since the cover said something about it being a movie with a <UNK> one of my favorites atmosphere i rented it br br the vote i gave here is not really fair because i did not think it was awful i just did not know how to rate it otherwise a question mark would have been more appropriate br br this is the first and only film that literally made me sick to my stomach i actually felt physically ill am i the only one whose stomach literally turned still i did not want to turn it off or maybe i just couldn't because i was fascinated in a nasty way br br i do not ever wanna see this movie again br br not awful a 1 as i said just not my cup of tea or <UNK> for that matter
<START> i've always knew anne <UNK> was a great character actor now i know she is a great writer director also i have been a fan since i first saw her in the movies perfect my favorite year <UNK> cab and stardust memories br br it's so rare to see lee grant these days in anything she has been missing from the screen for far too long it's also wonderful to see <UNK> <UNK> in something other than a sit com this is her best work since the last picture show if you grew up in an italian american family you will love this movie i wasn't expecting a lot when i started watching this movie so i was pleasantly surprised when i fell in love with this movie if you get the chance watch it
<START> this movie rivals plan 9 as one of the dumbest movie ever made always be concerned when the same person is the br br 1 star 2 director 3 producer 4 writer 5 <UNK> and 6 editor unfortunately justin <UNK> did all 6 jobs imdb shows that he and his father were western <UNK> <UNK> so maybe that was the problem br br here's just one example from the film in the film the sheriff has to take a witness to another town for protection of course the bad guys find out and are waiting for them but what happens the good guys are riding along and a shot rings out and hits a tree near them when the camera shows us the bad guys they're all just sitting on a <UNK> <UNK> what's wrong with this picture br br i could go on perhaps this film was meant as a comedy if so it didn't do that well either
<START> space camp is a pretty decent film the plot is predictable but the actors do a good job and the special effects are decent for the time br br this film was originally released about the time of the <UNK> disaster and that really put a <UNK> on how popular it was br br the scene where the <UNK> doors open in space is simply spectacular on the big screen that is on a tv it just looks average i remember this scene in the theater it made you feel like you were really up there br br this would be a good film to see on <UNK> but i'm sure that will never happen
<START> <UNK> fox did it again move the viewer's heart in a modest story taking place in an overwhelming mess the movie also succeeds in describing so perfectly and subtly the atmosphere of the incredible city that is tel <UNK> br br i was there a month ago and it is all there the lifestyle the relationships the heart beating city the mess the chock of <UNK> <UNK> in the most light hearted <UNK> and oblivious <UNK> ever br br strongly recommend it is a voyage for the heart and the mind with an interesting perspective to the <UNK> palestinian conflict br br <UNK> <UNK> there is central gay plot in the movie if you do not think you are too gay friendly be prepared to be challenged and finally see it as just love and don't worry the chick is hot too
<START> ever since the cinema loving universe made <UNK> with a guy named george a romero the word zombie automatically gets associated with blood <UNK> horror images and non stop acting sequences it's safe to say that his night of the living dead formed the zombie movie as we know it now yet in the earliest years of cinema the premise of <UNK> corpses was merely used in slow nearly action less psychological thrillers jacques <UNK> i walked with a zombie is a perfect example and so is white zombie starring bela lugosi this revolt of the zombies could have been another example but unfortunately it's a failure over the entire line and easily one of the most tedious movies i ever saw dreadful acting a very poorly written screenplay and a complete lack of atmosphere and tension the film only lasts <UNK> minutes and yet the first half hour is entirely wasted on stupid love story <UNK> and <UNK> monologues the setting in the legendary <UNK> city of <UNK> surely could have resulted in a more compelling story but all we ever see are interior shots the lead actress dorothy stone <UNK> blonde with curly hair and an ugly nose irritated me enormously and i kept hoping a <UNK> undead would suddenly appear out of nowhere to <UNK> her unlucky <UNK> if you manage to struggle yourself through 60 <UNK> minutes you'll be rewarded with a fairly decent finale still this is far too little to give this film a positive rating let alone a recommendation avoid this is the type of movie you should only see in case you already saw everything else
<START> what happens when the average joe finds out he has supernatural powers the premise may sound familiar the <UNK> <UNK> however the russian sci fi action flick the sword <UNK> is far from the standard stock br br the story revolves around a man named <UNK> who as a boy was <UNK> from society his peers and family due to a supernatural power that he possess when he wishes or his anger allows a sword <UNK> from his arm <UNK> his own skin very <UNK> maybe but that's not the interesting part of this film <UNK> all his life and driven by anger and a temper he does have our hero returns to his home town to turn his life around or find a reason to the only thing he encounters here is trouble when an encounter with an old <UNK> new boyfriend leaves him <UNK> on the ground this is where the vengeance and anger comes into play this is a man you do not want to cross and from this point the mafia and the police are on his tail he meets a girl and falls in love instantly as does she and this is really what the movie is about br br the film is highly <UNK> with bold colors and noir overtones spliced with short yet extreme action sequences this is art house at it's core beautifully filmed with such attention to details in every scene over gruesome sci fi action it's this odd mash that interests me so much in this film the directors approach for this genre is refreshing focusing on the emotional journey of <UNK> and not a straight action film don't worry though the action is there and plenty of it however much of these sequences show only implied violence with pictures of the horrific aftermath this is not to say that action is not shown these scenes are here and are fantastic especially the ending where we see <UNK> full powers unleashed in desperation the director chooses to imply the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on the character's emotional struggle at hand this is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre
<START> this hal roach comedy short a tough winter is the ninety <UNK> in the our gang little <UNK> series and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a showcase for black comic <UNK> <UNK> who gets special billing here we see him going to his shack where the gang hangs out <UNK> <UNK> a love letter from the mail for him and is told by <UNK> to read it since he can't read it during the day as he goes to night school it happens to be from his sweetheart in <UNK> so now <UNK> has to have his ears stuffed with <UNK> since it's too hot for him to hear in another room <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to mary ann of making <UNK> from the radio but because he keeps running back and forth to the kitchen he misses the lady <UNK> <UNK> to rice <UNK> and spanish <UNK> confusing mary ann with <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> after the <UNK> is completed jackie and the rest of the gang help themselves with the awful <UNK> but very <UNK> substance as everyone gets stuck on the walls as a result as they all try to clean the mess <UNK> works in the basement on various <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> that mixes <UNK> <UNK> functions such a <UNK> that <UNK> a <UNK> that rings and a <UNK> that plays music the end what i've just described <UNK> the meandering nature of this our gang short that served as the pilot for a potential <UNK> <UNK> movie short series it's just as well that it never took place as <UNK> characterization of the lazy <UNK> was amusing only in small doses and would be considered highly offensive today many of the scenes i've just described are good for some laughs though the final sequence was so confusing that the results were just too blah for me so in summary a tough winter is a <UNK> worth seeing at least once by the way <UNK> real name was lincoln theodore perry
<START> bad acting bad southern accents inconsistent cinematography horrible script br br i was looking forward to this film at a recent film festival and was so <UNK> after seeing it it contains quote <UNK> name talent but they do not deliver of course the basis for this is the uneven and uninteresting story that is told br br don't bother
<START> after the opening credits there's a black screen for about a minute a minute of nothing then a girl wakes up and takes a shower then her and two college friends are driving to a rock concert after much padding they hit something and <UNK> off the road they <UNK> in a cabin inhabited by a wheelchair bound old lady and her <UNK> the killings are sadly very tame for a supposed video nasty the twist ending silly and predictable no one involved in the mess would ever make anything of note again so there are still happy endings sometimes br br eye candy sara <UNK> gets topless and laurel <UNK> has full frontal on display br br my grade d
<START> after 30 seconds you already realize that there was no real budget for this cheap knock off the story is taken from great movies like texas chainsaw massacre and hills have eyes i like those kind of movies even if they're <UNK> well wrong turn <UNK> falls <UNK> br br but side sho is hard to watch the actors are really bad the dialogue is cheesy and the music is stupid and totally misplaced you do not care at all what happens to the characters the so called bad guys are also not interesting at all and rather stereotypical so how about the blood and gore well there is some although it is rather cheap and the action is executed very poorly 2 points just for the gore and blood but do understand that this is hardly worth a look even for the gore <UNK>
<START> if you want just about everything you want to know about wwii from multiple perspectives this dvd delivers you will learn new things guaranteed so much so that you won't need any other <UNK> on the subject get this watch it learn from it good for school use as well as a bonus watch this with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> saving private ryan <UNK> band of brothers a bridge too far the longest day and other wwii epics along with this to make your knowledge of wwii even more complete sir laurence <UNK> voice adds to the overall atmosphere of each episode in this 26 part series seriously you won't find a better wwii documentary set on the subject perfect 10
<START> this movie surprised me not ever having heard of hyde of gackt i was not expecting much the reason i wanted to watch this movie was because somebody mentioned that the movie contained some serious action scenes in john woo style normally i am very careful when this is claimed there is only one john woo and <UNK> this day there hasn't been one director that comes close to his brilliance when it comes to action the fact that moon child would feature a vampire convinced me even more how can you go wrong with gun blazing vampires sounds promising and interesting the first thing i noticed about this movie that the pace was considerably slow it takes it's time to set the mood this movie contains some nice hong kong style action scenes but moon child isn't an action movie it is a drama about friendship and loyalty the focus is on the characters and their relation to each other the pop singers hyde and gackt do a good job in acting and are very believable as friends the only problem i had was with the plot a couple of times the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip example when one member of the gang dies very dramatic moment alexander wang sees <UNK> hyde drinking blood of one of the <UNK> without warning and explanation the movie <UNK> 9 nine years and most of the friends aren't together anymore also without a proper reason given son alexander wang and sho gackt have to kill each other i know that this is done to add some serious drama because of the actors it is very effective but sometimes it does feel forced apart from the flaws in plot this movie has an ambiance and <UNK> that makes it hard not to like this movie it is hard to explain why this movie is wonderful but it just is the overall experience you get is heartwarming and sincere
<START> who actually created this piece of crap this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it is such a waste of time and money i hate it how they create low budget sequels featuring d <UNK> actors and a storyline so similar to the 1st one br br i found this movie in the bargain bin sitting right next to wild things 2 and death to the <UNK> for 2 99 what a fool i was to actually think that this could be good instead i watched in disgust as poor acting stereotypes ripped of the storyline and script from the 1st one br br whoever thought that this straight to video production was actually even a half decent film you must be on <UNK> or something because i think what pretty much most of the people who've seen this film thinks what a load of crap
<START> another rape of history br br this movie is a catastrophe it just uses a historic story and makes a sweet love story with bad acting and low budget production br br the movie should be 1 3 the time they just dragged the time to make a mini series br br the battle scenes are so stupid and illogical the <UNK> <UNK> stupid the costumes a catastrophe the <UNK> were good in fighting in opened areas one of their <UNK> was completely destroyed by the germans when they tried to fight in a forest in this movie the <UNK> choose to fight in side the city i mean get real br br and by the way <UNK> was from a <UNK> origin which means a light skinned person
<START> spoilers br br a buddy of mine said next movie was the best cheech chong flick and went out of his way to have me borrow it and the blues brothers next movie has no plot has no pacing really has no anything of what <UNK> a movie but it is funny and for what it is worth cheech and chong show some heart br br well in this little paragraph i put in the plot but being that four <UNK> of the movie nothing happens that would usually start a story i will just say that cheech 's cousin shows up br br was there no other funnier moment when chong made cheech drink the pee twice what about the <UNK> was that pee wee <UNK> first movie appearance you would have to watch the movie yourself to enjoy it i don't think next movie has strong enough balls to make it awesome but the movie has heart and hey my buddy let me borrow it so it gets a 7
<START> this movie is a perfect example of an excellent book getting ruined by a movie <UNK> have i loved is quite possibly the worst film that i have ever seen there is no storyline plots disappear and the editing is awful to top it all off the music is straight from a <UNK> and sounds unbelievably terrible bridget <UNK> acting is decent but everyone else's acting is totally amateur i would suggest this movie to someone who is studying to be a producer as a study on how not to produce a movie as it is chock full of bad cut scenes bad transitions and acting that should have been re shot read the book and don't waste your time with this film
<START> i saw an american in paris on its first release when i was still at school and fell in love with it <UNK> i went back to see it again the next day and have lost count of the number of times i have seen it since both in the cinema and on tv it makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs by the greatest popular composer of the <UNK> century george gershwin and features the greatest male gene kelly and female leslie caron dancers in hollywood history the supporting cast of oscar <UNK> as quirky as ever georges <UNK> why didn't he make more movies and nina <UNK> brilliant in an unsympathetic role are at the top of their form the closing ballet superbly choreographed to the title music makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of paris and of the images of <UNK> and post <UNK> artists all the gershwin songs are beautifully staged but the most memorable are it's very clear caron and kelly on the banks of the <UNK> and i got rhythm the kids of paris joining gene kelly in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> if you love paris see this movie if you've never been to paris in your life see it but see it
<START> i guess i was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor so i gave it a chance from director <UNK> jordan buffalo soldiers basically ned kelly heath ledger is set up by the police especially <UNK> francis <UNK> geoffrey rush he is forced to go on the run <UNK> a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family's names that's really all i can say about the story as i wasn't paying the <UNK> attention to be honest also starring orlando bloom as joseph <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as julia cook laurence <UNK> as dan kelly philip <UNK> as steve hart joel <UNK> as aaron <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as kate kelly emily <UNK> as grace kelly and rachel <UNK> as susan scott ledger makes a pretty good performance for what it's worth and the film does have it's eye catching moments particularly with a gun battle towards the end but i can't say i enjoyed it as i didn't look at it all okay
<START> my favorite part of this film was the old man's attempt to cure his <UNK> <UNK> by putting the strong medicine in his bath there is more than a sense of family there is a sense of community
<START> i didn't really expect much from the night <UNK> and i actually never heard of it until i saw the cover in the <UNK> however the movie is very effective when it comes to building up suspension and tension on occasion it drags a little but it actually helps to keep you wondering what's going to happen and more importantly when as the movie progresses the character played by robin williams gets dragged into some kind of cat and mouse <UNK> to the point where he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth and existence about a 14 year old abused kid that no one seemed to have ever seen in person the night <UNK> is an interesting story which is great in building up the suspense throughout the movie and you're pretty much kept in the dark of who is lying and what's real however in the end it kind of disappoints and doesn't live up to the potential it could have had it doesn't really give you a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character which would have been helpful and interesting
<START> in <UNK> childhood friends marie <UNK> as maggie warren and polly <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the wedding of their children anita page as helen and norman foster as john before the celebration ms <UNK> turns the <UNK> of her small town bank over to her son mr foster six years later the great depression brings many bank <UNK> and financial <UNK> <UNK> foster is able to survive due to mother <UNK> wise planning but ms <UNK> is worried about her fortune and <UNK> demands a complete <UNK> other warren bank customers hear <UNK> rant and start questioning their own <UNK> soon the family is in financial crisis br br <UNK> huge critical and financial film hit emma had been released early in the year and mgm had to have wanted to get a new <UNK> film out as soon as possible <UNK> 1931 hits <UNK> and politics were still making a lot of money and <UNK> had become <UNK> us 1 box office star according to the industry standard list <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> certainly celebrated <UNK> status but the production appears <UNK> sloppy and rushed the cast does well considering some more care in direction and editing and some <UNK> would have <UNK> apparently they needed it in theaters for the holidays br br <UNK> 11 12 <UNK> sam wood marie <UNK> polly <UNK> anita page norman foster
<START> cinderella br br i hadn't watched this film for about five years the last time i saw it the magic remains there is something that definitely contains that <UNK> feel the songs entertain and the secondary character's all please the villains in the form of step sisters are perfectly evil and vile then there is the most magical of all disney the mice making the dress and well you know the rest to sum up the four of the disney princess movies are all great but this is a charming magical experience watch and enjoy oh and of course cinderella is wonderful as the main character in the movie br br if you think about it disney movies can really lost their charm with <UNK> wood and others the movie has such a feel to it you simply can't help but smile br br they say the moral of this story is that dreams come true of course in the real world some are <UNK> others are <UNK> in this film it's even more the magical when her <UNK> comes smiling br br and of course the rest is cinderella
<START> this movie is a ripoff of james <UNK> novel the <UNK> always rings twice apparently the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the italians in wwii might account for their forgetting to consider <UNK> despite this the movie isn't really just an italian version of the hollywood movie in some ways it's a lot better and in other ways it is definitely not br br the three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people in fact the male and female lovers are a bit <UNK> looking the male lead is pretty ordinary except for his <UNK> body hair particularly on the back and shoulders and his lady love is to put it frankly unattractive they are a very very far cry from <UNK> turner and john garfield in the hollywood version and the ill <UNK> husband is really really <UNK> and loves to walk around <UNK> and his counterpart in the american film cecil <UNK> is definitely better looking and probably better looking than the other two italian leads actually and this <UNK> is generally a reason i actually preferred the italian film since i just could not imagine a finely <UNK> dish like <UNK> turner in the middle of nowhere married to <UNK> i am 100 sure she would have had dozens of better offers whereas the italian wife frankly might not have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable br br part of the italian film's believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex the <UNK> american film tries to make you believe that although turner and garfield kill <UNK> they never actually get around to sex this is pretty silly and totally unrealistic in addition to the casual sexuality of the film it's also pretty casual in showing the <UNK> side of life with lots of <UNK> people a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath br br the movie is also pretty fast paced compared to the over long american film and what you get due to <UNK> isn't all good the film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the american film with <UNK> footage relatively poor <UNK> and sets it sure ain't a pretty film but the neo realistic like style makes the film seem more realistic but it cannot make up for the short cuts in the plot many of the plot elements in the later american version are either missing entirely or <UNK> over and the ending seems a lot less interesting than the american film and misses the entire human nature dilemma when turner and garfield turn on each other like rats the best part of the american film br br so which is the better film well a lot of this probably depends on you as for me the warner brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles but it packed a great ending and the italian film was much much more realistic until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed so neither film is exactly great but i'd give my nod to the italian one being a bit better it's too bad they couldn't have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film
<START> i made the big mistake of actually watching this whole movie a few nights ago god i'm still trying to recover this movie does not even deserve a 1 4 average imdb needs to have 0 vote ratings possible for movies that really deserve it like this one a 1 4 is too high br br i had heard how awful this movie was but i really did not think a movie could actually be that bad especially in this day and era i figured all of the cheesy god awful movies were only from the 1950s and 1960s my god was i wrong trust me folks this movie really is that bad it is beyond horrible it is beyond pathetic it is beyond any type of word that i can think of for it battlefield earth looks like best picture of the year compared to this movie snake island which up until now was the worst movie i'd ever seen looks like it deserves a few oscars compared to this pathetic effort br br i seriously can not believe that the makers of this movie thought this was a legitimate serious effort of producing a hollywood movie this has no business being called a movie in the first 25 seconds of the film i seriously thought i was watching some high school theater class attempting to make a short movie or better yet i thought it was some saturday night live ripoff skit of the real thing i mean it looks exactly like that the acting is horrible the whole movie almost looks like it was shot with a 20 year old vhs video camera the special effects well good lord <UNK> from back in the day had better special effects than this movie the scene where he gets shot at the door is beyond laughable and beyond cheesy i mean seriously my intro to acting class from 4 years ago in college all of us could have put together a better movie than this and the worst part of the entire movie where arthur is naked in the bathroom oh my god i almost <UNK> up right there i have a strong stomach but wow that was horrible some people should never be naked and he's one of them the plot of this movie just seems to go absolutely nowhere they talk about legal issues that we never hear about again ben talks about getting into music that we never hear about again arthur says he is looking for a job and money for college and the next thing we see is he's running a porn shop everything about the movie is just horrible br br this really doesn't have much to do with my critique but just so everyone knows i am not a gay man i do however support gay rights and believe we should all be treated as equals and i would support any gay person in my church unlike the cruel priest in this movie who by the way seems to <UNK> every other word where is the f ing white out <UNK> but i didn't want anyone to think i hated this movie just because of it being about two gay guys it has nothing to do with that this would have been just as horrible of a movie if it was ben jill instead of ben arthur br br i just watched this movie to see if it really was as bad as they say and yes it was even worse than i had read let this be a warning to everyone only watch this movie if you want to just sit back and laugh at how pathetic some movies in the 21st century can still be if you watch this movie and are actually expecting a good movie or some entertainment i have no sympathy for you whatsoever br br on a final thought how in the world are there 7 movies <UNK> below this on imdb there is no way there are 7 movies out there that are worse than this
<START> john <UNK> 1977 film opening night is what critics usually call the work of such a significant artist <UNK> it is an excellent film in its own right and one of the best <UNK> of a <UNK> crisis ever put to film it's not a perfect film in that at two hours and twenty four minutes it's about a half hour too long and there's a bit too much emphasis on the <UNK> of the lead character myrtle gordon played by gena rowlands the wife of cassavetes long after we've gotten the point but only woody allen's masterpiece another woman which also starred rowlands eleven years later is a better portrait of the internal conflicts of an aging woman yet rowlands did win the best actress award at the berlin film festival for this portrayal and it was well deserved often this film written by cassavetes is easily compared to his earlier and inferior film a woman under the influence but it's a <UNK> comparison <UNK> character in that film is severely mentally disturbed from the start as well as coming from a blue collar background while her characters in this film and in allen's film are both artists who are haunted by <UNK> in this film it's the ghost of a dead young woman who can be seen as <UNK> younger <UNK> while in allen's film it's her character's own <UNK> many critics have taken this film to be a portrait of an alcoholic seeing myrtle surround herself with <UNK> such as a stage manager who tells her during opening night <UNK> seen a lot of <UNK> in my time but i've never seen anyone as drunk as you who could stand up you're great ' but this is wrong for alcohol isn't her problem nor is her chain smoking they are merely <UNK> from whatever thing is really compelling her to her own destruction and much to <UNK> credit as a <UNK> he never lets us find out exactly what's wrong with myrtle and despite her coming through in the end there's no reason to expect that she has really resolved anything of consequence this sort of end without resolution <UNK> cassavetes directly with the more daring european directors of the recent past who were comfortable in not revealing everything to an audience and forcing their viewers to <UNK> even if it hurts br br yet the film <UNK> perfectly the effect of a drunk or fever <UNK> out of the fog and as such the viewer again is <UNK> involved in its drama whether or not myrtle gordon does recover after the film's universe <UNK> about her is left for each and every viewer to decide and as we have seen before that <UNK> <UNK> one's choices do matter
<START> ever since seeing this film as a child over 30 years ago i never tire of watching it from the opening scenes in the horn factory to the car <UNK> running from the back seat of the car to ollie answering the phone and being accidentally pushed out the window by stan i think this was perhaps their best latter day film after this they moved to 20th century fox and while those films weren't terrible they lacked the comic timing of this movie jimmy <UNK> their long time foil in his last appearance with the boys showing up as the doctor is super quote i said goat milk his <UNK> to stan asking him how do you milk a ghost charlie hall and even ben <UNK> show up i'd say all in all one of my favorite l h comedies
<START> if you're a <UNK> interested in quantum theory and string theory read the elegant universe by brian greene of columbia university and the universe in a nutshell by stephen <UNK> of <UNK> br br recipe for br br 3 parts <UNK> new age <UNK> 2 parts <UNK> 2 parts real scientist br br mix together until ingredients are <UNK> from each other and spread on celluloid thin enough that there is no discernible substance br br serving suggestion <UNK> <UNK>
<START> nicole <UNK> was listed as the star of this despite micheal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> being much bigger stars than her br br basically this is a bit of a spin on the alien lands on earth film <UNK> plays the girl who feels sorry for an alien being chased by the military and takes in the runaway creature in her very sexy disguise a bit of nudity and partial nudity a pointless sex scene all feature along the way br br the film stumbles through a few obvious set pieces and running jokes about being shown photographs i quite liked the star trek jokes when micheal <UNK> had been taken over and he got a really cool death scene br br it was fairly obvious that <UNK> <UNK> was going to be taken over and the film had quite a weak ending it would have been nice to show exactly what kind of talent the alien passed to <UNK>
<START> this tiresome plodding las vegas casino heist movie in almost impossible to watch and get involved in it's something you <UNK> <UNK> if you have absolutely nothing else better to do the only two decent things in this movie are both attached to gorgeous stella stevens and one spends the entire program hoping she'll fall out of one of those skimpy tops she wears many great shots of mid 70s las vegas when it was still a cool place to visit and the fashions of the day are good for a giggle as well otherwise one big yawn the <UNK> dvd has a very good widescreen transfer but even at under 10 bucks it still ain't worth it in my humble opinion
<START> as a <UNK> i can't say i like this film fact is i down right hate it i tried to watch it as open minded as possible but when it gets down to it it feels rather insulting to my social group br br to me there are several reasons why br br 1 the characters seem unnatural i've met lots of players of all different walks of life i don't know any who act like any of the characters in the film it's like the producers of the film have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all into 5 people most <UNK> are rather social people some with rather active lives br br 2 the style doesn't work the <UNK> style is ill suited to the subject matter of the film an actual documentary on <UNK> would actually work better while it is good looking i e <UNK> put together it isn't very good br br 3 the dialogue feels forced unnatural it also seems to lack any real world context <UNK> swear i'll admit that but we don't have <UNK> syndrome br br 4 the humor is lacking while self <UNK> humor is a <UNK> of my group and several other groups i've encountered this is less self <UNK> and more like toilet humor likewise a large part of <UNK> humor is full of in jokes and <UNK> not toilet humor most <UNK> would <UNK> at and <UNK> anybody who made such jokes br br 5 the biggest problem to me is basically this accuracy i don't mean rules but instead dynamics <UNK> this film is going to be compared to the even lower budget films the <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> rising both of which portray the players as actual people playing an actual game the difference is <UNK> the movie presents a situation where you want to beat the players senseless vs the <UNK> where you can say something like huh i know a guy like that yep that's definitely like gary
<START> any movie that shows federal pigs persons in government to be the power mad <UNK> they are in real life has a lot to recommend it to me br br alas the script <UNK> and editing and even at times the directing are flawed so there will be people who will <UNK> the whole movie and ignore the good moments br br i saw the original way back when it was new and hated it <UNK> it <UNK> it thought it was a terrible irrational piece of junk br br now though i don't remember why br br i believe the two should not be compared or even connected br br consider them as two different movies br br rate them as two different movies br br this <UNK> point provides a <UNK> place a <UNK> for people who want to encourage <UNK> who believe in human rights who recognize the threat to freedom government can be and is especially the federal government br br the voice wears a cap bearing the state <UNK> of new <UNK> live free or die at one time it would have been the <UNK> of most americans br br despite its obvious flaws <UNK> point is a film to cheer
<START> a low budget effort from texas that's at least filmed well but that is little <UNK> bad acting or should i say bad over acting a pretty limp story line that's nothing new bad special effects bad bad bad seems like a bunch of young folks are putting together a haunted house for halloween which is done every year but this year things are different has a long extended lesbian theme that is not only annoying but definitely fills out the empty spots of which there are a lot <UNK> <UNK> definitely <UNK> at all costs
<START> utterly <UNK> strange watch for the kinky moment of a drop dead gorgeous blonde acting as pull string doll for some rich folks pointless but undoubtedly compelling late night feature this unhinged french production is a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> ideas and random plot <UNK> <UNK> on its very charismatic stars if somewhat anti heroes <UNK> <UNK> and charles bronson really they don't get to do all that much especially during the confined lengthy mid section where they hide themselves in a building during the christmas break to crack a safe with 10 000 possible <UNK> oh fun but this is when the odd if intriguing relationship is formed between <UNK> and <UNK> characters after a manipulative battle of <UNK> and <UNK> sly games against each other the two come to an understanding that sees them honour each other's involvement and have a mutual respect this would go on to play a further part in the <UNK> second half of the story with that <UNK> <UNK> ball still their encounters early on suggest there's more but what we get is vague and this is <UNK> by that <UNK> just happen there ' ending that might just make you jump <UNK> glad to get that out of the system br br the pacing is terribly slow but <UNK> <UNK> for it and this seems <UNK> done to <UNK> with its edgy nervous <UNK> tension watch as the same process is repeated over and over again and you know something is not quite right and the scheming eventually comes into play now everything that does happen feels too spontaneous but the climax payoff is haunting the taut complex script is probably a little too <UNK> for its own good but there are some neat <UNK> <UNK> glass and <UNK> try not <UNK> and visual <UNK> jean <UNK> direction is <UNK> sophisticated and low key but get a tad artificial and <UNK> an <UNK> icy atmosphere the sound fx features more as a potent note than that of <UNK> <UNK> funky score that's mainly kept under wrapped after its <UNK> opening top <UNK> <UNK> who's quite <UNK> and bronson a <UNK> turn are solid and work off each tremendously bernard <UNK> <UNK> up the attitude as the inspector who knows there's more going on than what is being led on an attractive female cast features able support by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> georges <UNK> br br a <UNK> <UNK> but polished crime drama <UNK> by its two leads and some bizarre <UNK>
<START> as an adult i really did enjoy this one i watched it with my 2 <UNK> and the 3 1 2 year old was fascinated and the 15 month old <UNK> at the mice br br the music is fun and the animation is wonderful this sequel does what return to <UNK> didn't accomplish a good follow up to the cinderella story but what becomes of <UNK> another sequel i hope so
<START> this movie is a loose collection of <UNK> <UNK> and ill conceived plot devices br br movie history the director of this film was a <UNK> who drove around town filming random women when his wife discovered the film <UNK> he was forced to quickly <UNK> a story he claimed he was making a movie called the brain that wouldn't die eventually his wife <UNK> that he show her his so called movie that night he quickly filmed some extra scenes with a friend and the brain that wouldn't die was born br br i hate this movie plot synopsis the main character's fiancé is killed in a horrible car accident that he caused by ignoring the clearly posted road signs he grabs her head from the <UNK> and <UNK> it after <UNK> the head he goes and picks up a bunch of <UNK> that is pretty much what happens for the rest of the movie at the end he fights and is killed by a monster that lives in the closet the monster appears with little to no explanation however the monster saves a hooker and i assume that they live happily ever after br br side notes the end credit screen claims that the movie is called the head that wouldn't die br br i hate this movie
<START> <UNK> example of an <UNK> movie br br although one can watch this movie over and over again and laugh every single time and still see something new in it it's still regarded as just another funny picture and although the movie has inspired many and added it's quotes and images to the <UNK> of all it's viewers moon over <UNK> still hasn't received the acclaim it should even the brilliant cast with academy award winner richard dreyfuss and <UNK> julia to mention one is not able to change this perception br br but after watching <UNK> julia as <UNK> <UNK> make richard <UNK> an offer he can't refuse in a <UNK> by reading him a good review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion this stuff is timeless in fifty years we will have the proof
<START> as a <UNK> i must say this movie has little if any <UNK> significance it's a fun witchcraft movie and not meant to teach us anything except that love is the strongest <UNK> of all and never to use it in a controlling or vengeful way that's a lesson everyone needs to learn not just <UNK> br br that having been said this movie is wonderfully written and <UNK> executed by kim novak and the <UNK> jimmy stewart br br <UNK> <UNK> delivers a stellar performance as <UNK> elsa <UNK> with too many movie credits to mention except as ms jane <UNK> of murder by death was wonderful as ms <UNK> absent minded yet capable upstairs neighbor <UNK> also starring jack lemmon wonderful performance and jim <UNK> brilliantly witty br br witches can't cry why they can't shed a single tear because their heart is full of <UNK> they don't have time for silly things such as love <UNK> br br gillian <UNK> novak and her brother <UNK> jack lemmon are manhattan witches <UNK> deeply within the secret underworld of those of the craft they live among other new <UNK> as one of them without so much as causing a raised <UNK> br br but then along comes shepherd <UNK> henderson stewart a <UNK> no nonsense dedicated businessman who is engaged to be married to <UNK> old college rival br br by a quirky <UNK> of chance he finds himself moving into <UNK> building and is instantly <UNK> by her charm and grace by the use of <UNK> with a little help from <UNK> <UNK> familiar trained by robert e blair and <UNK> gillian begins to work on this handsome new dream man to get back at her old enemy br br but <UNK> should never be used to control nor to hurt and gillian learns that the hard way in the most bittersweet way not only does she have to face what she's done but she has to face <UNK> in her guilt br br from the critical perspective however the movie takes a serious turn the effects are very dated to the point of being pure camp some of the scenery was seemingly shot in the basement of someone's small home but at least the characters were quirky and fun br br on a personal note <UNK> steals the show great cat great training by robert e blair br br as a note of trivia this is the roots for the beloved <UNK> television sitcom this introduces the original samantha and <UNK> all the characters of note are present and <UNK> for you have but to look to see it for yourself br br this is one of my favorites and i watch it often br br this movie gets a 9 1 10 from br br the fiend
<START> let's hope this is the final nightmare this is the epitome of a good thing gone bad okay there is still some enjoyment to be had but only in the most mundane sense rachel <UNK> had been there for the duration of this franchise had been on the production staff and produced even i don't know what she was thinking but this <UNK> comes complete with the human video game boy and a guest appearance by br br tom and <UNK> arnold i wish i had a clue what she was thinking when she wrote directed this disappointing piece of garbage she even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than an over <UNK> popcorn movie instead of bearing any resemblance to horror with the contrived use of a 3d ending aren't those glasses nifty and you get to keep them it's the equivalent of you just spent 9 00 making me rich here's 10 cents now don't you feel special sorry but for me it just did not make me feel special br br and freddy's had yet another face lift this one was for the worst i think all the beautiful artistry that went into his look in the earlier films has been replaced by an obviously cheaper less detailed set of <UNK> he looks less like the burn victim he is supposed to be and more like he has a skin disorder changing the <UNK> makeup like that so far into a series is about on the same level as changing the lead actor but wait they've done that and done that so i guess it doesn't matter but it <UNK> to me freddy is no longer scary he's just another low rent monster like the <UNK> br br it's more a dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises <UNK> with what you can only hope the writers thought were witty one liners and clever <UNK> sadly it fell short on both accounts br br so there's nothing more to say than grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh because there was not one scary or suspenseful moment in this entire film br br it rates a 3 2 10 from br br the fiend
<START> right away this film was ridiculous not that it didn't have redeeming <UNK> for example the best thing about this film was the beautiful background scenery anyone not living on the east coast should know the south doesn't have beautiful mountains like those found in the west i knew it was <UNK> right off the bat but perhaps dalton couldn't <UNK> his english accent so they had to excuse it by saying this was a southern town <UNK> his accent into a southern one was easier sure the film has plot twists but its phony sense of place was something i couldn't get past it's not like <UNK> doesn't have <UNK> <UNK> so why the writers thought it necessary to pretend it was in the south is beyond me br br one other thing in action pictures always <UNK> me why do they always make the <UNK> sound effect when the character pulls out an automatic <UNK> it seemed every other sound effect in this movie was a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> was loaded and ready to fire of course the weapons already had rounds <UNK> so this was unnecessary br br lastly the <UNK> were way over the top but hey this film was targeted to a certain <UNK> <UNK> i suppose it's too bad each of the actors can act but this film was lame
<START> <UNK> coward a witty and <UNK> man was friends with louis <UNK> mr coward a long time admirer of all things naval was <UNK> to write a story loosely based on the loss of <UNK> ship in a <UNK> british way it was considered that a film about the royal navy losing an encounter at sea would be good propaganda it was also considered a good idea to have mr coward play the part of the <UNK> captain <UNK> the many qualities needed to command a fighting ship the ability to speak in a very <UNK> voice and sing sophisticated point songs does not come very high up the list at <UNK> house or at least one would hope not a captain must earn and retain the respect of the <UNK> and the lower deck alike mr coward might have had the respect of the gentlemen of the chorus at <UNK> lane and <UNK> <UNK> might have been terrified of him but his ability to tame <UNK> and direct a <UNK> crew in wartime must be brought into question he <UNK> himself <UNK> around the bridge <UNK> the other ranks and <UNK> orders at the officers he only needed a <UNK> dressing <UNK> and a cigarette <UNK> to seem right at home much is made of the <UNK> as a <UNK> of british society theme and the crew largely <UNK> of the usual <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc without whom no war can be fought they spend most of their time on board smoking <UNK> about lord <UNK> <UNK> and getting blown up never mind there's plenty more where they came from once <UNK> they go straight to the pub where they spend most of their time smoking <UNK> about lord <UNK> <UNK> and getting blown up by contrast mr coward lives in a dream <UNK> with a rose covered door somewhere very quiet with very little chance of getting blown up he his lady wife and their two <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> convoluted tones and said lady wife spends much of her time <UNK> things for the poor <UNK> who <UNK> his crew and who she refers to by their <UNK> that nice young master johnny mills has a prominent role as a completely unbelievable lower deck type who <UNK> mr coward in much the same way as a <UNK> dog will worship its master he marries his girlfriend after kissing her on the cheek presumably on the grounds that she might be pregnant after such <UNK> passion so yes we do have a <UNK> of british society here but perhaps not in the way the makers of in which we serve intended at the end mr coward gets one last chance to <UNK> his men as the few survivors <UNK> past him goodbye <UNK> it was a <UNK> to <UNK> with you he <UNK> as if he was <UNK> how now brown cow it may have been david <UNK> feature debut but the hand of <UNK> coward <UNK> large right across this picture he was a funny and clever man better suited to writing <UNK> plays about poor little rich girls and boys interspersed with the occasional <UNK> song he had a talent to <UNK> no doubt but he could neither write nor speak convincing dialogue being <UNK> coward was a full time job he had no time to be a real person
<START> when the chamberlain family is camping near <UNK> rock australia lindy chamberlain meryl streep sees her baby being dragged out of their <UNK> by a <UNK> and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience for it seems like the <UNK> story is not believed by the public or the press and the whole thing turns into a circus lindy doesn't help matters either because she won't play to the jury or courtroom she's only herself and she's a tough nut to crack so of course everyone thinks she's guilty because there's a piece of evidence that hasn't come to light sam <UNK> is excellent as michael chamberlain a seventh day <UNK> <UNK> who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife it's good or bad to see that people are just as <UNK> and stupid elsewhere as they are in the states too because the australian public doesn't believe the story and the media only fans the flames eventually lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor but years later a missing piece of evidence shows up and she's freed but not until after the family's life is basically ruined a heart breaking story very well done a bit long but well worth seeing 8 out of 10
<START> in what is a truly diverse cast this show hits it's <UNK> on fox it is the kind of sitcom that grows on you if you just watch 1 show you might not like it much but once you watch two or three you get hooked br br this is because some of the jokes hit some miss depending upon how you view them as is usual today the themes are very mature the humor is usually very mature too often the most funny parts are the parts where the mature themes <UNK> with the innocent ones br br red <UNK> smith a veteran actor does some very good deadpan type of humor on this show debra jo <UNK> plays well in this ensemble cast too danny masterson the oldest actor of the kids is very good too laura <UNK> donna looks better in the earlier shows as a natural <UNK> who got the idea of making her a blonde she shows very good talent comedic timing often she looks good without make up too br br this is one of the better entries on fox in the sitcom department it's most successful live action one since married with children

<START> <UNK> green <UNK> <UNK> is a performance artist for wealthy <UNK> at a local club she falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic <UNK> turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon it's quite possible that through a form of hypnotic suggestion someone a possible task master pulling her strings like a puppet is <UNK> <UNK> into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that love making is about to begin after the murders within her fantasies are committed <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> often clueless as to if what she was <UNK> to within her dreams ever took place in reality br br if someone asked me how to describe this particular work from franco i'd say it's elegant difficult by now you've probably read other user comments <UNK> by what this film is about since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by godard early in his career as far as film making style and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience and as you read from the reaction of the user comments here some like this decision others find the style <UNK> dull and <UNK> i'll be the first to admit that the film is over my head but even franco himself when <UNK> by critics who watched <UNK> admitted that he didn't even understand the film and he directed it some might say that <UNK> was merely a <UNK> to his more admired work <UNK> in <UNK> considered his <UNK> by franco faithful because it also <UNK> the surreal <UNK> structure where the protagonist doesn't truly know whether he she is experiencing something real or imagined in a sense like the protagonist we are experiencing the same type of confusion certainly <UNK> is unconventional film making where we aren't given the keys to what is exactly going on and a great deal of the <UNK> dialogue doesn't help matters <UNK> is also populated by <UNK> types and poet speak <UNK> film a bucket of blood <UNK> fun at my personal favorite scene <UNK> at a possible lesbian <UNK> between <UNK> and a woman she meets at a posh party quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where <UNK> are used rather unusually great locations and jazz score i liked this film myself although i can understand why it does receive a negative reaction loved that one scene at the posh party with <UNK> a wee bit drunk <UNK> on the floor in a gorgeous evening <UNK> as others attending the <UNK> equally wasted rush her in an embrace of kisses
<START> i was born in 1982 most of my childhood memories are in the extreme late 80's and 90's i watched the groove tube for the first time in 2001 when i was 19 br br and i found it hilarious br br so for anybody who thinks that something dated can't be quite funny 30 years later think again it's funny even if you have no idea what the 70's were like and the thought of bell bottom pants make you cringe who can argue with a <UNK> the clown type who reads adult literature there is plenty to laugh at the <UNK> puppet show at the end is the best
<START> even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment of the 1960s ok so katie didn't join the <UNK> family and nobody died at <UNK> this movie was still unbelievably awful i got the impression that the writers just locked themselves in a room and watched forrest <UNK> the wonder years and oliver <UNK> 60s films over and over again and called it research a canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode head spinning he was right
<START> although i had some hopes for this film particularly since i enjoy the acting of jason <UNK> freaks <UNK> <UNK> so much i must say it was one of the worst films i've seen in recent memory loser and dr t and the women are also on that list br br yes there were a couple of laugh out loud moments although the movie could have been so much better the premise was not bad <UNK> artists cheating their way through college meet their match when they're discovered by someone with a <UNK> for them the problem is that the characters were all so unlikable that i didn't care about any of them the <UNK> played by talented jason <UNK> was such a psychopath that it wasn't that funny to watch him he wasn't deranged in a particularly funny or charming way he was just a crazy loser who was actually rather dangerous and not fun to watch the editing of the movie was hard to follow it kept cutting between fantasy and reality and it was often unclear which was which only two or three of the <UNK> <UNK> were really shown you just had to take it on faith that they were indeed <UNK> artists showing their schemes would have made for a better movie the so called love story was absurd and unbelievable in fact it was silly and poorly written and directed throughout i could go on about the movie's shortcomings but you get the idea not worth the 4 rental or the gas it takes to drive to and from the movie store to rent
<START> this isn't another <UNK> look at the holocaust but rather an intimate story about the events that took place on a small street in berlin and some of the people that were involved this film starts in the present time in new york city where ruth <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is in mourning over the death of her husband and family members have all gathered to her side <UNK> daughter hannah maria <UNK> slowly learns that her mother was raised by an <UNK> woman named lena <UNK> doris <UNK> and so she travels to germany and <UNK> the 90 year old who tells her about the events on rosenstrasse br br spoiler alert br br lena talks about berlin in 1943 where the <UNK> would hold all the jewish <UNK> in a building on rosenstrasse street even though they are supposed to have <UNK> for being married to <UNK> and for nine days a group of women would wait outside and shout for their release eight year old ruth <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for her mother to come out and has nowhere to go but she meets 33 year old lena <UNK> <UNK> who takes her in <UNK> husband <UNK> martin <UNK> is also inside and eventually she tries to <UNK> with nazi officers to get them to do something br br this film is directed by <UNK> von <UNK> who is making her first feature film in almost 10 years after working in television and while this is clearly not one of her more provocative efforts she remains one of the most <UNK> directors in europe this is not one of those nazi films where we view horrible acts of <UNK> to jews although we do see some severe treatment being <UNK> out but instead this is more of a retelling of a small event that meant life and death to the people involved this film isn't trying to shock anyone or open the door to <UNK> on the circumstances but what it simply wants to do is just shed a light on a small but true life event that occurred during an historical period part of the films strength comes from its actors and there are some good performances that shine through especially by <UNK> and young <UNK> and it's always good to see <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a pivotal role this isn't a great film or something that's going to change your perspective on wwii but considering that innocent lives were put to death because of the events that took place i think that reason alone is important enough to <UNK> this true story
<START> as an aging rocker this movie mentions <UNK> and <UNK> my 2 favourite bands ever but with the incredible cast everyone and the fantastic storyline i just love this piece of creative genius i cannot recommend it more highly and mick jones added so much <UNK> lead and primary <UNK> along with the greatest rock singer ever lou <UNK> i have watched this great work more than 10 times bill <UNK> what a voice and jimmy nail talent <UNK> from every <UNK> then <UNK> and karen what more could an aging rocker ask for 10 10 bloody brilliant br br <UNK> <UNK> western oz originally from <UNK> england

<START> this movie is very underrated it's highly imaginative creative and clever it's just plain fun and in my opinion this film tops the first one but the film was forgotten when it first came out and became even more overlooked as the years passed bill ted's bogus journey also bombed at the box office whereas the first one was a pretty good hit and very popular br br i think the problem may be that this film was just released a couple years too late in 1991 bill and ted already seemed so '80s even though the '80s were only a couple years ago back at that time the landscape of the music and style for kids had changed so <UNK> with <UNK> rap hip hop pearl jam <UNK> <UNK> and the seattle sound bill and ted with their <UNK> <UNK> van <UNK> and guns <UNK> <UNK> music along with their '80s style seemed so out of place and very outdated in <UNK> and i think that's one big reason the film bombed at the box office nobody but surfers were still saying stuff like excellent and bogus in 1991 <UNK> 2 which also came out in the early <UNK> suffered a similar fate of being a good film that bombed at the box office because it was too associated with the '80s the transition from the '80s to the <UNK> was a much faster change then now with the <UNK> and <UNK> 1991 was nothing like 1988 or 1989 whereas right now 2002 and last year 2001 still looks looked like 1995 or 1996 br br if only excellent adventure which was made in 1988 was released that year instead of 1989 and bogus journey was made quickly and released in 1989 then it too would have probably been just as wildly received as the first
<START> i thought this would be a sequel to the original <UNK> chamber of shaolin but actually it's more of a light hearted sister to the original gordon liu still stars as a would be hero on a quest to learn kung fu to defeat those <UNK> <UNK> but this time around it's lighter and more comedic the film <UNK> around the local <UNK> mill where <UNK> are cut due to the hiring of 10 new <UNK> bosses liu plays <UNK> who is able to fool the mill bosses into thinking he is a shaolin monk <UNK> almost magical kung fu skill but his luck runs out he is exposed as a fraud and he promises the mill workers that he will go to the shaolin monastery to learn kung fu and return to protect them br br the comedy really begins at the monastery where <UNK> makes several <UNK> attempts to get accepted this sets up lots of really funny moments and lots of great fight choreography continuing in the <UNK> chamber tradition we see all kinds of neat and interesting and <UNK> hokey training methods at the monastery as well as creative uses of wooden <UNK> as weapons br br also unique and of note is the <UNK> of kung fu and the craft of <UNK> <UNK> building <UNK> is not accepted as a student at shaolin but is made to build <UNK> <UNK> for the 10 year <UNK> of the monastery on the dvd i bought there is a special on <UNK> <UNK> building and the inspiration that director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> drew from it this is a craft many hundreds perhaps thousands of years old and in hong kong <UNK> is still built of <UNK> even on large high rises though the west exclusively uses steel <UNK> and <UNK> as a result of his <UNK> work <UNK> develops a special style of kung fu when asked what kind it is he hilariously replies <UNK> kung fu which he first <UNK> during a dust up with the <UNK> <UNK> in the final confrontation with the <UNK> there is a dazzling array of creative uses for <UNK> <UNK> and ties br br from a comedy perspective i think it's one of the best of the kung fu genre as a kung fu film in general it also stands out i recommend it to anyone
<START> <UNK> <UNK> was actually the far more accomplished <UNK> of course she <UNK> the english channel both directions she <UNK> from <UNK> island to the california coast marilyn <UNK> is a sweet story but the usual <UNK> of us <UNK> in the face of a superior world another <UNK> of our <UNK> complex our political system works pretty well and the health system allows people not to die in hospital <UNK> that's pretty good better than <UNK> what should we do about hockey though and <UNK> the notion of calling this a sport of its inclusion in the <UNK> ah but we <UNK>
<START> a lot is dated in this episode just like most twilight zone episodes such as the woman's incredibly sexist military uniform and some things are so unbelievable like the easy <UNK> of clean water still consider the year this was made and the time and you quickly understand why this episode is so special as you watch it has a nice sense of hope something missing from a lot of twilight <UNK> as well as an interesting female character despite the fact that she rarely speaks something else rare on the twilight zone two is a great example of how the twilight zone in just over 20 minutes could pack more emotion and drama than most two hours movies today and it's great to see two people who became american icons so early in their careers
<START> if you haven't seen zombie bloodbath you haven't a contest like <UNK> your own horror movie in one <UNK> could not possibly come up with a entry than this outrage of an insult on any viewer's intelligence mr sheets forgot a story a plot proper dialog the fact that people need some basic acting talents and the credited lighting designer obviously forgot to show up it seems to be recorded on the <UNK> of <UNK> and copied on even worse equipment make up effect consist of black <UNK> for the zombies and <UNK> being <UNK> over people's heads in order to <UNK> their skin melting this is nothing more than a home movie and a really bad one as well only fun to watch for the friends <UNK> and <UNK> that were willing to show up for the filming i cannot for the life of me understand why this mockery of a product is listed in any serious film magazine or website i have home movies of wedding parties that are way better and more interesting a total waste of time money and energy the sequel zombie bloodbath ii is just more of the same rubbish
<START> one must admit that <UNK> has an eye for beauty and talent he gave a break to <UNK> <UNK> a successful model and also former winner of beauty <UNK> title by casting her in a role which was <UNK> made for her debut her <UNK> stoned look and her <UNK> at the <UNK> music made her an instant darling of the viewers this movie is a treat to the eyes with it's <UNK> locales ethnic people those <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> naughty <UNK> who looks quite attractive in her ethnic wear and dancing skills <UNK> is of course adorable and this is one of his <UNK> successful performance <UNK> <UNK> manages to keep the interest going with it's carefully written script editing and captivating music like des <UNK> his another movie <UNK> has handled the topic of youngsters falling in the habit of drug addiction and the theory of them coming from disturbed families and troubled childhood is quite plausible a good entertainer this movie <UNK> it's <UNK> till date
<START> buddy is an entertaining family film set in a time when <UNK> animals and making them cute was an accepted way to get people to be interested in them br br based on a true story buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other and that they will do anything for each other br br while not a perfect movie the animated gorilla is quite <UNK> most of the time and the mayhem that occurs within the home is usually amusing for children br br this film misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets but does show the difficulties br br a recommended film which was the first for jim <UNK> productions
<START> this film was made in 1943 when i think judy was at her peak looks wise in her previous film for me and my gal people often say that she looks <UNK> well in this film she looks perfect she is beautiful and shows that she has a flair for comedy br br i think this film is hilarious especially at the beginning when she is trying to <UNK> an audition with john <UNK> one of the funniest <UNK> in my opinion is <UNK> rendition of lady <UNK> and when john is looking for her at the party to give her a <UNK> lol br br one criticism i do have is that there is a hole in the plot when john and lily fall in love i mean one minute he <UNK> her and the next they are going out on a date then the next time they meet after that date they are in love br br another point i didn't like was on opening night if i were lily i would be furious with john but she isn't it just doesn't make sense br br but all in all i would have to give this film a 10 because it is just wonderful and almost perfect
<START> this movie was extremely boring it should least not more than 15 minutes the images of child and animal being killed were little bit disturbing br br usually i don't write comments but this one was so bad having so many good and excellent comments i think in this case we are one step closer to honest <UNK> of this title br br what more can i say i fall asleep during this movie 3 times it was about 4 hours after i had <UNK> up from 8 hours long sleeping period i think it is the point itself br br there is no dialog between characters except maybe 2 sentences at the very end br br when you fall asleep once watching it do not try to <UNK> and catch up because you will fall asleep again
<START> what a dreadful movie for some reason scientific <UNK> and <UNK> always have a staff of <UNK> dirty mean spirited <UNK> living inside these folks who presumably work together on complicated scientific projects cannot seem to agree on how to survive death at the hands of a cgi dragon spoilers an extra nasty scientist whose main acting skill is <UNK> and the sinister stare has <UNK> a dragon while the lab was supposed to work on this kind of thing the other scientists are shocked because apparently they were all way behind in their experiments and got caught with their pants down the rest of the story is like the thing or ten little indians where the staff is hunted and killed off as they try to <UNK> a way to escape and or defeat the dragon the cgi dragon creature is dark gray which seems to be the popular color for most of the cheap cgi special effects it hardly looks better than a cartoon and the dark gray tones make it difficult to see any interesting details in the body of the dragon all it looks like is a gray blob the acting is less than horrible these scientists act like a bunch of children who cannot agree on anything and this makes it easier for the dragon to kill them off in various attempts to escape hide etc dean cain is hardly better than any of the cast of unknown actors in this movie he seems to sink to the level of his supporting cast this movie is really really atrocious the acting is bad the story is dumb the cgi is very very cheap and amateurish there is nothing commendable about this movie it is not even a good time killer to glance at while doing <UNK> or other work
<START> i rented this film in dvd form without knowing anything at all about it part of a winter marathon of watching a film every night after several awful american action adventure films <UNK> <UNK> cradle of life <UNK> warriors struck me as brilliantly original filmmaking the story is complete nonsense but i found the film's sincerity good <UNK> and complete lack of irony refreshing and the film looks spectacular sure the special effects are not technically as flawless as those produced by hollywood but the filmmakers wisely are more interested in color composition and movement than realism and so many of the shots are breathtaking in one shot two of the <UNK> characters stand on <UNK> <UNK> of rock a huge moon rising before them the image perfectly balanced by the three elements in another a princess warrior <UNK> through the heavens behind her glowing sword like a heat seeking missile and the colors explode from shot to shot used to express emotion rather than to represent reality br br the characters have the same simplicity and <UNK> of comic book characters offering no great depth in themselves but referring to <UNK> that <UNK> more deeply physically several of the actors are astonishingly beautiful they play their roles straight up without irony or <UNK> and so are believable br br most strange of all despite the <UNK> of plot and thin characterizations i found myself very near tears at the end moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original good hearted vision of the director br br
<START> i didn't expect val kilmer to make a convincing john holmes but i found myself forgetting that it wasn't the porn legend himself in fact the entire cast turned in amazing performances in this vastly under rated movie br br as some have mentioned earlier seek out the two disc set and watch the <UNK> documentary first it will give you a lot of background on the story which will be helpful in <UNK> the movie br br some people seem unhappy about the <UNK> crime scene video being included on the dvd there are a number of reasons that it might have been included one of which is that john <UNK> trial for the murders was the first ever in the united states where such footage was used by the <UNK> if you don't want to see it it's easy to avoid it's clearly identified as <UNK> crime scene footage on the menu
<START> great acting on the part of gretchen mol this film is one of the best <UNK> to hit the screen in some time while it does cover the majority of <UNK> young life it also manages to stay on a mostly focused path which is something most <UNK> films seem to lack there is some lovely and <UNK> funny subtext in the dialogue and acting this film is an excellent break from the <UNK> of american psycho and i think this will show through as her best work to date oh and as a cinematography buff i give this film 100 in the <UNK> <UNK> it was amazing how well they pulled off a 50s look with modern film <UNK> <UNK> to the d o p all around very enjoyable i recommend any interested to see it 8 10
<START> as serials go <UNK> fighting legion is one of the best action serials of the 1930s made in a period when the studios could still field a large cast this one has wall to wall action throughout its 12 chapters br br in <UNK> the president of the newly formed republic of mexico <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> young is trying to put his new country on a solid financial <UNK> to that end he has arranged to have rich gold <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> from the local san <UNK> mine br br members of the local <UNK> plot to steal the <UNK> on behalf of don del <UNK> a gold <UNK> god who with the aid of the local <UNK> tribe hopes to <UNK> himself as the <UNK> of mexico <UNK> him is don francisco guy <UNK> who forms a legion of locals to aid <UNK> when don <UNK> is murdered by don del <UNK> men a stranger the <UNK> don diego reed hadley arrives in town diego aka zorro takes over the legion with the help of his friends <UNK> william <UNK> and juan <UNK> buster the token heroine of the piece is <UNK> sister <UNK> sheila <UNK> br br both diego and <UNK> hold seats on the local <UNK> <UNK> it soon becomes apparent that some of the other members of the <UNK> are in league with don del <UNK> first there is the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> the head of the <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> chief justice <UNK> c <UNK> shaw and <UNK> edmund <UNK> zorro suspects that one of these men is don del <UNK> but which one br br what follows are several hair raising escapes by zorro and his <UNK> from the followers of don del <UNK> we have the ever present <UNK> rope bridge the deep <UNK> between two <UNK> over which only zorro can jump to safety and the usual assortment of explosions fires and <UNK> and <UNK> crashing or going over the cliff hats off here to <UNK> fine team of stunt men lead by the legendary <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> bill and joe <UNK> performs his signature stunt jumping on a team of runaway horses and then falling beneath the coach which he repeated in other films including john ford's <UNK> the same year br br anyway zorro finally <UNK> the false god don del <UNK> and <UNK> peace to the valley before riding off into the sunset in chapter 12 br br others in the cast include jim pierce <UNK> <UNK> and charlie king as don del <UNK> hence men and if you look closely you may spot bits by future serial star and lone ranger <UNK> moore and <UNK> <UNK> in bits big jim pierce by the way may be best remembered for playing tarzan in <UNK> tarzan and the golden <UNK> <UNK> and for his marriage to joan <UNK> the daughter of tarzan creator edgar rice <UNK> br br thoroughly enjoyable
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a wonderful director when it comes to westerns and broken arrow remains in everybody's mind as far as melodrama is concerned he should leave that to knowing people like <UNK> <UNK> george <UNK> or the fabulous douglas sirk the screenplay is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while you are watching such a tepid <UNK> natalie wood 's character was inspired by <UNK> <UNK> imitation of life see <UNK> and sirk but who could believe she's a black man's daughter anyway susan <UNK> was more credible in imitation of life and sinatra and curtis are given so stereotyped parts that they cannot do anything with them the poor officer and the wealthy good looking and mean sergeant guess whom will natalie fall in love with france is shown as a land of tolerance where <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> welcome at the time circa 1944 it was dubious it still is for narrow minded people you can find here there and everywhere
<START> the concept of the legal gray area in love crimes contributes to about 10 of the movie's appeal the other 90 can be attributed to it's <UNK> bad <UNK> to say that sean <UNK> performance as a so called district attorney is wooden is a gross understatement with her bland suits and superfluous hair <UNK> young does a decent job at convincing the audience of her <UNK> hatred for men why else would she ask her only friend to pose as a prostitute just so she can arrest cops who try to pick up on them this hatred is also the only reason why she relentlessly <UNK> a perverted photographer who gives women a <UNK> thrill and the driving force behind this crappy movie watching young go from <UNK> to full frontal nudity does little to raise interest but the temper <UNK> she throws standing next to a fire by a lake does watching her rant and rave about her self loathing and sexual frustration makes love crimes worth the rental <UNK> but it's all downhill to and from there despite her urge to bring patrick <UNK> character to justice her <UNK> skills completely escape her in the <UNK> of her own tired lust and passion patrick <UNK> does a decent enough job as a slimy <UNK> if it worked in sleeping with the enemy it sure as hell can work in this but i can't help but wonder if the noticeable lack of energy young brings to the film conflicts with his <UNK> i'm guessing it does and the result is a thriller with thrills that are thoroughly bad and yet comedic
<START> in canadian director <UNK> <UNK> film adaptation of the margaret laurence novel the stone angel ellen <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> a proud and <UNK> woman approaching her nineties who wishes to remain independent until the very end <UNK> <UNK> to be placed in a <UNK> home by her well meaning son marvin filmed in <UNK> canada and set in the fictional town of <UNK> the stone angel is a straightforward and conventional interpretation of the book that has been required reading in canadian high school english classes for almost half a century br br the title of the film comes from the stone statue <UNK> on <UNK> mother's grave which serves as a metaphor for <UNK> inability to express emotion during her <UNK> lifetime <UNK> brings vulnerability and humor to the role but is a bit too likable to fully realize the ego driven self <UNK> character who managed to alienate her wealthy father her well meaning but alcoholic husband and both of her sons as she <UNK> the end of her days she reflects that pride was my wilderness and the demon that led me there was fear i was alone never anything else and never free for i carried my chains within me and they spread out from me and <UNK> all i touched br br confronting having to spend her last days in a <UNK> home <UNK> looks back at her life and looks at her failed relationships her <UNK> shown in flashbacks without voice over narration the story begins with a dance that she attended as a young girl <UNK> by her aunt <UNK> she meets her future husband the previously married <UNK> <UNK> cole wings <UNK> a poor farmer whose reputation in the town is <UNK> because of his association with the native american population the young <UNK> is played by christine <UNK> who is exceptional in her first feature role despite <UNK> <UNK> her relationship with <UNK> is rejected by her cold and rigid father whose <UNK> to attend the wedding starts the marriage off on the wrong foot this is <UNK> by his leaving all of his money to the town of <UNK> <UNK> the young couple to a life of poverty br br going through the motions of her marriage to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from social activities to prevent being rejected by the town's upper classes when she produces two sons marvin dylan baker and john kevin <UNK> she is unable to give them the love that they need every joy i might have held in my man or any child of mine or even the plain light of morning she reflects all were forced to a <UNK> by some break of proper <UNK> did i ever speak the <UNK> truth like the biblical <UNK> who <UNK> to the desert because she could not tolerate further <UNK> to her pride <UNK> leaves <UNK> to live in <UNK> but eventually returns to the <UNK> farm br br as the scene shifts back to the present <UNK> runs away to an abandoned house near the ocean that she remembers from her childhood to escape from being placed in a <UNK> home by marvin and his wife doris sheila mccarthy here she meets a young man named leo luke <UNK> who takes an interest in her and <UNK> her to look at and take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life the stone angel pulls out all the emotional stops but never fully develops its characters to the point where i felt any stake in the story's outcome although the spirited performance by ellen page as john's devoted but naive girlfriend and the moving final scenes bring a new energy to the film's second half
<START> the blob qualifies as a cult sci fi film not only because it launched 27 year old steve mcqueen on a <UNK> to <UNK> but also because it exploited the popular themes both of alien invasion and

<START> i do admit that my review is from a 2006 point of view nearly 30 years after the making of this movie and at the time of its conception it may have been a brilliant horror thriller movie br br beginning on halloween night 1968 6 year old michael commits the brutal murder of his 18 year old sister michael is committed to a mental institution and 15 years later escapes and returns to his home town to murder again br br from this point it is clear that the movie will follow a basic and <UNK> path that is highly predictable the beginning of every scene is easily predictable in the way it will end whilst the music for each scene containing michael the murderer is exactly the same throughout the movie thus <UNK> the viewer to the likely events to follow br br for the horror thriller <UNK> there is a severe lack of blood gore compared to modern day films although i am not akin to the amount that is displayed in this day and age a happier medium could have been found br br from a half hour into the movie not one scene is unexpected the acting for a horror thriller film is fairly typical of the era and thus lacks any punch for the modern day <UNK> br br a positive for the film is its lingering camera shots and dark lighting which creates a frightening atmosphere a second positive would be the character of michael's doctor who provides clues to the <UNK> of where the story may lead br br however it is clear that the star in jamie lee curtis is in the <UNK> stages of her acting career and thus fails to provide a truly frightened central victim br br it is hard for me to rate this film as it was in its day but from other horror thriller films of indeed the 80s and to a lesser extent the 90s it falls far short of a truly great horror thriller film br br i suggest you move on and find a classic from the 80s cheers
<START> an interesting thriller that has paul <UNK> as a detective on the case of a murder paul <UNK> was an underrated actor who pulled off all his roles with such ease it was hard to tell the man was even acting maybe most known by younger viewers as the voice narrator of city <UNK> <UNK> ends his career with a so so movie but as always <UNK> shines a treat to watch br br erika <UNK> is well erika <UNK> nice to look at but leaves a lot to be desired in the acting department though to be fair this is one of her better efforts br br bottom line a watchable thriller that shouldn't be missed by any paul <UNK> fan a decent <UNK> to help send paul <UNK> off to celluloid heaven what an actor he will be missed
<START> my god what an incredible movie it is reminded me so much of the similar scene in mel <UNK> movie we were soldiers when the company is not lost they're just cut off and the other scene in pearl <UNK> when the british officer says to ben affleck if all americans are like you then god help the nation that goes to war with america br br put all 3 movies together and you would have enough <UNK> to <UNK> the entire <UNK> desert br br the story of the cut off <UNK> may be real enough but the movie could have done without all that american preachy <UNK> propaganda attached to it there were <UNK> <UNK> in the cinema during the above mentioned scene in pearl <UNK> no kidding either the lost <UNK> however is really in a class of its own  br br americans think they are <UNK> <UNK> i actually <UNK> and damn near <UNK> at all the <UNK> being <UNK> out throughout this <UNK> disaster the movie that is br br the fighting scenes were well made 3 stars for that but if the script is <UNK> then wrapped even in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it is still <UNK> the writer james <UNK> also wrote those other <UNK> hill no mercy <UNK> <UNK> someone please shoot him before he writes any more such garbage br br the director russell <UNK> is an australian too god the shame
<START> secret sunshine reminded me of the rapture 1991 with <UNK> rogers and david duchovny but this korean production is a better film it portrays super religious korean christians in a <UNK> korean city and the main character's experiences <UNK> with them in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy shin <UNK> is a widowed single mother who moves to the city of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in chinese from <UNK> with her young son she has chosen <UNK> because her late husband killed in an auto accident was born there and she feels she needs to make a new start in life in a new place she does not react well to the <UNK> of the local christian <UNK> one of whose members tries to convince her to come to their church and <UNK> <UNK> shin <UNK> is essentially <UNK> and <UNK> these people off as <UNK> as she can in fact she <UNK> just about everyone in <UNK> off to begin with but some of them are <UNK> in trying to <UNK> her world and the consequences are often hilarious to say more would be to give the film away but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role <UNK> do <UNK> is <UNK> having read that she won the best actress award at cannes in 2007 i expected her to a decent job but ms <UNK> is captivating and it is impossible to take your eyes off her when she is on screen the movie is a sort of harrowing evelyn <UNK> esquire piece of work showing how fate can feel insane as much as strangely inevitable
<START> spoilers br br first off nothing really happened in this movie other than a woman bleeding inexplicably second it wasn't scary third it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever let me elaborate the sound was edited by either <UNK> or <UNK>  i'm not sure which so let's just go with <UNK> the movie gradually gets more and more quiet and the people <UNK> and <UNK> forcing you to turn up the volume i watched this at home then <UNK> <UNK> some really loud sounds with supposedly scary shocking images forcing you to quickly lower the volume again this occurs many times until mercifully the movie ends i can picture <UNK> laughing <UNK> from behind the two way mirror while watching the test group <UNK> reaching for the remote each time if you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after they fall asleep this one is a big mistake but then it's a big mistake anyway here's a thought  if you're going to make a horror movie at least add a gratuitous <UNK> a 19 year old blond girl who screams at the top of her <UNK> just before she can take off her <UNK> the shadow on the wall of someone being eaten alive just out of the camera range a cat being thrown at the camera to scare the audience some <UNK> weirdo with a <UNK> laugh or a monster who looks like a stage hand covered in <UNK> foil a la tv's lost in space these people didn't even try to scare me they just wanted to hurt my ears
<START> <UNK> was the most <UNK> follow up to les <UNK> <UNK> which with <UNK> appears now as the last good movie of <UNK> golden era 1967 1973 <UNK> is <UNK> first real attempt at a wholly political movie its previous work les <UNK> <UNK> had also political elements but it was more a psychological thriller with the usual look at society in french <UNK> <UNK> includes terrorists <UNK> hostage taking a lot of blood not really <UNK> field a <UNK> cast gives the movie the coup de <UNK> only <UNK> who had already played with the director and maurice <UNK> are up to scratch <UNK> romance one of <UNK> actresses la belle <UNK> <UNK> is wasted as a <UNK> <UNK> italian actors <UNK> <UNK> lou <UNK> are awful br br with <UNK> this a second period of <UNK> inspiration for <UNK> it would be <UNK> <UNK> before he was again at the top of his game
<START> the alternate title of ecstasy is <UNK> of love a title which appropriately describes the mood and feel of the film ecstasy is an early <UNK> and could have very well been a classic film if released during the silent film era this film is a visual treat and is deliberately paced so the viewer can <UNK> its <UNK> <UNK> quality which is presented in an artistic low key fashion the director's style is distinctly european the subject matter and approach to sexuality was far more sophisticated than what was being produced in hollywood at that time consider the censorship code in the us during the 30's that pretty much sums it up hedy <UNK> one of the great <UNK> of all time was a perfect choice for this <UNK> of love '
<START> from this awful movie there are so many things wrong with this film acting writing direction editing etc that it's amazing that something rises to the top and proves itself to be the absolute worst the music i noted that the film has two <UNK> listed this must be the reason why every single frame has music of the absolute worst d movie style drivel they have never heard of the expression less is more it got so painful to listen to i muted the sound every time there was no dialogue not that the dialogue was that good you have to feel sorry for robert wagner and tom <UNK> i'm sure they didn't see roles like this in the twilight of their careers see it at your own risk
<START> in mexico city the former cia assassin and <UNK> an alcoholic <UNK> man john creasy denzel washington is hired by the <UNK> samuel <UNK> marc anthony with the recommendation of his old friend <UNK> christopher walken to be the bodyguard of his young daughter pita <UNK> fanning and his wife lisa <UNK> mitchell pita changes the behavior of the cold creasy making him live and smile again and he feels a great affection for her when the girl is kidnapped and creasy is informed that she was murdered by the criminals he <UNK> to kill each one responsible for the <UNK> br br man on fire is almost a masterpiece and will become certainly a classic in the future the story is excellent never corny and although having <UNK> minutes running time the viewer does not feel time passing the cast is composed by excellent actors and actresses their performances are outstanding <UNK> denzel washington <UNK> fanning and <UNK> mitchell the cinematography has wonderful moments and the screenplay has stunning lines i personally loved when the character of christopher walken explains to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> is death and he is preparing his masterpiece i agree with the user that commented that man on fire is one of the best if not the best film of the year in this genre my vote is ten br br title brazil <UNK> da <UNK> flames of the revenge
<START> next to star wars and the wizard of oz this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made it's a true shame it's not as well known as the former films maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or sci fi settings and that it's british meaning a smaller market for films but its wonderful to know that it's deserved that reputation br br like all great family films one can be a child an adult or even a teenager to enjoy this film i'm currently 18 but one must appreciate classic films first i absolutely adore this film it has an extraordinary music score by <UNK> <UNK> perhaps my favorite classic film score that rivals any john williams star wars score a fast but not flashy pace beautiful sets dialog and use of color both the sets and cinematography won oscars and state of the art oscar winning special effects for the time and some are still stunning and of course june <UNK> <UNK> looks as the princess rivals that of catherine zeta jones' she even looks like jones in a way br br in conclusion this is one of my all time favorite movie next to the adventures of robin hood and it truly deserves more attention it is a true adventure of <UNK> throughout and along with robin hood it's my desert island film that i could watch over and over again without getting annoyed br br stars excellent
<START> this film is awful give me the dentist anytime can you believe that one of the main tv stations here in <UNK> had this as their christmas film i can only assume they expected to entertain the crowds with dudley moore rather than this the last time i looked at my hot water bottle it had more acting better plot more drama and a lot more interest than this waste of celluloid don't even watch it if you're drunk
<START> boris karloff and bela lugosi made many films together but on the whole interestingly enough karloff usually is the better man of the two the real exception is the black cat 1934 where karloff is playing the evil head of a devil cult and lugosi is seeking revenge on him for destroying his life but more usual is black friday where whatever his motive karloff is trying to improve brain surgery while lugosi is a murderous thug in the <UNK> lugosi is a sadistic surgeon who <UNK> karloff to assist his evil plans until karloff finally has had enough rarely are they both negative characters totally in the body <UNK> karloff does kill lugosi but lugosi is trying to blackmail him br br the one exception where they are both extremely sympathetic but at cross purposes to each other is this 1936 film which i feel has rarely had the audience acceptance of some of the other movies i have mentioned in it <UNK> dr <UNK> rukh is a hard driven scientific genius who has been <UNK> at by the official scientific community for his theory that a rare form of <UNK> is in <UNK> on a <UNK> that landed centuries ago he has finally gotten the support of a well <UNK> expedition led by sir francis stevens and his wife lady <UNK> stevens walter <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and has another scientist a frenchman named dr felix <UNK> lugosi <UNK> young wife diane frances drake and a friend and <UNK> of the <UNK> named ronald drake frank <UNK> br br before they leave rukh is warned by his mother <UNK> <UNK> cooper that he is possibly seeking wisdom that he shouldn't and it may end in tragedy he tries to dismiss this but he is worried by what she says his scientific standing and whether or not he is going to get his due credit br br what he gets is a disaster he finds the substance but is infected by it's remarkable <UNK> he finds that he is slowly burning up and if he tries to touch people or animals they die he's actually built up a friendship or understanding with <UNK> who figures out a type of <UNK> fighting cocktail for rukh to use to counter the danger but there are two things that are <UNK> here the <UNK> can only last for a certain amount of time and has to be <UNK> and the <UNK> has affected <UNK> brain he is increasingly jealous of <UNK> friendship with ronald encouraged unfortunately by sir francis and lady <UNK> and he is equally upset that due to his having to pretend to have died the effects of the <UNK> are like that <UNK> and several others are collecting the kudos of the wonders that <UNK> x is giving to man soon rukh is on a murderous rampage that destroys many lives ending with his own br br the film certainly picked up on science to an extent <UNK> <UNK> had died recently from cancer she got due to work with <UNK> few fully understood the dangers of <UNK> in 1936 but some idea of it was coming out the wave of murders by rukh cause the <UNK> to talk about a curse on the expedition of course with the idea of a cursed expedition on the continent of africa for a hidden treasure buried centuries ago <UNK> by a titled <UNK> we have entered <UNK> not physics or <UNK> <UNK> howard carter and lord <UNK> br br on the other hand <UNK> tries to settle the cause of the string of deaths and <UNK> to an idea that was actually <UNK> in <UNK> in england during the <UNK> murders sir charles warren ordered the <UNK> of several of the dead victims to be photographed to see if the last image on the <UNK> was jack the <UNK> it turned out he only got the photographs of the <UNK> of dead prostitutes but the idea did not die jules <UNK> used it in his novel the brothers <UNK> in <UNK> and here dr <UNK> uses it as this is a science fiction story he finds the image of rukh on the the plate but <UNK> drops the plate accidentally and it <UNK> br br the film is good on many grounds the most interesting that for a change karloff and lugosi are not unsympathetic towards each other there is a type of tragic <UNK> in this story that is missing from their other films the other performances are good as well in particular ms <UNK> cooper she is best remembered as basil <UNK> frightening sister jane <UNK> in david <UNK> here her final act is the only way to bring this tragedy to an end and who can say it did not hurt her more than her target
<START> i happened to watch this movie by chance some days ago while flipping channels my expectations were not very high but it was an interesting movie in 'a guy <UNK> jason lee plays paul a straight laced seattle based fellow who is about to marry his fiancée karen <UNK> blair and settle down to an <UNK> life of middle class <UNK> we first meet paul at his bachelor party where he <UNK> no desire to engage in any of the normal bachelor party type activities his surprisingly few buddies encourage in case he's a bit naughty and gets into hot bother with his soon to be trouble and <UNK> of course the next thing paul knows it's the morning after the night before he's in bed with a naked <UNK> dancer and his mother in law phones to inform him that karen is on her way over oh and the <UNK> dancer is <UNK> cousin <UNK> julia stiles br br from this small <UNK> of potential trouble grows a mighty <UNK> of frenetic misfortune as paul <UNK> from <UNK> to <UNK> trying to cover up what he's done whilst keeping up the appearance of being a <UNK> family oriented good guy who's super excited about his <UNK> <UNK> his efforts to ensure karen remains none the <UNK> about any potential wrong doing on his part ironically forces paul closer and closer to the fun loving <UNK> forcing him to question whether he really wants the life that seems to have been <UNK> out for him the movie contains the right mix of comedy and romance definitely worth a watch
<START> in the year 1990 the world of disney tv cartoons was certainly at it's prime shows like chip n <UNK> rescue rangers <UNK> and <UNK> bears was already popular and now disney made another great cartoon and that cartoon brought the birth of the disney afternoon that cartoon is called <UNK> it's about old jungle book character <UNK> the bear as he gets a job in the plane business in the series he meets <UNK> <UNK> former air pirate and good cloud <UNK> business lady rebecca cunningham and her <UNK> daughter molly this series is very funny and has tons of great <UNK> that you may not understand as a kid but understand later on in life this is one cleverly written series and it's great to add to your dvd collection parents buy this for your kids rather letting them watch all of those horrible <UNK> cartoons if you liked <UNK> then check out <UNK> duck and goof <UNK> spin it
<START> sudden impact is the 4th of the dirty harry films and one of the best traits of these films is that they don't really <UNK> in quality from one film to the next thus sudden impact provides another thrill ride through the life of dirty harry callahan this time harry attempts to solve a series of murders while on vacation harry's always on the job it seems clint eastwood plays harry as he plays all his men of action slow deliberate and without fear as the first of the dirty harry films to be made in the 80's sudden impact lacks a bit of the 70's feel that <UNK> the first three films this doesn't mean that it's quality is any less bottom line <UNK> with intensity and action sudden impact is another worthy addition to the dirty harry series
<START> after mob boss <UNK> <UNK> late great anthony <UNK> kills his lady whom has been cheating on him with derek their new <UNK> vietnam vet and blames it on the poor guy derek finds himself in jail where he has to <UNK> with a corrupt warden <UNK> prisoner brother who runs the jail and oh yeah illegal experiments <UNK> by a shady cia agent great genre <UNK> and first time director john <UNK> to turn various prisoners into super human <UNK> zombies of course things get out of hand and it's up to derek and the rest of the <UNK> prisoners to save the day after the infected ones take the jail over br br john <UNK> is a great talented actor as a director <UNK> is a great talented actor to say this movie john's sole directorial outing to date lacks a certain visual flair would be a bit of an understatement however the film isn't totally without merit the dialog while idiotic is just bad enough to be humorous sometimes sadly this isn't really enough for the movie to coast by on that alone and it takes forever for the film to even start coming into it's own which is fairly late in the movie as such the most i can recommend this film is to say that if you're a fan of <UNK> which i indeed am it's worth one watch just go in with low expectations and you should be fine br br eye candy dana <UNK> mason and <UNK> <UNK> get topless br br my grade d
<START> this is a pretty strange movie it does comes across as an exploitation film with over the top violence and unrealistic situations but unusual for being constructed around rural characters at war with each other as opposed to an <UNK> <UNK> br br the movie is an excessive stereotype of vietnam veterans in a long line of films that portrayed the vets of that war as dangerous <UNK> kris <UNK> last line is 'i ain't lost a war <UNK> as he meets his demise after <UNK> a long trail of murder and destruction including the town's chief of police and his brother's girlfriend in a particularly chilling scene however kristofferson is a good enough actor and charismatic enough to carry this villain with a surprising depth vincent is clearly the golden boy but with enough intensity layered over his clean cut goodness the movie bears some plot resemblance to winchester 73 where jimmy stewart tries to tolerate a criminal brother until being forced to act against him br br the movie has b movie grade action though the presence of kristofferson vincent a gorgeous victoria principal and <UNK> peters give it an a grade <UNK> br br i give it a 7 for being a long lost view into an american psyche of post vietnam pre reagan <UNK> paranoia and confusion and a movie industry that was willing to address such topics at that time br br seen on the this channel a great network that keeps playing lots of old movies of the 70s through 90s regardless of political bent
<START> i watched written on the wind starring rock hudson lauren <UNK> robert stack dorothy malone robert stack was terrible just bloody horrible he was supposed to be a charming jet setting millionaire instead he came off like a jerk from the word go the plot was stupid and overwrought and the 3 romantic leads had no chemistry somehow dorothy malone won an oscar for best supporting actress although her campy tramp character was boring think the older sister from <UNK> in the grass filled with <UNK> and <UNK> and lacking charisma director douglas sirk has the entire cast <UNK> their way through dialogue that felt forced and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes had a cameo by the actor that played the chief on get smart
<START> though the plot elements to the <UNK> day seem like they have been done plenty of times the film still has much of the spark mystery and symbolism that <UNK> van <UNK> first film had though not as good as <UNK> the hero which will always remain on my favorites list the movie still leaves us with lots of emotions daniel <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> the closet <UNK> his part afraid to <UNK> rightfully so the role could have easily been ruined if the actor was overly dramatic however i felt the part needed a bit more realism to it focusing more on the character itself instead of simply the character's growth br br don't walk into this movie expecting the dark humor and unexpected twists that you got from <UNK> the hero because you will be disappointed however the film still serves as a decent if not flawed movie
<START> this documentary has been aired on both <UNK> and bbc in the last number of months having seen it twice now i would recommend it to anyone with an interest in media and documentary film making br br initially this documentary was meant to detail the political life of <UNK> president hugo chavez the irish crew set off with those intentions what happens when they get to <UNK> is startling as they witness first hand the attempted <UNK> by rebel <UNK> particularly the oil concerns in <UNK> of chavez and his government what we the audience witness is just how the media <UNK> the situation and in effect backs the <UNK> of chavez by <UNK> events that <UNK> as the coup <UNK> br br it really is an excellent documentary and a remarkable piece of work by a couple of <UNK> filmmakers br br
<START> this film fails to capture any of the mystery and intrigue that the book offers the main point of the book the insights are hardly even touched upon leaving the viewer wondering exactly why everyone is making such a big deal about them and why they are willing to risk their lives br br the character development is not good at all no background or personal development leaves the audience not really caring at all about what happens to them and so the action sequences fall flat br br the search for the <UNK> ends abruptly and with no real explanation not leaving any sense of satisfaction as to what the whole search was for br br this is one of the worst adaptations of a book i have ever seen it is horrible and a waste of time if you have not read the book skip the movie and read it if you have read the book skip the movie and <UNK> it br br it is almost as if the point of making the movie was to <UNK> the book that is how poorly done and ridiculous this movie is it is a shame too because it could have been good had they <UNK> on it at the height of its success and they probably would have been able to get a good screenwriter and some good actors br br please don't waste your time read the book
<START> i wanted to watch this movie because of <UNK> <UNK> but she only has a smaller part in it and her character isn't very likable however the main character played by melissa <UNK> is extremely beautiful and a perfect delight to look at throughout the movie this is really nothing but a showcase for her looks and talent she does a very good job br br the story itself is on the face of it pretty nonsensical after a car crash some friends are possibly dead but keeps on living their previous lives while all sorts of mysterious things happen some bad guys are after them but we never really find out who they are possibly they were the ones in the other car but we certainly don't hear anything about why they are after them the final scenes especially seem <UNK> ambitious but i can't get anything coherent out of it the opening scene where the bad guys who wear some strange masks cut a blond girl's <UNK> and gather up some of her blood is never explained or followed up on unless the bad guys are supposed to be a representation of the <UNK> <UNK> trying to pull cassie <UNK> back from the dead but no that doesn't seem to work the bad guys are just bad guys they really just mess up a story that might otherwise have been interesting in a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice who the hell needs bad guys br br 3 out of 10
<START> just plain good old stupid br br i mean really stupid not the good stupid like killer tomatoes or ed wood movies this is probably the most stupid movie i ever have seen to give this movie an golden turkey is an insult to <UNK> to call this movie dumb is offensive even to dumb people br br if this is the future of american cinema and art we are better off to really start world war 3 and 4 at the same time and let the <UNK> run the show after br br now i have to get drunk to wash this insult to my single <UNK> off br br this is a really good movie if you are <UNK>
<START> br br bleak house is hands down the finest adaptation of a charles dickens novel ever put on screen <UNK> one of my favorite novels i was <UNK> pleased with this television mini series the late great <UNK> elliot was perfectly cast as the noble john <UNK> and diana <UNK> was sheer perfection as the doomed <UNK> <UNK> the film captures the essence of dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book <UNK> making minor plot cuts that do not effect the story over all a brilliant moving and <UNK> film
<START> fay grim is on its face a tale of espionage and intrigue told with a nod and a <UNK> as the sequel to his extraordinary henry fool hal hartley creates a surprising blend of film noir and <UNK> spy thriller that starts with a knowing smile and large dose of laughter and turns as poignant and warm as any film i've seen this year br br <UNK> posey is fay grim an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> caught between the love of her <UNK> husband henry fool and the questionable intentions of a charming cia <UNK> as agent <UNK> jeff goldblum is a master of wit and sarcasm in a role that seems <UNK> to his talents he has never been better james <UNK> is <UNK> brother simon <UNK> but renowned for his wildly popular books of poetry his love of his work and his sister brings a <UNK> of passion to contrast the <UNK> nature of the spies which eventually <UNK> <UNK> world and liam <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> 14 year old son although that may be redundant <UNK> understated style is remarkably old soul for someone his age br br the entire film is shot dutch angle the off <UNK> style made famous by orson welles and used primarily in horror films and psychological thrillers to <UNK> a sense of foreboding in fay grim using that style from opening credits to closing is intriguing at first <UNK> clever the next for just as the viewer begins to fall for the perfectly timed comedic elements and wit of hartley's brilliant script something happens the film takes a dark yet strangely <UNK> turn as these characters magically become sympathetic before our eyes what began as dark comedy <UNK> into romantic drama and the transition is masterful slow pacing gives way to breathtaking action and we are sucked right into the <UNK> br br in the end hartley's sharp dialog combined with the amazing performances of a perfectly matched ensemble cast makes for a delicious cinematic cocktail told with the luxury of one able to write produce direct edit and even <UNK> the music hal hartley has crafted a smart sexy tale of espionage with tongue just barely planted in cheek fay grim is one part <UNK> <UNK> one part raymond chandler and one part ian <UNK> <UNK> and maybe <UNK> as well
<START> when friendship kills in my opinion is a very touching and kind of heartbreaking drama about the consequences of being <UNK> or <UNK> anytime <UNK> katie wright or jennifer <UNK> <UNK> threw up i wanted to vomit myself it's kind of hard to explain why if you ask me they should have been more <UNK> about things however i did enjoy seeing them do things together as well as get <UNK> by their parents before i wrap this up i'd like to say if you ask me when friendship kills does indeed show you how being <UNK> or <UNK> can affect a person's body now in conclusion i recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it you're in for some tears and a good time so the next time it's on tv kick back with a friend and watch it
<START> i say the domino principle is an enormously <UNK> film anyone who has taken the time to investigate our contemporary history of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> g wallace and in fact numerous others can only draw the conclusion that the author of the domino principle really knew what he was talking about roy tucker could be lee harvey <UNK> or james earl ray or <UNK> <UNK> or arthur <UNK> maybe even john <UNK> or timothy <UNK> to mention a few the conspiracy scenario involving spies big business and political <UNK> is not really a fiction but an ominous part of our convoluted existential history god help us but the domino principle is more fact than fantasy if this causes a little loss of sleep maybe it should don't take my word for it investigate for yourselves
<START> there was such a hype about a game show with bill shatner and especially right in the wake of deal or no deal and 1 vs 100 so of course everyone had to tune in to see what all the fuss was about on the new game show what a disappointment as ben <UNK> so <UNK> and <UNK> says <UNK> br br the only thing likable about this show was the fact that you knew it would eventually be over sitting through a full hour of it was like going to the dentist you find yourself looking at the clock in what you think are 10 minute <UNK> only to find out that only a minute has passed but seemed like an eternity since you last <UNK> at the clock so why didn't i just switch the channel well probably for the same reason most other people didn't out of sheer optimism i mean no one really wants to think that a show with bill shatner could actually be so bad br br personally from the first 15 minutes i never thought this was the kind of vehicle that would showcase the talents of william shatner my chief complaint was that the set was so dark watching it left me feeling depressed you kept on wanting to get <UNK> of a little excitement but there was just none to be had there was not even enough light on the set to get a feel of energy from the audience who you couldn't even see br br dear network people do not watch game shows to cure their insomnia they watch game shows to be excited and have a good time please do us all a favor and lose this in the vault
<START> there is no way to describe how really really really bad this movie is it's a shame that i actually sat through this movie this very tiresome and predictable movie what's wrong with it acting there is not one performance that is even remotely close to even being sub par <UNK> they are all very pretty soundtrack songs if we get orgy on the soundtrack then everyone will know that they are watching a horror film soundtrack score okay but anyone with a keyboard can make an okay soundtrack these days don't even get me started on the what the hell moments here are a few killer can move at the speed of light door opens actress turns no one is there turns back there is something sitting in front of her out of now where the killer shows up with a power <UNK> a really big one the filmmakers get points for at least <UNK> it in but can i really believe that the killer took the time to find the power <UNK> to plug it in i feel like one of the guards at the beginning of holy grail and want to say <UNK> you get the power <UNK> i could go on and on about how bad this film is but i only have 1000 words i will give this 2 out of ten stars one star for making me laugh and another star for all the <UNK> seriously do not waste your time with this one
<START> i believe <UNK> is a tremendous effort of whoopi goldberg besides her there are no other stars in the film and her role is smaller than the title character <UNK> since i work in a high school with urban children i think this is an important film to show south african history of apartheid <UNK> is a movie about education and a <UNK> relationship with her student <UNK> i bought the video for practically nothing at a <UNK> i watched it and fast <UNK> through the musical numbers but i strongly recommend this film to <UNK> and their students to understand now while i don't know the other actors and actresses in the film i assume that they are very popular in south africa and i am glad that they filmed with a south african cast and crew with the exception of goldberg in a small role but if it gets people to see this movie than whoopi reaches worldwide appeal
<START> this is in my opinion much better than either of the 2 1990's versions but is still not all that good it feels dated probably because it is but it does stand up well compared to other bbc 1980's period pieces such as <UNK> park and <UNK> <UNK> br br the length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90's versions and st john rivers is at least covered although not very well timothy dalton is very good as rochester but the actress playing jane is much too old there is definitely scope for a tv adaptation of this length that has more than a <UNK> spent on it
<START> nyc model alison parker <UNK> raines <UNK> a room in an old <UNK> where she meets a few bizarre neighbors and experiences some creepy hallucinations as lawyer boyfriend michael <UNK> chris sarandon goes about making <UNK> on her behalf she struggles to maintain her sanity not to mention her will to live as her experiences take a <UNK> on her physical mental and emotional health br br i don't want to spoil the better moments in this psychological horror film for those unfamiliar with it the story is interesting and entertaining but the film doesn't really offer much in terms of real scares or for that matter any atmosphere it is sort of quietly sinister but it's not like the traditional horror film it's more of a story about a troubled woman's attempts to deal with the increasing <UNK> in her life on that level it works but it's not quite powerful enough br br what the sentinel does offer are some eye catching set pieces in particular the fascinating <UNK> creepy climax and there's a scene with beverly <UNK> that must be seen to be believed there's also some gore to be seen but not very much an ominous music score by <UNK> <UNK> adds to the menace br br no review of this film would be complete without an <UNK> for the film makers in gathering such excellent actors for its ensemble cast some of them don't get to do too much but to see all of them together is impressive eli <UNK> and burgess meredith make the biggest impressions as respectively a hard <UNK> detective and a <UNK> neighbor other legendary names include jose <UNK> arthur kennedy and <UNK> <UNK> future stars like <UNK> christopher walken tom berenger jeff goldblum make brief appearances and other familiar faces include jerry <UNK> sylvia miles william <UNK> and martin <UNK> whoever was the casting director for this film deserves some sort of prize br br written for the screen by director michael winner probably best known for the death wish series that he did with charles bronson from the novel by jeffrey <UNK> br br i wouldn't consider this a truly great horror thriller but it has its moments and is reasonably entertaining br br 7 10
<START> i got the dvd from the library in the expectation of getting a good idea of how things go on in the background at a major opera production i have to say i was very disappointed the subject had so much potential the sets in a <UNK> production must of necessity be elaborate and impressive and the story behind their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience instead what we get it a <UNK> of clips of people moving around big items of scenery vaguely help together with a commentary which failed to hold my attention i found myself listening primarily to the background clips of music from operas i was impressed by the sheer <UNK> of the effort required to put on such a production that did come across fairly well and next time i am at the opera i am sure i will remember that part if this video but was left feeling somewhat cheated by the lack of detailed commentary and explanation
<START> it's the worst movie i've ever seen the action is so unclear work of cameras is so poor actors are so affected and this <UNK> 5 minutes of arnie on the screen my advice from the bottom of my heart don't watch it unless you like such a low class torture
<START> john candy need we say more he is the main reason you should see this film most people don't realize how gifted he was as an actor witness him changing from poor <UNK> to horny jerk just a simple subtle facial change and off we go there are many great bits in this movie and many really dumb bits the best moments for me are the kung fu u scenes as well as the great moment when john in a <UNK> goes up on stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend that is how much he and his <UNK> love his girlfriend i'm sure reading this you might think this sequence sounds really crude it is but it is also very funny mainly because it is john candy doing this bit the story in general is pretty lame and eugene levy and joe <UNK> both <UNK> <UNK> with candy are not given enough to do in the film levy has his moments especially filming the wedding at the end think rod <UNK> and the great scene when he is talking to his mother on the phone overall a good movie if you have had a tough day and need to put your brain on stupid i give this one 4 out of 10
<START> comedies often have the unfortunate reputation of having little real depth arms and the man proves that notion to be false <UNK> play is full of comedic drama combining an entertaining plot with true philosophical depth br br on one level arms and the man is a successful and somewhat unique romantic comedy the young melodramatic and superficial <UNK> comes from a military family deeply involved in a war her fiancé and her father are both military officers she is shocked one night by the arrival of an enemy soldier she <UNK> him knowing that she'll have to keep the incident a secret from her family forever and the soldier eventually leaves of course once the war is over that soldier comes back forcing each of the primary characters to <UNK> their values and their relationships br br it is quite interesting how shaw layers meaning within the rather standard comedic plot shaw manages to comment on class <UNK> on the absurdity of war and even on the nature of love and of course he does this with the <UNK> wit and within a satisfying plot there is so much here to think about that i think a lot can be missed in a single viewing arms and the man is excellent comedic theater and is definitely one of <UNK> best works br br arms and the man is both an amusing and thought provoking movie that <UNK> its relevance even today more than a century after it was first conceived shaw <UNK> at the popular theories on war and love and combines a military satire with a <UNK> on love and family structure the play has flashing wit <UNK> humor and bitter <UNK> a good example of <UNK> dialog is the statement by captain <UNK> to <UNK> i'm a professional soldier i fight when i have to and am very glad to get out of it when i haven't to you're only an amateur you think fighting is an amusement indeed as a swiss hotel <UNK> son <UNK> had no reason to be involved in war and it is in this absurdity that shaw questions patriotic sentiments shaw explores the whole concept of war and the military from both sides of the struggle and in the end shows that the feelings in both camps are not that different br br the dialog and sarcasm used towards the common notions of life are <UNK> with a gentle <UNK> of the movement of the story towards a fairytale ending the end where all characters are rendered happy and lovers change and love shifts is what <UNK> the essence of this drama as a comedy this is a movie that <UNK> its image of <UNK> a universal appeal and is still appropriate today when the concepts of war and <UNK> and love and marriage have changed dramatically <UNK> arms and the man should maintain its relevance as long as there is love and war
<START> talented detective mr philo vance william powell <UNK> his overseas trip to investigate an apparently cut and <UNK> case of suicide he has good reason to suspect is really something much more a rather deliciously complex murder br br as far as murder mystery films go it just doesn't get any better than this one populated with suspicious characters all connected to a dog show and all having very good reason to murder the apparent suicide victim archer <UNK> it's truly tough to figure this one out or wrap one's head around it but boy does it proves fascinating to watch unfold before us even the cops the <UNK> and the district attorney prove colorful fleshed out characters adding a level of unexpected gritty realism to this one's proceedings and <UNK> up its overall fun factor i particularly enjoyed the comic scenes involving the <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> who is always it seems to him being <UNK> and <UNK> interrupted by the discovery of corpses or injured men during this one's running time also eugene <UNK> detective sgt heath provides welcome often later delightfully humorous at his expense critical commentary during <UNK> investigation i cannot think of any valid criticism to give this movie in fact except perhaps that it hasn't dated particularly well doesn't stop the movie from being just plain good fun viewing though watch and see if you can wrap your head around this one's mystery highly recommended you try
<START> if you have trouble dreaming you may give this movie a low rating but you just have to realize this movie was not made to please everyone br br just people with a sense of humor br br for those people the movie is great it plays on old science fiction movies and radio shows long gone most of witch where b rated themselves along the lines of <UNK> and airplane 2 you may need to stretch your imagination a little bit to get the jokes but it is well worth it
<START> it brings to mind the <UNK> of stephen king and the remembered <UNK> filled with terror from stories like it as the exact opposite there is no terror in these <UNK> that any of the friends who are still friends 20 years up the line remember or seem to suffer from up the line all is described as friendly <UNK> maybe <UNK> described as picking on one or more of them but all is forgiven there is no angst <UNK> as the film and the participants in later life describe the relationships all we see are young people having grown up to be basically the same persons more mature but basically still the same people and the same power <UNK> br br totally amazing not just for the fact that people can in fact grow up relatively <UNK> by social conventions but also that friendships can in fact last in this respect this movie is a tiny pearl as one assumes this has been the intent of the film a portrait of <UNK> emotions <UNK> people together which when seen in opposition to films of later years portraying the dark sides of childhood the violent <UNK> in <UNK> for combine is what easily springs to mind but since mid <UNK> along with the growing <UNK> of children and childhood accompanied by <UNK> of commercials animations and series directed straight at children several movies and documentaries have had success with portraying the dark sides of growing up the abuse the loneliness the push to <UNK> resulting in adults with dark and twisted minds br br and here comes a film that says it is possible to have a happy childhood <UNK> br br thank you for that or the <UNK> illusion br br 8 10
<START> i found this film to be an utter <UNK> the talent available to the director notably stanley <UNK> chris walken hank <UNK> and alan arkin without even mentioning the four main leads have been completely wasted on an unfunny mediocre story whose conclusion one couldn't really care about once introduced to the dire <UNK> <UNK> characters julia roberts is feeble zeta jones is just plain annoying appearing to <UNK> her role from high <UNK> minus the humour crystal just plays his same old hyper active neurotic annoying alter ego and cusack simply walks through his part apparently bored with the whole project br br for what is supposed to be a <UNK> <UNK> there is absolutely no romance between the central characters let alone chemistry and as for the comedy possible spoilers well the only moments of mild humour came off the back of <UNK> role in <UNK> <UNK> and his relationship with alan arkin the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever spoilers <UNK> was reasonably amusing as the mexican lover and walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an <UNK> maverick <UNK> type director but these parts <UNK> very little screen time and instead spoilers we were treated to billy crystal having his <UNK> <UNK> by a dog pure genius br br for a huge fan of the majority of john <UNK> work not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast i was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them instead <UNK> to the same old genre cliches and even <UNK> itself to the depths of almost <UNK> out teen <UNK> humour at times br br a very poor 4 10
<START> when i heard patrick <UNK> was finally returning to his acting career with king <UNK> mines i was very excited i was expecting a great indiana jones type action adventure what i got was a 4 hour long with commercials epic that was very slow the second and third hour could have been dropped altogether and the story would not have suffered for it the ending was good no spoilers here but i was still left wanting more well all a guy can do is prey that <UNK> does <UNK> 2 so he can get back into the action genre that made him famous until than if your a fan of king <UNK> mines than read the book or watch the 1985 version with richard chamberlain and sharon stone which is also not very good but its only and hour and forty minutes of your life gone instead of 4 hours
<START> first off let me say i have wanted to see this movie for about a year now because i knew angelina jolie was in it and i love her but my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie anyhow no video stores carried it but low and behold the local library did i watched it and absolutely loved it yes there were italian stereotypes but it was done well and funny it was not <UNK> in any way br br every actor and actress did a superb job i laughed very hard at the sexual humor overall i think this movie is well worth seeing if you can find it it is adorable and just plain fun to watch i rarely rank movies as a 10 but i give this one a 10 br br go find it and watch it
<START> first one has to take into account the time period this film was made in 1995 <UNK> were in it and that added to the flair of it br br <UNK> was a socially awkward teen trying to find his way and couldn't until he met and was <UNK> by nazis they took him in <UNK> aren't all this awkward but like most gangs they fill a void that is missing be it economic social emotional whatever michael <UNK> played the part perfectly br br omar <UNK> was the hot shot track star with a questionable work <UNK> and a chip on his shoulder he kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his plight and had his girlfriend and professor to <UNK> him out on it br br <UNK> was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in until she was date raped she then found her self experiment with her sexuality and getting involved politically br br this film deals with racism and like most things that deal with racism people's own perspectives come into play br br i read so many comments about how there were no <UNK> black characters but there were evil white one nazis so what <UNK> wasn't portrayed as evil at all he was trying to find his way and kept failing until some <UNK> accepted him he was scared it was sad to see him <UNK> how he did he even says right before he kills himself i didn't mean it i wanted to be an engineer br br ice cube and <UNK> <UNK> were angry black men ice cube was somewhat of an intellectual and <UNK> <UNK> was just portrayed as a dumb thug they both showed no consideration at all for their roommates and generally appear to not like white people very much they were angry like the nazis but not on the level of nazis in terms of overall badness sorry if this makes it seem unfair but are there really black groups like the nazis no br br people say it shows white bad black good not true the only bad white characters were the nazis and the police which is more or less true in real life <UNK> was a good girl her boyfriend omar <UNK> roommate was a good guy and even <UNK> was a good guy he was just misguided br br omar <UNK> ice cube and <UNK> were seriously flawed characters angry and <UNK> although their constant <UNK> by police seemed to justify some of their anger <UNK> inability to fit in seemed to justify his anger as well br br good movie well done like all movies that deal with racism its a great piece to get a discussion going br br i don't think cube and <UNK> <UNK> beat those nazis though
<START> the <UNK> is a strange film its main character julian played with an unusual mix of charm and <UNK> by brosnan is not your typical hero julian is a hit man who is experiencing a late mid life <UNK> having spent 22 years in the profession of cold blooded murder he now finds himself <UNK> out and desperately lonely and so after a chance meeting at a bar with danny greg kinnear he <UNK> on and begins a <UNK> awkward friendship danny the quintessential nice guy is dealing with some stuff in his own life and truth be told could use a friend as well the two make an unexpected connection and danny sticks around to hear <UNK> story even after learning the <UNK> truth about <UNK> work br br <UNK> approaches a subject not completely <UNK> of in cinema the anti hero assassin films like <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> come to mind but <UNK> <UNK> in several key ways first of all the killing and gore is implied but never really shown in any detail meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an <UNK> rush this movie will probably disappoint you and second unlike most anti hero films <UNK> makes no attempt to show <UNK> and redemption from its main character <UNK> job is simply presented as an <UNK> is what it <UNK> kind of thing this is unusual given that 99 99 of us would consider killing for money horrific and yet this <UNK> approach is perhaps what makes the film feel authentic although we don't like to admit it almost anything could become mundane after we did it long enough maybe even murder did <UNK> victims deserve to die who is paying to have people killed who knows the movie never deals with these questions the focus is on julian and his stumbling <UNK> into a genuine friendship if you read about someone like julian in the paper you would have a passing thought that people like him should be ripped out of society like a cancer but forced to watch his life you are drawn in by his intense humanity sympathy for the devil i guess br br <UNK> take on julian is well done and deeply unsettling he doesn't completely divorce himself from his james bond good looks and smooth charm but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix weird or crude remarks in the middle polite conversations and sudden shifts from suave charm to childish <UNK> and sad desperate <UNK> for acceptance it keeps you guessing about his grasp on his sanity and how it will affect those around him it's a bit like listening to a piano player that occasionally and unexpectedly hits a wrong note while he plays but it works the films only other major role that of danny is not nearly as <UNK> kinnear turns in a solid if <UNK> performance as a regular joe with a regular joe life and problems br br the film doesn't really have any huge shocks or m night <UNK> twists but i wasn't able to guess the ending and it felt satisfying it doesn't have any deep philosophical or spiritual insights and yet it felt very human and it didn't have any heart <UNK> car chases or gun battles and yet i thought the pacing was well done and i was never bored maybe the only real message here is about the human need to reach out and make connections with one another and how those needs have no moral <UNK> even a murderer needs friends and even good people can be friends with bad people it's a comment on the strange random world we live in a good film worth seeing
<START> when i first saw this film i thought it should have come from the children's section it's very fun and at times humorous and is actually quite a good story but it severely lacks the romantic chemistry that actors like meg ryan and tim robbins are capable of delivering i must note that walter matthau is perfect for the part of albert einstein and his performance is extraordinary but that's the sole exception this film appears a bit forced the directing lacks substance and oh yeah the music is ridiculously awful it didn't put me in a very good mood but if you are not expecting a smart well crafted comedy romance tale then this certainly can be entertaining like i said it should be in the children's section einstein and his buddies are a good relief from tim <UNK> boring almost tense quest to steal meg <UNK> heart a very <UNK> film but as long as it's not taken seriously this can be an alright movie
<START> this film plays in the 60s and is about an italian family <UNK> his wife <UNK> and their two children <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> in italy to <UNK> in the <UNK> area i like this film because i think it is quite realistic it shows problems which many foreign families have when they come to another country they have to get used to a new culture a new environment and this can be difficult especially if you don't know the language it is difficult for the family but they find a way they open a restaurant which offers typical italian food and it is named <UNK> like their hometown the film also shows different conflicts <UNK> and <UNK> fall in love with the same girl and although <UNK> has to work very hard <UNK> refuses to pay money to engage more workers etc etc but stop i don't want to tell you how it goes on you should watch the film yourself it's a nice one i have also made a <UNK> about it and examined scenes which show different cultural attitudes and there are a few
<START> you've heard it said to live every moment as if it's your last whether it's your last day or not i beg you not to waste any part of it watching this <UNK> <UNK> provides some nice moments of eye candy that alas stays wrapped and david <UNK> shows why he should stick to the small screen or dog food commercials a shallow unrealistic plot with dreadful dialogue means there is no art in the art of revenge br br
<START> this was my second time watching the film via the french language version as opposed to the first which was dubbed in italian and i feel that it <UNK> on subsequent viewings br br a compelling if slowly built up character study that's beautifully shot and with the <UNK> settings being equally impressive in the long run it's not top grade polanski and i would rank it at number 9 in his filmography but it's still a confident mix of subtle chills and surprisingly often broad comedy it also features a fine cast all of whom are in good form but especially isabelle <UNK> melvyn douglas and jo van fleet br br even so i'm a bit <UNK> by the sudden <UNK> for <UNK> to <UNK> into the previous tenant apart from the owner of the <UNK> opposite the apartment building where he is given whatever <UNK> used to have without asking him if he wished any different there is little to indicate as far as i could <UNK> anyway that this is what everybody wanted of him okay so he found <UNK> <UNK> still lying in the apartment but what exactly drove him to wear her dresses and make himself up as her even if he apparently started doing this <UNK> following his nightmarish visions in the bathroom the last section of the film where <UNK> all but disappears is almost anti climactic especially the scene where the <UNK> and the other <UNK> witness his attempted suicide as if it were a night at the opera a concept which had already been used <UNK> years earlier by jean <UNK> in the blood of a poet 1930 br br the ending then is at once predictable and <UNK> just what made the two <UNK> of this particular apartment jump out of the window i remember this factor <UNK> me on first viewing as well and i'm sorry to say it's no <UNK> now mind you the film's first two thirds are pretty solid but i wish that polanski had been less <UNK> on obscure plot points throughout
<START> as i understand it after the chinese took over hong kong the infamous cat 3 hong kong movies kind of disappeared at least until now and what an amazing movie this one is i knew it was a rough crime drama going in but being the first cat 3 i've purchased that's been made recently i wasn't sure what to expect br br a <UNK> hit man goes to hong kong to knock off the wife of a judge who is also a lawyer turns out the judge made the <UNK> for the hit man because she was <UNK> the judge and threatening to take all his money this is all known within the first ten minutes so nothing is being given away after the hit the cops locate the hit man pretty fast but in trying to arrest him several police officers and civilians are killed he <UNK> the police and now the race is on to catch the guy before he escapes back to cambodia this is a movie that never stops and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath yes it is very violent and intense many cops are killed as the hit man proves very very hard to track and take down when they do locate him along the way the hit man in trying to hide in a dump finds a women being raped and <UNK> by some man he helps her and saves her from the guy and she <UNK> the hit man to take her along with him in his escape i loved this movie it's like a roller coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed as one incident leads to another and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hit man the acting is exceptionally good and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking there's no let up in this movie not even with the very very incredible ending the ending is pretty much unbelievable and also a fitting end to all the action and violence yes the violence is brutal at times but this is a very no nonsense crime drama that will knock your <UNK> off dog eat dog definitely needs a more <UNK> release including an <UNK> release for sure great movie highly recommended
<START> would have better <UNK> considerably by making it as a br br 50 minute episode of the outer limits too much superfluous material and stuff like the chief bad guy looking like he'd escaped from the phantom of the opera didn't help the whole <UNK> of the living <UNK> sequence was extremely silly and quite unnecessary after all if the dead were to <UNK> anyone for their sins now remind me exactly who was killing everyone again
<START> the actors play wonderfully especially kenneth branagh himself it's good that robin williams got the comedy role of <UNK> otherwise it could be a bit strange to see him in such a production it is really great that kenneth decided to use the <UNK> version of the text this happens definitely not too often thanks to that the viewers can see the whole not the chosen by the director parts also thank god that the film is in a classical form no to <UNK> <UNK> although <UNK> <UNK> was impressive nevertheless but still hamlet is a different story at least that's my point of view
<START> it's hard to believe an action packed jet li movie could be so boring but this was <UNK> trash the plot is an <UNK> of other hong kong <UNK> flicks the martial arts action is all special effects and no human talent br br it's a comic book story about a group of super human soldiers who are to be killed because they're mentally unstable one of their number li who holds off an incompetent army to save them and <UNK> a life as a <UNK> <UNK> the saved killers <UNK> with an austin powers quality plot to take over the world and li <UNK> his new life to save the world br br the version i saw was dubbed and that may have <UNK> the cheesiness of the <UNK> thin plot and comic book 25 <UNK> special effects but i suspect even ninja turtle watching 8 year olds would have found this juvenile and hollow
<START> a movie documentary about different people in <UNK> on the <UNK> weekend of the year it follows what they are doing and maybe more what they are not doing the <UNK> is very quiet so you have to relax breathe in breathe out before you see it br br first you think but nothing is happening and you get a little angry over that and thats the problem because its the mood of the film and the really nice social realistic pictures which are nice in this film a lot of people will say its disgusting but its not that bad i think its more used for the marketing and <UNK> some really funny moments a 60 old woman <UNK> i guarantee its the most <UNK> <UNK> in film history its movie which is real i think thats the word right up in your face and that makes it a bit scary no computer manipulation here its real life and as we all know movies can win over reality when it comes to doing sick things so its much worse in the real world br br if you survive the movie you can start to look at your neighbors and think maybe they are like the persons in the movie i bet <UNK> a lot of them out there sick crazy people living with a nice <UNK> after <UNK> the movie i feel its more interesting to look at my neighbors br br but maybe you <UNK> see this movie on your first date
<START> the author of the book by the same title should not have let her name be used for this movie if you have read the book this movie takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events in the book and its spirit that the movie and book seem to have quite little in common except the title and some superficial details the movie adds nothing in terms of artistic merit to the <UNK> own literary achievement br br for those who have not read the book you will also be disappointed not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace it doesn't offer anything more while it is moving slowly like character development for example some viewers might be entertained by some of the graphic lesbian love scenes later on in the movie but you might as well watch a showtime special for the stuff they show in <UNK> and isabelle its fairly tame and not imaginative at all
<START> plan b is strictly by the numbers fare except for one thing i surprisingly found it to be rather insulting br br jon <UNK> is the star of this film and plays his usual smarmy <UNK> <UNK> character that was actually endearing in pretty in pink and has not been amusing ever since grating doesn't even begin to describe his performance ricky mark <UNK> is a muscular blonde struggling actor who gasp is only worried about his hair and getting laid talk about a stock character ugh at least the other three characters are somewhat engaging lisa <UNK> and lance guest play a grounded optimistic caring couple who are struggling to <UNK> since they are not whiny drama queens however their roles are apparently considered boring and they aren't given enough screen time sara <UNK> rounds out the cast by playing gina your usual nice and good looking young woman who just can't seem to find the right partner in love i've seen this character a million times before but at least her performance <UNK> some of the <UNK> caused by the predictability of her situation br br what <UNK> me about this film was its juvenile promotion of stereotypes they introduced a russian character for the sole purpose of mocking him and making fun of the way he talked he was portrayed as being wild ignorant and amazingly shallow they were just getting <UNK> up though for the usual nonsense about gays gina decides to be gay for a while since she isn't having any luck with guys honestly that wasn't that bad except they really went overboard when gina brought a lesbian to a christmas party her friends were throwing her lesbian date had very short hair like i'm sure all lesbians do she also got quite upset like i'm sure all lesbians do when gina had the nerve to put on <UNK> finally her date goes around the party hitting on just about every woman there and mouths off when gina expresses her disappointment of course we all know how gay people can't stay faithful for so much as a couple of hours much less months or even years right please note the sarcasm in that statement thank you br br this film was based on a tired and predictable premise to begin with but <UNK> unlikable performance combined with the idiotic stereotyping sinks this movie to the lower depths of cinema 2 10
<START> dear me peter sellers was one of the most oddly talented actors there has been but his choice of films say after 1964 was very unfortunate he didn't seem to realize how to use his talents he would have been better off working with more of the <UNK> of the film world than the people he did of his later films only the <UNK> of nine <UNK> and being there have impressed me of those i have seen br br that said the <UNK> and sellers had made a few films prior to this that hardly sound that bad i have yet to see <UNK> <UNK> and heavens above at least in the sense of using sellers well to a degree but there's a girl in my soup really is a poor film and a dire choice on <UNK> part in terms of character in his films from 1955 64 you can usually expect at least some very inventive twist and always an enigmatic conviction in his roles here you have peter sellers trying to play a typical romantic lead it's almost sellers playing a niven <UNK> without the <UNK> he certainly does not convince try as he might or create an interesting character he should have left such parts to masters of <UNK> such as cary grant and concentrated on those intriguing dramatic and comic roles that he was famed for br br hawn and sellers really do not establish any genuine chemistry this is no easy <UNK> romance of the like <UNK> by william powell and myrna loy it is very artificial seeming all the way through i know that it is part of <UNK> character that he is a dry <UNK> of ladies but he doesn't really change from that in a way that convinces sellers has a very grating way of playing charm as well this character really has no depth and really does not gain the viewer's sympathy or interest sellers goes through the motions in a way one would not think possible when remembering the <UNK> of his <UNK> <UNK> performance in <UNK> br br there really is nothing to say about the plot direction or characters as frankly they leave little or no impression this is truly one of the most <UNK> <UNK> misguided and lightly dull films i have ever seen a <UNK> of a vehicle for <UNK> <UNK> talents br br rating 1 2
<START> it's a great american martial arts movie the fighting scenes were pretty impressive for american movie made in 90's of course the fighting scenes aren't that good as in <UNK> kong movies actually only few american movies have fighting scenes which are as good as in <UNK> kong movies even nowadays when you watch american martial arts movie you are expecting to see less impressive fighting scenes but still having some nice moves which can be surprisingly good sometimes or at least that's what i'm expecting from these movies i was impressed by this film some fighting scenes were really impressive the acting direction and the plot were good enough so it's a really worth watching movie if you like american martial arts films of the 90's
<START> the directing behind this film was fantastic for a comedy many of the scenes appear to be out of a comic book and much darker visually not story wise than what i expected granted this may not be the funniest movie ever made especially if you are into very crude sexist jokes as this has very little of that compared to others like something about mary or american pie as you <UNK> it several jokes stand out and get funnier if you have ever read a comic book or watched a comic book type movie batman x men etc and liked them you will probably enjoy the subtle humor that continues throughout the movie if you didn't like them you may like the <UNK> <UNK> that this film has for those if you did like this movie the dvd has some cool extras 8 10
<START> first of all i saw this movie when i was 7 years old at a christian <UNK> i attended needless to say that i was scared out of mind not because it was scary but because the content <UNK> i was 7 anyway the cinematography was pretty bad and the acting was cheesy that's very bad considering that i was only 7 and i remember that the one thing that still <UNK> me is that dreadful song i wish we all were ready where the chorus ends with you were left behind i wouldn't suggest seeing this one i probably will just for nostalgic reason besides i'm sure the remake is much better the best part of this movie though has to be when everyone <UNK> <UNK> cars crashing <UNK> running on their own pretty hilarious
<START> well it looked good on paper nick cage and jerry <UNK> <UNK> again this time on a mix of heist movie da <UNK> code american history 101 and indiana jones but oh dear this is to indiana jones what speed 2 is to speed a reasonable cast including john voight and harvey keitel battles against a <UNK> script and loses badly the film is little more than an extended <UNK> for the <UNK> however these <UNK> are not your usual <UNK> who use funny <UNK> and play golf these <UNK> are the natural <UNK> of the knights <UNK> and nobody mention <UNK> <UNK> or jack the <UNK> i don't think i've revealed any plot spoilers because there are none there is virtually no suspense no surprises and no climax it just stops national treasure aims for dan brown but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of scooby doo sans the humour
<START> as someone who has both read the novel and seen the film i have a different take on why the film was such a flop first any comparisons between novel and film are purely superficial they are two different animals br br the novel is probably intended as a satire but it arrives as a cross between tragedy and <UNK> instead any comedic elements such as those which later formed the <UNK> basis of the film version are merely incidental to the author's uniformly cynical thrust and <UNK> the <UNK> white suit of the author fool you into thinking this is another mark <UNK> think again a more apt literary <UNK> would be the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> in a top hat and <UNK> tom <UNK> is equal parts clown and hack more celebrity than author always looking for new <UNK> for his self absorbed mill br br it is therefore no wonder that the excellent production skills and direction <UNK> on the making of the film were doomed from the start unlike true satire which <UNK> very well into film <UNK> are grounded not in universally accessible observations on some form or other of human behavior but in a single minded attack on specific people whether real or fictional straw men who have somehow earned the wrath of the writer any effort to create a successful filmed story or narrative from such a beginning must have a clean start free of the writer's influence or <UNK> br br having said that i too find fault with the casting it is not merely that <UNK> like bruce willis and <UNK> griffith fail to measure up but that real talents like tom hanks f murray abraham and morgan freeman are either totally wasted or given roles that are mere caricatures br br there is enough <UNK> material here for a truly great film satire but it fails to come even close
<START> this is the prime example of low budget winning over what would be a good story line let's bring back <UNK> armstrong having seen her work on the o c i know she can do better then find a better script and budget br br the special effects were so bad and mostly badly computer generated that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen on screen and <UNK> <UNK> alert changing into a werewolf was done by <UNK> her at first to a bad <UNK> figure before she even begins to change final <UNK> humans as well as <UNK> made these laughable think of the figure as a nude <UNK> doll br br the story of was interesting though the idea of <UNK> in werewolves is nothing new as it also got into the balance between evil maybe not so evil and the possible end of human kind should the two lines mate the subplot of a book of werewolf <UNK> which <UNK> some of the other characters in a spell like manner for a while was effective but could have been expanded more in explaining what had happened in the past br br bring in a better script and direction and i'd come back again
<START> i do not envy barry <UNK> rachel <UNK> ben stiller or jack black for doing this film it's in one word boring maybe the fact that is too predictable the more than exploited ben <UNK> loser role or the not at all funny scenes make this film just something to forget even christopher <UNK> appearance finishes in a pathetic way i was very disappointed i love ben <UNK> acting i loved it in most of his films the last one i saw before this was <UNK> with drew barrymore and was not that bad about jack black well apart from high <UNK> i've never seen him doing something good what about school of rock <UNK> frightening
<START> i hate this movie i hate the show i hate just about everything about it it's so annoying and stupid everyone's saying that <UNK> and alex <UNK> are heroes in the music world and that they're going to make it big what kind of drugs are you taking <UNK> and alex are going to end up as either <UNK> or end up like jane hudson from whatever happened to baby jane i could only get through not even 20 minutes of this one barely 30 seconds of the show and i managed to survive about half an hour of <UNK> of the <UNK> how anyone could cheer for these guys in the audience at the kid's choice awards i have no clue days before the movie premiere on nick most of the teen girl actresses on nick jamie spears emma roberts lindsey shaw etc showed up in a commercial <UNK> brain dead kids about how awesome <UNK> and alex <UNK> are first off they <UNK> t trick me and second of all <UNK> and alex probably either drugged them or <UNK> them loads of money in order to say that and sound convincing because i don't see how anyone could find this show movie entertaining the music is just awful <UNK> singing sounds like a sick dying <UNK> on crack alex is the most annoying movie tv show character ever he's not funny he's annoying he's really weird and he thinks he's hot and knows everything about girls this guy's lucky if he ever manages to get laid you know this show is fake when you find out that some of the characters in real life don't even exist the character jesse is actually played by <UNK> and <UNK> cousin jesse <UNK> they <UNK> had some budget problem their father is not single he's married to polly <UNK> but she doesn't appear on the show making it seem the <UNK> are mom less <UNK> doesn't exist either her name is <UNK> <UNK> i'll tell ya the naked brothers are gonna be in some deep sh when their fans find out the whole thing is staged 0 10
<START> this movie was disgusting their should be a warning that some sadistic nasty writer is attempting to make a name for herself before being held hostage for an hour and a half watching garbage what is garbage the <UNK> of peoples time the <UNK> of energy and the waste of whatever type of educational system that taught her how to read and write <UNK> you are a sick demented loser your psychiatrist needs to <UNK> stronger <UNK> for your problem br br the acting and plot gave me no choice but to fast forward through the middle of the garbage i ended up at a scene that was <UNK> for if you want to learn how to shock people watch a larry clark movie i lost all respect for the entire cast of this movie no more support from me how could actors or actresses sit on a set while such gross depictions of human behavior is <UNK> from the mind of a psycho i feel sorry for all actors that took part in that scene i think the devil now knows who the writer of this movie is <UNK> you won his attention
<START> although it's not as creepy as it's cult classic predecessor zombi 2 i actually like this one better this is because of it's faster pace better settings and cool 80's soundtrack it's loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by lucio fulci the zombies don't quite look as nasty as in zombi 2 but they still look good it was made pretty well but it definitely has it's share of cheesiness for instance some zombies move really slow while others are as quick as ninjas some are <UNK> while others say funny lines but who expects <UNK> when it comes to italian horror there's even a flying zombie head how <UNK> is that definitely a must see for <UNK> and zombie fans it'd probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well also check out zombi 4
<START> the time is the future and for many not aware of it that day is now in this final movie for legendary actor edward g robinson <UNK> green becomes a landmark classic many a film buff and <UNK> believe this is our eventual history the movie is taken from the novel entitled <UNK> room make <UNK> but who's working title was changed to <UNK> green the story concerns the earth as it <UNK> into the future with the world's <UNK> problems becoming nothing short of <UNK> the <UNK> natural resources have been exhausted and basic food has been reduced to simple <UNK> they come in a variety of colors such as <UNK> yellow <UNK> red and now <UNK> green ' however there are those who know the <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> green and cringe at their own <UNK> and fear divine <UNK> the first is a food executive named william r <UNK> joseph <UNK> upon his death a dedicated police detective called robert thorn <UNK> heston seeks the truth behind his apparent suicide although corruption goes all the way to the top it begins with <UNK> bodyguard tad <UNK> chuck <UNK> and security chief <UNK> roy <UNK> who target thorn for a waste <UNK> factory <UNK> boss lt <UNK> <UNK> peters believes his <UNK> but warns him of those <UNK> and <UNK> who want the case closed but thorn will not risk his job for an easy way out what thorn discovers marks him for death but like the film <UNK> a final warning
<START> most of us at least inhabit two worlds the real world where we are at the mercy of circumstances and the world within the unconscious a safe place where we can escape with those words mr gone introduces inside the world of the <UNK> a fascinating world where the fantasy and the reality are combined inspired in the comic books of sam <UNK> the <UNK> is very faithful to the material in what it was inspired not only in the story but also in the graphic style that look like the pages of the comic giving this show a surreal and unique appearance but also the story it's interesting and entertaining at moments it could turn too weird but when you got inside it it's hard to get out of it the story and the characters are wonderfully developed the music goes perfectly with the style of the show and give it the proper atmosphere unfortunately like many good animated shows this one was short lived the <UNK> is a must see it 's one of my all time favorites
<START> like so many media experiments this amateurish effort contains <UNK> of a very interesting social commentary in the 5 years since it was released the premise has been made less outrageous by real world events in <UNK> development and i found it less boring than the previous <UNK> for that reason i imagine the director clearly is a fan of hitchcock and it's too bad that the film was not better executed but in fact it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction including the soundtrack <UNK> at us when we are supposed to pay attention one can almost see the <UNK> points and capital letters on a <UNK> page br br i have to admit i found it rather entertaining for all these reasons and more sometimes the slick has less to offer us and i would recommend it to anyone interested in <UNK> it for education purposes oh yes and even though the <UNK> showed and it <UNK> a lot my heart rate went up and i was reluctant to get up and take a break
<START> amazing performance from simon pegg who just gets better and better with every role as usual he plays the part of a very <UNK> character who makes you want to hide behind your <UNK> in embarrassment for him sometimes but thats what pegg is all about br br the laughs were regular and eye <UNK> and everyone of them aimed at penn the movie was very cleverly put together where every character plays a very sophisticated and serious part with penn being the only humour involved which is a huge credit to the director robert <UNK> br br and i cant let this one go without a quick round of applause to gilliam anderson who <UNK> throughout highly recommended to all
<START> he he hello this is a really fun movie basically in party girl you have your fun <UNK> independent early 90's new <UNK> chick along with her party friends she meets a mature turkish <UNK> it is a <UNK> of age story for those new adults who are searching for what they want to do it is <UNK> to see a female <UNK> develop into a mature woman hope is given to all of us <UNK> who might feel like their only skills are being able to maintain while <UNK> and a <UNK> for throwing good parties br br on a side note parker posey makes this movie great i have never been a great fan of her but this movie makes me just want to watch all of her movies there are subtle <UNK> that <UNK> her character if you want good laughs and a fun time make sure to watch this movie repeated viewings are a must
<START> for months i've been hearing about this little movie and now i've seen it i find it cute cute how so many <UNK> directors make movies where they combine other people's creative ideas in order to make their own one joke premise of a movie troops <UNK> any of the million blair witch parodies come to mind if all that these directors want is a foot inside hollywood's door then they're doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot <UNK> is how hollywood makes films how many times have you heard the phrase it's animal house meets back to the future it's wall street meets dead <UNK> society or shakespeare in love meets star wars i remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable
<START> <UNK> in between san francisco and <UNK> courageous two of spencer <UNK> greatest parts is this very curious film about war and the effects it has on some people they gave him a gun stars spencer tracy and <UNK> tone in the only film they ever made together and <UNK> george as the woman who loves them both br br tracy and tone are a couple of world war i <UNK> tone is a weak character who almost goes over the hill in boot camp but tracy stops him tracy is still playing the lovable <UNK> younger wallace <UNK> type that mgm <UNK> for him when they signed him away from fox br br over at the front tone gets an opportunity and takes it when during a fight he manages to get to a church tower that peers down on a german machine gun nest he's learned to shoot by now and he does a sergeant york but alvin c york was never changed by the war the way tone has br br wounded in the fight tone <UNK> at a hospital with <UNK> george looking out for him tracy goes <UNK> himself to visit his pal and he and george get something going later on when tracy is reported missing in action tone and george marry <UNK> <UNK> when he comes back and learns of the marriage but takes sit in <UNK> br br the rest of the film is dealing with tone <UNK> the the wartime skills he's learned to the gangster trade he's a hit man now and george doesn't really know what he does for a living i think you can figure the rest out br br the part of the film that gave me some trouble is that i can't believe <UNK> george couldn't figure it out she's a street smart girl her part is very much like the one she played in the roaring <UNK> opposite james cagney br br speaking of the roaring <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> character development there is similar to <UNK> although he was not the central character of the movie in fact there are elements of they gave him a gun that are to be found in taxi driver and in clint eastwood's classic the <UNK> br br the world war i battle sequences are very well staged by director woody van dyke for some reason leonard <UNK> <UNK> this film i think it's a lot better than he gave it credit
<START> diana <UNK> is an angry young woman surviving an <UNK> series of <UNK> and <UNK> she takes her anger out on the closest targets br br when she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a <UNK> boxing club she knows she's found her home br br the film progresses from there as diana learns the usual coming of age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing michelle rodriguez is very good in the role particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman <UNK> in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but <UNK> <UNK> br br the picture could use some <UNK> in its direction of all the young actors who pale in comparison to the older more experienced cast there are too many pauses in the script which <UNK> from the dramatic tension the overall <UNK> of the film <UNK> it of intensity br br this is a good picture to see once if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose <UNK> is complex enough to include her power its limitations prevent it from being placed in the see it again and again category
<START> sensitive film does lack brilliance and to some degree narrative structure but is nevertheless superbly shot and performed however the narrative structure point is <UNK> while it gives the impression of <UNK> off loose ends nicely in the final scenes and <UNK> its thoughts with what might be described by the modern viewer as a story i'm <UNK> as to whether this feel needs a narrative structure that is definite and <UNK> inevitably it will be compared with <UNK> in that its central protagonist i'm not sure that's the correct word is a young and very young looking woman whose newly discovered sexuality both <UNK> and <UNK> her although of course <UNK> <UNK> film <UNK> this aspect better but while the possibility exists for reckless viewers to dismiss this film as a cliché <UNK> is in some ways much more ambitious than <UNK> perhaps that's where it doesn't quite make it it's certainly very different to <UNK> first feature the interview i'm not quite sure how the sex scenes between <UNK> and lung added to the story who knows maybe they did they certainly <UNK> home the <UNK> and flawed nature of <UNK> character although i personally think this was achieved without the need for these scenes br br just saw the film again br br on a second viewing i can see how some would dismiss it as a <UNK> dressed up as a feature but i'm not sure how distinct these <UNK> are anymore or even if we should be making that distinction in any case i do think there are enough layers in the film to <UNK> it from hallmark efforts on the other hand the film's structure is very <UNK> and its content is hardly challenging at least in the way <UNK> tom white three dollars the illustrated family doctor look both ways and the human touch are the performances are all good but i did come to the <UNK> that the main reason i was enjoying the film was because it fit the australian genre without necessarily adding anything and i can understand that this can be a fairly good reason for another person not to like it indeed it wasn't until lung enters the room in her <UNK> dress that the film really begins to pack a punch but that leads us into another debate should we expect that a film must challenge us all the time certainly i enjoy being challenged by a film or a book or other people but is there no room anymore for what is simply a nice story br br i haven't deleted my initial post on this film because i'm all too aware of the <UNK> overtones of such an act but i would <UNK> my initial rating from an 8 to perhaps a 6 5 br br as for nominations for <UNK> best film my votes go to the human touch three dollars and look both ways and i think look both ways should win
<START> another case of a decent dvd case <UNK> the shot on video quality of the film br br it wasn't that bad <UNK> does a <UNK> job and damn the cast is good looking i've never seen that many <UNK> guys hang out together on a regular basis this movie really wanted to make you think <UNK> was the killer but it was not to be my biggest problem with the film was that by the end i didn't much care who was the killer and the real killer made little sense since it was out of the blue and the filmmakers were thinking <UNK> <UNK> didn't see that one coming sucker ' yeah there were continuity errors about mainly with ms <UNK> ever changing wardrobe but for an indie slasher it's not that bad i was pretty sure at the beginning it was just a <UNK> <UNK> excuse for girls to go topless but that was just a gimmick the dialog was overly think and painful at times br br just don't have high expectations going into this and it won't be that bad and lloyd <UNK> cameo is wonderfully understated
<START> this film was absolutely brilliant every performance in this film is excellent especially jake <UNK> and chris cooper it looks like mr <UNK> will have a huge film career if this is anything to go by i thought that joe <UNK> was an odd choice as director as he is usually associated <UNK> big budget blockbusters <UNK> honey i <UNK> the kids he pulls of every scene with sheer class my favourite scene was where homer is going down the <UNK> and looking at the sky going down as all of his dreams were it was beautiful joe <UNK> should direct more of these brilliant acting driven films as well as his big budget blockbuster <UNK> which is also excellent kudos to all involved in this masterpiece
<START> hilarious film i saw this film at the 2002 sydney gay and lesbian <UNK> <UNK> film festival and laughed from start to finish the acting was subtle but very funny i'm not entirely certain about the real world influence we don't get that here but the film holds up without the understanding of that show heather b steals every scene she appears in most notably when acting with her seldom <UNK> red co star highly recommended i'd love to see this released on video dvd some time in the future
<START> a convict serving time comes forward to give the cold case unit information about the murder of a policeman committed years before the murder of sean cooper a good cop was never solved naturally the detectives believe the new evidence will help them put together all the pieces of the puzzle that frustrated their colleagues br br in flashbacks we are taken to the <UNK> of james <UNK> baby sean and jimmy were partners there is tension as sean who is the godfather arrives <UNK> and late for the <UNK> <UNK> bruno doesn't appear to be happy being there the real mystery is revealed by her she caught sean who was drinking with jimmy in the backyard kiss her husband and more shocking yet jimmy <UNK> willingly br br somehow at the station the partners become the center of <UNK> sean has not <UNK> himself to his superior because he discovered the involvement with a criminal in his area who controlled the drug business sean realizes this man is in with the drug strong man because he always makes an excuse to free the <UNK> <UNK> sean and jimmy <UNK> into the station all the time the pressure is too much on jimmy sean is comfortable in his homosexuality and wants to be honest about it <UNK> own father doesn't want anything to do with a <UNK> son even his superior <UNK> wants him out of his <UNK> but the case is complicated because cooper comes from a long line of irish men serving in the police force sean is killed because his homosexual condition and for knowing too much on his <UNK> involvement in taking dirty money br br tom <UNK> wrote this honest portrayal of the life of a police officer in the closet and his secret love with another fellow cop we thought it was a frank account of a serious matter no one talked about in those days sometimes the people involved with the show <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> or the networks don't dare to present these real situations <UNK> <UNK> shows a sensitive approach to this <UNK> issue which is dealt without the <UNK> the case might have been shown with a different team br br there is a rare <UNK> everett appearance as the older jimmy bruno his take is right on target with a touch of sentimentality that doesn't get out of hand <UNK> johnson makes an excellent contribution to the show as sean cooper the cast is marvelous and it includes good all around performances from everyone under mr <UNK> direction br br in this episode nick vera gets closer to his neighbor the mother of the basketball player the detective took his ball away nick is heading for romance with the woman
<START> in this forgettable <UNK> the 40 ish norma <UNK> plays a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> caught in a <UNK> between george sanders and robert taylor it would be <UNK> to blame this movie's failure on the dull talky script or director george <UNK> who never seems interested in <UNK> up the film's generally <UNK> state mostly though it's the fault of <UNK> herself who desperately wanted to keep playing young parts as long as she could get away with it inadvertently this makes her cardboard lover a bizarre <UNK> to an aging woman's vanity
<START> nathan detroit runs illegal <UNK> games for high <UNK> in nyc but the heat is on and he can't find a secure location he <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sky masterson that sky can't make a <UNK> <UNK> sarah brown go out to dinner with him sky takes up the challenge but both men have some surprises in store  br br this is one of those expensive fifties mgm musicals in <UNK> colour with big sets loud music larger than life roles and performances to match broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing which i don't my main problem with these type of movies is simply the music i like all kinds of music from <UNK> to <UNK> top but broadway show tunes in swing time with never ending <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at the end of every fourth bar aren't my cup of tea this was written by the tag team of frank <UNK> <UNK> jo <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> based on a couple of damon <UNK> stories and while the plot is quite <UNK> the songs are weak <UNK> two numbers for example are identical unnecessary don't advance the plot and <UNK> on the ears and are also <UNK> misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you there are only two memorable tunes luck be a lady sung by brando not sinatra as you might expect and sit down you're <UNK> the boat nicely performed by <UNK> but you have to sit through two hours to get to them the movie's <UNK> card is a young brando giving a thoughtful laid back performance he also sings quite well and even dances a little and is <UNK> matched with the always interesting simmons the sequence where the two of them escape to <UNK> for the night is a welcome <UNK> from all the noise <UNK> and <UNK> murdering of <UNK> <UNK> fans of musicals may dig this but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show
<START> i have a feeling that dr <UNK> was intended for an audience composed entirely of children i think i would have had a better time if i sat at home and watched a sit com my favorite characters in the movie were the pet <UNK> and the two alley mice
<START> there were good performances by robin williams and others but the movie was dull overall and very disappointing compared to the positive reviews br br i thought <UNK> might become a serial killer who <UNK> people to death a <UNK> guy in ugly clothes <UNK> his victims around food <UNK> <UNK> oprah and <UNK> his medical history until they beg him to shoot them br br i think the movie mostly appeals to <UNK> who think strangers are interested in their photos i expect most <UNK> workers want a break from the customers
<START> this is one of the worst films i have ever seen it is bad even at tv movie level standards the plot is <UNK> flawed and the known names in this film are wasted on confused uncertain characters i don't know how the director managed to keep this excuse of a film together it is that bad billed as a <UNK> horror <UNK> it is certainly horrific there is nothing thrilling about it and it could do you psychological damage the initial opening scenes held such promise a possible <UNK> on whether the soul is just an aspect of the brain but the utter <UNK> that followed the car crash scene is beyond belief no matter how hard you try you couldn't care less about the characters there are so many <UNK> ideas that the film is at best a <UNK> of <UNK> phrases from chinese <UNK> and at worst the film would actually make you go brain dead br br i have purchased over 300 films on dvd and this is the first one i'm going to get my money back on steer clear
<START> simply terrible why wouldn't you use actual actors look this has to stop stop using non actors if you want any credibility or any message sent via these low budget films please for the love of god use real actors most will work for free take advantage of that now back to my comment anyway the humour was lower than that of the bathroom variety and wasn't funny on any level as for the quality in one scene filmed on a public <UNK> bus you could see the reflection of the crew guess what it was one guy with what looked like a <UNK> camcorder and probably not even his well i assume the only audience for this film are people with a gore fetish and it wasn't even good gore
<START> this film has good characters with excellent performances from the cast david <UNK> is <UNK> sincere as the child <UNK> salesman and danny <UNK> plays a perfect <UNK> whipped southern husband the slick soundtrack betrays the murder <UNK> tone of the film
<START> i think this piece of garbage is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed why all the american animators thinks that the kids this days wants stupid <UNK> joe versions of good stories the looney tunes are some of the most beloved characters in history but they weren't created to be <UNK> i mean come on tiny <UNK> was a great example of how an old idea can be updated without <UNK> it's original charm but this piece of garbage is just an example of stupid corporate decisions that only wants to create a cheap idiotic show that kids will love because hey kids loves <UNK> right the whole show is only a waste of time in which we see the new versions of the looney tunes but this time in superhero form this doesn't sound too bad but the problem is that this show tries too hard to copy series like batman the animated series or the new justice league the result bad copies of flash the road runner or superman who else bugs bunny the problem is that looney tunes weren't meant to be dramatic the were supposed to be funny as i said before this series sucks and many people wonders why anime is taking all over the world this show tries to be dramatic and action packed but that's something that few series and anime are able to do if you want to see a good <UNK> of an old show watch tiny <UNK> that's an example that it's possible to bring back to life old characters but with a good story and <UNK> the original roots too bad that show is already dead another corporate wise decision i suppose
<START> melissa <UNK> wes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> affleck play young students at <UNK> college in the town of <UNK> the four teenagers form two love <UNK> one night during an ominous full moon they drive and argue along a <UNK> and <UNK> mountain road not looking properly they <UNK> into another car and one or more of them are killed the ghostly nightmare begins pretty lousy and politically correct horror flick without gore and nudity it's obviously influenced by carnival of souls the cinematography is decent unfortunately there is zero suspense 4 out of 10 just another instantly forgettable <UNK> <UNK> trash
<START> recently i had opportunity to view a working print in kansas city <UNK> <UNK> of this title it is difficult for me being a lover of the art as i am to report the following but the truth sometimes hurts and quite frankly after sitting through this tripe i'm using the <UNK> definition here worthless statements or writing for an hour and a half i feel <UNK> to share warn any interested parties let's begin at the beginning a good place to start as always the first 15 minutes are not really that bad a couple of laughs and decent development but then it is downhill from there this is the story of a woman in her mid thirties that as the writer would like for you to believe is <UNK> with her life and <UNK> the first major difficulty occurs when if you don't know that fact going into the movie you won't know it when she suddenly risks it all for in my opinion a very <UNK> and unlikely <UNK> with a local salesman there is little development drastically <UNK> development to justify her actions for the affair she has and when it occurs one feels as i did that she is just of low moral character the word slut comes to mind hopefully they'll let that pass the review and post the comment this in my opinion is the first fatal flaw of the film if you're married or have ever been in love <UNK> of whether you are male or female its going to turn you off quite frankly i feel that it would have made a much better blue movie that's the level in my opinion of which the screenplay is deserving the second fatal flaw is the casting diane lane just didn't work for me here and viggo <UNK> is not the right man for the job believe me the only saving grace to the entire film is anna <UNK> the depth of her ability as a fine actress shines in places conveying a subtle yet very blunt i apologize for the <UNK> but it is accurate portrayal of an <UNK> teen bravo well done i'm not going to give the ending away but i was disappointed being billed as a slice of life romance is one thing but an ending like that well if that <UNK> you enough to see this picture don't say i didn't warn you but you better look fast if this celluloid is released i doubt it goes four weeks before <UNK> into flames i'd say wait for the video but the free sex education tapes at most video rental <UNK> have more entertainment value hmmm dustin hoffman produced this you think he'd learn after <UNK> this film once carried the working title <UNK> man and should have been left on the rack if you've never in your life wanted to walk out on a film give this one 35 40 minutes the only thing worth staying for is anna <UNK> if you can stomach the fact that you'll find your mind <UNK> to whether or not you took out the garbage before you left home which is probably where you should have stayed in the first place if you're off to the movies to see this one that's my two cents for what it is worth
<START> this is a film exploring the female sexuality in a way not so often used almost every other film with this kind of sexual scenes always becomes rated x and so seen as a pornographic movie here is a kind of romantic horror story combined with the females own satisfaction need br br a very good film
<START> if you love cult 70's sci fi the way i do or if you like movies such as <UNK> man or <UNK> <UNK> than you're going to love this one it's a stream of consciousness 70's sci fi spectacular including a <UNK> century <UNK> and the earth a million years from now this movie is pure 70's put on steve <UNK> fly like an eagle or pink <UNK> dark side of the moon and you're ready to go
<START> to fight against the death penalty is a just cause everyone who is sane in europe would think so in the usa everything is different the film seems to demonstrate in a first stage that justice can be won against the racist <UNK> death penalty <UNK> american justice a young man is freed from death row thanks to a law professor who went back to defense <UNK> for this particular case but the film has a sequel justice in the usa is entirely <UNK> by the aim of vengeance <UNK> of justice is just the same <UNK> by vengeance one person in the local public attorney <UNK> has a young man <UNK> on false charges this public <UNK> officer drops the charges after a while and the young man walks out free but he loses his college <UNK> and he is <UNK> by some vengeful people for whom there is never any smoke without a fire he hides his shame and <UNK> to get his vengeance but he also needs to satisfy his sexual needs which are more mental than <UNK> for sure but even stronger because mental and no longer <UNK> and he can only do that with little girls he apparently teams with another serial killer who is after the same kind of <UNK> one day the local cops follow their <UNK> guided by some vague <UNK> elements in the assassination of a young girl and they arrest the young <UNK> we are speaking of they beat him up and <UNK> him for 22 hours with nothing but blows and blows and <UNK> books and guns and russian <UNK> he <UNK> sent to death row he asks his grandmother to go get the law professor in <UNK> who is the husband of the local public <UNK> representative that had him <UNK> <UNK> some years ago and the vengeance is on the <UNK> it will fail but it shows that as soon as one in the line of justice police work and other security forces steps off the line of absolute <UNK> some <UNK> act is done that can ruin even the best <UNK> case and that can <UNK> the worst deepest imaginable <UNK> for vengeance to charge someone on <UNK> elements is just as bad as to let <UNK> elements ruin the work of the police or of justice the best intentions on the police side are ruined by some personal involvement and vengeful intention just as much as the life of a person can be <UNK> by <UNK> elements <UNK> to the size of evidence which in its turn will <UNK> the whole case by being just <UNK> hence easily <UNK> with a good lawyer the film then is a deep reflection on the necessity to respect standards and <UNK> all along the police and justice line if we don't want to make a mistake which in its turn of course does not justify the death penalty since anyway it goes against the deepest belief americans are supposed to have we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are <UNK> by their creator with certain <UNK> rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness <UNK> of independence life is an <UNK> right that was given to man by his creator which means no one but the one who gave it can take it away only god can take the life of a person away the death penalty is the arrogant <UNK> of a power that we do not have even if we do not evoke god we cannot justify the death penalty except as an act of vengeance and here the film shows vengeance is the worst possible motivation in the rendition of justice and in the establishment of public peace if vengeance is pushed aside there is no other justification for this death penalty and there can always be a mistake in that pursuit not of happiness but of vengeance br br dr jacques <UNK> university paris 1 <UNK> <UNK> university paris 8 saint denis university paris 12 <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is the story of australian <UNK> who are captured out of uniform after a raid since they are out of uniform they are <UNK> treated as spies as such they are tried convicted and sentenced to death the japanese court martial out of admiration for their <UNK> <UNK> that they be given a <UNK> death of course under the code of <UNK> this means that they are to be <UNK> a fate for which as <UNK> they are <UNK>
<START> revenge is the theme of this denzel washington thriller that offers its share of action mayhem murder and grisly <UNK> the <UNK> are a <UNK> search and destroy mission as his charge young <UNK> fanning is kidnapped from school which is exactly what washington was hired to prevent the mexico city locations are as chaotic as the storyline moves towards its predictable violent conclusion with plot twists along the way washington a former cia <UNK> with a drinking problem gets a good reference from a former fellow agent which sets in motion the <UNK> outline washington and fanning have a great chemistry between them and after a <UNK> beginning the bodyguard and his charge become the best of friends christopher walken rachel <UNK> <UNK> mitchell <UNK> <UNK> and mickey rourke <UNK> the good cast in support of the two stars
<START> the germans all stand out in the open and get <UNK> down with a machine gun the good guys never die unless its for dramatic purposes the plot has so many holes its laughable where did the german soldiers go once they rolled the fuel tank towards the train <UNK> <UNK> please and the whole idea <UNK> a train how moronic is that the germans know where you are going to go its not like you can leave the track and drive away what a waste i would rather <UNK> myself on the head with a ball <UNK> hammer 10 times then have to sit through that again i mean seriously it felt like it was made in the 60s but it was produced in <UNK> 1988 the a team is more believable than this horrid excuse for a movie only watch it if you need a good laugh this movie is to <UNK> <UNK> what green <UNK> was to john wayne
<START> the only possible way to enjoy this flick is to bang your head against the wall allow some internal <UNK> of the brain let a bunch of your brain cells die and once you are officially mentally retarded perhaps then you might enjoy this film br br the only saving grace was the story between <UNK> and stephanie govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the brit girl perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their <UNK> in india and how they eventually fall in love would have made it a much more enjoyable film br br the only reason i gave it a 3 rating is because of <UNK> and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy br br <UNK> <UNK> and anil kapoor were wasted needlessly plus the scene at <UNK> of the re union was just too much to <UNK> being an international <UNK> in the post 9 11 world anil kapoor would have got himself shot much before he even reached the sky bridge to <UNK> his true love but then again the point of the movie was to defy logic gravity physics and throw an egg on the face of the general audience br br watch it at your own peril at least i know i have been <UNK> for life
<START> ray liotta and tom <UNK> shine in this sterling example of <UNK> love and commitment <UNK> plays dominick <UNK> a mildly mentally handicapped young man who is putting his 12 minutes younger twin brother liotta who plays eugene through medical school it is set in <UNK> and deals with the issues of sibling rivalry the <UNK> bond of twins child abuse and good always winning out over evil it is captivating and filled with laughter and tears if you have not yet seen this film please rent it i promise you'll be amazed at how such a wonderful film could go un noticed
<START> this is the kind of picture john <UNK> would be making today if it weren't for advances in cgi and that's just to say that he'd be forgotten too if technology hadn't made things sexy and <UNK> since 1983 twice has got the same wit imagination and sense of real excitement that you'd find in a pixar flick only executed under the <UNK> of the medium c 1983 innovative animation techniques combine with a great script and excellent <UNK> to produce a movie that appeals on lots of levels it should be spoken of in the same breath with <UNK> away and toy story
<START> what an inspiring movie i laughed cried and felt love for a true story it does give you hope and that <UNK> do happen it has a great cast ellen <UNK> samantha <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she's 4 or <UNK> old what a actress its on showtime a must see movie
<START> i figured the whole joke of the movie would be to see some rich white guy acting like chris rock and then see chris rock react to people's reactions instead you just see chris rock being himself and people not understanding him there are maybe 2 scenes in the entire movie where they use their gimmick this should have been a lot better
<START> i have grown up reading modesty blaise both the comics and the books and she truly is a heroine to me although not being a great fan of quentin tarantino i anyway was interested to hear a few years back that he was considering making a film of her could he finally give modesty a nice big screen treatment she's worthy of i heard of <UNK> name is <UNK> a few months ago and checked the stars it had been given here and wasn't too surprised to find out the score was not too high since beloved characters often have hard time melting the <UNK> heart if not done exactly right so i decided not to read any reviews and see the film instead and well i just finished watching it and i'm stunned and sad and yeah pretty furious too sad and furious of giving over an hour of my time seeing something so fabulous as modesty blaise character being turned into a film that has nothing to give to a viewer or a fan br br it seems that almost everything about this film is sub par and <UNK> although i must admit seeing some actors in other films earlier where they were fine so i can't blame them but the screenplay and the directing my god why even make this kind of crap with production values slightly bigger than your average tv film but done much worse i don't know the background of this film and actually i really don't want to know but i just can't help wondering that how on earth could tarantino with a straight face tell that he loves modesty and then put his name on this he just lost a huge amount of respect in my eyes the director was not the right man for this job and i can honestly thank him for ruining my night br br i give this film 3 stars and those stars go to the actors and the technical quality which could've been worse the other seven stars missing are what this film was not good at oh well hopefully at some point there will be a serious production of the modesty blaise movie that has some other goals than to steal money from the modesty fans although if people like tarantino are the ones making the decisions i'm not holding my breath
<START> it's been nearly 30 years and i still hate everyone involved in this movie it remains the worst movie i've ever seen br br before seeing this i never much minded rivers one way or the other after seeing this movie i have an <UNK> reaction when i accidentally see her on television br br i got dragged to this against my better judgment by <UNK> pressure however coming out of the theater those friends <UNK> an <UNK> to never again <UNK> my choice of movie nearly thirty years later we still carry around mental <UNK> from this movie br br on my <UNK> one of my regrets will be the time i wasted hoping that this movie might get better it never did br br if you are ever given a choice you would prefer putting your own eyes out to sitting though this movie br br i <UNK> for imdb comments just in the hope that perhaps i can warn others against viewing this movie if i can save just one person from watching this then my existence on this earth will have been justified
<START> skip mccoy richard widmark pick <UNK> <UNK> jean peters <UNK> which contains an important <UNK> that is intended for the communist cause she is being followed by 2 federal agents that are waiting to <UNK> once she hands the <UNK> over to her contact however skip steals the purse on the subway under everyone's <UNK> and so starts a hunt for him by both the police and joey richard <UNK> and candy who want the <UNK> back skip can only be <UNK> through moe thelma ritter who sells information on criminals it is made clear to skip that what he has stolen is important and both sides want the film but he <UNK> to hold out for a high price this leads to joey hunting after him and a conflict between joey and jean who has fallen in love with skip joey has a <UNK> to deliver the <UNK> to his boss br br its a well acted film and it has a good beginning that gets you involved straight away its a bit unrealistic how jean peters immediately falls in love with widmark but this point is necessary as otherwise why would she later hold out from joey its a good film
<START> the sequel to the ever popular cinderella story reminded me somewhat of what they did with one of the beauty the beast movies it's basically three short stories rolled into 1 br br ok the mice are adorable i love gus he's <UNK> cute and <UNK> awesome as usual i liked some of the newer characters as well <UNK> <UNK> was adorable and i did like <UNK> still the storyline was somewhat limited but still very cute so i vote 7 10
<START> this has long been one of my favourite adaptations of an austen novel although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular pride and prejudice emma is a lush and relatively faithful tv version of <UNK> novel especially considering its short length the biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one as the unnecessary <UNK> that austen <UNK> at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more akin to <UNK> character in the rest of the book i thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were well picked kate beckinsale walks the fine line between <UNK> and the social <UNK> with a grace completely lost in gwyneth <UNK> <UNK> version samantha <UNK> <UNK> blonde locks suit her attitude and character as the <UNK> that <UNK> her role in previous <UNK> is replaced with the harriet we know from the book mister <UNK> role is carried out extremely well in my opinion both the seriousness and the gentle compassion that the hero is painted with in the novel are present here in this much neglected <UNK> film
<START> never cast models and playboy <UNK> in your films bob <UNK> star 80 about dorothy <UNK> of whom bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her sister after her murder at the hands of her low life husband is a <UNK> times more interesting than dorothy herself on the silver screen patty <UNK> is no actress either i expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la orson welles but instead got audrey hepburn <UNK> in <UNK> and a god awful <UNK> hair do very disappointing paper moon and the last picture show i could watch again and again this <UNK> i could barely sit through once this movie was <UNK> not released because of the <UNK> surrounding ms <UNK> <UNK> death i think the real reason was because it was so bad
<START> haha you have to just smile and smile if you actually made it all the way through this movie it like says something about myself i guess the movie itself was created i think as some sort of psychological test or like some sort of drug to take you to a place you have never been before when <UNK> wrote his famous first philosophical piece the <UNK> <UNK> he said it was meaningless and useless but if you read it after you were done it would take you to a new level like a ladder and then you could throw away the work and see things with clarity and true understanding this movie is the same i think br br as a movie it is without a doubt the worst movie i have seen in a long long time in such a unique way first of all this is snipes i loved watching this guy kick ass in various movies and i have suffered through a few weak ones however although you know the movie might suck you would never suspect that it could be as bad as it actually was which is the fun of it i mean this is snipes you know it might be good but it will be alright right smile br br so this thing on every level is pure boredom pure <UNK> the reference to the professional is both dead on and obvious yet so poorly done as to be comical there is not one character in this movie that is interesting in the least and to make the whole thing more surreal they have a soundtrack that sort of sounds like parts to various bourne identity type movies only isn't quite right in fact although it seems close to action movie background music it just so happens it is done in a manner that will <UNK> on you fantastically br br then all the scenes in the total pitch black where honestly since the characters are so flat you don't really care whats going to happen but regardless after it happens and someone is killed you just say to yourself was i supposed to see that what else how about scenes with <UNK> obnoxious flashing at a <UNK> lights pace for a period of time that is too long to bear sure let's throw that in how bout this though when you are <UNK> and your eyes cant handle it any longer do some more of these in the dark kills where you really don't see what happened and on top of that lets face it you don't care you were past bored way from the beginning br br so i <UNK> in and out a couple times but i caught almost all of this movie and it becomes something you can watch without something that <UNK> your mind on any level therefore it becomes something you can effectively zone out with and begin to think about your life where its going where its been what we are as people br br and that that is the true magic of this film
<START> despite the lack of logic present in the storyline kill shot is a highly enjoyable film through a moving performance <UNK> van <UNK> brilliantly portrays the emotional <UNK> between a hard working wealthy father and his misguided son each member of the supporting cast <UNK> in with a solid performance <UNK> by the vivid acting of a young asian man whose name i cannot recall a shockingly tragic ending may <UNK> some younger viewers but as a whole kill shot truly delivers a death blow
<START> what a great word re imagining is isn't that what they call dawn of the dead <UNK> 2004 a clever word indeed it <UNK> the term that everyone has grown to hate remake that is and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination well damn was i <UNK> at least i was <UNK> more by the thought of countless gore and <UNK> violence than by the idea of re imagining though it played a role br br still why make a remake directors do it for only a few reasons really to update a movie for a modern audience or because they personally love the original and want to make a tribute to it an homage if you will nonetheless it all generally i do admit exceptions <UNK> down to one thing stealing someone's idea and <UNK> it or re imagining it so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it it's like <UNK> <UNK> notes dump everything in a <UNK> <UNK> all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial <UNK> in other words a great marketing scheme br br so what's wrong with this one well i'll start with what i liked i liked the opening scenes thanks to cgi and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust romero tried to communicate in the original through <UNK> means we see the city in ruins thousands of zombies chaos and death two words that look beautiful on screen then it all falls apart br br this set up leads nowhere the movie does what almost every remake does it adds more of everything except character atmosphere and story it's <UNK> in some sense <UNK> and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots the setting the mall which played a crucial role in the original film's story and theme is purely <UNK> the idea <UNK> in romero's film the pure <UNK> joy of having a mall all to yourself as a <UNK> is gone here further this re imagining has no <UNK> no spirit no balls it assumes probably quite rightly that the audience has no attention span and doesn't bother to get us interested in the characters or the story the film is rushed and misses the <UNK> interactions of the four characters of the original you actually grew to care about those people in romero's version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall here you don't care when or who goes what matters is how they go br br what else is their to say the film is not scary it has one or two jump scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and loud special effects as a story it's really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it the humor is also reduced to a few one liners and one really good character andy after that what remains an ending that is <UNK> ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued inevitable ambiguity of the original film but despite it being a pretty bad film though not quite as bad as some other remakes it should be remembered for one thing it kicked the passion of christ from it's number one spot in the box office well done zombies
<START> this really is the most dreadful film i have ever seen i simply have no idea how anyone has the <UNK> to put this on release br br the production standards are atrocious there is no <UNK> here at cinematography the camera work scripting acting and sound are unbelievably crass i think there is a plot but it could have been done in 10 minutes <UNK> us the time to watch it the hysterical neurotic girls at the centre of this piece have no credibility whatsoever br br i would urge anyone to avoid spending any time or money on this title it is truly atrocious br br <UNK> 14 december 2008
<START> i also viewed this film at the santa barbara film festival it was an excellent film about adult family relationships paul reiser wrote the film and included some similarities to his family it was funny warm poignant and moving as well as entertaining a film like this would do very well with the word of mouth reviews i would definitely tell my friends and family to see this film let's only hope they'll have the chance i would rate this film as one of the best movies i've seen in a year it contains no violence action scenes murders sex so evidently <UNK> question whether or not to pick it up believe me there are people out there who would love to go see a movie like this that has redeeming value instead of the many typical big box office blockbusters we are usually given
<START> absolutely hilarious john <UNK> tribute to the people he loves most <UNK> is a twisted little <UNK> with plenty to look at and laugh at it's like being turned loose in a museum of <UNK> i haven't laughed so much in a theater since serial mom i loved seeing old friends from the <UNK> days sharon <UNK> and susan lowe back in front of <UNK> camera the cast is simply wonderful especially edward <UNK> and martha <UNK> uses the best elements of past waters atrocities especially the underrated <UNK> and plenty of new surprises made me sick in a wonderful way thanks john
<START> what else is left to say br br i've read all the reviews here and most are right on however one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that satan <UNK> it or something along those lines evil wow what a shocker i mean <UNK> basically made this film open your eyes please br br <UNK> this was the very lowest grade of <UNK> nonsense that has come along in years br br the most terrifying thing about <UNK> code is how much money they spent to make it if this movie can be made there are no limits and therefore we have no choice but to get ready for <UNK> 2 and ernest loses the <UNK> <UNK> br br for those of you who are into the biblical stories the new movie dogma will pickup where <UNK> code never started
<START> i've read up a little bit on che before watching this film and you wanna know something he was a real hero for the people because he only wanted to see <UNK> for everyone and that he hated what the oppressive forces were doing to his people as well as all other latin americans in general now i don't know about others but to me he did the right thing by wanting <UNK> so that everyone had to pay their fair share however the powerful elite obviously weren't going to go for that so rather than understanding what che <UNK> wanted they were forced to kill him in attempting to <UNK> the revolution it didn't work since there were too many of his other followers who only picked up where he left off a good example of this was when castro continued his <UNK> in cuba as far as i'm concerned and as che said it himself right before he died if you kill me that's fine but you're only killing a man you'll never kill the cause i couldn't have said it any better myself br br but anyways that's why i give this film a 7 out of 10
<START> bunny comes home <UNK> man's <UNK> deserves more credit than it gets a clever script by <UNK> chase directed by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the film has just the right feel for early post <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and none of the blind terror that came into play few years later produced in 1944 the japanese defeated the battle scenes a little <UNK> <UNK> tom <UNK> melancholy attraction for <UNK> young jan <UNK> has solid chemistry plays real and <UNK> <UNK> career at <UNK> the following year jan opened on broadway in <UNK> ' <UNK> <UNK> a little <UNK> eyed boasts to an always <UNK> jimmy <UNK> his memories an improvement over reality and give <UNK> a <UNK> like shadow to play against the navy <UNK> lighter than air shots are authentic photographed at <UNK> and <UNK> and the p <UNK> <UNK> is out of march <UNK> lot 3 <UNK> for india and <UNK> u <UNK> bunny comes <UNK> gives back to <UNK> an authentic slice of his past something he had wanted to believe was <UNK> then the future we spin into again is <UNK> now on a <UNK> scale a newly designed navy <UNK> with launch <UNK> for a <UNK> <UNK> how expensive <UNK> <UNK> still you got to believe in it that's the way you make things come <UNK>
<START> images are great and reflect well the landscapes of canada the story was on the other side quite boring to my eyes it was a love story in the woods just like titanic was a love story on a boat i did not feel that grey owl was great <UNK> i usually like lord attenborough but this one was bad
<START> shame really very rarely do i watch a film and am left feeling disappointed at the end i've seen quite a few of ira <UNK> adaptations <UNK> <UNK> and 'the <UNK> <UNK> and liked both them but this just didn't appeal to me br br when i read the plot outline an award winning playwright michael caine decides to murder one of his former <UNK> christopher reeve and steel his script for his own success i was excited i like thrillers michael <UNK> a good actor sidney <UNK> a good director and ira <UNK> work is generally good br br i won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet but all i'd say is there are loads of twists and turns so many its kind of hard to explain the film's plot line in detail without giving it away i enjoyed the first 45 minutes before the twists and turns began to occur and at that point my interest and enjoyment began to fade out though i have to give lumet credit for the very amusing ending which did make me laugh out loud br br the main cast michael caine christopher reeve <UNK> cannon and irene worth were all brilliant in their roles though <UNK> obvious fake russian accent got on my nerves slightly nothing personal irene i think any actor's fake accent would <UNK> me not sure if <UNK> character was meant to be annoyingly funny but <UNK> managed to annoy and <UNK> at the same time br br anyone reading this i don't want you to be put off watching this because of my views give it a chance you may like it you may not it's all about opinion
<START> in the opening scene of <UNK> story mr a guinness bore such a startling resemblance to <UNK> coward that i fully expected his first words to be certain women need striking regularly like <UNK> or some such world weary bon <UNK> unfortunately his dialogue is hardly <UNK> <UNK> and even the master would have had trouble bringing it to life indeed mr guinness wanders through the picture as if looking for a <UNK> point and failing to find one and <UNK> lies the fatal weakness of the whole movie mr j <UNK> likewise gives up early on and ends up giving a jack <UNK> performance without an ounce of <UNK> it could have been spliced from any of a dozen british war movies many of the early fifties usual suspects turn up and do their <UNK> to very little purpose the <UNK> failed to bomb <UNK> into <UNK> in much the same way as it failed to bring london to its knees the courage of the <UNK> people in the face of <UNK> danger was <UNK> by the king and the island was awarded the george cross a worthy subject you might think for a movie but <UNK> story does not even qualify for the term worthy in its most <UNK> sense it gives the appearance of being <UNK> <UNK> together to meet a <UNK> perhaps before the actors lost the will to live
<START> let's face it romantic comedies are considered lightweight when compared with dramatic movies just look at the academy award nominations each year but still the good ones are truly an art form look at when harry met sally <UNK> in seattle and classics like roman holiday and it happened one night i like the good feeling of seeing two people destined to find happiness br br this movie attempts to <UNK> something that resembles a romantic comedy but no one believes the romance between the main characters and there is nothing funny to make up for that major <UNK> <UNK> is way past being a leading man especially a romantic lead i'm sure as executive producer he had the means but not the good sense to cast himself and <UNK> i see possibilities of some comedic talent but she had no script and a poorly developed character and whose idea was the english accent pointless br br others have stated it but i want to repeat this story is poorly conceived poorly executed the actors are terribly miscast and the characters well we just don't give a hoot about them br br an art form this ain't go rent moonstruck again
<START> david <UNK> film debut has been <UNK> by many as a real thinking man's movie a movie that makes you question everybody and everything i saw it for the first time recently and couldn't understand what was supposed to be so great about it br br the movie is about a female psychologist named margaret who is also a best selling author margaret has become <UNK> by her profession and her inability to really help anyone she tries to <UNK> this by helping settle her <UNK> gambling debt to a shark named mike played by joe <UNK> who is the only reason to watch this film she discovers that mike is actually a professional confidence man when she nearly falls victim to a <UNK> he pulls immediately after meeting her intrigued she returns to see him and asks him to show her how con artists operate she plans on using this as the subject of a new psychology book she then falls for him and <UNK> him on a long con that he and his associates have set up br br i don't feel like going into details but at the end of the film it is revealed that the events of the whole movie were an elaborate con by mike and his <UNK> to <UNK> margaret out of 80 000 br br first of all the big twist towards the end was very predictable any scene where the con men were operating was made very obvious by the <UNK> acting and weird line reads not only that but the audience and the main character knows that they're dealing with con men so is it really such a big surprise when we find out that margaret has herself been <UNK> besides margaret is supposedly an intelligent psychologist who is an expert at reading people yet she allows herself to be <UNK> far too easily and keep in mind she knows full well that mike is a con artist br br secondly we are led to believe that margaret was <UNK> from the very beginning yet in order for the con to ultimately work she had to do several things that the con men couldn't possibly have predicted that she would do first she had to decide to help settle her <UNK> debt allowing her to meet the con men in the first place if she hadn't done this the entire con would have failed i just have to say that it's pretty <UNK> to assume that a psychologist is going to take it upon herself to settle a <UNK> gambling debt not only that but what are the odds that the con men would be at the right spot on the very night she decided to show up did they simply show up at that bar every night hoping she would come and see them another thing that had to happen that couldn't have been predicted is that margaret had to return to see mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade what are the odds of this happening and yet the whole con is based on this premise br br another problem i had is with the ending margaret finds out she's been <UNK> and decides to get revenge on mike at first mamet leads us to believe that she's going to con the con but that falls through so the ultimate ending is her <UNK> mike down in an airport <UNK> area somehow that just felt like a clumsy and inept way to end a movie about con artists <UNK> their trade not only that but she didn't even take back the money he stole from her br br ultimately the movie leaves you feeling empty and <UNK> and if you like me predicted ahead of time that margaret was going to be <UNK> you will find this revelation just as unsatisfying
<START> the movie is great like every other international project that includes strong impressions three of them israel <UNK> and egypt should've been cut out especially <UNK> clip which is pathetic beyond all reason and doesn't contain a single original thought or element on it's own everything else is really great <UNK> for most of americans known for the rest of the world unfortunately clips speak about misery of the people all over the world and as i see it there are so many of those who won't give a damn about it br br top 5 1 <UNK> 2 penn 3 <UNK> 4 <UNK> 5 <UNK>
<START> a great concept a great cast and what a pity there wasn't more time to flesh out the story i loved it and wanted more <UNK> dukakis and <UNK> now there are some real women still <UNK> and her character alone had enough substance to carry the script over some of its lesser moments i have it on tape and will continue to watch it hoping that there is a clue at the end that suggests there will be a sequel br br top <UNK> no question no argument br br
<START> unfortunately the realism is boring this movie i thought it would never end would have been better if all the characters would have been <UNK> in the first five minutes where's blade when you need him while as dismal as combat shock <UNK> for a dream and as nightmarish as <UNK> <UNK> dead creatures isn't nearly as entertaining as any of the aforementioned bleak movies while the gratuitous <UNK> might make the wannabe <UNK> <UNK> hearts race a little faster it wasn't nearly as interesting as <UNK> really i found it about as interesting as late night <UNK> and as exciting as a trip to the dentist if you have strong <UNK> qualities you might be able to endure this otherwise for no one i was really surprised that this one wasn't made by the people at brain damage as that was the quality of dead creatures
<START> how can they from joe don baker as <UNK> <UNK> in the first sequel to bo <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> in the second sequel why did they do that for just because bo <UNK> look more a like to <UNK> <UNK> they still <UNK> of changed it because the first sequel it was joe don baker as <UNK> <UNK> and that one of the thing i wanted to see in the second sequel br br i would've given this movie a 7 out of 10 and i would've given it a 1 out of 10 if the story <UNK> have anything to do with <UNK> <UNK> life but it did and that why i had given this movie a 3 out 10 br br i strongly suggest that anyone who is planning on watching this cheese i suggest don't and watch the first sequel instead
<START> being the only movie i was able to see at this year's <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> this year's festival will be remembered as a all time low for me br br this movie which was announced as an erotic thriller is nothing more than a sick piece of crap excuse the language but there aren't any decent words to describe it br br first of all the actors are not the best but even better actors would not have rescued the movie e g the plot after the first 15 minutes it was quite clear that john was sick the <UNK> girls were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend the so called sex scene was nothing else but disgusting hitting each other until blood flows for me hasn't anything to do with sexuality but unfortunately that were not the only disgusting images to be shown everything else was copied by other directors like e g lynch but of course without their <UNK> br br so to <UNK> the whole film and to save other viewers time and money guy loses girlfriend girlfriend turns back home guy kills girlfriend and becomes mad afterwards guy <UNK> hot but crazy <UNK> girls guy has very disgusting sex with one of them or so he thinks in the end he realizes he is crazy and his girlfriend and her new lover lay in his apartment all the time bad story bad actors pictures that make you want to vomit br br 1 out of 10 1 point for the fact that you realize how good you can understand norwegian if you learned swedish at least one benefit of the evening and you can't choose 0 points here
<START> i don't know what this movie is about really it's like a <UNK> art school project they never say why the world is dark but it is always darkness except for seconds a day there are long <UNK> shots of insects of all sorts for no reason what little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images a black woman enters the main character's apartment somehow she becomes pregnant overnight then gets shot in the head the main character takes care of the body until it becomes a <UNK> after which a white naked woman emerges i have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be honestly i would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it's about but i wouldn't wish this level of hell on anybody else
<START> in the title i write that the story is ludicrous below i'll elaborate and tell you why it in my humble opinion ruins this movie br br gere and danes are doing their jobs and while it's not their best work it's quite ok the rest of the cast though is doing a really poor job mind you this is not entirely the actors fault the problem is that gere and danes are the only ones that have characters that have even the slightest room in the movie to really give any depth all other characters have either too little room in the movie to create any depth or the character is such a cliché that it doesn't matter how hard the actors try br br the director has a bit of a <UNK> complex but looking merely at the direction i think he does an ok job br br but the story this is the kind of script that is bad in two ways first of all it's a bad movie script the characters are shallow except for <UNK> and <UNK> characters the villains are clichés and the actions of the characters is totally unbelievable besides this the writers must have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and <UNK> a hundred years it's the kind of movie that are saying that some criminals are still criminals regardless of the fact that they have paid the price the society has given them it's also the kind of movie that says albeit only between the lines that every form of sexual <UNK> should be <UNK> without trial judge or jury and of course according to the movie everything that is not sex in the <UNK> position by a married couple is a sexual <UNK> br br so if you're going to film school and need an example of a bad script or if you're writing scripts yourself and want an ego boost see it for everyone else i recommend another movie
<START> almost every review of this movie i'd seen was pretty bad it's not pretty bad it's actually pretty good though not great the judy garland character could have gotten annoying but she didn't allow it to somewhere along the line i've become a fan of brooding overbearing overacting van <UNK> at least in the early 40's <UNK> singing is great but the film missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship i gave it a 7
<START> this film reminds me of <UNK> street starring <UNK> daniels and ruby keeler when i watch this film a lot of it reminded me of <UNK> street especially the character <UNK> who's a <UNK> star and she ends up falling and breaks her <UNK> like <UNK> daniels did in <UNK> street and another performer gets the part and become a star this film like most race films keeps people watching because of the great entertainment race films always showed black entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era the dancing styles the music dressing styles you'll love it this movie could of been big if it was made in hollywood it would of had better scenery better filming and more money which would make any movie better but its worth watching because it is good and <UNK> does good with the little he has i have to say out of all <UNK> films swing is the best the movie features singers dancers actresses and actors who were popular but forgotten today <UNK> <UNK> a awesome female <UNK> player who can blow the horn so good that you think gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky the sexy hot female dancer <UNK> harris would put ann miller and <UNK> rose lee to shame br br adding further info popular blues singer of the <UNK> and 30's <UNK> green is the focus of the film she's mandy a good hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women a <UNK> neighbor played by amanda randolph tells mandy what she seen and heard and mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive <UNK> woman by the name of <UNK> played <UNK> diaz a hot <UNK> entertainer in the 30's and a fight breaks out then mandy goes to harlem where she <UNK> with a somewhat guardian angel lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies dorothy van <UNK> lena provides mandy with a home a job and helps her become a star when <UNK> <UNK> smith played by <UNK> i guess she's playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior when <UNK> gets drunk and breaks her leg lena convinces everyone that mandy is right for the job and lena is right and a star is born in mandy tall long <UNK> but handsome <UNK> <UNK> is the cool aspiring producer who lena looks out for as well pretty boy larry seymour plays the no good man but after lena threatens him he might shape up there are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where <UNK> smith <UNK> diaz <UNK> in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but that's not enough she almost gets into a fight with mandy again in between there's great entertainment by chorus girls tap dancers shake dancers swing music and blues singing there's even white people watching the entertainment i wonder where <UNK> found them there's even a scene where there's blacks and whites sitting together at the club <UNK> frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films he should be <UNK> for such a bold move br br this movie was the first race film i really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to oscar <UNK> this movie is one of the best of the race film genre its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show business br br no these early race films may not be the best can't be compared with <UNK> green <UNK> <UNK> weather cabin in the sky carmen jones or any other hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black film making and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black person's eyes these films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life be beautiful classy and elegant and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in hollywood most of the actors and actresses of these race films weren't the best but they were the only ones that could be <UNK> at the time <UNK> and spencer williams couldn't afford nina mae <UNK> <UNK> baker <UNK> waters <UNK> washington paul <UNK> rex <UNK> and more of the bigger stars so <UNK> and other black and white race film makers would use nightclub performers in their movies some were good some weren't great actors and actresses but i think <UNK> and others knew most weren't good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent they just wanted their stories told and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films for some true actors actresses race films were the only type of films they could get work especially if they didn't want to play hollywood stereotypes so i think you'll be able to spot the true actors actresses from the nightclub performers these race films are very historic they could have been lost forever many are lost maybe race films aren't the greatest example of cinema but even hollywood films didn't start out great in the beginning i think if the race film genre continued it would have better if your looking for great acting most race films aren't the ones but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films than watch race films there are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast moon over harlem body and soul paradise in harlem keep <UNK> sunday <UNK> dark manhattan broken strings boy what a girl mystery in swing miracle in harlem and <UNK> cinderella that not only has good entertainment but good acting
<START> the first time i came upon delirious i only heard it i listened to the entire comedic performance and never have i laughed so much in my life <UNK> ability to paint hilarious pictures in our minds and do great imitation is captivating when i finally got to see him perform this act i had to have it eddie murphy's performance on delirious shows his genius with it being the new millennium his acts in 1983 is just as funny today as it was then my parents loved it as teenagers and i age <UNK> love it as well from that point on i had to view murphy's other movies such as coming to america and harlem nights there will be no other comedian like eddie
<START> paul naschy made a great number of horror films in terms of quality they tend to range from fairly good to unwatchable trash and unfortunately horror rises from the tomb is closer to the latter the plot is just your average story of a witch wizard or as is the case here <UNK> who is put to death but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it etc etc we then get a <UNK> and one thing leads to another and pretty soon the executed <UNK> is up to no good again the plot is slow painfully boring and the film constantly feels pointless the characters string out <UNK> of <UNK> and it never serves the film in any way whatsoever paul naschy wrote the script and if you ask me he should stick to acting because the dialogue is trite in the extreme and only serves to make the film even more boring than it already is carlos <UNK> who also directed naschy in blue eyes of the broken doll and curse of the devil provides dull direction here which likes the dialogue does nothing to help the film sometimes crap films like this have a certain charm about them but horror rises from the tomb doesn't even have that this is a painfully boring film that has little or nothing in the way of interest
<START> the great talents of michael powell and <UNK> <UNK> are noticeable in their wonderful a matter of life and death it was part of the recent tribute to mr powell that played at the walter <UNK> in new york this film in particular shows us one of the best british films from that or any other era br br a matter of life and death has a brilliant cinematography by jack <UNK> a man who knew how to work wonders with a camera particularly impressive is the contrast from the <UNK> tones given to the scenes played in heaven and the colored ones when the action comes back to earth this was quite a coup and well ahead of its times the black and white sequence that involves the long <UNK> where peter and the conductor are <UNK> has to be one of the most amazing things on any film br br much has been said in this forum about the film so our comment will be about the great acting powell and <UNK> got out of the large distinguished cast who <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> br br david niven is peter whose aircraft is hit and his best friend dies as a result of it this film marked one of the highlights in mr <UNK> career he was an excellent film actor as he shows us in this movie kim hunter is surprisingly good as june the woman who talked to peter as his plane was falling from the <UNK> as fate would have it peter and june fall in love at first sight br br some of the best british film actors grace this film with their presence robert <UNK> is bob the man who is admitted to heaven but he is surprised his friend peter never made the trip with him an excellent star turn by <UNK> <UNK> who as the conductor <UNK> steals the film mr <UNK> who had worked with the directors is one of the best things in the movie also roger <UNK> as dr frank reeves does one of the best appearances of his career as well as raymond massey who is seen as abraham <UNK> br br a matter of life and death is a timeless film that will always be seen with <UNK> toward its creators
<START> more than twenty years before peter jackson's <UNK> adaptation of the lord of the rings there was this 1978 animated effort from director ralph bakshi an ambitious and reasonably faithful version of the story this has sadly been rather over <UNK> by the jackson trilogy indeed many reviewers here on the imdb mainly those who saw the newer version first seem to be <UNK> <UNK> to this version but if one applies a little common sense and takes into consideration the time when it was made and the technical possibilities that existed at that time then they will realise that this is a pretty good film indeed it was shortly after seeing this animated movie back in the early '80s that i sought out <UNK> book and immediately became a <UNK> fan of these richly detailed middle earth adventures so in some respects i owe this film a degree of <UNK> as the film which shaped my literary tastes forever br br <UNK> the dark lord of middle earth <UNK> an all powerful ring that gives him incredible power following a great battle during which <UNK> is defeated the ring falls into possession of a king named <UNK> but instead of destroying it he <UNK> chooses to keep it for centuries the ring passes from hand to hand eventually coming into the possession of a <UNK> named <UNK> <UNK> who lives in a peace loving community known as the <UNK> <UNK> learns from a wizard named <UNK> that his ring is in fact the one ring the very same that was <UNK> by <UNK> all those centuries ago and that its master is once again searching for it in order to <UNK> his dark power over the entire land <UNK> <UNK> on a <UNK> journey to protect the ring with three other <UNK> companions but every step of the way they are hunted by <UNK> ring <UNK> the black riders there follow many adventures during which a company of nine <UNK> is formed to guide the ring to the only place where it can be <UNK>  <UNK> doom in the land of <UNK> the film concludes with <UNK> and his best friend sam on the borders of <UNK> closing ever <UNK> to their horrifying destination meanwhile <UNK> and the other members of the company fight off a huge army of <UNK> at the legendary <UNK> of <UNK> deep br br this version covers just over half of the original book a second <UNK> was planned to bring the story to an end but was sadly never completed while the ending feels abrupt it does at least end at a sensible point in the story one has to feel a little frustration and regret that no sequel exists in which we might follow these animated heroes to their eventual goal the animation is passable with a nice variety of locales and characters presented in interesting detail the music by leonard <UNK> is suitably stirring and fits in appropriately with the epic narrative the voice overs are decent too especially john hurt as <UNK> and peter <UNK> as <UNK> on the other hand michael <UNK> who provides the voice for sam is rather campy and goofy which is not well suited to the character the lord of the rings is a commendable attempt to <UNK> the <UNK> book on which it is based
<START> the premise was intriguing but sadly this film just doesn't do any justice to it the casting was quite good and it was shot beautifully but <UNK> much of the direction was inconsistent <UNK> fast editing been there done that to no effect i was waiting for steven <UNK> to run in the credits followed by a commercial characters were identified exclusively by on screen coke usage and pretty much everything else left to boogie nights for character development and no <UNK> characters to draw the viewer into the story a very forgettable film
<START> this movie is traditional bollywood fare as far as the star power sentimentality and love triangle of emotions what really bothered me about this movie was the <UNK> absurd notion of surrogate mother a whore who <UNK> a child with someone after have sex with the man of the family <UNK> a child is not a surrogate mother neither is she a good candidate for a surrogate mother i have seen indian movies and television shows that made 10 to 15 years ago that dealt with this issue more intelligently the whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and absolutely implausible i realize that most bollywood movies aren't meant to be plausible but they don't pretend to be either this movie wants us to <UNK> along with the characters but this can't done with such a ridiculous contrived conflict i would have expected better from <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> i do not recommend this movie because it's inaccurate and misleading this story was supposed to be in <UNK> <UNK> territory this one was shot in the southern <UNK> desert <UNK> different culture i know i am from both <UNK> and <UNK> the other shocking element was the character of her companion aunt speaks in the movie with a very <UNK> french university level academic french while the character she plays was supposed to be of a disturbed never left her mountain kind of <UNK> so living as a <UNK> with that kind of education i that context is impossible the most <UNK> scene and <UNK> especially for the people of the region is the femme <UNK> segment which is s pure invention from the writer director things like that will never happen in a <UNK> society ever
<START> a remake of the superb 1972 movie of the stage play nicely casting caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie but doing nothing else nicely at all br br a under <UNK> performance from the actors law and caine <UNK> further by weak self indulgent direction br br the warmth of the setting in the original is <UNK> for a super modern <UNK> the subtle interplay between oliver and caine which made the first movie so watchable is replaced with a horrid <UNK> arrogance that instantly <UNK> disdain in the viewer but this is not the clever to ing and <UNK> of liking one then the other character the original <UNK> so well this is an obvious <UNK> character assassination of both character from the word go br br this version of sleuth is not really worth seeing watch the original film and be <UNK> from the opening act
<START> bette midler showcases her talents and beauty in <UNK> las vegas i am thrilled that i taped it and i am able to view whenever i want to she possesses what it takes to keep an audience in <UNK> her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you the highlight of the show was her singing stay with me from her 1979 movie the rose you can feel the emotion in the song and will end up having <UNK> <UNK> the show will leave you with the urge to go out and either rent a bette midler movie or go to the nearest music store and purchase one of bette <UNK> albums
<START> till hbo began <UNK> it this month i remember laughing out loud in the theater back in 1991 and now again in my living room if i see that it's on i have to watch it there's just no question this is so much more entertaining to me than other more popular spoofs like airplane which i really like btw cathy <UNK> steals the show in my opinion quotes like sudden speech the last <UNK> of brain fever she could blow at any moment put me over the edge and <UNK> goldberg hasn't been this funny since <UNK> jack <UNK> kevin <UNK> sally field robert downey jr all turn in superb performances as expected i started out giving this 9 out of 10 stars but then i realized that for the type of film it's supposed to be there isn't one thing i'd change or improve upon so 10 it is i have to get this on dvd that's just all there is to it
<START> <UNK> the true story of jesse james 1957 is a remarkably poor widescreen remake of their <UNK> 1939 <UNK> power henry fonda classic jesse james i'm not sure where the fault lies but the casting in this version of the two central characters the uneven direction of nicholas ray and the ham <UNK> screenplay must surely have something to do with it br br in the late thirties and forties <UNK> power was <UNK> top leading man but in the fifties his star began to <UNK> and studio head <UNK> <UNK> started to <UNK> newcomer robert wagner to take his place this was a major error on <UNK> part as wagner proved to be a less than a suitable replacement with the possible exceptions of broken lance 1954 and between heaven hell 1956 it is hard to think of wagner <UNK> himself in anything also jeffrey hunter was nothing more than a fox contract player before being assigned to play frank james to <UNK> jesse in the true story of jesse james borrowed from the studio the previous year this actor's one <UNK> mark was his excellent and revealing performance in john ford's classic the <UNK> but his playing here along with wagner as the second half of the james brothers is nothing short of boring neither player bring any personality or colour to their respective roles they totally miss the mark lacking the charisma and appeal so vividly displayed by power and fonda in the original the movie is also marred by too many flashbacks and with the all over the place screenplay wagner as the robin hood of the american west comes across as a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that you can feel no empathy for whatsoever the supporting cast are hardly worth mentioning but it is a shame to see such a great actress as <UNK> <UNK> barely getting a look in as ma james br br the best aspects of this <UNK> so so western is the wonderful <UNK> colour cinematography by the great joe <UNK> and the excellent music score by the underrated and little known composer leigh <UNK>
<START> i am not one of those people that will walk out of a movie that was based on source material and automatically say the book was better i know better than to <UNK> the value of a movie just because it wasn't a faithful adaptation there is a lengthy process and lots of decisions that go into making a movie that are sometimes out of the director's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> control and certainly out of the original author's control therefore it is <UNK> to expect a movie to be exactly the same word for word as a book or play or video game or <UNK> ride or whatever a movie should be judged on its own standard and how it fits in society moreover a successful movie should be made because the material is relevant to the society which it belongs and if it is based on source material its relevance needs to be <UNK> and enhanced by the filmmakers br br films like there will be blood follow this <UNK> because while it was based on a novel written at the turn of the century oil it feels relevant because of things like the iraq war and energy concerns that the film's country of origin the us was and is experiencing even king kong based on the original film benefits from using new technology and concerns of animal rights that people have br br with that said i just don't understand why they even bothered to make this movie besides the great performances guaranteed oscar <UNK> and <UNK> director writers <UNK> and <UNK> he will get this movie seems to come from nowhere it should have simply stayed as a play the movie which is essentially the same as the play says nothing new about the <UNK> sexual atrocities committed and in many cases covered up by the catholic church here and abroad it says nothing new or different than the original play i can't help but compare this movie to another movie that came out at around the same time frost <UNK> which was also based on a play frost <UNK> while about <UNK> regrets seems relevant because it seems to have come at a time when president bush was about to leave office the regrets that <UNK> had as depicted in the play movie about the war and his <UNK> could just as easily reflected on bush and his <UNK> in that respect frost <UNK> seemed more relevant and actually <UNK> from a wider distribution via film because it got people talking and <UNK> about the political status <UNK> in the country at the time in contrast doubt felt like it was <UNK> news and didn't seem to offer anything that the play didn't offer br br of course the movie is good the performances are outstanding and the screenplay adaptation is apt but so what why didn't it just stay as a play why besides marketing and financial reasons make it into a movie it gave audiences nothing new to <UNK> about the awful subject
<START> brilliant execution in displaying once and for all this time in the <UNK> of politics of how good intentions do actually <UNK> the road to hell excellent
<START> this is why i so love this website i saw this film in the 1980's on british television over the years it is one i have wished i knew more about as it has stayed with me as one of the single most extraordinary things i have ever seen in my life with barely a few key words to remember it by i <UNK> the film here and much information including the fact it's about to become an off broadway musical br br interestingly unlike the previous comment maker i do not remember finding this film sad or exploitative on the contrary the extraordinary relationship between the mother and daughter stuck in the mind as a <UNK> of great strength honour and dignity ironic you may think considering the <UNK> of their lives maybe it's because i live in britain where <UNK> <UNK> has an established language in the lives of old money where <UNK> is often <UNK> as evidence of good <UNK> i saw it as a rare and unique portrayal of enormous spirit deep and profound humour whose utterly fragile and <UNK> balanced fabric gave it <UNK> and respect in a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a <UNK> over the years as it faded in my mind it <UNK> the <UNK> above all others as a one off brilliant outstanding <UNK> experience it was such a deeply private expose it seems odd to think of it becoming so public as to be a new york musical but perhaps somewhere the daughter will be amused by such an outcome it is she who will have the last laugh maybe they made a musical out of her before you jackie <UNK>
<START> when you're making a thriller about witchcraft i believe you should do everything you can to help the audience suspend its disbelief in order for the movie to work some pictures rosemary's baby for example have accomplished this others like <UNK> haven't and the potentially scary material comes across as corny and goofy this film does have some atmospheric moments but about half the dialogue is hard to make out sometimes it's poorly recorded at other times just incomprehensible and orson welles who gets top billing has a role that is so beneath him that you have to assume he was desperate for the work or maybe he was simply having fun 1 2
<START> this is a fair little show about the <UNK> although it feels as if art bell and his <UNK> figured out how to <UNK> a career out of the attitude that carl kolchak <UNK> of course there probably wouldn't be an x files if this show hadn't <UNK> this audience for it so well darren <UNK> is not exactly the super heroic type but he is a plausible enough guy to deliver heroic deeds check out his work on some of those old alfred hitchcock presents here he is the main attraction there doesn't seem to be a girlfriend or wife who's a distraction in fact there isn't a whole lot of sex appeal to the show something i'm <UNK> as well is that the pacing isn't really suspenseful in a typical way there's a lot of throwaway humor to this show sometimes its just <UNK> to get to the climax there's a thread from this show coming all the way up to the present mad men show in terms of style not that david chase writes mad men but the people that worked under him on the sopranos definitely have <UNK> and inherited his <UNK> comic tone
<START> when this film opened back in 1976 legend has that it was met with massive <UNK> and disdain it was widely considered a failure i vividly remember ebert giving it one star and it was supposedly <UNK> at cannes br br apparently these people didn't understand the movie which is not that hard to comprehend since it's very <UNK> dark and layered in ways that still <UNK> me reading through many of the reviews here i find even after about 7 8 viewings over the years many elements of the film i had previously <UNK> over but even without understanding much the psychological <UNK> of the story it's still a cracking <UNK> even if you just take the <UNK> paranoia and <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> title character like a <UNK> wave over the course of it's two hour running time br br <UNK> the source material an excellent <UNK> by underrated novelist <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> more intriguing layers <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> of the highest order though he seems at first to be yet another mild everyday soul one gradually realizes he is one of those people who seems to <UNK> drift through life letting it direct him he seems to have few strong feelings about his likes and <UNK> he finds himself gently pushed this way and that but never seems to get too bent out of shape regardless this vague sort of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is more noticeable in the novel than the movie but there are hints of it early in the film too br br making a play for the apartment of a woman one <UNK> <UNK> who is in the hospital recovering from a recent suicide attempt appears to be the most daring thing he has attempted even effectively <UNK> down the price of the <UNK> in the bargain he soon finds however that he is paying for his good thing in more ways than he cares as he finds himself in the center of <UNK> created by a building full of neurotic control freaks who are <UNK> to even the slightest sign of human life such as a <UNK> in the night or a knock on the door br br instead of taking a stand though <UNK> becomes increasingly <UNK> by the situation and <UNK> by paranoia and a sense of <UNK> he becomes obsessed with <UNK> imagining himself to be like her dressing like her etc as his own personality rapidly begins to be wiped away by his own insanity br br if anyone has ever <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as an artist they'd be well advised to see this film his trademark black humor is <UNK> and sometimes embarrassingly on display here and god bless him he makes himself the butt of it it's a tour de force performance in one of the <UNK> <UNK> most gothic horror movies ever made that more people haven't seen it is a true crime
<START> for my opinion the middle of the film specially the love scene is a bit too long but the whole time you can imagine this desert feeling but the best what made this film unforgettable are the great explosion pictures their color <UNK> and the pink <UNK> music are unique in <UNK> br br destruction in its <UNK> and popular form
<START> does any one know what the 2 sports cars were i think robert <UNK> might have been a <UNK> rock <UNK> character told his father he was taking a job in iraq isn't that <UNK> i have had <UNK> malone in my <UNK> bank most of my life maybe this was the film that impressed me loren bacall sure did have some chops in this film and probably out acted malone but <UNK> part made a more sensational impact so she got the oscar for best supporting role was <UNK> part considered a leading role old man hadley character was was probably a pretty common picture of <UNK> of his era in that he was a regular guy who made it big in an <UNK> industry but in building a whole town he had forgotten his children to have his wife bring them up in time being widowed he realized that they were all he really had and they were spoiled rotten looking for attention so rather than try to relate to his children he blew his head off an ancient morality tale but seriously what were those sports cars
<START> saving grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun i mean the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a <UNK> it was the first movie i watched with this theme drugs marijuana that is not really <UNK> it only making jokes about it grace <UNK> is a widow who lives in a small town in u k and has many financial problems because of her dead husband who committed suicide since he was full of <UNK> the problem is that grace who imagined to have some money saved for her discovers that she needs to pay all of her husband's pounds in <UNK> to not lose all of her things specially her house that she loves so much she never worked before and is in a tragic situation until matthew her <UNK> who is very found of smoking pot decides to make a <UNK> with her in selling marijuana in large scale
<START> well done al gore you have become the first person to have made 1 billion dollars of the global warming lie just like all the other man made <UNK> in the world this one is up there with the best lies to have sucked in so many people sure <UNK> is not a good thing and i would love for all the <UNK> to keep on growing but global warming is a business it <UNK> thousands of people that are all very <UNK> br br <UNK> it there are just to many things that just don't add up but well done al you failed as a politician but went on to make lots of money sucking in the world br br whats next santa is real
<START> it's obvious that the people who made <UNK> at the box <UNK> love b movie horror overt references to the genre are <UNK> throughout from stock characters the authority figure who doesn't believe the monstrous invasion is really happening to kevin smith style discussions to <UNK> <UNK> jones' last moments from <UNK> of the living <UNK> not once but twice br br unfortunately it takes more than love to make a good movie br br the staging and shot choice are <UNK> and unimaginative while a common <UNK> in film school is to avoid <UNK> theatre ' telling the story completely in a wide master shot here we find the <UNK> as in several sequences it's hard to figure out the <UNK> relationships between characters as the story is told in a series of medium shots with no establishing shot to tie it together editing is drab and basic and at times there are <UNK> cuts the lighting is flat and sometimes <UNK> making the scenes in the <UNK> theatre hard to make out was there lighting or was this shot with available light only some shots are out of focus the dialogue is trite and the performances for the most part one note <UNK> robinson shows some energy and screen presence as curtis and the fellow playing the <UNK> has some pleasantly <UNK> line <UNK> michael allen williams as the theater manager and <UNK> <UNK> as enthusiastic film geek eric have some nice moments the premise is silly even for a b horror flick also it's too bad dr <UNK> was unaware of project <UNK> he could've saved himself a lot of trouble the <UNK> are non threatening and their makeup is unconvincing although the <UNK> zombie trying to get a <UNK> out of the machine raised a smile for a zombie fan film there is very little blood or violence although what there is is handled pretty well the incidental music while <UNK> uneven is kind of nice at times and there are some good <UNK> effects the <UNK> <UNK> parody was a fun listen although the images going along with it were less fun to watch unfortunately the <UNK> dialogue sounds flat was this shot non sync <UNK> it looks like video through and through i watched the special introduction by troma <UNK> lloyd kaufman before the main feature although it consisted essentially of kaufman <UNK> his own stuff and <UNK> that he hadn't seen the movie while someone <UNK> in a <UNK> mask its production and entertainment values were higher than <UNK> ' itself quick aside to whoever put the dvd together the <UNK> on film leader <UNK> only on the flash frame 2 not on every number plus one more after for that matter the vampire film <UNK> are seen watching early in <UNK> ' looked a lot more entertaining than this recommendation to avoid unless you know someone involved in the production or are an <UNK> lloyd kaufman <UNK> he plays <UNK> the <UNK> in the film within a film br br full <UNK> my girlfriend is an extra in this movie i swear this did not color my review
<START> the guy did a lot of title design for a bunch of movies and i guess one day he said i should pick a cheap scenario try to put as much title in it as a can cause after all i'm a title designer and try to <UNK> people that this is in fact a movie one of the worst i've even seen that's for sure if you fell the urge to see nice titles go check out some posters don't waste your time watching this br br it kinda ironic don't you think did you saw the poster the only part of his project that should had title work done have almost none
<START> in its way mister <UNK> originally and more appropriately titled <UNK> <UNK>  i can't see addressing its title character as mister is a tribute to good acting both jamie bell as <UNK> a physically attractive <UNK> creep and sophia <UNK> as kate his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance are convincing the problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life a young man who spies on the intimate details of people's lives the way <UNK> does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp and a woman in <UNK> situation would be <UNK> and frightened she would probably call the police br br these things are not however what happens in the movie poor <UNK> mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he's been having an affair <UNK> of course hates his stepmother and lets he know it she has sex with him <UNK> some kind of an <UNK> person who places <UNK> in a dish <UNK> job and plays sexual games she looks like his birth mother it all ends happily with <UNK> <UNK> his issues br br forty some years ago the play and brilliantly acted movie who's afraid of virginia <UNK> had a similarly optimistic ending with characters becoming <UNK> and better after <UNK> each other apart the trouble is it doesn't always work that way especially when nobody really cares in virginia <UNK> the <UNK> plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation in mister <UNK> the emotional revelation never really happens
<START> i began watching this movie with low expectations as a matter of fact i only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a s k novel a novel i never read br br i'm glad my expectations were low because the movie wasn't nothing close to good but it manages to keep you interested what really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the actors the movie is overlong hasn't no nice shots and no scares the dialogs are dumb and the special effects are crap br br the only things good are that as i said it keeps you interested i guess the book must be good without using much horror cliches br br my vote 4 10
<START> barbra streisand is a tour de force in this hollywood story her performances and the songs are one of a kind and are special in the <UNK> of great movies the scene where she is introduced to the <UNK> audience by <UNK> against the <UNK> wishes and hers only to turn them around with her magnificent performance of woman in the moon is one of the best examples on film of how well a great performer can win over an audience it's real the scene where she records <UNK> ranks with the best in the business all live no lip sync very special streisand is often criticized for being a <UNK> but she delivers on this one she is <UNK> singing with one more look at you she deserved the oscar she and paul williams got for <UNK> <UNK> had his moments too far above most of his movie appearances this version of the born franchise ranks with the first one of <UNK> janet <UNK> <UNK> march although i will always enjoy judy garland and james mason musical remake of 1954 i haven't seen the dvd yet and don't know about its quality
<START> so this guy named george is sitting home alone on his birthday when two women show up <UNK> wife is at a hospital taking care of their son so when the wife is away george gets in the bubble bath and makes love to both of the girls it isn't that great of a scene because it really doesn't show anything after that the birthday boy wakes up the next morning and the girls are still at his house they make him a nice breakfast but george isn't hungry george isn't very happy and he tries to <UNK> them but when he gets home the girls are still at his house the girls have had enough with old george and no longer want to cook for them they both turn out to be major <UNK> and use george in their little crazy game i liked that the girls just did what they wanted and messed up <UNK> house george wasn't really that great to his two guests when george said he was a married man he really didn't seem to mean it george looked like tom tucker on family guy i was for the two girls the whole time
<START> in die <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was betrayed now <UNK> seeks revenge she marries <UNK> and through a series of events finally <UNK> in a very <UNK> but fitting action at the end br br one of the things about watching this movie nowadays is that we can look at certain portrayals <UNK> the <UNK> called <UNK> in the movie is shown as the strange person from the east possibly an <UNK> to the soviet union obviously it was not fritz <UNK> fault that hitler used the <UNK> for german national pride in the third <UNK> but one can see what the <UNK> liked about the story nonetheless this is an absolutely <UNK> movie
<START> i see people writing about how great this movie was it was horrible the acting was sub par at best it made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of <UNK> where the hell did they get the money anyway i wanted to learn more about the titanic why it <UNK> what was running through a lot of people's minds maybe even a little conspiracy stuff does anyone realize that certain people didn't even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off no you don't because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupid br br i did cry in during one scene though the scene when they showed the water that was filling up in the ship it looked like pool water i'm thinking this movie made all this money and they couldn't even make the water from the ocean look real unbelievable br br <UNK> the band played on while the ship <UNK> just ridiculous this was the worst movie until pearl harbor <UNK> it in the nothing to do with reality department
<START> i was lying on my bed with a really bad cold or <UNK> or whatever i figure maybe i'd kill some time watching some horror movies my mom bought for me a little while ago i wish i never picked this movie after i watched it i felt even more sick and i wanted to throw up <UNK> when i got better of course i did some research on dennis l <UNK> and i noticed that the dennis in the movie was nothing like the real one i hope that no one ever watches this movie but if they ever do don't eat or you'll feel the way i felt after i first watched it i think you would have a better time watching the santa claus 3 at least that movie had better reviews on this site
<START> someone will have to explain to me why every film that features poor people and <UNK> a pseudo gritty look is somehow seen as realistic by some people br br i didn't see anything realistic about the characters although the actors did their best with really bad parts or the situations instead i saw a forced self conscious effort at being edgy gritty and down and dirty br br sadly it takes a lot more than hand holding the camera without rhyme or reason and failing to light the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant way br br it's a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only films that see the inside of a movie theater are nowadays all <UNK> copies with bad cinematography non existent camera direction and a lot of swearing <UNK> to pass themselves as art br br it's little wonder that films like in the bedroom or about <UNK> get such <UNK> i found them to be meandering and very average but compared to the current slew of independent <UNK> like raising victor vargas they are outright brilliant and inspired br br a few years ago seeing an independent film meant that you would likely be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care and maybe a few technical <UNK> caused by the low budgets nowadays it means that chances are you'll get yet another by the numbers let's shake the camera around for two hours attempt at <UNK> the lack of taste of independent <UNK> and of course all that to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and contrived br br is it any surprise that the independent <UNK> has fewer and fewer surviving companies not at all when you see films like raising victor vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the films that <UNK> them
<START> i am so insulted by this movie it's not even funny and i thought <UNK> was unbelievable however low my expectations of disney have become i never figured they'd do something so stereotypical yet so off there is no respect here for any true chinese culture just the hollywood tradition of random martial arts br br i appreciate that they tried to make wendy into a normal teenage girl but fortunately most normal teenage girls particularly asian teenage girls are much less obsessed with such shallow aspects of life and from a cultural stand point it's almost impossible yes there are girls who are wrapped up in popularity and fashion but they're pretty rare and even the ones who are are still fairly decent <UNK> another stereotype maybe but a fairly true one because that's how chinese parents work that's how chinese values work if they wanted to go for authenticity they would've made wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a love hate relationship with her family br br this just adds to my frustration with american movies asian culture isn't about <UNK> and vague nature oriented phrases that sound wise we don't walk around smiling <UNK> all the time and we don't all know some form of martial arts we're a people and i'd appreciate it if someone would write an asian part that doesn't portray us as some sad caricature
<START> youth sexuality and the french countryside one of the more unique films you're ever going to see if you can see it that is no mean feat considering how hard it is to find copies of it a combination of <UNK> and censorship it's sometimes erotic sometimes disgusting and occasionally funny a <UNK> boring also in the middle but all in all you can't call yourself an <UNK> of bizarre film until you've seen this one at least once
<START> the movie opens with a meteor crashing into a lake <UNK> to the locals a dinosaur egg is also at the bottom of the lake the meteor <UNK> the lake turning it into a giant <UNK> you guessed it the egg <UNK> releasing a dinosaur that proceeds to <UNK> the community br br what utter garbage it's not that i mind the stop motion clay dinosaur it's everything else about the movie that bothers me the acting is atrocious the dialogue is utterly ridiculous the comic relief is anything but comic logic is non existent any similarity between the scientists in this movie and an actual scientist is purely <UNK> i could go on for an eternity on the bad aspects of this movie but you get the idea i feel it's fairly safe to call this disaster mst3k worthy
<START> this movie is so bad it can only be compared to the all time worst comedy police academy 7 no laughs throughout the movie do something worthwhile anything really just don't waste your time on this garbage
<START> this movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about murphy's law being applied to home <UNK> and construction if a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional since it was set in the <UNK> forties we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era grant of course perfectly <UNK> the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast <UNK> by loy and douglas their <UNK> make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment 7 10
<START> now i'll be the first to admit it when i say something that may be <UNK> or unfair so i would like to apologize in advance for my <UNK> about how much i disliked this movie br br that about sums it up too i disliked this movie to be more specific i disliked the concept of this movie the cinematography was good the mood was nice and the acting was satisfactory br br however the story is <UNK> <UNK> and misleading it is also offensive br br i am a quarter <UNK> indian and for some reason i feel insulted on a personal level by the nature of <UNK> character first of all he's a black guy and this isn't a racist remark i swear the thought of a white hispanic or even native american swinging a <UNK> on a <UNK> <UNK> everything that the <UNK> represents the <UNK> represents the soul of a samurai <UNK> with the souls of his <UNK> who guide and protect the samurai for ghost dog to use his guns instead of the <UNK> is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside and where the heck did he get a <UNK> anyway it must be one of those <UNK> which insults the samurai <UNK> even more br br also ghost dog showed no honor near the end of the movie he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then <UNK> a man by shooting him in the face through a <UNK> drain not only is this a <UNK> way to kill an enemy it's more like a ninjas way silent <UNK> a group that <UNK> deny exists but hates none the less br br then he tries to kill his boss when he finds out his boss is a baddie you know what a true samurai does when he learns his master is <UNK> bad or <UNK> he kills himself to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his <UNK> master br br everything about the character was a giant <UNK> to the real code that all samurai <UNK> to <UNK> br br so we have great cinematography good ambiance and so so acting <UNK> a <UNK> plot and premise which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it making it an <UNK> overall film and an insult to everything a honorable <UNK> samurai holds dear br br 2 5 10 <UNK>
<START> panic in the streets is a fairly unknown little movie from director <UNK> kazan and was made before his classic masterpieces such as a <UNK> named desire on the <UNK> and east of <UNK> kazan already won an oscar in <UNK> before this movie so he was not a completely unknown at the time still panic in the streets is mostly a movie that passed under the radar br br the great thing about this movie is the oscar winning script it has a very good concept and its excellent tense thriller material with a <UNK> of crime film noir elements the dialog in this movie is also absolutely magnificent and gives the movie a feel of reality and credibility br br the cast is fairly unknown especially at the time it was released but it still features zero mostel and jack palance in one of their first movie roles especially palance <UNK> as the tough gangster boss with a very powerful looking face br br still the movie drags a little at some points the movie starts of very well but after the start the movie slows down and does not always makes the right decisions in terms of pace and the point of view the story is told from br br yet panic in the streets remains a perfectly watchable movie mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialog that makes the movie a believable one to watch for fans of the thriller genre this is a great movie to watch br br 8 10
<START> at last i've finally got round to it and managed to see a clean copy of <UNK> up until now i've only had a <UNK> <UNK> jerky version taped off <UNK> tv sometime in the <UNK> with quirky english subtitles <UNK> widescreen coverage and a fluid colour with a mind of its own having thought the world of such a poor and short copy i find the decent one was well worth the wait and the full <UNK> minutes even more of a pleasure than i thought possible br br this was the lovely <UNK> <UNK> film from start to finish and i believe was planned by her from 1958 on finally <UNK> it in 1971 what a shame it was that <UNK> alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes in <UNK> <UNK> a body double in some scenes the strain definitely shows in her face br br the story of <UNK> versus <UNK> i can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it but i'm led to understand that it <UNK> depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in india it's a <UNK> and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously <UNK> too but to me it's the <UNK> golden music by <UNK> <UNK> as sung by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> especially <UNK> <UNK> and its part in the unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding i've seldom heard such serious beautiful poetic <UNK> sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack <UNK> in the rain may be my favourite musical film but <UNK> has my favourite music yet <UNK> said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her the only pity is that the also unique <UNK> <UNK> only had the one song in here albeit a classic <UNK> with <UNK> br br because of all this but not blind to its faults <UNK> is my favourite indian movie filmed at a time when the <UNK> of india was gathering pace and watched now when western values seem to be state <UNK> and de <UNK> at the very least watch <UNK> for a taste of what indian pop music had to offer the world before it was all <UNK> for drum machines the bollywood beat and <UNK>
<START> by hook or by crook is a tremendously innovative film from a pair of immensely smart and talented filmmakers harry dodge and <UNK> howard they manage to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style and it's beautifully shot by ann t <UNK> and wonderfully written truly poetic br br the lead characters are true heroes and serve as a rare kind of role model inspiration for butch <UNK> and <UNK> everywhere this film has so much energy so much poignant passion and <UNK> san francisco heart to it i can't recommend it highly enough br br the best butch buddy movie of all time
<START> ned kelly ledger the infamous australian outlaw and legend sort of like robin hood with a mix of billy the kid <UNK> love the legend of how he stood up against the english <UNK> <UNK> and united the lower classes to change australia forever the fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70 immigrant criminals seems to be casually <UNK> around by this film indeed quite a few so called <UNK> in this film are on reflection a tad dubious br br i suppose the <UNK> should have been <UNK> when in the opening credits it was claimed that this film is based upon the book our <UNK> if ever a <UNK> version of truth could be seen in a name for a book there it was this wasn't going to be a historical epic but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of ned kelly albeit a harsh and <UNK> brutal version br br unfortunately ned kelly is nothing more than an overblown hallmark channel real life historical <UNK> wannabe the story <UNK> along at an <UNK> rate <UNK> because never has a film <UNK> so slowly the feeling of <UNK> after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of <UNK> awful <UNK> <UNK> all those years ago simply put nothing happens in the film but it takes a long time getting to that nothing this would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good because the direction sure as heck wasn't however unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst <UNK> accent then you're gonna be disappointed between that the game of who has the stupidest beard ' spot the obvious <UNK> ' clue they are all ginger for some reason and nature in australia including <UNK> it is an experience similar to <UNK> through hallmark the history channel discovery channel and <UNK> whilst suffering a huge <UNK> <UNK> nature pops up a lot as to fill even more time possibly an attempt to look arty the film keeps showing pointless <UNK> shots and once all the native species are shown here's a circus to allow for a <UNK> and a lion which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the <UNK> people br br this is a turgid <UNK> piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to tv there isn't even one good word i can say about this film even the usually fantastic rush seems embarrassed to be here when one of the characters comments that there is only 2 bullets left for him and his pal i myself was wishing i had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head
<START> we tend to forget that the master slave context of the past centuries lead to more than well tended <UNK> powered by large groups of <UNK> people and a lot of money for the white owners it lead to a group of people caught in the middle the <UNK> resulting from slave owners <UNK> with their female slaves br br some of these children just became more slaves and others were free but free and <UNK> which back then meant anything but relative to the lot of their <UNK> br br a class formed around these <UNK> the <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> or free people of colour and that class was able to a certain extent to own property raise themselves from <UNK> to educated and to <UNK> a <UNK> dignity that is to say they weren't slaves but they were still exploited to a certain extent br br often the women lived as <UNK> to the white plantation masters and men of wealth set up in their own houses with <UNK> <UNK> paid for for their children and a kind of <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> they chose to <UNK> on their families in essence they were <UNK> themselves to ensure their own <UNK> and relative independence from <UNK> an <UNK> called <UNK> br br feast of all saints is a beautifully written story about the children of one such woman the result of just such an <UNK> with a local gentleman and the people who touched on their lives in both a negative and a positive way the tale was an eye opener for me a new <UNK> with no real conception of the black white lines let alone that grey area in the middle where the <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the characters are very three dimensional and have been well rendered in this adaption of the novel by anne rice the parts are well cast the costumes are wonderful and the brutal way the lines are drawn out with the <UNK> areas made all the more distinct by the conflicts the protagonists go through the <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> could not marry the whites the slaves could not help themselves and the whites even the sympathetic ones couldn't bear to face the economic reality of doing right by the people they <UNK> on br br i recommend this story both the novel and the miniseries to everyone <UNK> if you can't handle the truth you'll cringe and <UNK> through some parts as one injustice after another is <UNK> out on those of colour both by their white <UNK> and by their own people bear in mind though that this is nothing more than reality and this tale is an absorbing way to learn about it br br i know it may sound <UNK> but this miniseries both entertained me and enthralled me despite the sour taste i found in my mouth at what went on and i thoroughly enjoyed it watch it if not read up on the period because there's a lesson to be learned from it all
<START> this could have been a good episode but i simply had to turn it off the british representation was horrible to watch have the makers ever set foot in britain prior to filming at least set foot in england i don't think any british person have had such an accent apart from a comedy skit of the royal family also with the 2 english boys well i don't think any english boy has acted spoke or dressed like any english kid in the history of the british nation since prince william and harry's <UNK> public appearances to american film makers there is more than 1 country in the uk england <UNK> scotland and northern ireland meaning more than 1 culture i can handle some stereotyping but this was so bad i could not watch it fire looked cool though
<START> if you are a fan of altman's large ensemble casts as <UNK> in major films like m a s h <UNK> <UNK> park and lesser seen films like a wedding then you will no doubt be entertained by health centered around a health convention where two women are running for president health contains many of altman's latter 70s <UNK> like paul <UNK> who helped write the film carol <UNK> and henry gibson while also including top star altman <UNK> like lauren bacall james garner and glenda jackson like a lot of altman ensemble films there are numerous subplots in this film but it is not nearly as overwhelming as films like <UNK> or a wedding rather it has a more centered feel perhaps like m a s h or <UNK> park the whole thing is an obvious satire on the health movement filled with over top outlandish <UNK> characters with guest stars like dick <UNK> providing a <UNK> commentary on the whole thing <UNK> the whole election process is altman's characteristic <UNK> about politics and public appeal but what is most appealing about this film is the sheer fun most people seem to be having this would be one of altman's last films like this for a while
<START> fabulous actors beautiful scenery stark reality i won't elaborate on all of the other <UNK> comments because you get the picture however the movie isn't for the <UNK> reality is <UNK> pigs and other <UNK> in order to survive i also have <UNK> randall stewart's <UNK> book i read it several years ago i have to <UNK> it since i just watched the newly released <UNK> dvd of the movie br br i tried to buy the video for several years finally bought it used from a video store that went out of business but <UNK> the dvd is now for sale i purchased it on amazon com not cheap but well worth it to me this is a movie i will be watching until the end of my days
<START> this may not be the very worst movie peter sellers ever did i think that laurel goes to the prisoner of <UNK> but it is surely the most depressing sellers especially sans makeup as <UNK> smith looks like he has just <UNK> <UNK> as fu <UNK> he looks hardly better and spends most of the film with the exception of those strangely disturbing scenes where he gets <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> on the verge of <UNK> under the weight of all that makeup the supporting players also look tired and run down and sid <UNK> presence is offensive even without his constant references to <UNK> one bright spot this would be one of the last times a major motion picture would portray <UNK> so <UNK> or for that matter star a non asian as one the film seems surprisingly cheap with <UNK> photography and drab sets even the <UNK> bang elvis number at the end looks cut rate only the stunning helen <UNK> and the tall thin nervous guy who get his pants wet add any sparks of life to this sad affair all in all this film provides an eerie <UNK> of a great <UNK> death and an even <UNK> <UNK> of his dying
<START> this is actually a pretty bad film the ideology is not as perverse as in those films collins made later however my main <UNK> about the film are that it is implausible and quite frankly boring for a long time the whole concept of an ex <UNK> man joining terrorists for no particular reason isn't very convincing and you can't help wondering why a group of highly organized terrorists who later become pretty clueless fall for it the film starts with a pretty powerful scene but then <UNK> for quite a long time building up towards the great finale overall i think who <UNK> wins could have been an interesting 45 minutes episode of the professionals but the story doesn't carry a feature film although reasonably successful at the time this film <UNK> the demise of <UNK> career who in the eighties mainly made cheap and dubious soldier of fortune or army films pity because he actually is quite a versatile actor but at the end of the day martin shaw chose his roles more carefully and has a career that's still successful
<START> john <UNK> is a an excellent actor i have to admit that i was impressed by his range in the role of a <UNK> old <UNK> who reluctantly agrees to take in an <UNK> from the streets of london wwii time era br br that being said the film is also excellent a very moving story with a satisfying ending some of the characters are a little underdeveloped the school teacher in particular but none of them are essential to the plot basically the story is about the old man and the boy and the film needs little else
<START> the most <UNK> and funny brooks movie i ever seen i can watch and re watch the tape 100 times i laugh my a off and i cry on some moments it is really good and funny movie and if you like brooks this is a must in short brooks <UNK> gets to the streets as homeless for 30 days in order to win the entire poor district from his <UNK> the reality bites but in the end it is about warm relations between humans <UNK> recommend
<START> this is one of my favorite films of all time i read the book and liked it but this movie <UNK> on everything the book made famous the acting is fantastic especially from jon voight who plays mr sir a very evil character this film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you hooked throughout until the end where everything is pulled together for a great ending i also love the way this is directed by flashing back and forth between the modern day and <UNK> <UNK> stories the story was written by louis <UNK> yes but it seems that this story is made for film and andrew davis does a great job directing it i definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys good movies
<START> warning avoid this super <UNK> awful movie if you watched it you will be <UNK> disappointed br br pam and denise are grandma age now what are they doing trying so hard to be young innocent and sexy just not working at all pam and denise act so horribly in this movie br br plus the script is absolutely atrocious i can't believe someone can came out with such crappy ideas with the development of movie industry movie lovers are not as easy to satisfy as the ones in the last century i bet the movie goers from last century will hate this too br br stay away from it i think watch white chicks from 2004 it's so much better that this make no mistake at that time i thought that's the worst movie i have ever seen
<START> since i had loved the inspector gadget cartoon in the 80's i went to see this movie i wasted my money the plot was very thin also the movie could not keep me interested for long i was glad it was over br br if you want to see inspector gadget watch the cartoon instead it was much better than the movie
<START> ok i have been a huge fan of the black for a long time and was disgusted after seeing this film let's name the problems first this film has much of the same crew that the first two had it has also been called the prequel to the original black <UNK> why is it that they can't get <UNK> <UNK> name correct or her color in the black <UNK> returns we learn the <UNK> was the <UNK> <UNK> mother and in this film she is a gray <UNK> name jenny wtf and it's set in africa in 1946 and <UNK> i could be wrong but the first one was set in the 1940's as well when the ship <UNK> time line doesn't sound quite right to me also as a goof there is a <UNK> in the beginning of the movie that is supposed to be <UNK> father upon further notice it appears to be a <UNK> ben <UNK> is the only character that remained to even make this film appear to be related to the previous two in any way might be a cute family film to some but it's my biggest movie disappointment of the year
<START> this is one of the best films ever made it is a realistic depiction of rural <UNK> life which was a big part of american history the setting is <UNK> <UNK> where life had not changed much since the previous century the film keeps your interest without the added hollywood <UNK> the whole family can see this movie and be intrigued about how life was like in america when it was mostly a rural nation with this film you will escape the present and witness the daily life of 100 years ago in a beautiful <UNK> environment you will see the hard physical work that was required to survive as well as the constant <UNK> and concerns of the elements and the market <UNK> that will make a difference between success or failure see this movie and experience life as it was for most of our <UNK> history this film is worth your time to see my only question is why aren't there more films like this one
<START> a movie about a bunch of some kind of filmmakers who want to make a documentary on a new kind of surfing in shark <UNK> waters as an absolute fan of movies including some kind of vicious animals or monsters i thought this might be my kind of movie it wasn't this should be more of a <UNK> of how not to do it it has a lot of accidental humor in it and the evil beast is an incredible joke in the final scene it goes after the main characters rolling the feet are obviously waving in the air it looks ridiculous good for a laugh though if it were only for the lack of talent between the actors the embarrassingly stupid dialogs and the hilariously stupid crocodile it would be at least worth a laugh but it gets worse i'd guess the people in charge of this movie noticed how weak it was so they though up the old idea of sex sells totally i mean totally without any reasons one of the main actresses shows her breasts to the beast and somewhere towards the beginning there's some kind of meaningless <UNK> this is the last <UNK> making the movie absolute trash to me it's incredible how people actually spend time producing such rubbish if you are seeking for a real waste of time watch this movie
<START> in iran women are not <UNK> to attend men's sporting events apparently to protect them from all the <UNK> and foul language they might hear <UNK> from the male fans so since men can't <UNK> or behave themselves women are forced to suffer go figure <UNK> tells the tale of a half dozen or so young women who dressed like men attempt to sneak into the high stakes match between iran and <UNK> that in 2005 <UNK> iran to go to the world cup the movie was actually filmed in large part during that game br br <UNK> is a slice of life comedy that will remind you of all those great <UNK> films the shop on main street loves of a blonde closely watched trains etc that <UNK> out of communist <UNK> as part of the <UNK> miracle in the mid 1960's as with many of those works <UNK> is more concerned with <UNK> life than with <UNK> any kind of <UNK> contrived fictional narrative indeed it is the simplicity of the setup and the <UNK> of the style that make the movie so effective br br once their <UNK> is discovered the girls are <UNK> into a small pen right outside the stadium where they can hear the <UNK> cheering <UNK> from the game inside stuck where they are all they can do is <UNK> with the security guards to let them go in guards who are basically bumbling good natured <UNK> who are compelled to do their duty as a part of their <UNK> military service even most of the men going into the stadium don't seem particularly <UNK> at the thought of these women being allowed in still the <UNK> <UNK> yet how can one not be impressed by the very real courage and <UNK> displayed by these women as they go up against a system that continues to <UNK> such a ridiculously <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and yet the purpose of these women is not to <UNK> behind a cause or to make a point they are simply obsessed fans with a burning desire to watch a soccer game and like all the men in the country cheer on their team br br it's hard to tell just how much of the dialogue is scripted and how much of it is <UNK> but in either case the actors with their <UNK> <UNK> faces do a magnificent job making each moment seem utterly real and convincing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are notable <UNK> in a uniformly excellent cast the structure of the film is also very loose and <UNK> as writer director <UNK> <UNK> and co writer <UNK> <UNK> focus for a few brief moments on one or two of the characters then move smoothly and effortlessly onto others with this documentary type approach we come to feel as if we are witnessing an actual event unfolding in real time very often it's quite easy for us to forget we're actually watching a movie br br it was a very smart move on the part of the filmmakers to include so much good natured humor in the film it's what the czech filmmakers did as well the better to point up the utter absurdity of the situation and <UNK> the appeal of the film for audiences both domestic and foreign <UNK> is obviously a cry for justice but it is one that is made all the more effective by its <UNK> to make of its story a heavy breathing tragedy instead it realizes that nothing breaks down social <UNK> quite as <UNK> as humor and an appeal to the audience's common humanity and isn't that what true art is supposed to be all about in its own quiet understated way <UNK> is one of the great under appreciated gems of 2007
<START> after losing his cattle herd to a <UNK> <UNK> a trail boss winds up in the <UNK> gold fields with a bad reputation and small chances of being able to return to the states while there his <UNK> take a turn for the best until a bad luck <UNK> from the past comes calling good western with many favorite old faces in the <UNK>
<START> i never had an <UNK> while watching the movie that it was meant for the idiot box i always thought that this was some very good successful movie of the late 90's but after i saw on the internet that this was meant for the tv i was shocked because for a television film it is absolutely fantastic br br the thing that mostly concerned me was the length i felt that the one on one battle scene should've been removed as it was completely unnecessary also it began to drag towards the end as it seemed as if the adventure was never going to end br br on the plus side there is a strong very interesting and captivating plot with magnificent performances by everyone i just felt that <UNK> <UNK> looked a bit <UNK> i also felt that <UNK> who looked <UNK> turned a bit stupid at some scenes br br i was delighted by the beautiful landscapes of africa also the first half of the movie would have made me give this movie a 9 still its a great film for the television 8 out of 10
<START> if this is your first time experiencing the wonders of cinema if you've never seen a moving picture before you'll think this movie is a child of the gods but if you've seen a movie a tv show even barney the dinosaur then you won't be very impressed by this film heck barney the dinosaur was even more realistic than the <UNK> in this flick br br now i like b movies i just watched the giant <UNK> monster right before i watched this <UNK> and i liked that movie much better it works as a b movie it has <UNK> dialog <UNK> acting <UNK> effects and an honest to gosh real <UNK> monster as the monster <UNK> 3 just doesn't pack much of a b movie punch it has some gore and that <UNK> guy comes close to being funny a few times but this movie is <UNK> almost <UNK> it's the little engine that couldn't of dinosaur movies i'm not saying you shouldn't watch the movie br br some people can watch <UNK> <UNK> on a sidewalk and feel entertained if you're one of those people then give this movie a shot
<START> the first of two jim thompson adaptations released in 1990 the other being the more well known <UNK> after dark has all of <UNK> <UNK> dangerous women the confidence game and characters that are either not as dim as others suspect them of being or not as harmless br br jason <UNK> is superb as a former boxer <UNK> from the sport for life due to an incident in the ring director james <UNK> uses raging bull esquire sequences to flesh out the back story and the too little seen rachel ward also delivers a great performance but bruce dern is the film's secret weapon his sweet talking <UNK> uncle bud subtly <UNK> each of his scenes br br there's almost no comic relief in this film so watch it prepared to be sucked into the void
<START> just because someone is under the age of 10 does not mean they are stupid if your child likes this film you'd better have him her tested i am continually amazed at how so many people can be involved in something that turns out so bad this film is a showcase for digital <UNK> and nothing else the writing is horrid i can't remember when i've heard such bad dialogue the songs are beyond wretched the acting is sub par but then the actors were not given much who decided to employ joey <UNK> he cannot sing and he is ugly as sin br br the worst thing is the <UNK> of it all it is as if the writers went out of their way to make it all as stupid as possible great children's movies are wicked smart and full of wit films like shrek and toy story in recent years willie <UNK> and the witches to mention two of the past but in the <UNK> <UNK> down of american more are <UNK> to dreck like finding <UNK> yes that's right the recent charlie the chocolate factory and eye crossing trash like red riding hood
<START> spoilers some people claim that natural born killers is brilliant criticism of the media obsession with violence but this <UNK> ignores the actual content of the film oliver stone could have shown his serial killers as vicious <UNK> murderers of innocent people and <UNK> this with a morbid media fascination instead he lends them justification the movie portrays just about every victim as someone who deserved to be hurt engaging in vicious stereotyping stone presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures dumb <UNK> broken english speaking immigrants lazy fat people the one person that the homicidal <UNK> is also a stereotype of course they <UNK> the old <UNK> using american indian because they're trendy dude let's make him an admirable character fat chinese <UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> so let's make it seem like the deserve to die instead of twisted hateful that are <UNK> by their <UNK> their rampage makes them happier and more in love mickey and <UNK> are made sexy and cool and surreal visuals are bound to <UNK> more <UNK> people justice is <UNK> the police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal ugly and <UNK> compared to the <UNK> murderers again this is not in the media reports within the film but in the reality in the film there is no nuance or subtlety in the film just overblown performances and visuals the film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence the proof that the film fails in its message lies in actual real world reactions to it some <UNK> young people who saw this movie <UNK> it as inspiration for murders that they committed the film's message is a failure because it <UNK> people in the opposite direction with horrendous real life results the clever message is nowhere to be seen
<START> joe don baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and there he was alright in <UNK> and made a pretty good bond <UNK> in the living <UNK> and has appeared in various other movies one thing he can't do is carry a movie as the lead which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in <UNK> joe <UNK> partner is killed so he kills the killer's brother and <UNK> the killer to italy but some guys cause the plane to set down in <UNK> and the killer gets away the rest of the movie is seeing joe don chase the killer here and there joe don getting taken into custody various times joe don torturing a <UNK> and being interrupted and so on the movie is quite bad and you won't find yourself exactly pulling for joe <UNK> character you will be amazed at how many times joe don the hero gets taken out by one punch and how incompetent he proves to be the <UNK> part of the movie comes when joe don chases the killer all over <UNK> with the killer in a priest <UNK> and then they get in <UNK> and he chases them all around <UNK> this movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever
<START> after reading the previous comments i'm just glad that i wasn't the only person left confused especially by the last 20 minutes john carradine is shown twice walking down into a grave and pulling the <UNK> shut after him i <UNK> <UNK> some kind of explanation for this odd behavior naturally i assumed he had something to do with the evil goings on at the house but since he got killed off by the first rising corpse <UNK> referred to as zombie 1 these scenes made absolutely no sense please if someone out there knows why carradine kept climbing down into graves let the rest of us in on it br br all the action is confined to the last 20 minutes so i'll attempt a synopsis john carradine comes out to the cemetery to investigate and is <UNK> by zombie 1 so far so good but then we get the confusing scene where john ireland and jerry <UNK> out for a little <UNK> filming in the graveyard discover <UNK> dead body <UNK> repeatedly tries to push ireland into the open grave from <UNK> zombie 1 had emerged but ireland succeeds in flipping him into the open grave instead and <UNK> <UNK> comes out as zombie 2 yeah i guess we can <UNK> that <UNK> was dead all along a witch but why he changed from normal appearance into rotting flesh version by flying into zombie <UNK> grave is never explained considering how excruciatingly slow moving these zombies are i'd of thought he would have preferred to stay in his normal form until his business was <UNK> this scene also brings a question to mind just who the heck is zombie 1 we can only assume zombie 1 is one of the original murder victims shown during the movie's opening credits but who knows which one nor why he has a particular grudge against the film crew br br anyway after ireland sees this transformation and runs away we see the exact same shot of zombie 2 <UNK> through the trees as we saw for zombie 1 this leads to <UNK> confusion over just how many zombies there really are then in best 1950's horror movie fashion ireland manages to trip while fleeing he conveniently knocks his head on the small <UNK> of faith <UNK> dead cat wasn't that nice of john carradine to <UNK> a <UNK> for a cat that he barely knew br br meanwhile zombie 1 has been <UNK> havoc up at the house he easily <UNK> three film crew members then starts up the stairs faith <UNK> hears him and thinking it's lover john ireland back from his night shoot goes out upon seeing it's only zombie 1 she lets out a scream and <UNK> into a bedroom where she <UNK> <UNK> revolver while <UNK> carole wells is <UNK> at this point and can't hear the scream her co star charles <UNK> who's <UNK> and <UNK> it up at a mirror in his bedroom does taking his sweet time and only after some more <UNK> from his hip <UNK> he finally decides to investigate one thing that strikes the viewer during the last quarter of this movie is how slow to react the stars are to screams and <UNK> <UNK> comes back out into the <UNK> armed and ready but mistakes <UNK> for zombie 1 and shoots him six times he does a nice <UNK> flip over the <UNK> then a horrified <UNK> backs up right into the waiting arms of zombie 1 br br carole wells is by now out of her shower and <UNK> off when she hears <UNK> and <UNK> screams she too feels no great urgency in running out to investigate so during this time zombie 1 has time to string <UNK> up from the neck with a rope wells sees <UNK> hanging corpse and <UNK> dead away the next time we see her is in a stream outside the house but more on that later meantime ireland has <UNK> his senses and stumbles into the house where he discovers zombie <UNK> bloody carnage though ireland has just stumbled upon 3 murdered people he's more concerned that his film has been exposed and ruined mercifully for him and the audience zombie 1 throws some movie equipment down on his head from the 2nd floor that's the last we see of zombie 1 at this point the audience is treated to a montage of all the deaths showing that the new ones mirror the old ones how profound br br zombie 2 meanwhile has gotten near the house remember these zombies move as slow as <UNK> in january where he happens to see carole wells floating by in a stream and <UNK> her out how did she get there did zombie 1 carry her down throw her in then zoom back upstairs just in time to crush john ireland apparently one of the original victims was drowned in the <UNK> so wells has to <UNK> too but why outside in a stream instead of in the <UNK> is never explained zombie 2 never makes it into the house himself everyone's dead by now anyways thanks to zombie 1 but instead he carries carol wells back to the graveyard as the end credits flash on screen we see zombie 2 with his dead love still in his arms <UNK> into the open grave br br the viewer is left wondering yes but wasn't this zombie <UNK> grave why is zombie 2 taking up <UNK> and what if zombie 1 comes along and wants to climb back in is zombie 2 gonna let him or will there be a zombie fight will the zombies share both the grave and the newly deceased carole wells and what about now dead john carradine where's he gonna stay after all from the earlier scenes we know he's clearly at home in the grave if this plot synopsis of the finale has left you confused don't worry cause you're not alone
<START> this is not the typical mel brooks film it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was <UNK> leslie ann warren made the movie she is such a fantastic under rated actress there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so but all in all this is worth the price to rent and see it the acting was good overall brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience again warren was the best actor in the movie but <UNK> and sailor both played their parts well
<START> i've just finished listening to the director's commentary for this film and i think the one big thing i got from it that i agree with is that this film like <UNK> the <UNK> is completely <UNK> it's from <UNK> <UNK> so any review or attempt at <UNK> a set of comments about it as ebert did is really about <UNK> character actually if you feel as he did that the film does not work then you're saying i think that howard does not work and to be frank you might be right <UNK> reasoning and personality really wouldn't stand up to professional mental <UNK> and analysis br br but hey that's the nature of people br br andrew
<START> if you're a fan of the late <UNK> parsons then this movie is definitely going to <UNK> you part comedy part road movie but mostly a bad <UNK> of one of rock <UNK> <UNK> tales br br spoilers br br basically the story concerns a well known <UNK> named phil kaufman played by johnny <UNK> who supposedly made a <UNK> with cult rock country folk music hero <UNK> parsons that stated when one of them died first it didn't matter which one it was that the other living one was to take the deceased out to the desert joshua tree national park in california to be exact and set the body <UNK> so as to free the spirit and become one with the earth and so on sure to keep his word the barely sober kaufman with the assistance of a self hating pot headed buddy <UNK> the body of the late parsons whom had <UNK> <UNK> from a drug and booze <UNK> a day prior from the airport and shortly after that what ensues is a cringe worthy combination of fiction and truth where the late parsons girlfriend <UNK> girlfriend parsons stone faced father and a <UNK> of police officers and other pointless idiotic characters all try to beat the clock so to speak in trying to catch kaufman and his pal before they get the chance to torch parsons body br br the film's incompetent direction bad acting and lame offbeat tone in general all sink this movie faster than the titanic and not to mention the huge fact that this movie is not even halfway telling the truth of the actual events that took place the <UNK> that should have replaced the inaccuracies as far as i've heard them include number 1 parsons was married at the time of his death and even had a child so what the hell was that all about with the <UNK> and the chasing and <UNK> number 2 <UNK> drugged out buddy was a known willing <UNK> unlike what the movie attempts to portray in the <UNK> of <UNK> body and finally number 3 <UNK> parsons real life father died when he was just a boy and so it was <UNK> step father who could have honestly cared less about <UNK> parsons when he was still alive in real life that took care of the body after it was <UNK> altogether though what probably <UNK> me the most about this movie is that the real phil kaufman was actually on set to help assist with the facts of the story and yet still the movie ended up becoming so untrue and so bad that it really <UNK> my mind frankly br br also as the mediocre aforementioned acting in the film is concerned it's lead character played by the ultra grating johnny <UNK> phil kaufman is not only a bad actor but it actually seems as if he were asleep throughout most of the movie and the rest of the pathetic cast are for the most part either hysterical brain dead or seem utterly clueless as to what they're actually doing there in the first place overall if you like johnny <UNK> and or really dig the so bad they're not even good buddy flicks then i suppose you just might get a kick out of this movie but if you're like me and are a fan of the late <UNK> parsons enjoy films that attempt to tell the truth as much as they can especially if they're based on an actual real life story and or you just like good films be them road movies or fictional slice of life stuff you will truly <UNK> this film and advise others to do likewise i obviously hated this movie and wished it had never been made in the first place but since it was made i would have preferred it to have turned out differently than what it did unfortunately maybe some day the real facts of the story will come through and be made into a really great biopic on all of <UNK> parsons life not just what happened to his body after his spirit left it but until that time comes all we as an audience and or fans of the late performer get is this sad waste of film and an all around terrible <UNK> of sorts to the musical legacy that <UNK> parsons was known to have left behind it should also be noted that they did actually use parsons music and a few others as well in the flick but not surprisingly though you never get to hear enough of it to really enjoy it even in the slightest bit turkey zero stars
<START> this could be a cute movie for kids my <UNK> watched it once he was watching it a second time i was watching some of it with him br br when the little bear gets lost on the ice <UNK> and he is in the water he is trying to get to a piece of ice it says come back stupid ass fool br br i don't want my 3 year old <UNK> watching movies with words like this in it br br that is why its rated for children should be child friendly that is what i would expect put out by warner brothers and g rated i would expect this to not have <UNK> words in it the words don't even fit the movie in most places as it seems added later and the movie drags out in many parts
<START> for a low budget project the film was a success the story is interesting and the actors were convincing eva longoria who now stars on the tv show <UNK> is <UNK> than ever the locations were ideal for the <UNK> plot and the director shows his talent by taking on many roles for his project of course this low budget film could use better editing transitions and more special effects for the gun scenes but the music keeps this script moving although this film has it's share of problems such as continuity i must say that i would rent the director's next movie if your a film student you could learn a few things from the director's commentary
<START> i just finished watching this movie i was very excited since i'm a big fan of punk rock horror films and spoofs i was very surprised at what i saw i knew it was low budget but i wasn't expecting it to be taped with a video camera it opens with a good song and a great very underrated band the <UNK> <UNK> their song where they wander and promptly getting killed in various gruesome ways it's a great opening but the problem is the fact that up until the end this was really all that the movie was a live performance a death another live performance a death it gets old and there is a gross literally <UNK> of intestines in the death scenes why doesn't the killer use other body parts like legs or <UNK> or brains don't get me wrong this movie has some parts that are awesome like the hardcore french band known simply as <UNK> the <UNK> of a band named <UNK> the scene containing a performance by members of the the used and simple plan playing together since neither bands had enough members to play their show and <UNK> for <UNK> overweight and proud of it <UNK> getting killed in a truly hilarious manner that i will save for the future <UNK> of this movie but the big problem i have with this movie is the at first comical but after a while terrible lack of acting talent in a lot of the actors especially <UNK> tour creator kevin <UNK> he tries very hard but i suspect that he didn't want to make the film but was <UNK> <UNK> or something in addition to that the sound quality is terrible and there are no subtitles on the dvd the movie's <UNK> plot is very <UNK> and very random something about a magic sword and lloyd kaufman as the devil bottom line this movie has a lot of good qualities but not enough to be anywhere near a decent horror music or comedy film although i have to credit it with turning me onto a few bands that i would never have listened to otherwise such as <UNK> bomb and the <UNK> an insane <UNK> band i recommend that you rent this movie watch the first 10 or 20 minutes if you like it watch the next 20 or 30 if you still like it then watch on if not just go to the special features and watch all the music videos and live performances they rock long live punk rock and horror
<START> i loved good times with the rest of many of you i love reading intelligent and insightful commentary the writers on this show were fantastic and the actors were beyond talented to answer <UNK> the <UNK> commentary to the other superior and positive commentary what happened was that james was killed in an accident i believe i remember that it was a <UNK> accident or car accident and it was the saddest episode when it first aired and i was a tiny thing it was so sad to me br br florida and the children actually get out of the projects and even become neighbors with <UNK> <UNK> and that is how the very last show ended br br all of the children achieved their dreams and found opportunity in each of their dreams it was a wonderful ending and i cried because i was happy for them and the show seemed so realistic that i actually believed in their fate i hope that this kind of ending rings true in actually for many br br a great show and many other great shows followed including benson and the <UNK> this was an awesome period for african american television and the best writers were awesome at that time tv land is awesome for the memories and i just love it because i cannot stand the junk that we are watching today somebody bring back the 1970s and 1980s quickly your intelligent viewers are a dying breed out here and we need better material br br love a tv land original sitcom <UNK> of the 70s and 80s as they sing in all in the family those were the days
<START> be warned neither zeta jones nor <UNK> plays the main part as the poster would have you believe their roles are in fact minor br br the film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama with neither being really engaging especially i find it impossible to <UNK> much sympathy for the main protagonist not to mention his screwball friends and sex obsessed fiancé the plot drags terribly and i turned this one off after about 2 3 unusual for me as i like to finish what i start the good acting and beautiful setting takes it from 1 to 2 stars br br 2 10
<START> one of the worst films ever not funny poor tv style cinematography bad acting sad to see so many famous old actors barely able to walk let alone act lead female nancy young can't act terrible direction sub par with bad tv movies occasional weak jokes fall flat even the basic premise of the movie makes no sense somehow they are supposed to stop a wedding from happening but there's no logic behind their actions slow pacing made my wife stop watching but i suffered through it the old men are supposed to be acting like they are young and horny but it comes off as pathetic instead of funny how did they even get the money to make this
<START> the premise of this movie is revealed on the dvd box a <UNK> worker develops a miracle fabric that doesn't <UNK> but the movie fails to get on with it instead it <UNK> for 45 minutes <UNK> around a <UNK> before he makes the big discovery since audiences don't benefit much from seeing a <UNK> kid <UNK> things out it's a strange choice the movie has successfully been prevented from engaging any topic once the fabric is discovered the movie too rapidly <UNK> that both industry <UNK> and blue collar co workers want the invention <UNK> leaving the movie with just two flimsy movements <UNK> the chemical and running from <UNK> br br i can't understand why anyone would describe this as comedy the tone isn't funny or comical it's more like serious social criticism of the day that capitalism <UNK> both supply chains and production which in turn <UNK> <UNK> from reaching and <UNK> the world yes that's probably true but without some <UNK> with an attitude towards that fact the movie is simply an earnest argument you'll need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find any here br br this is more like a british meet john <UNK> meet <UNK> <UNK>
<START> according to the book the last of the cowboy heroes which is about joel <UNK> <UNK> murphy and randolph scott the author says that <UNK> was the only film he personally did not review because he claimed it was lost hadn't been seen in years br br good thing for western fans somebody was doing some spring cleaning at paramount because a print was apparently found and now it's out on the open market <UNK> is a pretty good western too with scott involved in a family <UNK> with uncle george cleveland br br george cleveland sends for his nephew randolph scott with the intention of making him part of his <UNK> business <UNK> in the fast growing <UNK> of <UNK> cleveland is more than just a business owner he's the town boss which he runs from a wheelchair he even has the sheriff in his pocket br br randolph scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing that includes not backing relatives up when they're villains he goes to work for a rival outfit headed by brother and sister russell hayden and catherine craig br br cleveland is full of all kinds of tricks and he even sends for a western <UNK> <UNK> in the person of barbara <UNK> to worm her way into the confidence of his rivals <UNK> great as the <UNK> <UNK> who develops her own agenda br br randolph scott's original home studio was paramount it was where his first studio contract was with <UNK> marked the last film he ever did for paramount and they gave him a good one br br note also <UNK> <UNK> jr who is george <UNK> chief henchman a rather <UNK> bully of a man and <UNK> hayes who is just <UNK> hayes br br <UNK> must have been loved by <UNK> across the nation in 1948 with its chief villain as a town boss who rules from a wheelchair a certain <UNK> from a wheelchair had made <UNK> of them for four straight presidential <UNK> and he was gone they had high hopes of winning the white house that year too but things went awry and they had to settle for an <UNK> boss getting his <UNK> in <UNK> i'm not sure why cleveland was in a wheelchair since nothing was really made of it in the plot my guess is he was injured and played the part that way because he had to br br still <UNK> must have had great appeal to the <UNK> market
<START> deanna durbin <UNK> grey and barbara read are three smart girls in this universal film from 1936 which introduces deanna durbin to film audiences it also stars ray <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> charles <UNK> john king <UNK> barnes and alice brady it's a sweet story about three young women now living in switzerland with their divorced mother who hear their father <UNK> is marrying again not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him they board a ship to america with the help of the <UNK> <UNK> determined to stop the wedding realizing that the intended called precious barnes is nothing but a gold <UNK> aided and <UNK> by her mother brady they <UNK> for her to be introduced to a wealthy count this is arranged by their father's <UNK> king the man he chooses is a full time drunk <UNK> but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count <UNK> what a mess br br this is a delightful film not <UNK> or overly <UNK> at all with some nice performances particularly by <UNK> <UNK> barnes and brady the young women are pretty and all do good work the emphasis of course is on young durbin who is a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer in fact her voice as a <UNK> is much more even than it would be as an adult she has no trouble with the high notes as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice she sings a delightful <UNK> <UNK> in a police station br br one of the <UNK> things about the film is to see the father played by charles <UNK> not want his children around until he sees them and gets to know them barnes as the gold <UNK> isn't all that young but the girls' mother looks way up there so the <UNK> probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger more glamorous woman in fact he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters br br universal gives durbin the big star <UNK> here she has the final shot in the movie ray <UNK> at this point was still paying his <UNK> and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is br br very entertaining and of course this led to a sequel and big stardom for deanna
<START> this is a movie about animal cruelty under the <UNK> of a marathon race we see depictions of extreme animal abuse including literally running a horse to death in slow motion the guy who did this then has his conscience <UNK> <UNK> by the flames from the burial burning of the horse which of course is still dead having been tortured to death this is one of the <UNK> <UNK> movies i've ever had the <UNK> of viewing as gene hackman and james coburn near the finish line on their dying animals we're supposed to admire their spirit for finishing the race i'd like to put the producers and director in a marathon race i'll decide when they're finished probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing
<START> <UNK> is the <UNK> movie i have ever seen and i saw the blair witch movies parts one and two it seems confused in what it wants to be it's not funny enough for comedy it's not tragic enough for drama it's not bloody enough for horror and it's not good enough for watching it has scenes of a man doing slapstick bloody karate so i think oh this movie will be in the vein of toxic <UNK> and street trash then it leaps without warning into a drama about a missing girl a retarded mentally <UNK> woman and a <UNK> mother then it <UNK> itself into the only good part in the movie which seems to be set up like a sitcom without the laugh tracks the part i'm speaking of is a lonely <UNK> who is so lonely he finds comfort in a rotting corpse that was the only part of the movie that gave me any feeling the rest was a <UNK> of my life then just to show how cruel wayne is there is a kind of documentary at the end of the film of wayne the director making fun of toby the star in public it made me sick even though killer nerd and bride of killer nerd two other movies by wayne aren't the best they at least are thought out enough were you can stay entertained until the ending credits i even like killer nerd a bit it had some great lines i still use to this day br br if you like underground films if you like <UNK> films and if you like to watch your feet just <UNK> were they are you will not like <UNK> br br 1 2 out of br br
<START> those engaging the movie camera so early in the century must have figured out some of its potential very early on this is a good story of a playboy type who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to satan for a lot of money unfortunately the soul is his double and he must confront him frequently <UNK> his life apart there are some wonderful scenes with people <UNK> out and of course the scenes when the two are on the stage at the same time the middle part is a bit dull but the <UNK> story is always in the minds of the viewer one thing i have to mention is the general <UNK> of the people in the movie also they pretty much <UNK> away from much action which would have at least given some life to the thing i first was made aware of this movie about 25 years ago and have finally been able to see it i was not disappointed
<START> ah winter kills based on the novel by richard <UNK> which deals with a conspiracy that killed the president of the united states 20 years ago i knew <UNK> also wrote the <UNK> candidate which dealt with a similar theme and was looking forward to seeing an intelligent thriller br br winter kills left me cold it's not a thriller it's a piece of worthless crap possibly the worst movie i've seen this month and boy have i seen a lot of bad movies in june the problem lies in both the direction and the script and seeing as william <UNK> was responsible for both then he should be blamed entirely for this unfunny farce br br there's two things wrong with this movie first off is the way everything is presented in a totally over the top manner it's not as <UNK> as say something like that james bond movie with david niven and peter sellers but everything has a <UNK> edge to it with actors completely <UNK> their performances this might have been justified if there was entertainment value to the movie but there's none as a satire it's very silly so silly that it becomes almost unwatchable secondly the scenes seem to have been cut so much that they're rendered senseless take for example a scene where the hero is confronting a <UNK> <UNK> leader called dawson dawson tells the hero he has 30 seconds start then it cuts to the hero being on board a plane the scenes begin and end with no rhyme nor reason br br a dire movie that's an ordeal to sit through
<START> it surprises me how much i love this movie despite the fact that i don't really like dogs fox field and <UNK> do a wonderful job with the voices of chance sassy and shadow and the acting by the animals themselves is just amazing br br i have seen this movie <UNK> times already i know that sounds scary but it's true and every time the ending scenes still get me i highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers it is indeed my all time favorite movie
<START> i have seen this movie many times and recently read the book the movie is based on and every time i see it i just want to slap all four of them the fact that they don't clue in to the fact that tom <UNK> character is flipping into his d d <UNK> m m persona oh he's just acting in character outside of the <UNK> session that and the fact that after three months of therapy let's just destroy all that and feed his <UNK> these kind of people are what give <UNK> a bad name br br also the corny <UNK> <UNK> and the music done by <UNK> on a <UNK> and <UNK> us if we get too <UNK> are almost enough to set your teeth on edge
<START> this movie seemed to have it all going for it with good camera sound film sets music costumes but drum roll gary stretch spoke i don't know if it was his poor acting or simply a bad script but would say it was both considering the casting of him in this role i found it difficult to root for him even to the very end i wished he'd have died in battle or one of the sword knife <UNK> br br then the <UNK> for the plot to kill the king was because the king didn't have dinner and sex with his queen pretty lame and to go to the extreme to kill her own son and to then push up her lover as <UNK> king i see a thread or two here and there of historical <UNK> but the manner in which this was all presented was <UNK> br br i don't recognize gary stretch from anything else but he was dreadful i read another <UNK> comments about audio being dubbed but don't think his was dubbed after all he speaks english right it really was awful the lines were read right off the <UNK> table flat line it could be he just doesn't have the voice to carry tone <UNK> br br aside from this i did watch it to the end so the movie had at least an interest it could have been more if the script lines and casting had been given more work the scenery and filming crew along with very good quality film is what really made this movie above all else the cast and story were all secondary i give the film crew a 10
<START> kay <UNK> 2004 heart <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> as it is in heaven contains every stereotype of swedish humanity and <UNK> yet manages to be a crowd <UNK> it contains plenty of <UNK> for cynical critics continuity error <UNK> and for <UNK> <UNK> yet manages to depict the colours of life in a small community <UNK> the film also runs the gamut of proverbial messages about <UNK> one's own <UNK> and <UNK> doing it despite one's <UNK> without completely <UNK> the <UNK> from the throats of the <UNK> br br its success as a crowd <UNK> comes from two facts firstly small films about strangers bringing new life to rural christian <UNK> provide plenty of scope for the exposure of <UNK> while at the same time allowing repressed characters to break out of their <UNK> the same year and with a similarly swedish <UNK> the queen of <UNK> <UNK> did it and <UNK> feast also comes to mind secondly any film about small <UNK> taking on the whole wide world will strike a human <UNK> in our increasingly individual self focused and <UNK> world this film's <UNK> similarity with the likes of the full monty <UNK> off <UNK> girls and on a clear day shows its <UNK> to the formula but it is a formula with life left in it yet and this seems to be because people need positive message films that evoke a sense of community almost in spite of themselves br br the stranger is burned out <UNK> daniel <UNK> on a quest for self <UNK> the town he visits or rather <UNK> is <UNK> to the <UNK> the place of his childhood he was <UNK> mercilessly by classmates here supposedly because he was a sensitive musician without <UNK> to drive a truck here he takes the job of <UNK> <UNK> despite the usual <UNK> of artists and <UNK> the place is of course populated by a wide range of recognizable types whose character <UNK> can be predicted the broken hearted fair haired girl so beautiful she nearly <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> local businessman the woman whose beauty is lost amidst domestic abuse the <UNK> <UNK> and his less <UNK> wife who at first seem right out of <UNK> bergman also present jealous uptight <UNK> <UNK> check <UNK> whose soul still sings check elderly couple who may have repressed desires for each other since <UNK> check <UNK> person whose function is to point out we should not laugh and say <UNK> check intellectually handicapped boy who proves able to sing a good <UNK> check br br <UNK> film is not all warm <UNK> however it <UNK> from the <UNK> put on a show despite <UNK> and moral <UNK> sub genre it contains violence and an ending that might well be a metaphor for dying after achieving creative <UNK> the violence of the film is mostly a function of male anger and <UNK> but in never <UNK> deeply into why the school bully who grows up into a wife <UNK> is like this similarly the small town <UNK> so closely <UNK> to the <UNK> black wearing super <UNK> stereotype that his secret <UNK> in <UNK> magazines is hardly surprising his <UNK> and <UNK> are just there <UNK> unrelated to psychological reality perhaps the unexplained photograph of a young boy a lost son perhaps <UNK> once over his shoulder holds the secret br br perhaps these holes are functions of the editing like several inconsistencies and continuity <UNK> that can be spotted such as <UNK> unexplained <UNK> in the choir twice after <UNK> <UNK> in fact none of the <UNK> in the film last very long and all seem resolved within a scene apart from in some awkward love scenes the film's <UNK> minutes seldom drag but there is a feeling that things may have been left on the cutting room floor br br the film remains solid three star fare despite the holes that can be picked in it this is simply because in a world of technology focused flicks and <UNK> self seeking any glimpse of human community is deep down welcome for anyone even the cynical
<START> the problem is that the movie <UNK> in on the <UNK> of the 60's created concept that comic books could only be done as camp i e the 60's batman show for tv and movie thus you have combat sequences with subtitles come on a <UNK> <UNK> doc savage he was uncomfortable around women in the <UNK> not an idiot monk <UNK> in a <UNK> a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy <UNK> in gold like a <UNK> <UNK> posing for an oscar <UNK> and when they're not doing <UNK> <UNK> march scores the <UNK> little funny music <UNK> much of the drama br br even as such this movie is okay it's fun and when it stays serious it's a very accurate representation of the <UNK> except for monk as has been mentioned before he's hugely <UNK> not <UNK> and long tom who is supposed to be a pale <UNK> guy with an attitude not paul <UNK> with an inexplicable <UNK> br br the green death sequences for instance are remarkably gruesome and not something i'd recommend for children but they are very close to the feel of the <UNK> when the writers and producers get it right they do get it right i'll give them that br br but if the producers had done doc with the loving care and scripting of say <UNK> first two superman movies think what we might have had then i think the problem is the movie's <UNK> there's a definite sense of trying to do a 30's homage but they're also trying to give in to the heroes must be camp attitude that batman created one gets the impression there was a sober pulp style first draft and then someone came in and said hey let's make it funny it worked with the batman show 8 years ago br br but doc lives on thanks to earl <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> if <UNK> ain't doing a homage to doc savage in that movie the man is truly demented so when the series actually gets on tv allegedly mid season in <UNK> 00 doc savage updated to the 90's will live once more
<START> this movie is so wonderful it's hard to find words to describe it this is the only time i can't decide which was better the book or the movie br br whoopi goldberg is awesome and oprah <UNK> such a good actress she could be funny happy and miserable all at the same time all together the movie was well directed by steven <UNK> and should not be passed up 9 10
<START> first of all i liked very much the central idea of <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> others in the fragile self on various levels mainly <UNK> but sometimes more <UNK> in fact the <UNK> are <UNK> throughout the film in the swiss french border where the <UNK> leads secluded life in the his recurring <UNK> and nightmare inside his <UNK> body after heart <UNK> in the last half of the film he becomes intruder himself returning in ancient french colony in the hope of <UNK> for the past br br the overall tone is bitter rather than pathetic full of regrets and <UNK> sense of failure being more or less <UNK> this is a quite grim picture of an old age ostensibly self <UNK> but hopelessly void and lonely inside the <UNK> <UNK> the images more to convey passing <UNK> of anxiety and desire than any explicit meanings some of them are mesmerizing not devoid of humor though kind of <UNK> play only <UNK> can <UNK>
<START> hello i was <UNK> i'm a still crazy <UNK> it was just another movie i watched partly on tv then i had to get the video tape to finally find out how it ends then i wanted the dvd because the tape showed first signs of <UNK> after a few weeks after the dvd i had to lay my hands on the soundtrack then on several film posters and the film script right now it has become that worse that i try to push other people into addiction with my website and still crazy parties br br how could that happen what drove me into addiction br br ok it's one of those funny but somehow sad and <UNK> intelligent comedies like only the british can produce br br alright the movie is worlds apart from stuff like <UNK> is spinal <UNK> because of the characters that aren't childish or ultra cool but real this is a story about men getting older too a story about men getting along with each other or don't it contains some of the best actors possible tim <UNK> stephen rea bruce robinson jimmy nail and bill <UNK> bill <UNK> who puts on one of the best performances i've ever seen in a film br br good the soundtrack is unbelievable <UNK> mick jones has written the songs for the imaginary band strange fruit jimmy nail who plays bass man les <UNK> and bill <UNK> portraying the <UNK> but awkward singer ray <UNK> are really singing we know that about jimmy nail but if you've only heard bill <UNK> singing in love actually you have no idea how great and powerful his voice is br br well you'll fever for every scene to come for the x <UNK> time especially those concert scenes you'd die to be able to really stand in the dancing crowd when strange fruit is doing all over the world singing on the top of your <UNK> you long to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the <UNK> of the real strange fruit at <UNK> festival stage br br it's hard but i'm addicted to this film i'm addicted to strange fruit if there's a world where this band really exists i'd like to move there br br got still crazy anyone
<START> a <UNK> about <UNK> the 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes <UNK> sometimes boring the first one for example sometimes used to say to americans we have had more deaths than you and you supported the murderers sometimes really weird but highly symbolic and interesting i really loved the claude <UNK> personal live of a couple in new york showing that our day to day problems are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bizarre strongly anti wars in general and <UNK> <UNK> funny typical african optimism despite terrible day to day misery and <UNK> <UNK> an egyptian intellectual pro peace having moral difficulties to accept the u s policy towards arab countries i am really pleased to see that many americans liked this movie it shows that we or they i am still <UNK> but living in texas for 12 years are still interested by other cultures and able to question past and present actions of our government like we should in a democracy
<START> directed by samuel fuller who also wrote the screenplay pickup on south street is a tough brutal well made film about a <UNK> richard widmark who inadvertently <UNK> top secret <UNK> and becomes a target for espionage agents also involved are jean peters as a tough broad who is used as a <UNK> by her evil ex lover richard <UNK> it's film noir at its best and although the performances are very good its grand character actress thelma ritter who steals the movie as moe a weary street <UNK> selling neck ties and who also sells information she is terrific in a role that brought her another oscar nomination its amazing that miss ritter was nominated six times for an academy award and she never won this should have been the role that <UNK> it for her
<START> <UNK> 2 had a lot of potential they just didn't put enough time in <UNK> it the stories were pretty cool and creepy enough but it was lacking it's a good movie but after you've seen it once you might want to see it again this movie could of been better
<START> excellent gritty and true portrayal of <UNK> ranch life on the western <UNK> with an emphasis on the woman's role and place a moving film lovingly made and based on real people and their actual experiences low budget independent film never made any money definitely not the <UNK> unrealistic hollywood version of <UNK> life
<START> a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film also a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original i'm tired of the same old stuff in movies a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film also a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original i'm tired of the same old stuff in movies a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film also a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original i'm tired of the same old stuff in movies
<START> 'the last <UNK> is far more than the sum of its parts it's not merely a disaster film not simply an exploration into australian <UNK> <UNK> and certainly more than a simple court drama writer director peter <UNK> manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thought provoking film with the same eerie atmosphere he gave to <UNK> at hanging <UNK> two years earlier that you will continue to remember years later br br when lawyer david burton chamberlain is called to defend chris lee <UNK> over the death of an <UNK> for which he may or may not be directly responsible he finds himself not merely struggling to get the truth from lee but making sense of what he hears when it does come as with the <UNK> belief that there are two worlds the everyday and the <UNK> the truth exists on two completely different levels with <UNK> more disastrous than burton could ever have imagined br br no doubt the reason why <UNK> at hanging <UNK> is better remembered is because of its enduring mystery we are led along the same path but forced to find answers for ourselves in 'the last <UNK> we can piece everything together by the end of the film however even with all the information we have to choose how much of it we want to believe because the film takes us beyond the borders of our normal realities br br on the production side <UNK> uses his budget to great effect <UNK> building a sense of doom in everything from soft lighting to heavy rain to good use of sound the incidental music is <UNK> never trying to be <UNK> richard chamberlain manages to convey the <UNK> the audience would <UNK> feel as he tries to unravel the mystery david <UNK> excellently portrays a man trapped between two worlds wanting to do the right thing but afraid because he already knows the ending br br put all these things together and you have a perfect example of why david <UNK> is a familiar name in cinema thirty years on strongly recommended
<START> i sat through this film and i have to say it only just managed to keep my attention the film would have been a bit more bearable if i did not have to watch the awful cgi for future reference to the industry if your going to use cgi watch this so you know what to avoid br br apparently this is supposed to be a graphic novel for the screen but all i saw was a bad movie which bears no resemblance to a graphic novel whatsoever br br all in all the story was not as bad as the cgi i was quite impressed with the acting and thought the casting was good and little more character info would have been nice as it did get a little confusing for me on occasion but that's not surprising as like i said it only just kept my attention but in all honestly i wish i had given this one a miss
<START> <UNK> le <UNK> is robert <UNK> masterpiece and one of the great thrillers of the fifties based on a <UNK> <UNK> novel a writer the director often worked with see also le <UNK> charge which <UNK> did not direct but in which he was the lead too the screenplay grabs you from the first pictures on a desert road by night where a beautiful blonde might be the <UNK> of the criminals to the mysterious house where he finds his femme fatale and her sister then begins a cat and mouse play one of the sisters is in a wheelchair but is she really disabled which one is the criminal who tried to kill the hero on that night br br the two actresses <UNK> <UNK> and the late <UNK> <UNK> were sisters br br turn off all the lights before watching highly suspenseful
<START> i don't know if the problem i had with this movie is that i was not able to capture the way movies were done in the past but i believe that this one did not miss to make use of any of the the <UNK> conventions available in the 40s to make a film if you don't have anything better to do my advise is not to watch this movie but to read a book or to go out for a walk
<START> outstanding film of 1943 with paul lukas giving an oscar <UNK> performance as the head of his family bringing them back to america from europe as the nazi menace <UNK> br br the usual terrific bette davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of 1943 br br <UNK> <UNK> around them lukas successfully deals with the situation he knows he must return to europe on a <UNK> mission and return he does br br davis again pulls out all the stops with a <UNK> hepburn like <UNK> of tears when they must part <UNK> she knows that her older son must follow him on his path to liberty br br a wonderful film <UNK> american positive propaganda against a wicked <UNK>
<START> i really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been <UNK> br br to it to say the least but it was terrible really terrible badly br br acted a witless script <UNK> handed direction watching this film was br br like watching a car crash you want to look away but you keep staring br br because you want to see how messy it's going to get well the car is br br <UNK> and there are no survivors on the plus side the cinematography br br was nice made me want to go on holiday if only to <UNK> myself from br br this <UNK>
<START> yes some plots are a bit hard to follow and the bill does have a tendency to get violent but it is actually an engrossing show that i try not to miss a vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense and the acting is fairly good though i do miss <UNK> taylor as inspector gina gold and todd <UNK> as gabriel kent i will admit i prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the <UNK> as i found it easier to watch when it was at 8 00 still why i like the bill is because not only it is engrossing but the <UNK> at the end do make the next episode <UNK> it is true though that it is more melodramatic than it was but i really like this programme as a programme that doesn't try to take itself too seriously 8 10 <UNK> cox
<START> outside of the fact that george lopez is a pretentious jerk his show is terrible br br nothing about lopez has ever been funny i have watched his stand up and have never <UNK> any resemblance to a laugh br br his stuff comes across as <UNK> and his <UNK> towards white people <UNK> out of every single <UNK> of his body br br i have laughed at white people jokes from many a comedian and love many of them br br this guy has a grudge that won't end br br i feel bad for <UNK> who have only this show to represent themselves br br the shows plots are always cookie cutter with an hispanic accent br br <UNK> laugh at the dumbest comments and scenes br br might be why this show is always on at <UNK> in replay
<START> this movie is about this <UNK> guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high tech company named <UNK> this <UNK> guy morgan jeremy northam is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and his demanding wife so he decides to become a spy he is suppose to go to conventions from other high tech companies and find out all the <UNK> plans instead morgan finds himself attracted to a beautiful woman played by lucy liu and pretty much being double crossed by these two companies that force him to become a double agent how will morgan get himself out of this can he trust the beautiful but mysterious rita foster played by lucy liu and more importantly can morgan make it out alive wow what a nifty movie i was completely sucked in after 15 minutes of watching this movie it is very suspenseful and you can feel <UNK> fear and confusion as he is doing his best to stay alive the scene where they put this horrible <UNK> on <UNK> head to <UNK> him is brilliantly creepy and frightening morgan slowly goes through a personality transformation that is not so readily apparent until you think about it after the film is finished from a <UNK> guy with bad hair and glasses he turns into a man <UNK> fighting for his life br br the ending wow the ending is incredible the twist is so much fun it left me <UNK> and cheering like crazy good performances from all around especially from jeremy <UNK> lucy liu and <UNK> bennett br br i highly recommend this film
<START> what an absolute pile of pants having read chris <UNK> books <UNK> since i came across quite ugly i was delighted to find out that this drama had been <UNK> br br i obviously had too much faith br br <UNK> is probably the best thing in this show and even he doesn't quite fit how anyone can read the book and then adapt it to this piece of <UNK> is beyond me br br entire characters are changed situations are dropped and to see <UNK> dramatic break in reduced to <UNK> doing a quick <UNK> up and <UNK> open a bay window it brought tears to my eyes br br i dread to think what's going to happen with country of the blind if this is the <UNK> br br please just avoid it
<START> 24 is the best television show it's an incredible tv series with an incredible suspense excellent plots and unforgettable characters and the first episode of all is my best evidence because it's only the first episode only the introduction and you are hooked because of the plot and the continuous twists and turns br br jack bauer is a federal agent who is assigned the protection of the senator david <UNK> he can't trust in anybody because people of the <UNK> may be involved and when this events occurred his daughter <UNK> escapes from house to a party but br br at the end of the episode you want to watch more and more and more br br it's only the first of the lot and it's excellent
<START> only minor spoilers except as noted br br i've enjoyed a lot of spanish cinema recently both the actual spanish cinema of people like <UNK> and the latin american cinema of directors like del toro whose superb devil's <UNK> set in civil war spain was the finest horror film of the last decade it's no surprise then that this film is both well made well acted and manages to sustain that <UNK> different spanish atmosphere but it's also as nasty and pointless a film as one could hope not to have to see br br what actually is the purpose of all this we have no real idea what caused the creepy central character to <UNK> on his killing spree despite the fact that large amounts of narrative voice over are drawn directly from his own <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> unpleasant opening sequence set more than a decade earlier we see the central character killing his girlfriend in a rage of jealousy and control <UNK> <UNK> i can't have you nobody <UNK> oddly enough that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree which appears completely different in both motivation and execution what happened to him in jail to cause this change we have no idea though we do later discover as an absurd sort of <UNK> that he <UNK> a law degree while imprisoned br br in britain in several of our notorious serial killer or sex killer cases the terrible question <UNK> what about the wife did she know or suspect what was going on this is a question that this film could have asked and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters but <UNK> the answer to the question is quite clearly no she didn't even when a dramatic opportunity like this is presented on a plate the film still manages to <UNK> it all we actually get <UNK> <UNK> out at the end is her slightly amoral <UNK> to cash in on the proceeds after the event compare this to the awful <UNK> moment in ten <UNK> place where <UNK> wife says you know what i <UNK> thereby <UNK> her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> knowledge and horror br br major spoiler in this paragraph in the meantime we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who <UNK> <UNK> the police thereby <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again how exactly did he achieve this the plot gets extremely <UNK> at this point something to do with deliberately leaving certain clues for the police but how this all works or why or how the subsequent court case actually proceeds remains a mystery br br i actually don't believe serial killers are like this the silence of the <UNK> may be comic book stuff but  <UNK> aside  it gets its serial killers right they are deeply disturbed deeply dysfunctional deeply <UNK> people not the <UNK> charming mastermind presented here closely related to the equally implausible suave killer of the last horror movie or indeed even man bites dog though it appears not to have been noticed that that was a satire br br this film has little suspense and <UNK> what little intrigue the plot might have generated it has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers either generally or in the specific cultural <UNK> of spain this is nothing more than a poorly plotted excuse to show some pretty misogynistic violence to women and oddly what makes that violence even more repulsive is a certain <UNK> failure of nerve even in how it is presented the soft core character of what is actually shown just makes it seem even more <UNK> <UNK> just one explicit shot properly timed would have been infinitely more shocking and would have rendered all the rest completely unnecessary <UNK> up more film time to flesh out the <UNK> holes in plot and characterisation instead we just get endless shots of young women <UNK> <UNK> on a table in their pretty but slightly revealing underwear very very creepy i'm sorry to be rude i love horror films and can tolerate even the most extreme to the extent even of worrying my partner but i think anyone who finds this film good or interesting even i'd find myself <UNK> away from the purpose of a horror film is to scare you this is just <UNK> br br it leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed i have to give this film more than one star just because it's competently executed but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been made
<START> four eyed monsters follows the relationship of a shy <UNK> <UNK> and an equally estranged struggling artist who both living in the big apple develop an unlikely romance with the help of an internet dating site this in itself is not so unusual but what is is their method of communication <UNK> the verbal they take to writing notes and later <UNK> through video br br the film is based upon the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> susan <UNK> own relationship who besides writing and directing take to acting as the lead characters as well with elements of avant garde anti plot and <UNK> the film <UNK> itself to the wind with an <UNK> structure <UNK> neatly between <UNK> and self <UNK> br br as the movie wears on a brief <UNK> and <UNK> of their once intriguing form of communication grow old as the couple face the <UNK> of reality focusing solely on inner conflict or the <UNK> of relationship the film struggles through a <UNK> narrative that is neither original nor poignant this could have been easily <UNK> with the addition of subplot and <UNK> conflict and a third act to which there is none just a montage of melodrama that leads nowhere br br what is even more <UNK> is the film's descent from story into reality that abruptly concludes with an open ended and unsatisfying finish this would have been all fine and dandy but there is no question asked and no meaning to be discovered or <UNK> br br on a side note the film contains beautiful animation and a vivid and moving soundtrack one of the more interesting aspects of the production br br but as always watch the film and decide for yourself
<START> from the <UNK> ranks of the already over <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sub genre comes this <UNK> tale of a <UNK> family <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> sound familiar well it most definitely should to anyone with even a <UNK> knowledge of the horror genre there is absolutely new here the film seems content to <UNK> all <UNK> old worn out clichés <UNK> <UNK> a peaceful family turned gun <UNK> killers when push comes to show the rebellious daughter the one <UNK> who's good at heart <UNK> but does even that half <UNK> enough to make this an utter waste of time this is forgettable dreck but <UNK> enough lead j d hart once starred in a movie called films that suck earlier in his career quite an ironic omen indeed br br my grade d
<START> this movie was hysterical i haven't laughed this hard in a long time i mean it's not good will hunting but was it supposed to be i actually went into the advanced screening expecting a lot less and was pleasantly surprised the comedy hits hard and is fairly constant amanda <UNK> is hot and awesome the entire audience that i screened it with seemed to be enjoying the film as much as i did
<START> the animation was <UNK> and the film funny the two circus bugs <UNK> roll were very funny if you waited till the credits at the end you saw a very funny sequence of film where they showed the bugs pretending to do things wrong like in other movies that was clever as it made the characters more human and <UNK>
<START> we bought the dvd set of <UNK> war <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> german once upon a time life english for our <UNK> kids because everyone loved the <UNK> war <UNK> der <UNK> german once upon a time man english series us parents had seen it as kids and it has <UNK> even high expectations the series is very well made does not show its age and our kids at various ages really like to watch it at the same time they learn things us parents didn't know until way way later the series covers everything to do with the human body from organs all senses blood <UNK> <UNK> and much more in animated 20 25 min episodes topics some people may find sensible such as <UNK> and <UNK> are covered in a <UNK> <UNK> and child friendly manner the <UNK> episode starts coverage mainly where the baby starts growing while still as typical informative and fun br br children are usually fascinated with how their bodies work and through the episodes gain an understanding of this in the context of their environment the format of the episodes switches between the outside world a family with 2 children and the inside of the body for example in the episode covering <UNK> the boy cuts himself accidentally and the wound gets infected and the episode covers how the body <UNK> to this similarly the episodes on the senses e g hearing seeing link what happens inside the body to the context of the outside world and the episode on <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> in the blood covers the complete <UNK> including briefly where the <UNK> comes from plants br br this is one of the best ever children's programs i would say it's a must see for every family with kids
<START> just watched this movie on dvd and thought the acting was very good but the over all story left a lot to be desired this movie has the same <UNK> and look of panic in <UNK> park or <UNK> cowboy hard to believe that human beings can live this type of lifestyle on the <UNK> of society in which their total existence is based on hardcore drug use crime violence sex and a total lack of self respect for anyone or anything including themselves br br val <UNK> is outstanding in his role of burnt out former porn star john holmes the supporting cast is just as good however this is a bleak dark disturbing and depressing film the murder was brutal but the daily lives of these people were brutal as well unless you have an interest in these murders or were a fan of john holmes this really isn't a film to see if you want to see a <UNK> drama on murder truman <UNK> 1960s in cold blood starring scott wilson and robert blake is much better
<START> i've discovered that this film gets rented based off of the <UNK> the zombie on the front of the dvd looks cool and scary then you get to the movie and it's women with <UNK> masks on zero special effects and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by 2 feet the funny thing is that <UNK> acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie the only thing i can think is that <UNK> is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a cult classic however i can't possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made the real horror in this film is how bad it is i'm embarrassed i rented it and <UNK> never to see another <UNK> film again
<START> just watched it me and my better half could not believe how awful and badly acted it was if anyone else thinks its good then you must be easily pleased i actually gave up a night out to watch this its all been done before ie hostel springs to mind but at least that did not make you cringe with the bad acting and lack of story line same old stuff re <UNK> i read so much about this film i even recommended it to my mates my fault someone said it was good no more gory horror or <UNK> back in disgust than your average scary movie it has to be said please don't bother with this movie get mary <UNK> now thats scary i'm off out now go to the cinema and watch something scarier than this little miss sunshine maybe
<START> when plague breaks out in new orleans it's richard widmark to the rescue in panic in the streets one of the lesser celebrated films of the great <UNK> kazan kazan keeps the pace <UNK> and there are lots of marvelous touches the scenes between widmark and barbara <UNK> <UNK> who plays his wife and the scene in the police station show family life and work life and the relationships of average citizens which is in sharp contrast to the lives and relationships of the low <UNK> portrayed by a menacing jack palance his weak yes man zero mostel tommy cook and louis charles there are also some interesting visuals palance has a couple of scenes with actors who seem to come up to his knees in height br br the acting is marvelous and the dialogue sharp if the story isn't quite up to the direction and performances it has a few questionable aspects which will be spotted by the viewer quite easily that aside it's well worth viewing kazan was a masterful director
<START> this movie was a complete waste of time br br i viewed this movie with a group of cinematic <UNK> who have varied taste in movies yet always a keen eye for a work of genius as one of my fellow <UNK> on this site had the <UNK> to label this steaming <UNK> not one of them found a single redeeming quality we ended the movie with a rousing chorus of <UNK> i will not <UNK> here br br i can only guess that the positive reviews provided here were written by sir anthony hopkins himself <UNK> as one of those reviewers will tell you he <UNK> the film himself  because no one else in hollywood or anywhere else in the world for that matter would risk a single penny or their good name in association with this film don't let the semi famous actors who appear in the film lure you into its <UNK>  as christian slater admits in the special features making of he signed on to the film without reading the script or knowing any details a <UNK> i am sure he will never repeat br br i pity the hapless individual who stumbles into this <UNK> of self <UNK> written directed produced and <UNK> by a man who is too famous to admit to himself that not everything he creates is a masterpiece and if you don't believe me please <UNK> anthony hopkins and art
<START> why on earth is colin <UNK> in this pointless film has he really been that <UNK> for cash br br the film isn't clear on what it wants to be about grief exotic places ghosts a vehicle for mr <UNK> it's a muddled <UNK> mess br br there seems to be some sort of idea that italy must be good in itself and that italian has something to offer as a language but in the end the girls just want to go back to <UNK> br br there are pointless episodes on the beach in <UNK> on busy roads but what it is all about or why anybody should care simply isn't clear br br there was also a <UNK> woman in the film it wasn't clear what here job was but she seemed only to be there to make vapid inappropriate and <UNK> comments to the girl was it supposed to be about <UNK> br br a pretty dreadful mess all in all i gave it 2 rather than 1 because it doesn't have the charm of an utterly ghastly film
<START> as a history nut who is particularly interested in this particular historical event i was very disappointed with the movie granted the costumes and staging was quite authentic but the hollywood portrayal of this british little big horn was truly boring br br the amount of film footage dedicated to <UNK> or <UNK> troops has to have been <UNK> in film history <UNK> i heard <UNK> background music begin i knew i had to prepare myself for another <UNK> scene of meaningless filler obviously the producers had invested heavily into staging and were determined to get their <UNK> worth br br despite the outstanding cast their dialogue was again boring and their characters were never developed whenever peter o'toole or burt <UNK> finished a scene i would cringe with disappointment their given lines were so weak and meaningless that i could hardly believe these were the same two great actors who portrayed lawrence of <UNK> and the bird man of <UNK> respectively br br there are worse epics but this one is not much better
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a very promising entertainment package gene kelly and <UNK> minnelli the team behind an american in paris are reunited with a lot of the great <UNK> and women behind their previous <UNK> <UNK> leading lady is <UNK> <UNK> one of the best dancers of 40s 50s cinema and unlike the generally superior it's always fair weather this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances <UNK> and <UNK> were the rising team behind such future hits as my fair lady and <UNK> musical masterpiece <UNK> <UNK> and minnelli had already demonstrated their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the excellent american in paris br br what happened along the way why is the movie itself such a stupid bore minnelli himself didn't want to do the movie despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with <UNK> maybe it was because the movie's <UNK> <UNK> was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step <UNK> for <UNK> minnelli but once trapped in this assignment like the <UNK> of <UNK> are trapped within its city limits minnelli <UNK> to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting if not <UNK> way the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold br br while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like cabin in the sky and meet me in st louis the <UNK> <UNK> wearing inhabitants of <UNK> can <UNK> up none of the <UNK> nostalgia of those never have been locales its <UNK> doesn't even match up to the glossy <UNK> of <UNK> and the thief or the pirate because the <UNK> settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions the only people in <UNK> who i at least can relate to are the <UNK> man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow <UNK> played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him the general proceedings in the <UNK> of <UNK> itself are too <UNK> and <UNK> even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively <UNK> in their aspect for example in exchange for <UNK> <UNK> the honorable and most generally good <UNK> of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed <UNK> br br at one point we're assured that everybody's looking for their own <UNK> suffice it to say the box office for this picture <UNK> my own suspicion that most of us aren't looking for this kind of quasi <UNK> paradise the premise itself is ridiculous and almost <UNK> <UNK> but could work if the players were perfect but kelly himself is the most <UNK> thing about the movie and <UNK> is horribly miscast as a <UNK> <UNK> in much the same way as lucille <UNK> was miscast in <UNK> and the thief van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar <UNK> sidekick to kelly even lighting 3 <UNK> at one point like <UNK> in <UNK> and he provides a lot of amusing moments but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget <UNK> with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed off van johnson performance
<START> i love paul <UNK> he is in my <UNK> the greatest of all time i could not however afford a ticket to his concert at the <UNK> <UNK> during the back in the u s tour i was upset to say the least then i found this dvd it was almost as good as being there paul is still the man and i will enjoy this for years to come br br i do have one complaint i would of like to hear all of hey jude br br also paul is not dead br br the single greatest concert dvd ever br br out of
<START> i enjoyed watching this well acted movie very much it was well acted particularly by actress helen hunt and actors steven <UNK> and jeff <UNK> it was a very interesting movie filled with drama and suspense from the beginning to the very end i <UNK> that everyone take the time to watch this made for television movie it is excellent and has great acting
<START> two sailors are on leave ladies man joseph brady gene kelly and shy innocent clarence <UNK> frank sinatra they meet beautiful susan <UNK> kathryn grayson and both fall in love with her there's more but you've probably guessed it br br the story even for a 1940s musical is ridiculous and everything is so nice and wholesome gets annoying pretty quick also this movie is far too long it's <UNK> minutes and that's way too much for such a silly story there are also some boring numbers by jose iturbi and his orchestra still this is worth catching br br when kelly is dancing or sinatra or grayson are singing this becomes magical none of the songs are particularly memorable but sinatra had such a beautiful voice you won't care it's shot in rich technicolor with all the <UNK> mgm had the acting is ok kelly is fine although seeing him as a ladies man is pushing it and sinatra is just great although seeing him as a shy guy was pushing it too grayson is given nothing to do but she's incredibly beautiful to look at some shots of her literally took my breath away there are plenty of highlights here sinatra and kelly's big dancing and singing number sinatra singing anything <UNK> two songs and the <UNK> famous animated sequence in which kelly dances with jerry an animated mouse tom does a funny cameo too also there's little dean <UNK> who steals every scene he's in br br so it's too long and the plot just doesn't hold up but it's still worth catching this was a huge hit in its day
<START> this film never received the attention it deserved although this is one of the finest pieces of ensemble acting and one of the most realistic stories i have seen on screen clearly filmed on a small budget in a real v a hospital the center of the story is joel very well played by eric <UNK> joel has been <UNK> in a motorcycle accident and comes to the hospital to a ward with other men who have spinal <UNK> joel is in love with anna his married lover played by helen hunt who shows early signs of her later academy award winning work br br although the joel anna relationship is the basic focus there are many other well developed characters in the ward wesley snipes does a tremendous job as the angry raymond even more impressive is william forsythe as the bitter and racist <UNK> i think <UNK> two best scenes are when he becomes frustrated and angry at the square dancers and later when he feels empathy for a young korean man who has been shot in a <UNK> store hold up my favorite scene with snipes is the in the <UNK> discussion of post injury sexual <UNK> br br the chemistry between <UNK> and hunt is very strong and they have two very intimate but not gratuitous sex scenes the <UNK> in the ward is both sexy and amusing there is also another memorable scene where joel and <UNK> and the korean boy take the specially <UNK> van to the strip bar it's truly a comedy of errors as they make their feeble attempts to get the van going to see the naked ladies br br the story is made even more poignant by the fact that the director <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> in real life this is basically his story this film is real not glossy or flashy to have the amount of talent in a film of such a small budget is amazing i recommend this film to everyone i see because it is one of those films that even <UNK> on a second look it's a shame that such a great piece of work gets overlooked but through video perhaps it can get the attention it so richly deserves
<START> i rented this dvd having seen it while looking for something else when i saw the title on the jacket i couldn't believe my eyes i read <UNK> book about a year ago and loved it in fact admire <UNK> work in general i am a <UNK> psychologist i have watched perhaps 30 minutes of this movie and have had to turn it off i'm not sure if i can take much more at a superficial level the faux accents as others have commented are simply distracting at best and irritating and vapid at worst the acting is dull when it should be passionate and comical when it should be serious the portrayal of lou <UNK> is simply <UNK> and the brilliant <UNK> comes off as little more than a <UNK> i see very little of the <UNK> spirit conveyed thus far i had hoped to be able to recommend this film to my students instead i will refer them to the book imagine that
<START> i've probably been <UNK> by having firstly seen the 1973 version with michael <UNK> and <UNK> cusack so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment i just didn't get any chemistry between the 2 main stars a lot of staring and theatrical acting just doesn't do it for me and what was all that about putting tim in the role of rochester had the casting director actually ever read the book very strange he's a fine actor but mr rochester he definitely isn't and zelah was just well strange bit of a mix matched couple in it's favour the supporting cast were pretty good and the <UNK> scenes for me were the best of the adaptation but overall didn't capture any of the magic of the novel certainly wouldn't ask anyone to watch it as a true adaptation of the novel a real let down
<START> i sort of accidentally ended up watching this movie i'm still not sure if i regret it or not i felt like i was watching the film made by that group of film school students that didn't quite make the cut it plays up every hollywood cliché imaginable all the while <UNK> us with the <UNK> are the ultimate <UNK> message subtlety this movie does not know as far as that goes it even manages to provide it's own spoilers br br the story appears to be a computer <UNK> fantasy world come true the lead character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend yet is a programming genius and apparent <UNK> i think among many other nerd fantasy come true elements that you'll have to see for yourself br br as well i should've known it would be a z movie when i saw ned <UNK> he tends to be a good tip off br br can't recommend this one i'm afraid
<START> this movie is bizarre better put it's <UNK> weird i could give you a plot summary or some <UNK> <UNK> analysis but i would consider it a waste of your time all anybody needs to know about this movie is two young sisters one incestuous relationship homicide post <UNK> <UNK> and one really disturbing <UNK> at the end of the movie you feel like you need to go take a shower to wash the filth off yourself but not in a good way like after pulp fiction or fight club it's like you're a teenager or high <UNK> being that i am myself still a teenager and have just done something you a wish you hadn't done and b hope to the good lord of heaven and earth that your parents never find out about and nobody likes that my advise is that rather than <UNK> your mind and by watching piece of <UNK> cinematic filth just go waste your time on something a little less horrible and watch <UNK> yes i would rather watch <UNK> than murderous <UNK> read into it what you want
<START> like other people who commented on <UNK> <UNK> i stumbled by chance upon this little gem on late night tv without having heard of it before the strange mixture of a pulp fiction story about a sexy but <UNK> anti heroine on the one hand and a realistic and well <UNK> portrayal of war in the <UNK> on the other hand had me hooked from the beginning br br to me this is one of the five best movies about wwi the others are all quiet on the western front paths of glory <UNK> and the post war la <UNK> et <UNK> <UNK> and the scene with the poison gas attack is really chilling the horses and men appear like riders of the apocalypse with their gas masks br br i only wish i had taped the film
<START> the man who directed 'the third man' also directed the <UNK> will <UNK> sequence in oliver now that is talent br br i raise my hat to carol reed br br i know there are <UNK> <UNK> involved but still br br and he had to deal with orson welles and oliver reed br br i suppose quality will out br br it does show in the final scene with nancy avoiding spoiler everyone has to see oliver for the first time sometime how many lines do i need to type br br <UNK> people to type too much is not to be encouraged br br i hope this counts as the <UNK> line
<START> ll cool j morgan freeman dylan mcdermott kevin spacey john heard cary <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> justin timberlake wait a minute justin timberlake and he's the star i should have known better than to rent edison force in fact i did know better but in a moment of absolute weakness i rented this <UNK> when you have big names like freeman and spacey in an <UNK> you know it's one of two things an indie or a dog as in sat on a shelf which this did and with good reason the plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la <UNK> force and journalist timberlake is the only one brave enough to <UNK> them he is targeted for his efforts or maybe i should say for his horrible acting i turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the <UNK> and still had the <UNK> to turn to his <UNK> and smile before <UNK> just awful the real <UNK> to how bad this flick is to see freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an <UNK> beard looking like nothing so much as a <UNK> you just know the director was not in control freeman is clearly <UNK>
<START> let me be really clear about this movie i didn't watch this movie because of the plot i watch it for the <UNK> sex scenes that being said this movie is so god damn awful i flip between pure joy of seeing a <UNK> body of <UNK> mandy <UNK> and cringing my <UNK> out for the disaster of a plot br br spoiler alert the first scene of the movie already had me cringing you see a woman painting something by the <UNK> in pure bliss and <UNK> then a beautiful girl approach and ask if she could paint beside her when they both finished they show each other what they had done and the woman painted a <UNK> when she is facing <UNK> of the lake what kind of screwball director would make this kind of mistake and in another scene <UNK> gets to kill her <UNK> lover by smash him with the <UNK> pole and then she <UNK> away and none of the town's police suspected her once i mean <UNK> mandy did not wear a <UNK> did she her finger <UNK> are all over the god damn boat after that it gets worst whenever mandy is around there is the chilling sound effect played which sounds like a cat in <UNK> fit it's also a real pity <UNK> <UNK> is in this movie i feel real sorry for her to have to star in this super low budget soft porn no <UNK> same goes for <UNK> <UNK> who also has the misfortune to star in this movie all in all 2 10
<START> if <UNK> hadn't done anything like this before <UNK> would be a <UNK> now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director and a great cinematic <UNK> of spanish culture but he has done a lot like this before and though we can applaud the <UNK> he has given us we have to pick and choose favorites and high points among similar films which include blood wedding 1981 carmen 1983 el <UNK> <UNK> 1986 <UNK> 1992 <UNK> 2002 and tango 1998 i would choose <UNK> 1995 flamenco as his most unique and potent cultural document next to which <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> is conceived as a series of interpretations of the music of <UNK> <UNK> francisco <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and in particular his <UNK> <UNK> for piano <UNK> <UNK> was a great <UNK> to the <UNK> of spanish musical culture its re <UNK> for a non spanish audience he moved to france in his early thirties and was influenced by french <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> is an imaginative <UNK> of spanish folk music with the styles of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> he traveled around performing his compositions which are a kind of beautiful <UNK> of spanish <UNK> and <UNK> not as <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> but moving in that direction naturally the spanish have <UNK> <UNK> and in <UNK> the performers <UNK> his compositions in terms of various more ethnic and <UNK> dances and styles but the source is a <UNK> and <UNK> form of spanish musical and dance culture compared to the <UNK> <UNK> of pure flamenco flamenco coming out of the region of <UNK> is a deeply felt <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and jewish cultures <UNK> simply is the <UNK> <UNK> spain <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the very concept is more <UNK> br br <UNK> flamenco is an <UNK> intense ethnic mix of music singing dancing and that <UNK> manner of noble <UNK> that is the essence of spanish style the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride <UNK> on arrogance and <UNK> and <UNK> even <UNK> and the moves of the <UNK> are full of it in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion they just are <UNK> always <UNK> the <UNK> of his <UNK> with choreographer antonio <UNK> and other artists in his 1995 flamenco he dropped any <UNK> of a story and simply has singers musicians and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens <UNK> and mirrors arranged by cinematographer <UNK> <UNK> another of the spanish <UNK> important <UNK> the <UNK> and endings of sequences in flamenco are often rough but atmospheric marked only by the <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> feet and a mixture of voices sometimes the film keeps feeding when a performance is over and you see the dancer bend over sigh or laugh or somebody just unexpectedly says something in flamenco more than any of <UNK> other musical films it's the <UNK> intense interaction of singers and dancers and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shouting <UNK> <UNK> that is the story and creates the magic because <UNK> has truly made magic and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional story br br <UNK> is in a similar style to some of <UNK> <UNK> musical films no narration no dialogue only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region beginning with a <UNK> playing <UNK> music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing in flamenco music the fundamental element is the <UNK> voice and that voice is the most <UNK> and unique contribution to world music it relates to other songs in other <UNK> but nothing quite equals its raw <UNK> unique ugly beautiful cry that defies you to do anything but listen to it with the closest attention then comes the <UNK> and the foot <UNK> and then the dancing combined with the other elements there is only one flamenco song in <UNK> if you love <UNK> flamenco you'll want to see <UNK> but you'll be a bit disappointed the style is there some of the great voices and dancing and music are there but <UNK> source and conception doom it to a lesser degree of power and make it a less rich and intense cultural experience
<START> this has to be the worst movie ever the acting is scarier than the movie lots of blood but no idea where it comes from <UNK> they don't even show you the cuts i can't believe i wasted my time watching this movie we laughed like we were watching a comedy and not a horror movie this is a disgrace to horror films for one if they are in asia why is there a white cop driving past waste management trash <UNK> there's so much of another language that you don't even know what's going on half the time the film editing is a joke my teenager could do better and if i went to a movie theater and that nasty old man was working the window that would be the first clue do not watch this movie not to even see how bad it is you will be sorry you did
<START> i purchased this film on the cheap in a sale having read the back of the dvd case and assuming that either way i can't lose it if was rubbish then no loss if it was any good then bargain br br then i watched it br br i am normally a fan of christopher walken but in this film he <UNK> very little screen presence seeming not to do a whole lot even the death of his friend near the beginning which sparks off the action in the plot seems to affect him very little and his eventual revenge is just boring and <UNK> br br normally a film which has themes as grand as revolution and revenge are able to capture the audience and <UNK> them into feeling something for the characters however watching this film felt more like seeing a series of confused and almost random events that loosely tied together towards it's eventual conclusion br br at this point i <UNK> br br i thought this film was the most horribly painful piece of viewing i have ever been subjected to the scene where the pilot sacrifices himself by <UNK> to jump out the explosive laden truck due to not wanting to kill any civilians is not so much <UNK> sad as it is <UNK> horrible and painful although not quite as bad as the <UNK> surgery on the wounded girl the acting was poor all round the script and story was weak the action was even weaker and the visuals were but <UNK> not all that visual to <UNK> there are films which are good films that are bad films that are so bad they are good films that are terrible br br and then on a whole new level is <UNK>
<START> to me this review may contain spoilers but i like watching movies with no idea of what is going to happen so therefore i think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilers br br i just watched this movie again and i must <UNK> that it has the best ending to any movie ever ever ever the real translation 'the beating of the <UNK> <UNK> is oddly not used as the translated title i suppose they thought most americans wouldn't know what chaos theory is except for those who saw or read jurassic park the movie is based on chaos theory and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events which all lead back to one event the movie is a <UNK> of wondrous cause and effect as we follow the chain of chaos as it <UNK> between several characters about 20 in a way the ending seems inevitable despite this but if you think about it it is a perfect ending think to yourself what else needed to be said it is at the same time a very brave ending too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one but an ending like this would never come out of hollywood br br
<START> when i saw this movie first it was long ago on vhs video i did like this movie because it was funny and <UNK> some years ago i saw another movie called andy <UNK> incredible adventure in this movie were parts of <UNK> of the lost kingdom used in they called this movie <UNK> the <UNK> i began to search for the <UNK> movie many years because i wanted to see the complete movie not only the parts which were used in the andy <UNK> movie no shop had this <UNK> movie to rent and no shop did know this movie many years i watched my old vhs tapes i had at home and what a wonder i had this movie since many years still at home but the movie had a different title because in germany it has 3 or 4 titles so i was happy to find this tape at home and this time i had much more time in watching <UNK> the <UNK> again the music is great during the hole movie but the best part of filming in combination with the music is this moment when <UNK> is walking drunken through the green forrest the music in the background had some kind of magic i like bo <UNK> and also the boy who played simon in the movie both of them did their job very good <UNK> <UNK> germany 26 10 2004 thanks to all for reading my comment
<START> i had heard this movie was good from a lot of my friends that saw it and they all said it was amazing so i had very high expectations and nancy drew <UNK> those high expectations it had funny parts it kept me entertained with the action and all the <UNK> trying to kill her and emma roberts was amazing as nancy drew the rest of the cast was very good also i would definitely recommend this movie br br nancy i wonder why those guys were trying to kill us corky yeah i was wondering that too actually it's kinda <UNK> me out br br nancy i hate when people try to kill me it's so rude br br nancy drew
<START> sarah silverman is a dangerous bitch she's beautiful sexy funny and talent dark and demonic i read the other <UNK> on this show as well as the message board stuff and people just don't get it nothing that appears on t v is an accident too much money time and work is put into the production of a t v show for there to be mistakes this show is stupid because sarah wanted it to be stupid this show is juvenile because sarah wanted it to be juvenile i thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre it's a lot like pee <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> twenty something <UNK> <UNK> future <UNK> of america from the valley the cast is awesome the scenarios and action is well paced i hope this show succeeds since comedy central didn't let david spade keep his show who plays <UNK> sister she not in the cast listing on the show's home page i would love to see her stand up does anyone know about her up coming show dates or dvds that may be floating around out there
<START> when you start watching this animation masterpiece you quickly notice that it's a european production although the europeans have sadly integrated some of the clichés you would normally find in an american production of this kind most are missing one of these is that there is an overwhelming evil that only our very few and very unlikely heroes can <UNK> another is that one of the group is only in the business for the money is greedy runs away when the heat is up but somehow gives in to his better nature this movie would have been better off without both br br the movie is based upon a tv series that was out four years before the movie unlike the movie the tv series is a cartoon and not a computer animation at first i thought the computer would kill the charm and character of the plot but i was <UNK> convinced whoever did the animation knew his or her stuff although the characters are obviously fictional in stills they don't even look real they seem as alive and <UNK> as the audience following their quest making characters who by normal standards could be considered <UNK> those <UNK> legs could never carry that giant body let alone make it jump so alive and lovable is more than just a highlight the creation of the world is another masterpiece not so much because of its looks but because of the <UNK> of it the world our heroes travel is not solid like our own but is made of many pieces of land varying in shape and size that seem to be floating in mid air when a person steps on a smaller <UNK> of ground it <UNK> a little bit as if <UNK> from the weight in some cases up and down no longer apply but our heroes still manage to get a <UNK> somewhere although the world of floating islands is completely surreal in this movie it is absolutely believable and after a short time it doesn't seem any <UNK> than running into a car somewhere in new york br br i wrote that the looks of the world aren't as breathtaking as the idea as true as that might be to my mind the quality of the world the characters and the attention to details is <UNK> although the faces of the characters have relatively few attributes emotions can be read as clearly as in sean <UNK> or dustin <UNK> face the world around the characters is wonderfully colourful and no two settings are alike the background is always in motion something is always going on which makes the world seem even more alive if you stop the movie and look at the background you will be surprised how many details you can find br br the existence of hector actually puts the <UNK> on top hector is a <UNK> little thing possibly the equivalent of a dog in our world who is totally lovable and extremely funny although he isn't really important for the main plot he would be missed like <UNK> would be in ice age the really cool thing about hector is that you need to speak <UNK> to understand him br br if the movie is so great why didn't i give it 10 stars well the plot in itself was rather thin two hunters are sent out to rescue the world from a really bad dragon who wants to swallow the world isn't really original that in itself wouldn't be much of a problem what i missed was the background information what kind of a dragon was this and why did it look that way i love mythical stories but if they get too thin then they seem to be written after the movie is finished in a feeble attempt to give the whole thing some depth br br another thing i didn't like was <UNK> although a little girl like her could be considered adorable she was somewhat of a pain in this movie she seemed pretty <UNK> to all types of learning about reality kept dreaming of some hero from a story book and basically <UNK> the others down she would have been ok if she had developed a little more and a little earlier in the movie or had been less of a <UNK> to start with to me the idea of this girl who was there to twist the story a little <UNK> on the writers br br all in all this is a really good movie for just about all ages
<START> what this movie does well is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that <UNK> more emotion form the audience than a typical horror movie unfortunately with disjointed storytelling frustrating plot holes and <UNK> scenes this movie mainly caused me frustration and is hardly the greatest monster movie ever br br let's start with the good stuff comedy acting and special effects from the get go this movie starts off fast paced and <UNK> the opening scene the <UNK> origin is campy and quick paying homage the the classic <UNK> disasters that have given birth to so many other monsters the pacing is fast which was a welcome break from the long and often <UNK> dramatic opening scene from other monster flicks and allows the movie to jump right into the action with in the course of 10 minutes you get the <UNK> <UNK> ' and <UNK> of the beast and are ready for action in this the movie delivers br br after another short and well shot sequence the characters are introduced the lazy son and his <UNK> little girl kind grandfather and talented sister aunt and of course the monster the characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly apparent allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster shows up suddenly to <UNK> havoc in the river area where they live and work br br the monster it's self looks great alien yet familiar kinda like a dog and fish <UNK> out by a <UNK> the effects of the creature are second to none and although it looks strange it is believable and at no point in the movie could you <UNK> it's strings ' even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar like a growing and excited <UNK> on <UNK> the monster <UNK> through the crowd <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> and eating those in it's path when the <UNK> path <UNK> with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movie's appeal begins to unravel br br following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity plot lines are introduced then abandoned characters change their position for no apparent reason and comedy is <UNK> into dramatic scenes confusing intent while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random br br as for the comedy let me say this i'm willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural i am not familiar with korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation however as an asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in japan for the last 5 years still here i'd like to think i have a better grasp on asian humor than the average white guy that being said there were many parts of the movie that i understood were supposed to be funny but to me weren't br br spoiler for example after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral everyone is mourning a new character is introduced a brother and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another they both begin to <UNK> for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is <UNK> harder this competition is at it's core funny two brothers who dislike each other so much they even compete at a funeral it shows the <UNK> nature of <UNK> love common in asian comedy this subtle slap stick comedy <UNK> fun at family and <UNK> mourning is supposed to be funny but seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl end spoiler br br then come the plot holes there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained or worse are explained and <UNK> over only to be proved <UNK> and pointless in the end finding out an <UNK> isn't an <UNK> can be a good thing for a character but you'd expect some comment to that nature instead the audience is <UNK> by moments of anti climax when problems just <UNK> <UNK> anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start so i ask you why even bring it up in the first place br br this was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with <UNK> forces that never resolved each other of course introducing new and greater problems is a time tested story telling tradition but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced <UNK> of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation not in this movie instead it was as if you get several stories each only explained 20 of the way and in the end the parts never <UNK> to complete the whole br br again i'm willing to accept that a lot of this might be <UNK> ' maybe its in korean story telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy maybe it's normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on every page but never finishes one maybe it's ok to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or <UNK> or maybe these are all <UNK> of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves
<START> the acting is good the women are beautiful and the men are handsome so if you're looking for well acted soft porn this movie is for you otherwise you are wasting your time the motivation of the main characters in particular the eponymous lead is often a mystery she could have just told the truth the truth as presented in the film not necessarily the historical truth and her lover would have been <UNK> time in jail for a rape he did not commit was she protecting her father who went off half <UNK> as it were when he <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> was she protecting herself with her reputation suddenly of concern when <UNK> only her art seemed to matter during the trial this strong <UNK> woman turns to <UNK> before our eyes <UNK> her lover who starts off as a <UNK> jerk becomes a <UNK> hero during the trial at least his motivation is <UNK> he sacrifices himself for love naturally since no good deed must go <UNK> we are told that she never sees him again
<START> robert duvall is a direct <UNK> of <UNK> general robert e lee according the imdb com movie <UNK> after seeing this film you may think <UNK> appearance is reincarnation at it's best one of my most favorite films i wish the composer peter <UNK> <UNK> had a cd or there was a soundtrack available wonderful scenery and music and all too true to life especially for those of us that live in or have moved to the south this is a real moment in time life moves on slowly but strangers we do not remain
<START> there's a lot of good that can be said for this cartoon the backgrounds are rich <UNK> colored and full of nicely done art <UNK> details the animation is up to the usual studio standards of the time which are <UNK> higher than those of the present day however i find it tedious for a number of reasons br br the music it's definitely not up to scott <UNK> usual standards although it's probably supposed to be <UNK> of a great <UNK> setting it ends up being dreary sleepy <UNK> and monotonous <UNK> and monotonous are not the same as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> since most people including me tend to close their eyes when they yawn there's a lot of the visual part of the cartoon that will be missed by the average viewer br br the storyline i'm not giving away any secrets that aren't already in the plot summary country good city bad this is a common theme in films both animated and live from this era it's a misplaced nostalgia for a nonexistent rural <UNK> which in the present day is reflected in a similar nostalgia for values that never were
<START> i watched this over the christmas period i don't know why but it reminds me of christmas so i watched it so there we are br br arthur is a film i watch all the way through with a big dumb smile on my face and its a mixture of special performances great jolly music and a script <UNK> with wit and charm that causes it br br dudley moore makes a character that could well be hated very easily spoiled rich lazy drunk who feels sorry for himself but turns him into someone you love <UNK> <UNK> is great as linda <UNK> a queens waitress who manages to pull off the tough soft on the inside lady arthur nearly gives up his world for john gielgud gets all the <UNK> lines and <UNK> them off with <UNK> br br i can watch arthur again and again and it always makes me feel good check it out if you need a lift its a lovely film
<START> oh man this s u c k e d sucked i couldn't even get any camp value out of this and i sat through the whole thing on showtime don't bother waiting around for the <UNK> scenes either it's too late and only plastic jenna jameson is involved shows how much <UNK> cash must be laying around hollywood just to get your name on the closing credits i guess showtime had to throw something in at <UNK> next time i think i'd even rather be watching <UNK> loop around every 30 minutes
<START> one of the best tarzan films is also one of its most action packed and graphic br br picking up a year or so after tarzan the ape man <UNK> <UNK> holt has asked a rich friend to <UNK> a <UNK> back to the elephants graveyard to collect <UNK> his friend arrives also carrying dresses and <UNK> that holt hopes to use to win jane back from tarzan before they can leave holt finds his map stolen and it becomes a mad dash to try and capture a competing expedition when they finally over take the thieves they find the whole party dead and themselves surrounded they have no choice but to fight their way out and soon find they are out of the <UNK> pan and into the fire eventually tarzan and jane show up and everyone is off on even more adventures br br infamous film was heavily <UNK> to <UNK> the graphic violence its graphic even by todays standards it probably would get a pg 13 and to remove all hint of nudity there is a several minute long nude swim scene involving jane that is full frontal in its nudity it was only recently restored its clear watching the restored version why this film was reduced by 20 minutes in its run time for tv as it stands in its restored version this is a very adult film that is romantic touching action filled and everything else that a movie should be its an amazing film by almost any standard best of all its the sort of film that plays well both as a stand alone adventure one need not to have seen the first film to enjoy it but its also a film that <UNK> the characters and themes that were set up in that original film its an amazing thing br br i really like this film a great deal br br if there are any flaws to the film its perhaps that the film hasn't aged well the rear screen is often very obvious there are gorilla suits for many of the apes and some of the other effects are more quaint rather than convincing however on almost every other level this film is top notch br br you really owe it to yourself to see this make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and <UNK> up on the couch and just let yourself drift back to a simpler time this is one of the great adventures
<START> this movie was the worst movie i have seen since date movie i was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared it was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example the eye the tongue the butt the breast if we have seen national <UNK> channel we know snakes wont stay <UNK> on the body once they bite for each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person i believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior i cant believe i wasted my money on this movie so i don't recommend this movie trust just wait until it is at the dollar theatre or rent it
<START> the power rangers is definitely the worst television show and completely ridiculous plastic toy line in the history of the united states br br there is absolutely nothing even remotely entertaining about this completely awful television show br br this is simply the worst show ever made with awful actors dressing up in multi colored <UNK> outfits that look completely ridiculous br br the owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves since there is no redeeming value to this nonsense br br kids of today should try watching better shows like the toy story movies instead of this garbage
<START> <UNK> is what it is i saw this in the cinema at age 4 and i have very fond and vivid memories of it seeing this as as adult allows one to catch the references that are way over the heads of the target audience like the bit where <UNK> grey witch wig is ripped off and witch <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i knew she had brown roots it is of course heavily influenced by the flower power culture of the time and in some ways quite <UNK> the track different for example sends a clear message to the young viewers about being yourself not running with the pack and <UNK> what is is about yourself that is different this could be an <UNK> to the gay community it should be great track br br martha <UNK> <UNK> elliot and <UNK> hayes are all great as witches and the living island cast give it their all in the confines of their character suits includes billy <UNK> felix <UNK> and other famous names there is a lot of over acting in this film there's really nothing subtle and when little jack wild has to <UNK> his concern for the kidnapped residents of living island it's really little more than yelling this is drama and comedy spread on with a <UNK> while i think of it i never could stand the <UNK> though br br i love the soundtrack especially the above mentioned different but also <UNK> the world <UNK> and even jack <UNK> touching if i could what's more it is now out on cd from the <UNK> people at el records in london see here for more www <UNK> co uk el artists <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie was amusing at times hell sometimes it was even downright funny br br the underlying message i got from the film though was that women are responsible for all of the troubles of man every time a woman is depicted in the film she is being lazy being <UNK> or <UNK> some poor guy for no apparent reason i don't think the message involved is good for women or gay men br br but it is a comedy and a piece of art so it is simply <UNK> point of view even if i don't agree with it they are still entitled to it br br an amusing film but some of the comments others have made are just plain stupid best film ever my foot
<START> <UNK> police supposedly marked the debut of the <UNK> <UNK> named after the studio they worked for in this one however they don't dress in the silly cop costumes or drive the fast paced car that's their trademark anyway mabel <UNK> is a farm girl here who's <UNK> her dad for a <UNK> she later sees some strange men in the <UNK> and quickly calls the police one answers and the chase is on next mabel <UNK> her door just as someone is coming in turns out it's her mother who jumps to the conclusion robbers are in there so while mabel <UNK> her door with furniture the mother and father try to fight their way in this was perhaps the most amusing part of the short along with some explosions of the cop car this was a short 7 minutes that went by so fast it's over before it's begun the only real characterization that's developed is <UNK> who exudes charm with just her face and big eyes and seems so <UNK> <UNK> here except of course when she's frightened it's easy to see why she became a star it's largely because of her that i'd recommended seeing this at least once and why i'm giving this a 4
<START> this is definitely a stupid bad taste movie eddie murphy stars in what is written like a sitcom he is surrounded with his perfect family full of good family values if you're looking for politically correct entertainment this movie is for you but if you hate the idea of being the only one not to laugh at obscene gags in a movie theater full of pop corn <UNK> just flee
<START> very few so called remakes can be as good as the originals this one crosses that border with flying colors just a remake i don't think so i saw it <UNK> at the age of nine and was completely <UNK> and <UNK> by the film br br the film certainly invites comparisons to its 1963 counterpart the earlier film is also a enjoyable and entertaining movie but admittedly it tends to feel more like a nature documentary than a film this update is more epic and cinematic still i thoroughly recommend both films br br this film is certainly a must see for an animal lover we have the wise old golden <UNK> shadow the sharp sarcastic <UNK> cat sassy and the young fun loving american <UNK> chance the animals are brilliantly voiced by don <UNK> sally field and michael j fox respectively br br there is virtually nothing offensive in the film there is a bit of <UNK> humor but nothing extreme no hard violence save a few tense scenes involving a <UNK> <UNK> an angry <UNK> and a dark <UNK> <UNK> br br hilarious scary moving and above all real it surprised me to see that this film didn't win any awards not one nevertheless i will have to say this is just as good as some of the best picture <UNK> nowadays
<START> i turned this on to see the incredible <UNK> waters whose autobiography i am now reading i'll admit my jaw dropped when the <UNK> chops and <UNK> references started rolling in but people cannot look at this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece it's pretty much a short film made by blacks for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was quite <UNK> and the stereotypes to the people involved were the jokes of their time old <UNK> exaggerated for humor we see modern black movies do the same thing but with the new <UNK> stereotypes <UNK> and the hood and such i think if you look back in <UNK> years you would find today's movies will look just as racist what viewers should appreciate about this film is the talent of waters and the <UNK> sized sammy davis jr who out <UNK> his contemporary shirley temple and looks remarkably the same <UNK> as he did as an adult everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it why not enjoy it for what it is instead of what you think it should have been
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is an old man who lives alone in his remote rural <UNK> chasing his beloved cat one morning into the woods around his property <UNK> glimpses what looks like the murder of a young child in the middle of the woods he reports the crime to the police but there's no body to be found troubled by disturbing visions he <UNK> further and eventually is guided to a spooky <UNK> where events take a supernatural <UNK> soft for digging is a fantastic experimental horror with lots of creepy atmosphere to spare this <UNK> film is almost completely devoid of dialogue some scenes are genuinely nightmarish and the acting is excellent the location sets provide plenty of creepiness the eerie <UNK> woods rival those used in the blair witch <UNK> give this strange horror film a chance 9 out of 10
<START> all <UNK> go to heaven is an animated kid's movie like no other gambling drinking death guns and hell are all prominent in the plot and though kids will get very little of it adults will be scratching their heads as to why this movie was made to feel like some sort of gangster movie the actual movie isn't explicit in any way it's just an odd combination to make a kid's movie on br br charlie <UNK> burt reynolds is a player dog who owns half a casino with his partner carface <UNK> <UNK> after getting drunk a dog getting drunk in a kid's movie it just sounds weird charlie is tricked and murdered by <UNK> when in heaven he finds a way to come back to earth but he will no longer be allowed in heaven he still goes back to earth and meets up with his old friend itchy dom <UNK> and plans <UNK> on <UNK> meanwhile <UNK> has a little orphan girl anne marie held captive because of her amazing ability to talk to all species of animals which helps predict races charlie and itchy free her and try to help her find a family while learning a lot about themselves br br this movie is one of the few non disney that will appeal to both kids and adults kids will enjoy the funny characters and lively animation while adults will enjoy the nice sweet plot and the more than normal developed characters one thing that keeps this down is that it's a musical normally that's a good thing but the music here is honestly terrible they tend to jump around almost sounding ad <UNK> with next to no <UNK> backing in fact these are probably the worst songs i've ever heard in an animated movie but luckily the rest of the film is strong enough to not fall apart because of some bad notes br br the ending of this movie works but i honestly hate it it's sad but happy but more sad than happy and makes the movie feel like it needs a sequel considering how bad the sequel made to this was i wish the ending wouldn't have <UNK> a sequel and it would've wrapped up into a nice super happy ending this is one of the few movies i feel this way about but i do br br overall this is a nice family film with odd themes thrown in but nonetheless good entertainment br br my rating out of 85 mins g
<START> vivah is in my book the best movie of 2006 period in my book it is one of the best 100 movies ever made in bollywood its sad that this movie doesn't have that many reviews and isn't having that much popularity br br vivah is once again a true achievement from a director who does it again after <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has once again pulled off a brilliant one vivah br br this is the most simple and cute movies that i've seen this year after seeing don 2 which was crap and later <UNK> 2 which even beat don in that matter i finally see a movie which is so close to my heart and my culture br br i don't know why bollywood is moving away from the beautiful culture which we have and are making hollywood remake style crap movies like <UNK> 2 and don br br the story is beautiful and relates much to the indian system of arranged marriage which i too would like to be a part of our system which teaches us to <UNK> <UNK> follow them and of course <UNK> their thoughts is so brilliantly shown in this movie of course there isn't any force in choosing your life partner and it should be a brief meeting between the couple and its up to them to decide as it is brilliantly shown in this movie br br coming back to the movie vivah is a story of journey between the beautiful period of engagement and marriage the phase where the guy meets the girl both understand each other both try to <UNK> if they could love each other for seven generations as our system says and the various which occur during <UNK> br br amrita <UNK> is brilliant in the movie shahid is ok and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are awesome the songs are brilliant i especially like the <UNK> <UNK> main <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and do <UNK> <UNK> br br overall a must see for anyone who still believes in the indian culture and tradition and i certainly do br br go see this movie i just have to say one word br br bliss
<START> following a car accident a mad scientist jason <UNK> keeps the head of his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> alive he then goes on the <UNK> looking for the perfect body to make her whole again pretty lame all the way around nothing redeeming here also in the cast are leslie daniels bonnie <UNK> and bruce <UNK> someone should have helped put this one out of its misery let it die
<START> i gave this movie a single star only because it was impossible to give it less br br scientists have developed a formula for <UNK> any <UNK> in their lab a run down warehouse in l a they create a t rex a group of industrial spies break in to steal the formula and the remainder of the film is one endless foot chase br br of course the t rex a rubber puppet gets loose and <UNK> to wipe out the cast it has the amazing ability to sneak up within 2 or 3 feet of someone without them <UNK> and then promptly bites their head off br br one cast member escapes in a police car and spends the remainder of the film driving <UNK> through the city she is of such superior mental ability that she can't even operate the radio she never makes any attempt to drive to a <UNK> or a <UNK> shop and appears hopelessly lost br br the t rex <UNK> havoc throughout the city there are blazing gun battles and buildings cardboard mock ups blowing up but a single police car or the army nor anyone else ever shows up such activity must be <UNK> in los angeles br br we can only hope that a sequel isn't planned
<START> although i generally do not like remakes believing that remakes are waste of time this film is an exception i didn't actually know so far until reading the previous comment that this was a remake so my opinion is purely about the actual film and not a comparison br br the story and the way it is written is no question it is capote there is no need for more words br br the play of anthony <UNK> and eric roberts is superb i have seen some movies with them each in one or the other i was certain that they are good actors and in case of eric i always wondered why his sister is the number 1 famous star and not her brother this time this <UNK> is raised to fact no question his play just as well as the play of mr <UNK> is clearly the top of all their profession br br i recommend this film to be on your top 50 films to see and keep on your dvd shelves
<START> okay this movie is a pure pleasure it has the ever so violent horror mixed with a little suspense and a lot of black comedy the dentist really starts to loose his mind and it's enjoyable to watch him do so this movie is for certain people though either you'll completely love it or you will totally hate it a good movie to rent and watch when you don't got anything else to do also recommended psycho iii
<START> well i do like the gore in this movie it is <UNK> <UNK> anyone that's been to the dentist will know why the story really isn't that bad corbin <UNK> character's motivations do make a lot more sense than in most horror movies br br i've seen worse acting directing script etc but at the end of the day this is still a bad horror movie so it comes down to if you enjoy that type of thing or not i tried to watch the sequel but it was exactly exactly the same thing as this movie just keep in mind if you enjoy people getting tortured at the dentist then this is the movie for you
<START> paulie was cute cool enjoyable and quite fulfilling i went to this movie expecting to view a typical family movie one that within moments would find me unconscious and <UNK> on the floor my <UNK> immediately changed when i was quickly captivated by the movie's <UNK> it is rare that you find a family movie that is <UNK> and can be <UNK> wholesome most are cheaply made written and produced purely to attract young family members <UNK> then drag the unfortunate <UNK> to a mind numbing <UNK> minutes of <UNK> sight gags and plots br br oh yes paulie had a plot it told the story of a young girl marie and her best friend paulie the parrot who unbelievably could talk and quite frequently held conversations with her <UNK> <UNK> jerk father found this unbelievable and thought paulie to be <UNK> to his 4 year old daughter's mental health and quickly <UNK> them apart we follow <UNK> adventures and <UNK> as he attempts to reunite with his beloved owner meeting many memorable characters along the way oh yeah paulie really could smart talk and had a swift new jersey accent cool the plot held thick and entertaining throughout keeping me attracted paulie is the best family movie i have found and <UNK> enjoyed ever seriously pick up a copy and sit back and enjoy a true family movie with the whole family no sleeping i promise
<START> i saw this movie for a number of reasons the main being mira sorvino with her on the cast it couldn't be so bad and it even seemed like it had some mystery and olivier <UNK> was her boyfriend at the time and he was pretty good in <UNK> the story is set in spain so it could be an exotic entertaining movie with one of my favorite actresses br br if you're thinking about the same thing let me warn you this is a truly awful uninteresting boring movie the only <UNK> that comes to mind is pathetic br br the story is contrived with sub plots that add nothing to the narrative they try to build a slasher thriller with a look at <UNK> in spain but fail horribly the twists have no credibility and the so called investigation leads nowhere br br the characters are paper thin i didn't care about anyone more than that they're irritating and pretty hateful people br br the acting is atrocious mira what is wrong with you why mira you're an oscar winner keep some dignity her character was weak but that is no excuse for such an awful performance she seems to be <UNK> all movie long come to think of it i actually think i saw her eyes slowly closing in some scenes i used to think this woman was sexy well she isn't here if you want to look at some skin try <UNK> and michelle because there's nothing to see here and that accent my god br br olivier <UNK> is even worst it's too painful to remember his performance to describe it here im sorry but i <UNK> <UNK> suffered enough with this garbage br br this whole movie is depressing it's so bad in every way it's a wonder how it was even made a lousy team to produce a lousy script and make some money over the actor's name don't fall for it br br avoid it br br
<START> this is the best of the <UNK> films that rainer <UNK> fassbinder made his most successful at least he was one of the leading directors in the new germany after wwii br br <UNK> <UNK> was magnificent as the cold <UNK> maria <UNK> who lost her husband to the war found him after she took an american soldier as a lover lost him again after he went to jail for her and found him <UNK> at the end her day and a half marriage before he disappeared was longer than their time together at the end br br such is life things come and go and you do the best you can you can give up or <UNK> you way of thinking to survive even though maria <UNK> her thinking and did what she had to do she never stopped loving <UNK> which makes the end such a tragedy br br excellent drama
<START> just got my copy of this dvd two disc set and while not perfect i found the overall experience to be a fun way to waste some time i have to say right up front that i am a huge fan of zombie movies and i truly think that the fine people who made these films must be too i also have a soft spot for people who are trying sometimes against all odds to live a dream and again these people are doing it is this some award winning collection of amazing film no not even close but for what they do on their <UNK> budgets these films should be recommended for me the bottom line is always was i entertained did i have a good time with this movie and here the answer to both was yes the first in the series is also the most raw it opens with some kind of accident at a nuclear facility and people melt down or something cut to some years later and a new <UNK> community is built over the old <UNK> site some kids making a video fall into a hole and find themselves trapped in the bottom levels of the facility they get rescued but the hole is not sealed and the people from the opening start <UNK> out of the hole soon the whole town is <UNK> by the undead and these zombies are fun they go from cool <UNK> makeup to the <UNK> slap on white face ever but they are fun the whole movie <UNK> in a showdown between the final survivors of the area and the undead with our heroes going into the <UNK> lower levels to take out the flesh eating zombies and seal the hole forever pretty cheesy but i think it was meant to be still it moves very fast has <UNK> of gruesome effects and really tries to have some style the acting is uneven but a few good performances shine through and one really should listen to the commentary track i went back and watched it again with that on and found it to be a good bit of information on the trials and fun that the crew and cast experienced on the movie director todd sheets seems pretty proud of this his first film but also has no <UNK> he knows it's a trashy zombie movie but he does show respect to people involved also sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field the behind the scenes of zombie bloodbath is pretty fun as well i felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for there are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like <UNK> fox and mtv over all a fun little film that is very rough around the edges but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride i have seen many <UNK> films and some shot of video films and many are quite dull but this one really wasn't while newer <UNK> films are technically superior they just aren't fun overall this is a solid if a bit flawed release with plenty of extras and tons of gore and splatter while not breaking any grand rules of move making i found the series to be fun and always a laugh so i give this set a solid recommendation todd sheets was not trying to make award winning art here folks he was trying sometimes against all odds it seems to make fun zero budget <UNK> horror and to that end he has succeeded in <UNK>
<START> i would have rated this film a minus 10 but sadly it is not offered br br why i didn't walk out in the first five minutes of this movie i cannot say i should have gone with my instinct and left immediately several people in our theater did and sadly i didn't follow them out br br the story lacked all <UNK> for a movie no plot awful acting even robin williams was so disappointing that i may never see another film he is in not a single relationship in the story went beyond <UNK> talk i did like the <UNK> scene too bad it didn't shock some meat into the <UNK> of the plot someone needs to <UNK> the writer and director of this film
<START> why me why should i be subjected to such slaughter of what could have made an interesting plot at least if i can warn other people off it will have been worthwhile br br i had to watch this horrible movie for a college course otherwise i would have looked at the synopsis on the back of the thing and <UNK> clear the movie was slow had painfully little character development and centered around the idea that a creepy little white man can become cool if he hangs out with an la style token black man br br if you want to experience the stereotypical la feeling of <UNK> <UNK> watch the movie note though that this movie does not depict what we have come to think of as an la lifestyle it is a wonderful example of the products that <UNK> from it
<START> i attempted watching this movie twice and even then fast <UNK> the irritating parts but still could not make it to the end br br i don't understand how this movie genuinely got any good reviews i think these people giving such good reviews are just trying to hype the movie for marketing purposes their reviews seem very unrealistic and it looks like an inside job which makes things more pitiful movies should get true positive comments on their own steam and not contrived ones br br the acting was reminiscent of a cheesy porno movie and not in a funny way i don't mind low budget movies with bad acting if they know how to work with it br br i found the lead character to be irritating his facial expressions and humor was <UNK> childish i thought this was intentional to make the <UNK> conspiracy seem more enjoyable and <UNK> but they were even worse br br the script was also very awkward his bosses overdone business speech and the unfunny sarcastic remarks br br i did not find anything redeeming about this movie other than some of the attractive women br br never have i felt that a rating was this misleading i was interested by its premise but scared off by everything else of course see it if you want but i just didn't want anyone else to get their hopes up waste their time br br maybe it is just me probably not
<START> there is this private <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> that's been around since 1959 my grandparents were among its <UNK> my parents had a site starting in 1965 and my two brothers have sites there now br br this doesn't have anything directly to do with the movie bear with me br br i spent <UNK> at <UNK> hill from when i was five years old to when i was <UNK> and it is to people like me to whom this film speaks the ones for whom a group camp in the woods was as my fiancée tells of me the good and happy place if you've never experienced the lifestyle indian summer will probably be lost on you don't bother it's not quick paced it doesn't have rapid cuts the plots aren't in the least bit convoluted it has no explosions such dramatic tension as exists is mild there aren't any a list actors there are no rapid fire <UNK> just to show off how clever the <UNK> are other than perhaps <UNK> <UNK> killer line about how her fiancé shouldn't <UNK> his toys that is not the least degree what this movie is about any more than the godfather is a slasher flick just because it has a lot of on screen gore br br but indian summer is <UNK> polar opposite if you have experienced the lifestyle see this movie don't read any more just do it br br for me this is a 9 10 film
<START> i really have to say this was always a favorite of mine when i went to see my grandma and it still is it is very very close to the book the way it is filmed and the players were just all excellent i have to recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it almost everyone i talk to hates tv movies but this was really great i gave it 10 10
<START> i really enjoyed this drama from sidney lumet the best word i could come up to describe it with is insane it throws the viewer around for an hour and fifty minutes and doesn't let you breathe until the credits start to roll at the very end trust me this movie will keep you guessing the entire way through br br the story is very well crafted and almost brilliant it's almost like a more complicated tarantino type story the acting is all amazing from all of the leads and even the small parts excellent cast i also loved the cinematography it gave it the real feeling as if it were an independent film it was all great br br this movie is excited <UNK> and heartbreaking it's almost hard to watch but you'll be glad that you did
<START> one of my favorite shows in the 80's after the first season it started going downhill when they decided to add jean bruce scott to the cast deborah <UNK> was wonderful and it was fun watching her and ernest <UNK> character go at it with each other the last episode she appeared in was one of my favorites for in the second season unfortunately during those days blacks did not last long on television shows some of the episodes in the second season where okay but the third season it was more about the human characters than <UNK> and it was not shown until almost at the end of the show when it went to usa it was disgusting
