<START> for a made for tv movie i thought that it was a great popcorn movie don't expect anything to be very accurate and don't expect any award winners in this bunch but i do recommend this for a tv type version somewhat like the <UNK> look for cameos from real <UNK> players officials
<START> i loved this film it has a great heart and great bones i stumbled onto it by chance and i had no <UNK> not even an <UNK> of this movie from <UNK> or reviews or word of mouth <UNK> i remember reading many years ago a journalist who commented on the value of watching movies without having them <UNK> by the pre judgement of reviews or the false <UNK> of the <UNK> this seems to be the single most common source of the <UNK> negative reaction to the film failed to meet expectations of it being a comedy or a slice of life or character driven <UNK> had no expectation about the film and so it was comedic but i only laughed once or twice without being a comedy it was about a person but so eccentric that it wasn't slice of life it was about a character but the character was so intelligently optimistic and <UNK> of her instinct to life that it wasn't the angst driven sentimental melodrama so typical of american film as i wrote that i realized that writer director lisa krueger managed to poke fun at this schlock american sentimentality in the husband very cleverly too and <UNK> was able to keep the <UNK> sentimental ending from the screen when the <UNK> husband returned with his tail <UNK> between his legs ms krueger bravo <UNK> now i will be watching this film again as it is getting better and better as i reflect on it br br <UNK> performance as is brilliant i loved how subtly but completely she was able to portray and convey intelligent awareness of her commitment to <UNK> her words and actions she knew that in keeping her word with a band or friends or husband that she was setting herself up to <UNK> and or disappointment in a world that was unable to honour commitment as she was able to do but even with that strength she was fully connected to humanity and <UNK> with a fully committed heart their <UNK> and failures the character of was amazingly well acted and i left the film surprised that i had no <UNK> of awards nominations for it okay not that surprised as american awards tend to go to women in roles filled with angst and the proper amount of nudity which this film did not have what it has was far better which was heart in this woman's discovery of herself with the assistance of new friends and a self <UNK> <UNK> br br i admit to being a bit of a soft touch for eccentric characters who manage their <UNK> while remaining honest and true to themselves as they move through the <UNK> of what <UNK> <UNK> societal behaviour and <UNK> <UNK> if people must <UNK> to <UNK> in your world then this film will not be to your liking that was it seems one of the common threads in the <UNK> br br and i am always a sucker for a good play on words when it raises questions of human behaviour and <UNK> philosophical values until this movie i hadn't made the emotional connection between being committed to a cause or honesty or something and being committed to an insane asylum at what point does one's commitment to a personal sense of truth and action in life become a one way ticket to insanity this sounds like a simple question or one that is easily <UNK> as being <UNK> but is it and yet few of the critics i think maybe two commented on this aspect of the film either directly or <UNK> br br a lovely film 8 10 br br <UNK>
<START> this was a funny movie just having seeing the evil dead trilogy not a week ago and left wanting for more i got as many bruce campbell movies as i could including really bad ones this one is funny without being exceptional but as sure as hell original br br i mean you've got mad scientists <UNK> <UNK> half brain freaks <UNK> ex <UNK> cab drivers jealousy murders of passion love romance sex action and what more all with the same 6 actors br br you really have to see it and enjoy it i can't explain it in a text box i guess it is not so much a cult movie as evil dead was but it certainly has that bruce campbell touch i love ted <UNK> lends a hand <UNK> looks both beautiful and interesting she has gone a long way from the hooker in friday the 13th and <UNK> also shows a lot of promise as an actor although he will probably be cast as secondary character in hollywood movies his entire career br br bottom line funny movie if you liked evil dead you'll like this too
<START> this film is a perfect example of great <UNK> i loved this film and was sucked in from the very beginning sure it's just an action flick but isn't having fun what watching movies is all about br br the cast of this film are very strong with likable characters the friendship between the boys is so realistic and appealing it's heart warming and hilarious to see a group of teenage boys interact especially this group of boys sean <UNK> makes a great rebel successfully avoiding being a <UNK> teenager br br if you want fun watch this film i thoroughly enjoyed it even though i was watching it on a very dirty and old vhs that was terrible quality go dvd's
<START> if i was only allowed to watch one program in my entire life i would definitely have to pick the war on everything of all the satirical shows that have been on australian television i found <UNK> to be the funniest of all it is just so amazing the boys aren't afraid to do anything br br whether it's dress up as hitler to get into a polish club or push a massive ball of string around melbourne to try out the <UNK> or rock up to the coke factory naked in a bath with 2 40 to buy some water the <UNK> boys will go there br br in <UNK> with the comments above and or below the war on everything is more popular than their previous program but was just as funny some unforgettable moments from that show clean up cambodia classic br br so anyway to stop me from <UNK> further i strongly advise you to at least give <UNK> a chance you'll more than likely find it hilarious
<START> i watch this movie without big expectations i think everyone should do it's a great tv <UNK> and of course we couldn't compare it with gone with the wind but it's still nice to watch it's also weird to see a different scarlett <UNK> <UNK> don't play scarlett with passion and fire like <UNK> leigh but i believe that scarlett is changed when she became older don't expect to much of this just watch but don't watch like i think this would be horrible
<START> yes at times <UNK> love <UNK> as it <UNK> no as it from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of <UNK> elements and characters in fact it wasn't until i watched the film for the second time that i began to understand what i think p j hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky unconventional flick perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the <UNK> love for which grace kathy bates <UNK> and describes in the later part of the film grace insists that <UNK> love is just that without condition and without <UNK> so i watched <UNK> love again with that in mind i laughed much more than i did the first time i became more involved with the characters i began to understand the at times absurd turns the story takes the performances are often over the top but no more than they need to be to fit <UNK> weird and <UNK> vision a vision which moved me to tears yearning and <UNK> of side splitting laughter yes hogan is asking a great deal of his audience but i for one have come to truly love his film <UNK>
<START> this is absolute drivel designed to shock and <UNK> the 60's mindset the acting is completely wooden <UNK> mainly of ad <UNK> which results in the sub standard actors <UNK> the first thing they can think of <UNK> br br the end result is of a badly written play being read by people who have no idea and couldn't care the one exception to this is the lead character joe played by joe who spends a lot of the film in a naked <UNK> either stoned or the only one in the piece who can act please don't think i don't get <UNK> this is <UNK> and simply a stinker that should never have made it out of a film class
<START> when goes to town he discovers nothing but bad news for his little <UNK> neighbors in the can this honest good natured <UNK> save his sweetheart miss honey <UNK> from the <UNK> of the evil c <UNK> beetle and also lead his friends to a safe new home before it's too late br br while not one of the great animated features a very new art at the time this film was created is an enjoyable film which should bring pleasure to <UNK> viewers technically it is well made with animation of a generally high quality the movie's main <UNK> is that none of the characters really have any <UNK> they don't come <UNK> on the screen in the way <UNK> <UNK> did a year earlier in <UNK> br br however it is ultimately unfair to compare the <UNK> studio <UNK> with that of disney max dave <UNK> had their own star to follow their contribution and it would be a considerable one would be in the realm of the one reel cartoon with their <UNK> and betty <UNK> series they created alternate realities as <UNK> as any produced by other cartoon studios was their second experiment with feature length animation after <UNK> travels in 1939 and <UNK> they would <UNK> their <UNK> again on the cartoon short subject in fact the first in the highly acclaimed superman series was already in release br br story owes a great deal to frank <UNK> with it's energetic go get hero up against powerful societal forces indeed the film's original title was mr bug goes to town which immediately puts one in mind of gary cooper or jimmy stewart and their <UNK> adventures br br jack <UNK> famous as the voice of <UNK> here speaks for two very different characters old mr <UNK> <UNK> the fly movie <UNK> should be able to catch veteran voice actors <UNK> <UNK> mae both in uncredited roles br br the film has some pleasant songs <UNK> by <UNK> frank <UNK> of which be my little baby <UNK> <UNK> is the most familiar we're the couple in the <UNK> is a fine romantic tune which deserves to be <UNK> br br it is unfortunate that the film's initial animation with its <UNK> out of the heavens and past the in depth new york <UNK> is <UNK> behind the opening credits
<START> ok i admit it i'm 40 and still shed a tear every time i watch johnny calling back his robot at the end br br robot now stop don't do it stop the attack robot what are you doing robot robot where are you come back robot robot please don't do it you'll die robot robot please comeback i need you robot robot giant johnny the last of emperor <UNK> br br of all the thats out there giant robot has a special place in my heart and will always be there i credit it with getting me into everything sci fi and anime when i was a kid br br live on <UNK>
<START> i attended a screening of this movie it was <UNK> with clichés and very unfunny jokes and set ups i think the other comments were by people who must've worked on the movie or been family members of the cast i'm amazed this movie cost 3 4 million without any real stars where did the budget go it obviously didn't go to writers for re writes nice thought to bank on the success of big fat greek wedding but a major miss there was little or any spark between the main characters and the <UNK> incident was a bit flimsy at best the direction was uninspired and looked like a student film br br i don't even know what it means everybody wants to italian is that a real saying i've never heard it
<START> i put down this vehicle from robert de niro and eddie murphy and murphy in particular the first time but having seen it again recently i can see that it does have some very funny bits br br this is by no means to say that this is the greatest buddy comedy of all time but really what can you do to the already exhausted <UNK> what director tom <UNK> has tried to do is make it a satire of the clichés of buddy comedy and the media early in the movie the executive of a cable network asks how is this different from cops when chase is <UNK> the idea of a reality show dealing with de <UNK> character mitch preston hilariously boring name by the way that's when i saw it in a new light that i hadn't previously noticed br br the idea is to show all the elements of the buddy comedy and put a twist on them de <UNK> <UNK> to star in the show and to partner up with murphy is right out of every cop film you can think of you can say that de niro is actually playing himself asking why would i do another movie playing a cop chase is portrayed to be a hollywood phony but if you look at her opening scene again she is merely doing it to save her job she somehow sees the <UNK> of what she is doing but she wants to succeed despite that one line says it all who doesn't want to be on tv maybe this is reading too much into what is essentially a lightweight film merely set to entertain but it does give it a little spin that i hadn't noticed before br br as for murphy you got to applaud him for looking this ridiculous <UNK> wants to be a star so bad that he is willing to sell out everything he comes in contact with murphy was a big star and maybe it struck a nerve that it is all so fleeting br br the plot with the gun is of course pretty boring the action sequences are nothing special except the end which required a lot of effort both from cast and crew one thing that i noticed about the villain is that he is dressed like an 80's pop star george michael comes to mind and that adds to the whole media spin br br so i <UNK> it the first time around but what the heck if you are gonna do this why not point out how ridiculous it really is and de niro and murphy took a big chance doing this
<START> i would not recommend it whatsoever it was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater so i couldn't leave and watching a part porn movie except they didn't take their clothes off it was the body language and definitely the language i have to say i was embarrassed filming was very low budget no good dialogue <UNK> actors <UNK> except the two best characters who got killed off and they were david carradine and dennis hopper it did <UNK> of kill bill and that old movie with the two guys who ride the <UNK> on their you know what i mean <UNK> the filming was grainy and just a very low quality there was nobody in that theater that liked this movie and the people around me were younger and <UNK>
<START> what makes this one better than most movie movies is that it doesn't feel phony the film the story of the hot headed director and his rise and fall and rise by using real recognizable names and events during the silent and early sound <UNK> instead of the generic sound will put us out of business business they actually show <UNK> and the jazz singer the acting is really quite good with <UNK> performances from don <UNK> alice faye and j edward in particular
<START> simply one of the greatest films ever made worthy of sitting alongside such european <UNK> as the rules of the game grand illusion <UNK> 8 1 2 wings of desire the night of the shooting stars la <UNK> <UNK> the passion of joan of arc the four hundred blows and <UNK> de both a <UNK> and an almost perfect work of art
<START> i went to see this film over <UNK> men in fact buying the tickets to <UNK> men and going to the other because it looked like a fun movie with action romance thrills <UNK> and exotic locations they had all that but so do a lot of movies with a conception of story br br all i can say is why why why why did they not just make it a straight narrative instead of some sappy flashback story br br here is all the movies from what i've seen the film was derived from of course indiana jones and <UNK> the stone but also true lies proof of life that old 80s tom <UNK> movie <UNK> woody allen and hero from the use of digital extras br br ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up
<START> the <UNK> of western style <UNK> on the various of india have <UNK> remained largely non existent the two <UNK> <UNK> to alien <UNK> and threatening in the name of tradition never to <UNK> art <UNK> life or so the claim goes and popular hindi cinema is no exception <UNK> an underlying <UNK> which <UNK> forms the foundation of much of the collective indian culture but why what is it about the female gender that has rendered it so hateful to the culture that women are <UNK> subject to the most <UNK> horrors including rape murder <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> infidelity and the <UNK> of spirit that goes under the name of <UNK> <UNK> latest offering <UNK> asks the same <UNK> question <UNK> the atrocities committed against women through three separate chapters episodes which <UNK> the journey of shame endured by its protagonist br br direction on <UNK> part is not up to par with the level the story demands he fails to achieve the necessary sensitivity in depicting the saga of sadness and confronts the issue of <UNK> from the side instead of head on <UNK> has recently said that he did not make the film for an international film festival but rather for the masses of his country <UNK> the <UNK> shows and the film too often <UNK> into the action blood gore genre that <UNK> <UNK> in the film suffers from its jerky episodic pace and its ending is rather too contrived br br the female cast is given much <UNK> and more rounded characterizations than their male counterparts the protagonist is played <UNK> by the beautiful who proves in <UNK> that she is one of our <UNK> more competent leading ladies and given a proper role and set up emerges with a truly commendable performance one wonders how brilliantly she may have <UNK> had the film been made by a director with the appropriate creative intention and appreciation of the issue at hand puts in a <UNK> performance and continues to show that she is an <UNK> talent cast as <UNK> <UNK> performs with a never before seen <UNK> and <UNK> for what truly deserves the name of <UNK> ' the role of a street smart performer who finds <UNK> in alcohol and the promise of an unborn child stands as the greatest risk in her cannon of song n dance roles which have <UNK> her <UNK> status over the past decade which leaves the final and most disturbing performance in this would be feminist saga that of the <UNK> talented <UNK> <UNK> is film there can be no doubt about that but it is <UNK> who <UNK> the proceedings in a performance that <UNK> into your bones and sends echoes of terror through the of your heart <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> vanity and <UNK> to deliver a performance that is so <UNK> with authenticity and <UNK> that emotional nudity becomes the <UNK> of this portion of the film comparisons are indeed <UNK> especially when rendered opposite one of the world's great leading ladies but in the <UNK> presence of this <UNK> screen legend the others fade in her shadow br br <UNK> has none of the sophistication of <UNK> feminist dramas like <UNK> <UNK> or even the hell queen celebration it <UNK> its <UNK> goals in two early moments the loud <UNK> in which <UNK> her in laws for their abuse of her father who has committed no other crime than given birth to a girl she <UNK> leaving the wedding <UNK> in <UNK> seeing her father <UNK> she begins to <UNK> <UNK> herself for the chaotic destruction in front of her she <UNK> why did i say anything i have ruined everything it is all my fault her grandmother witnessing <UNK> the abuse she bore <UNK> her by saying why are you crying there is no reason for you to be crying you are not at fault for anything the fault is mine the fault is of every woman who came before you because if we had had the courage to say in our day what you have said today there would have been no need for you to say anything today in this scene the importance of the feminist legacy is laid <UNK> in sight through words br br the other more subtle moment comes very early in the film when has <UNK> from her abusive husband to the <UNK> of her parents' home in india to viewers of western societies it may seem perfectly reasonable indeed natural that any abused woman would seek the protective of her parents this however is a societal taboo in many eastern cultures india among them once a woman has been married the identity she assumes is that of her husband and his personal <UNK> family business children etc for her to turn her back on these <UNK> is a grave social sin one which truly has no equivalent for the western woman she is thereafter regarded as <UNK> and as one whose value has been <UNK> entirely by her own actions and her <UNK> to submit to the role she has been given she is not so much an individual as she is an <UNK> of <UNK> honor her father <UNK> her for her actions concerned that his <UNK> honor will be <UNK> <UNK> by the daughter he had already transferred to another man his primary concern is that of the impending marriage of younger sister a <UNK> made far less likely with a divorced elder daughter in the same household he tells her in no uncertain that she must return to the man to whom she belongs however violent and sadistic he may be he against her the age old <UNK> that the honor of every home lies in the hands of its daughter quietly and <UNK> she replies yes the honor of every home lies in the hands of its daughter but there is no honor for the daughter herself
<START> anyone who has seen ali g before should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is g br br although i prefer ali g when he is <UNK> the rich and famous his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too br br ridiculous plot ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script that all make this film a riot for fans of ali g br br if you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague because it's definitely just more of the same for everybody else watch it 7 10
<START> i found this movie to be one of the best for this time and era the cast was very exceptional and most entertaining to all that saw it i would like for my younger generation to have seen this movie but i haven't been able to find or see the movie in the past my first viewing was back in the early sixties and i have been looking for it every since the movie showed me potential of how far we come go to become a gifted at a craft where we could only have meaningless roles to act as <UNK> and servants br br <UNK> and <UNK> showed some of the urban life of my neighborhood as i saw it in the time where i needed good solid male role models the singing and acting had me skipping for days playing the part of different characters in this excellent movie
<START> this is just art house rubbish i sat watching this trash with my <UNK> friends they found it as boring as i did for a more interesting and more true account watch the excellent movie <UNK> this is just a <UNK> with people talking in coffee <UNK> a cure for insomnia 1 out of 10
<START> this has been one of the best vampire movies that i have seen in a long time it was very seductive and <UNK> i liked that it did not have the usual gore and carnage that comes along with most vampire movies the music was excellent it would be great if there was a sequel
<START> from the beginning <UNK> there was you was on the right track setting up for the big finish where it would all come together but the thing is it <UNK> <UNK> i found the ending extremely disappointing but maybe in <UNK> it was the right ending a little more realistic you could say judge for yourself
<START> i am working at a video store so i got to see this one for free thank god had i paid for it my review would be less <UNK> br br well the major idea of the film geeky girl takes bloody revenge isn't all that original there are several parallels to carrie playing a mean practical joke on a loser except for one nice girl that is actually sorry for her and carries bad family background i still think it's a fun idea for trashy teen horror flick unfortunately they didn't take much advantage of the <UNK> that are here and rather put an emphasis on all the wrong things br br what worked i liked the actress that played <UNK> she looked great when she was hot and her <UNK> lines were fun sean can't come to the phone he's f king patrick br br what didn't work the whole thing was silly i generally prefer rational explanations she could have the whole thing with her teacher or one of the boys to get her revenge there were a lot of logical <UNK> and the gore looked really bad when the boy is cutting of his ear and his tongue please br br the whole idea wasn't bound for oscar buzz but i just think they wasted the comedic and the suspenseful potential they had it was bearable but far from good
<START> i heard that after the first <UNK> movie the sequels begin to go downhill i believe that this is not the case at least not for this film this movie is even better than the first film the original crew returns three years after they successfully robbed terry <UNK> now <UNK> is visiting each one of them personally telling them to get the money back within two weeks to do that they must do a couple <UNK> in europe to get the money br br the acting is very good the all star cast <UNK> expectations matt damon brad pitt and catherine zeta jones were probably the best in this film br br there are some confusing moments in this film but that does not matter because there are only a few confusing moments anyway this movie is only made for harmless fun br br overall this is a great heist movie i rate this movie 9 10
<START> i highly <UNK> this movie it <UNK> the line between childhood fantasy and everyday reality in such a <UNK> fashion that it has to be seen to be believed the actors and director have such perfect timing that in one scene a name calling fight becomes a sort of dance i loved the story line the actors everything while i do think there were one or two decidedly cheesy scenes over all the movie was <UNK> done
<START> if you don't like italian horror you won't like this film on that note br br overall it was a terrible experience many things happened vanessa redgrave was <UNK> to be in the film and she pulled out one of the actors was crushed by a car i was engaged to be married but by the end of the picture that was finished my father died during the shooting all kinds of things <UNK> <UNK> on the making of opera br br i was truly impressed with <UNK> and the film he made here especially against such harrowing circumstances the whole <UNK> of <UNK> and its curse on those who attempt to stage the play adds <UNK> volumes to opera br br throughout the film <UNK> some of his most clever and audience directed tricks a young opera singer christina is stalked by a violent psychopath who forces her to watch a series of brutal murders by <UNK> several sharp <UNK> to <UNK> the killer makes it impossible for her to close her eyes take a good look if you try to close your eyes you'll tear them apart so you'll just have to watch everything br br it is clear that <UNK> put great care into <UNK> the faux <UNK> opera on screen and his hard work pays off add to this several <UNK> brutal murders an incredibly tense chase sequence and the genius use of <UNK> to portray a certain character the role vanessa redgrave pulled out on thank god and you've got one of the best italian horror films ever created br br that said it's still italian horror why christina never seems to tell anyone about this brutal murders is beyond anyone's <UNK> some scenes might be difficult for certain viewers to stomach but personally i felt more tension towards christina and her eyes than any of the brutal <UNK> in the film the finale to had my stomach <UNK> more than anything in opera but that's probably just me br br and the last five minutes <UNK> wanted it he filmed it and he's fought to keep it in the film absolutely no one likes it myself included but it's not enough to ruin the rest of the film for me it remains one of <UNK> best films to date br br 9 10
<START> what a disappointment the story line is so simple the good guys sometimes do bad things and the bad guys sometimes do good things dressed up into a racial setting to make it seem clever sophisticated and meaningful it isn't it lacks any subtlety br br everything that happens is <UNK> and then gone over again in case you missed the explanation br br for a film like this to convince and move the audience it has to be represent the ambiguity of the characters and their motivation and actions not simply present it as a series of <UNK> degree changes in each character's actions br br half way through i really wanted to waste no more time on it but i thought i would stick with it in case it improved big mistake i should have stopped then it simply got worse
<START> i found this to be an underrated quietly compelling spaghetti western also known as dead or alive despite modest <UNK> apart from multi purpose co writer producer albert band the only notable crew member is composer <UNK> the film clearly benefits from the presence of its three american stars newcomer alex <UNK> is an ambiguous anti hero while veterans arthur kennedy and robert ryan lend a <UNK> quality to the proceedings as well as the unusual plot involving a crippled protagonist an <UNK> <UNK> covering a <UNK> clean up of the town and which has the law finally <UNK> with the <UNK> against a <UNK> of mexican <UNK> br br there are several tough action scenes on hand  the film is <UNK> by a terrific climax in which the star trio is <UNK> inside a blazing cabin  plus a couple of outrageous moments which are something of a spaghetti western trademark from the middle of the street <UNK> sees a hidden <UNK> at a window reflected in a <UNK> bottle a man who helps <UNK> escape is repeatedly immersed in a pool of oil by the villains <UNK> also makes a nice impression as a village girl with whom <UNK> the supporting cast then is <UNK> with familiar if largely anonymous faces  all of them essentially genre <UNK> br br i wasn't aware of the fact that the english dubbed version of the film on mgm <UNK> dvd was cut i was fooled by the wrong running time being listed on the back cover the film was only 99 minutes long and not  apparently character is killed in the longer italian version
<START> i watched this movie the other night and i have to admit it was quite possibly the best film of this generation turns out i wasn't born until 1988 but i can relate to this motion picture like cary grant can relate to having an <UNK> or burt reynolds to being a <UNK> <UNK> mark did not decline in <UNK> after his brief <UNK> in new kids on the block which i will from here on refer to as the best band in the world aka like it's totally a morality tale about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> so pay attention i love all <UNK> and continue to support <UNK> because he needs us now more than ever he's the only who survived the de
<START> excellent movie about a big media firm and the goings on both on and off camera covering several years the film centers on 3 <UNK> mobile young <UNK> all <UNK> for their place within the corporation well written dialogue flawless acting and a riveting story made for 2 hours of solid entertainment
<START> this movie brilliantly captures the atmosphere of a d d group while watching i could not help but notice how vividly characters reminded me of myself and my <UNK> friends to the point where they acted literally the same as we do including the <UNK> the fighting the internal jokes driving the <UNK> crazy everything br br it has it all jokes that made me cry action scenes which even filmed in low budget i found <UNK> awesome the story is pretty straightforward and <UNK> but that doesn't really matter since the best part of the movie is to see the characters react and interact with each other and the br br seriously if you're playing d d or any similar <UNK> i cannot stress this enough watch this movie it captured beautifully the spirit of d d
<START> after watching this movie i couldn't help but notice the parallels between it and another film called america 3000 both were very bad mid 1980's post apocalypse disasters on celluloid obviously fake sets wooden acting and stupid monsters are found in both films about the only difference between the two is that the lead <UNK> here played by has a very thick accent avoid this one unless you're watching the mst3k version joel and the <UNK> barely salvage this turkey
<START> one of the more <UNK> statements against the death penalty ever filmed quite a frontal attack against the most disgusting way of doing justice the final sequence with that parallel between the crimes that the convicted committed and his own execution are just superb br br no what about the work of sean penn and susan sarandon it leaves you breathless they're two giants and their performances achieve the highest levels of emotion br br tim robbins put clear that he's not only a good actor he's a nice director as well br br my rate 9 10
<START> my wife and i saw this when we were 17 the only good thing my father ever did get us in this is our movie and the music is our songs <UNK> song is our song yeah nowadays it's a crime to show naked children on the screen but we were <UNK> at 16 why not these kids the movie is rich boy <UNK> poor girl then rich dad steals him away from her at the end after she gives birth under <UNK> conditions she is left alone with child it is a love story and a growing up story the music is fantastic and the story is one any person could relate to may be someday this will be released on dvd
<START> i thought this movie was really good it ends up showing the viewers in the end that <UNK> should of kept what she had <UNK> was sick of her husband jim who was more worried about work then her he was so into his work that he forgot their <UNK> he was also very sloppy she couldn't take it anymore so she left to see if he would miss her the movie shows that he misses her he even tries to make up for the night he messed up he goes to her and tries to bring her home she ends up finding another man named he seemed like the man she always wanted neat and notices her in the end she sorta <UNK> by when she look at shoes and the way he let his <UNK> <UNK> fall on the floor the way jim did the same kinda thing jim ends off making lots of money and cleaning himself up <UNK> thinks in the end that she should of kept her husband because thats all she really wanted and he did changing
<START> one dark night is a highly overlooked and little known film from the early 80's that deserves an audience that i fear it will never get and that's a damn shame i have seen this film compared to others that have gotten a bigger name over the years most notably phantasm hell night and <UNK> this is a much different film than those and i don't see the comparisons other than the <UNK> which is a bit similar to the one in phantasm but not enough to make any real comparisons i'm not sure how this one slipped through without a <UNK> acceptance maybe it's all in the marketing i don't know perhaps a remake would breathe new life into it unless <UNK> all the life out of it that is i'm not too big on all the remakes that are <UNK> these days but i think they do work well with lesser known films except for the awful ghost ship remake which other than the opening scene and not falling <UNK> was utter crap so if a remake of one dark night would happen to fall into the right hands i think it would make a lot of people go and watch the original i know that's what i do if there's a remake of a film i haven't seen before so anything short of a remake i fear would not bring this film back to life unless of course got his eyes on it br br anyways one dark night is a must see for horror fans especially 80's horror fans 'cause we all know that's when the best horror movies were made creepy setting fairly good acting very good story campy what more could you want from an early 80's horror film what's that nudity and gore well sorry no nudity or gore in this film but it's still great nonetheless a solid 8 out of 10 enjoy
<START> gary cooper is a cool headed guy always liked his easy going level headed characters as some others have commented there are some <UNK> in the script such as a us marshall who got his job and can't even hit a <UNK> with a pistol a <UNK> with about thirty hands but can't seem to keep his cattle from being run off br br but there is plenty of the quick thinking straight shooting cooper to keep you entertained br br this movie was made in 1950 people in their <UNK> and 30's have trouble understanding those movies were made for entertainment not oscars br br to expect oscar material does this film injustice it is about the good guys finding a way to round up the bad guys br br so rent borrow or buy this movie pop some corn and enjoy the coop one more time
<START> this film was hilarious it provided a somewhat comical view of the british club scene which if you really look at it is a funny thing the characters in this flick were so realistic to those of us who watched here at my place that it was like watching a movie about ourselves br br there were a few pivotal scenes which really made this movie work the getting ready scenes the get me a real doctor scene the white background scene showing each character in a total state of being <UNK> ending with the infamous line what was i saying and the <UNK> <UNK> scenes i have lived these moments myself and found myself laughing hysterically at my own ridiculous behaviour br br i can't give this movie a 10 because it doesn't measure up to groove which i thought was out of this world but it certainly has its moments the <UNK> en scene and the camera work is superb the special effects are well worth mentioning and the acting is fantastic br br after waiting a long time to see this film i am glad to say that i was not disappointed i hope to see more from the writer director in the future
<START> it is difficult today and in the us to understand this movie we have nothing really to compare it with here is an attempt at comparison it is as if during the last years of rule a filmmaker in iraq were somehow able to make a film which for the first time ever showed life as it really was lived in that country the life of ordinary young girl with all the terror and the <UNK> full blown then the film was <UNK> <UNK> in iraq if you could imagine that unlikely event then you might have an idea of what went on with this film in the last few years of the soviet union prior to this film soviet cinema was highly <UNK> soviet movies would only show an ideal life in the <UNK> paradise then suddenly this the alcoholism the random sex the ugly <UNK> that was the soviet city the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> each other and themselves the utter <UNK> it is all there people were stunned soviet women would often <UNK> during the <UNK> many would say that this is the story of their lives it was a cultural <UNK> the like of which filmmakers only dream of <UNK> it undoubtedly the <UNK> of the soviet union br br reading the reviews here i can see that few understand this film one says it was groundbreaking because it contained real sex to the soviet viewers at the time the sex was a minor event compared to fact that it portrayed reality for the first time in soviet cinema br br others compare it to current films such as as good as it gets might as well compare <UNK> to the latest john novel they simply do not compare this is not just a film this is was a social document and a <UNK> social force it needs to be viewed that way or you will not understand the film br br other reviewers see it as a film about a dysfunctional russian family one even says that it is difficult to feel sorry for vera because she keeps coming back to her family the point is that vera and her family are symbols for all of soviet life there was nowhere else to go because the family down the block and in the next town were the same this was life in the soviet union for most people br br this is a film that can be viewed on many levels as a drama it <UNK> the landscape of despair as a social document it shows the living conditions of the time as a political document it shows the attitude of the people and many of the reasons for the break up of the soviet union and as a moral document it shows the <UNK> of a <UNK> that is out of control and the <UNK> that victims will practice on each other br br little vera clearly shows the human <UNK> that <UNK> eventually takes on its victims despite any good intentions that system may have in doing so it helped end the soviet regime thus <UNK> to one of the major changes in modern history this film achieves what only a few films have ever accomplished it is not only an stunning representation of history but it also become a force in that shaped history
<START> this program was on for a brief period when i was a kid i remember watching it whilst eating fish and <UNK> br br riding on the back of the <UNK> hype this series was much in the style of and the like except more there was a geeky kid who's computer somehow created this guy he'd go around solving crimes and the lot br br all i really remember was his fancy car and the little flashy <UNK> thing that used to draw the car and help him out generally br br when i mention it to anyone they can remember very little too was it real or maybe a dream
<START> i saw a test screening of <UNK> recently and i am surprised to say that it was actually pretty good its a film about different groups of kids your <UNK> your rich <UNK> your typical teenage couple plus two geeky guys and one post hippie babe together but as separate <UNK> each group is travelling to the gold coast for week australia has never had any problems writing comedy and australia is never short or actors who can play comedy with subtlety and just the right amount on <UNK> the cast is full of stellar aussie actors with enormous talent and loads of screen presence keep your eyes on craig <UNK> a young graduate who's optimism for a week long party gets lost in his friends <UNK> travis <UNK> and mark <UNK> who successfully tackle some <UNK> physical comedy as two <UNK> out and jessica <UNK> as a <UNK> but confused teen <UNK> about love <UNK> makes her film debut as every adolescent boys dream girl and holds her own amongst an array of considerably more experienced performers look out for matthew <UNK> cleverly cast as a seedy <UNK> driver fantastic aussie
<START> i watched this movie with my mother she is <UNK> <UNK> old and was raised to be a <UNK> she even <UNK> this i don't think she really understood what was happening she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty scary i felt for this child and his family what torture they went through and remained faithful that is true faith back to the movie i was disgusted by the police force and their <UNK> i am so glad that this public <UNK> was chosen to work this case it was very fortunate for this family that they had a person that cared enough to see through the crap that was handed to him i could tell when one the cops was lying he would not look the <UNK> in the eyes his eyes moved to the side when he answered the questions it is unfortunate that a black person has to be <UNK> because of the color of his skin i read the book about the black man being dragged behind a truck by three white men they were finally found guilty after many years i can't remember the title but it was the same premise whites doing whatever they want with blacks i am sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time if not forever i pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and <UNK> are white no comment from her i want to <UNK> the director and producer of this film i feel the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project i am an avid viewer of <UNK> films i feel that they are well written and have substance i am pleased that i happened to grab this movie on the shelf i felt compelled to write a comment because of how strongly i feel about the film and the prejudice that continues to exist in our modern society
<START> sweet rich valley girl develops crush on a punk from the alley and when her <UNK> friends <UNK> of him she's forced to choose between her heart and her popularity very funny romantic comedy <UNK> in elements of black comedy and <UNK> cheese that make this all the more fun to watch the movie not only follows the life of the valley girl and her punk but her friends too as they shop party hang out and go to the mall if the dialogue doesn't have you laughing non stop for a week the music will songs like johnny are you <UNK> are found throughout also elizabeth daily is a funny existential character and the prom king queen speech at the end is hilarious
<START> a movie i've seen and enjoyed possibly more than any other movie i first saw it as a kid and loved the drama and the great climactic battle as i got older i enjoyed it as much or more than before but now due to all of the <UNK> that work together to make a true classic the acting is great especially keith as t <UNK> the cinematography spectacular the script is full of gems and the directing pulls it all together wonderfully it's loosely based on an actual event and it shows rush of europe and a newly america to <UNK> up the <UNK> old man' the <UNK> empire as it <UNK> in a fashion unlike any other <UNK> movie i've seen humor drama action love it's got it all and deserves far more acclaim much like 'the great <UNK>
<START> following the advice of a friend i got myself this movie i'm very fond of computers in general hence why a 1995 film about identity <UNK> on the internet could not be left unseen i had some bad echoes about it but in the end i wasn't so disappointed the story though classical is kind of interesting and must have been really new back in the days when it was released in theatres i was gladly surprised when i figured out that contrary to what we usually see computer performed actions are somehow realistic as they use windows 3 x and normal computers the storytelling is <UNK> and not bothering the viewer the end is typically american the actors' performance is <UNK> ok sandra <UNK> usually <UNK> me with her oh my god why me way to behave but this time she seems to have controlled herself i'd recommend that movie
<START> this movie is <UNK> of various super bad tough guy biker characters loosely connected but with no real storyline some of the scenes are nicely filmed if they took the same cast and crew and made a movie called the <UNK> who was the coolest character in the film and came up with an interesting and continuous story maybe it could be decent as it is prepare for a lame series of tough guy character <UNK> all of whom do nothing but ride <UNK> around the desert all day and cause trouble while all staying never getting and keeping their hair and clothes perfect and never needing to look for a home or money etc there was a sort of background story about the characters <UNK> various people that were killed and a treasure that was probably supposed to be the plot
<START> although i haven't seen it yet i know that chaplin is a genius and only someone of his talent would take on this daring subject matter a comedy about hitler all great satire is based on going out on an edge also all great comedy deals with the other side pathos this film seems like it will <UNK> both sides like kubrick's dr <UNK> the great dictator deals with history through the distorted lens of satire the only way to deal with the horrors of this world is by laughing at it and hopefully through laughter we can learn to view the world in a new light another film that does this that comes to my mind is <UNK> <UNK> underground and <UNK> and <UNK> so let me watch the film first
<START> i couldn't i was bored not just because the acting was terrible and the tragic story was simply a b movie whose plot was all about the <UNK> but the fact i was watching a <UNK> foreign film which doesn't bother me at all but was still dubbed br br the special effects were awful as the back of the plane <UNK> off you can see the model is hollow as it breaks away in the phony snow most of the movie takes place on a sound stage that clearly is not real and almost looks like a play as the sounds of snow blowing all over are heard but not actually scene br br but how what will they eat they have no food one military person it's never clear what this guy does or why he's in charge says which i'm sure no one ever said in reality or even thought about food since they were concerned if the people were alive not how they'd eat it was simply a stupid line written to point out that yes they will have to eat the dead bodies to survive br br when they finally decide to eat the bodies one man finds one <UNK> body who despite being in the snow for however long is not remotely frozen in fact his flesh is very <UNK> and fresh he cuts the fresh meat off his back that again is not frozen or even cold it appears and this scene goes on for five minutes that's where i had to stop the remake alive was a far superior film about trying to survive in a horrible situation that i'm sure the real survivors praised whereas i can't imagine any of them had anything nice to say about this version it was simply about eating dead bodies and everything else was secondary avoid
<START> of all the episodes of all series this one holds the closest to <UNK> original <UNK> according to the book the making of star trek in <UNK> writer's guide to his story writers he states that any alien creature no matter how <UNK> ugly impossible to believe <UNK> or <UNK> must hold some semblance of humanity that the tv viewing public can empathize with and or relate to devil in the which resembles nothing more or less than a large blob of cow dung is a mother protecting her babies those ball shaped <UNK> the <UNK> keep finding throughout the mine <UNK> and destroying because they have no idea what they are this is one of my absolute favorite episodes if only for that
<START> the three names that mean the most to this film are burt reynolds mark <UNK> and <UNK> moore these three deliver the strongest performances but the entire cast does a wonderful job the film although about the porn industry does not let itself get out of hand with it's own sexual premise on the other hand there were many scenes that involved drug use and although important to understanding the characters lifestyle i think there was some <UNK> in this department paul thomas anderson has not done a great deal of directing but he may have been picked for this film based on his 1988 work the <UNK> <UNK> story one thing that was brilliantly portrayed is the family like atmosphere between the characters as they work live and party together although not a typical family they certainly seem to care for each other the wonderful soundtrack really helps give you a feel for the period during a time when disco was the rage there are many disco favorites on it and some other wonderful songs as well br br the story is about a gifted young man named eddie adams <UNK> that gets invited into the porn industry he changes his name to <UNK> <UNK> and becomes and adult film star almost overnight jack <UNK> reynolds is the director that takes his films very seriously as he believes his work is more than just pornography but that they are true art however <UNK> becomes overly <UNK> on drugs and soon heads down a dangerous road where he stands to loose everything although a greater focus is placed on the character <UNK> there are subplots for the other characters and their trials in life you will find yourself wishing for and hoping their situations improve all in all a well done film
<START> the ending made my heart jump up into my throat i <UNK> to leave the movie theater a little <UNK> after all it was nearly midnight the movie was better than i expected i don't know why it didn't last very long in the theaters or make as much money as anticipated definitely would recommend br br
<START> lord david cecil wrote an interesting book in the 1930s early victorian <UNK> where he looked at the works of dickens <UNK> <UNK> mrs <UNK> charlotte <UNK> and emily <UNK> he selected these writers as the popular favorites of the first half of the victorian period and he explained their strengths and weaknesses as he saw them to the reading public some of his comments are quite relevant to this day but like all criticism it gives an idea of the spirit of the times of the <UNK> life as well br br cecil thought highly of george <UNK> mary ann cross who wrote about seven or eight books including sketches and poetry but for most modern readers they are usually <UNK> with her <UNK> book <UNK> <UNK> which is still read in some high school <UNK> the other books felix holt the radical daniel the mill on the <UNK> adam <UNK> scenes of <UNK> life are still in print penguin for example has most of them in print but are mostly <UNK> the one of most interest today is her last novel where she <UNK> the jews in english society and an <UNK> pre type of <UNK> <UNK> is her sole attempt at a historic novel about experiment of a <UNK> pure republic in <UNK> in the her <UNK> novel is which is concerned with english society in the <UNK> in <UNK> the year of the great <UNK> bill of lord grey i had to read in college for a literature course it certainly is a thoughtful book virginia <UNK> called it the most grown up book in the english language but it suffers like all of <UNK> novels from one <UNK> she cannot write <UNK> exciting <UNK> while dickens is overly <UNK> at times and <UNK> can become pompous and <UNK> and can become as lord cecil says very ordinary in his discussion and charlotte <UNK> can fail to explain certain relationships well and mrs <UNK> seems best dealing with female characters all of them and emily <UNK> in her single novel hold the <UNK> interest reading most of <UNK> novels is like trying to <UNK> sentences out of <UNK> of <UNK> with a <UNK> br br to date i have read about fifty pages of mill of the <UNK> i notice that one of the other reviewers never finished the novel too but i have read a synopsis of what it is about the maggie and her brother tom are the central figures they own the mill in the title although close at the start of the story maggie falls in love with the son of a neighbor whose father is involved in legal difficulties with mr sr tom takes a dim view of this relationship and the tragedy of the story is regarding the split between the siblings culminating in their demise at the conclusion maggie runs back to the mill to rescue tom during a heavy <UNK> and they die together it must have been a success with victorian readers but it is very gloomy and depressing to modern audiences br br the movie changed the ending a little maggie <UNK> fitzgerald does die at the end with her lover and tom james mason notes their deaths at the conclusion in his record book the story is totally <UNK> except for a double death in the <UNK> at the conclusion it doesn't really help matters although fitzgerald and mason do pretty well with their parts they can't really pull the film up by their work alone the end result is a fairly minor film that fortunately did not hurt the <UNK> careers the only other thing to note is that the boyfriend was played by frank <UNK> who two years earlier played david <UNK> as a grown up opposite w c fields lionel barrymore and maureen <UNK> but then <UNK> never really had a major film career he just happened to always be around in pictures some good some mediocre
<START> this is yet another pseudo intellectual let's make the nazis look real bad movie the nazis were pretty bad no doubt most of already know that however that does not necessarily make every movie on the theme good a discovery channel presentation of the <UNK> would have been much more interesting br br conspiracy falls on its ass between two categories documentary and drama it doesn't cut it as a documentary the movie is too and the presentation too it doesn't cut it as a drama the characters are too shallow and conflicts too easily <UNK> br br another thing is the <UNK> one of the greatest crimes against humanity was <UNK> in just over an hour as the movie shows the <UNK> the meeting had nothing to do with reaching a <UNK> on the final solution the decision on the solution had already been taken by the ss the sole purpose of the meeting was to make all significant commit themselves to an already established plan there were no decisions or plans made at the <UNK> there was only <UNK> and some needed less than others br br finally one thing the movie does show although in no exceptional manner is man has a tendency to turn to culture and <UNK> in an attempt to hide for himself the fact that he is committing appalling atrocities this is seen in most <UNK> and politicians
<START> a letter to the guys i tried guys i really tried i tried so hard not to watch this movie i would leave the room when it was on or jump on the computer when the wife watched it this is her second favorite movie the godfather being first which i love br br i ended up catching little bits of this movie and finally after maybe a year i was actually sitting down watching it with her i can't believe i am saying this but i loved this movie dalton plays a great <UNK> and has his <UNK> down pat <UNK> plays a delightful scarlett full of fire and <UNK> and nothing is going to stop her br br my favorite scene is when she is overseas in ireland and the government is going to tear down a house because they are behind in the rent scarlett gets all mad at this and pays the entire debt thus making a huge name for herself around this small town br br all i'm saying guys is you might want to try this movie especially if you are a fan of gone with the wind it does take a little bit to get used to the new actors but i think you will find them refreshing
<START> br br jurassic park iii adventure br br sam <UNK> the dish william macy happy texas <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> family man br br a better title would be escape from the island of really mean dinosaurs but then no one would need to see the film in this sequel a <UNK> tag group pays a visit to the island of dinosaurs to rescue the teenage victim of a hang <UNK> accident br br access hollywood reports began filming without a completed script that explains why the film seems to have little or no purpose other than to demonstrate state of the art special effects sure there are a few clever scenes and some moderately funny bits but no meaningful plot line to tie them together the dinosaur puppets and animation in are very good to excellent and more numerous than ever but the overall film experience can not hold a candle to the original jurassic park or even br br is a mercifully short 90 minutes the last 10 minutes of which is credits even at that i found myself frequently checking my <UNK> the audience i saw it with left the theater in silence br br a better bet see the movie <UNK> blonde br br dave
<START> the audience sat in silence through almost the entire film with only a few rare occasional chuckles the character of <UNK> smart was so inconsistent i felt whip <UNK> when it is convenient for the plot smart behaves like a master spy at other times he acts like an <UNK> they lift many classic lines from the television series but they don't work in this version the classic missed it by this much is funny if it is spoken with attempted <UNK> by someone who is an obvious failure but it loses all humor when spoken by someone who is <UNK> to a slightly lesser degree many of the other characters move at a <UNK> pace from skilled to cartoonish incompetent <UNK> the main villain would seem to be intelligent but he makes decisions that make no damned sense at all still none of the characters in the film is as incompetent as the writers of this mess i am utterly depressed that so many imdb users think this was good
<START> following up the 1970s classic horror film carrie with this offering is like ford following the <UNK> with the this film was horrendous in every detail it would have been titled beverly hill <UNK> meets mystery science theater 3000 but both of those shows far <UNK> this tripe this film was <UNK> a horror film i timed about 3 minutes of gore and 90 minutes of lame high school <UNK> and ritual wow what a surprise <UNK> weird friend commits suicide wow carrie <UNK> her love interests affections wow the in crowd sets up carrie wow the <UNK> have a sexual <UNK> contest what this film needed was way more action and far less tired teen cliches this film is totally
<START> sex and the city has some great things going for it the problem is that it's <UNK> with a number of <UNK> that really hurt the ultimate rating and review for its' six seasons br br the good things about is that a lot of the conversations ring true to life the romance stories are interesting and the characters are fun br br the bad things is that few women act like complete <UNK> these four women have so many partners even going lesbian in some episodes that you have no choice but to roll your eyes at the utter absurdity men on the show are for the most part depicted as shallow <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the foul language these women use is far in excess as to what a normal conversation <UNK> why do the writers do these things clearly to be over the top and to get your attention br br another thing that bothered me without spoiling is how some of the relationships ended they simply didn't ring real to me or to others i discussed this with br br but even though i gave the show 2 stars in the end i'm glad i watched the show i've actually watched every season multiple times i do recommend the show to anyone that won't be offended by strong profanity and soft core pornography i could have done less with the offensive language and the nudity and sex acts but the romance was very good and the saga ends pretty well
<START> reading the book i felt once again drawn into castle rock <UNK> things being the final part of the rock trilogy and the plot was a <UNK> on the demon comes to small redneck village type story king likes to tell the characters were all described in loving detail and it made both a good psychological and gory horror the film on the other hand is awful gone are the character interactions and clever plot and replaced by a story that tries to be exciting but misses by a mile if you haven't read the book then you might enjoy this else avoid at all costs as with most films of king's books
<START> a true masterpiece of the soviet cinematography it's a shame for the soviet union that was never given an opportunity to play in the western movies but then again she would probably never find herself there in she is unforgettable this was one of the few movies where i was crying br br in addition to and who are top rate it was a brilliant work of the director and the <UNK> which made this movie an all time classics world wide just remember the scenes of piano music and <UNK> under the heavy german <UNK> or the death of boris with a <UNK> sky above his head and his last visions appeared <UNK> in those <UNK> the very simple means but the great technique added to the emotional weight mind you 20 years before the star wars <UNK> years before titanic and with a soviet budget
<START> stick around is one of the brief series of films that paired bobby ray with oliver <UNK> hardy before <UNK> immortal <UNK> with stan laurel several critics have suggested that ray and hardy the <UNK> little man and the overbearing big man were a prototype for laurel and hardy but that simply isn't true ray and hardy play off each other well but really aren't a team in each of these films ray has more footage and is clearly meant to be the hero while hardy bullies him in a manner very much unlike his later ollie character's treatment of stanley it's very clear that the relationship between little bobby and big babe was inspired by earlier chaplin films in which the little tramp was <UNK> by huge mack <UNK> or <UNK> eric campbell br br however in stick around hardy sports a <UNK> hat that's identical to his later ollie although with a fuller <UNK> and he and bobby after spending most of this movie as <UNK> end up as drunken <UNK> br br bobby is a for the firm of and with hardy as his boss when the bobby tries to pretend he showed up promptly there's some clever physical business between the two men that reminds me of a routine performed by <UNK> <UNK> and buster keaton in 'the a bit later bobby ray whose brief acting career never firmly developed a screen persona performs an impossible gag that would have been inappropriate for stan laurel when he pulls a long out of a much smaller br br the go to work in a <UNK> and there are the usual unrealistic depictions of mental illness one resident insists on sitting on a piece of <UNK> because he thinks he's a egg there are also some <UNK> racist and <UNK> unfunny gags involving a black man who <UNK> lets the inmates crack open <UNK> on top of his head when he sees a picture of a lion not even a photograph mind you he goes all cowardly as if it were an actual wild animal br br stick around is fairly dire most of the <UNK> and acting is much <UNK> than it needs to be for a slapstick comedy even hardy already a very subtle actor by <UNK> badly with his over acting here there are several bad examples of shot matching i was impressed with one unusual camera set up when a fat face is and we see a close up of his reflection in a hand mirror rather than his actual face br br spoilers coming during their brief pairing hardy typically played <UNK> boss or <UNK> or both here for once they end up as pals it's a nice ending but it doesn't make up for what's really a poor film my rating for this one is only 4 out of 10
<START> this is an <UNK> new clothes situation someone needs to say that's not a funny and original etc etc film that is an inferior film don't waste your money on it the film is trashy and the people in it are embarrassingly inferior trailer trash they are all too realistically only themselves they have no lines they don't act the american dream is not to create shoddy no quality films or anything else shoddy and of no quality it is to achieve something of quality and thereby success only people who are desperate to praise any film not made in hollywood it can't have been made in hollywood can it would try to any kind of quality to this film it's worse than ed woods another film about a film maker without standards these films shouldn't have been made and you shouldn't go see american movie
<START> i only wish that i had the good sense to turn this movie off in the beginning when i knew it was terrible br br instead i gave it the benefit of the doubt and waited for it to get better br br don't make the same mistake i did br br the title has nothing to do with the movie the movie has nothing to do with the real world the plot has nothing to do with a plot the acting consists of a guy who wants to be john cusack but can't pull it off the lead is a girl who tries to be claire <UNK> sadly she can't pull that off either they are in love although god only knows why and by the end i was hoping that they would all kill each other off just so i could believe none of these kids would ever <UNK> the world again
<START> alien warrior or king of the streets is one of those 80s gems you stumble across by mistake then watch <UNK> <UNK> at how wonderfully silly and over the top it gets br br a rather hunky alien arrives on earth la to be exact and stumbles into a world of drug dealers gangs and corrupt cops he falls in love with the haired beautiful teacher who only wants to help inner city kids read more he also manages to anger a coke <UNK> drug <UNK> who <UNK> to destroy him br br i fell in love with this film at first viewing sure it's hokey silly and low budget but you can tell the filmmakers had their heart in the right place and damn if the thing doesn't work i only pray it'll be on dvd soon br br it's got a hot soundtrack break dancing violence nudity all with a positive wholesome message see it
<START> i was forced to watch this film for my world <UNK> class this film is what is wrong with america today instead of <UNK> out the best way out of hard times or situations we would rather complain about how it is someone else's fault this film goes through the downfall of <UNK> <UNK> and blames it 100 on general <UNK> in the process of doing so moore goes to great <UNK> to make the executives of general <UNK> out to be villains just because they are doing their job in a <UNK> society moore films several throughout the film and does not ever even ask once if the person is being <UNK> because of a <UNK> additionally he never interviews the <UNK> of the <UNK> filmed moore goes to great <UNK> to twist historical events to fit his political agenda in this film of pure propaganda
<START> this movie worked for me because i see this movie as an exact opposite of with the wind ' farm owners instead of plantation owners scarlett fights and for what she wants <UNK> gets depressed and turns inside herself until ruby <UNK> <UNK> shows up to save the day sort of in a round about way instead of officers trying to get back to their families the lists goes on and on even the love story was opposite if this is what the producer and writers were trying to get across it succeeded with me br br there are only two things i didn't like about the movie the rest i thought was well done and i liked it enough to recommend it to friends first i couldn't see the attraction between jude law and <UNK> nicole kidman as being strong enough for to desert to get back to her said he only had written to her a few times where <UNK> wrote to him almost constantly second something or someone getting killed or dying in almost every scene was a little much i must say it was full of action because of that but after about the second scene i knew something or someone was going to die in the next scene i like to be surprised by the next scene not know what is going to happen before it does br br i thought all the acting was very well done with <UNK> the best she deserved the credit she got for it i thought she played the part of the <UNK> girl very well she must have done her <UNK> on the part <UNK> even said in the movie that she was smarter than people thought she was i think that was true law did well with his part with all he had to go through to get back to kidman it must have been a lot stronger love to go through all that than i thought it was now he showed a lot of emotion in his face during his trials <UNK> part may have had something to do with the fact i chose her performance after the other two except when she was depressed she didn't show much emotion i don't know if that is how the part was written or if that is how she perceived the part she still did a good job i just thought the other two were better br br i liked the scene with the <UNK> kidman and the <UNK> even though it was one of those scenes i mentioned above i thought the <UNK> <UNK> was exactly as they probably were back then even though we don't hear much about them they were a part of that time i thought the scenery was beautiful the movie had everything needed to be a good historical romance
<START> not only is the great rock n roll <UNK> thoroughly inaccurate but when it comes down to it not much about it is interesting or even entertaining malcolm <UNK> apparently <UNK> the majority of the sex <UNK> <UNK> on this waste of film which makes it that much more obnoxious the intention from the beginning was to create a <UNK> to the genius of <UNK> who to this day takes full credit for creating punk music creating the sex <UNK> and at times even writing all the songs viewers follow <UNK> to various settings where he tells his story to his sidekick a female dwarf and simply takes credit for one thing after another one particularly irritating scene has <UNK> in an abandoned airplane <UNK> waiting for a plane being <UNK> by <UNK> and giving them their big story the most entertaining elements of the film are the animated short pieces however even these <UNK> of <UNK> overbearing self importance br br even as a farce this film doesn't work little about it is entertaining except for steve jones who is surprisingly decent as a pseudo detective type person 20 years later <UNK> temple who wrote and directed this film also directed the sex <UNK> documentary the filth and the fury while that movie is much better and more interesting than <UNK> it still is full of <UNK> artistic <UNK> that just don't work like <UNK> band members in shadow as if they are some kind of crime witness trying to hide their identity an interesting bit of trivia film critic roger ebert was one of the original <UNK> for the movie who killed <UNK> which eventually became <UNK>
<START> in print this is one of the greatest short stories ever written brought brilliantly and <UNK> to the screen by this father son team working together sadly for the first and last time it is fitting that john huston should end his career on a high note by bringing the work of one of his favorite author's to the screen in what is easily the best <UNK> screen adaptation huston made a career of adapting great works of literature to film usually quite successfully it is sad and somewhat puzzling that tony huston pretty much began and ended his career in film by adapting what would be his father's final project and picking up a well deserved oscar nomination in the process br br i once had the <UNK> of sitting in the company of the great screenwriter playwright <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> this film as one of his favorites in recent years at the time it was still a fairly recent release as a rather prolific screenwriter himself and a brilliant screen <UNK> of his own works as well as great authors such as <UNK> and <UNK> lee he was obviously impressed with tony <UNK> first time effort and possibly equally puzzled by his lack of <UNK> since then if anyone has insights to share on the topic i'd be interested to hear more
<START> a whole lot of the people that have seen this are confused obviously the original title of joe would've put things into better perspective for much of the viewing audience i have personally experienced the condition of often accompanied by a really bad <UNK> after a weekend <UNK> and it is indeed a lot like the movie <UNK> man a dry <UNK> film that <UNK> regret for recent choices and begs for a hot shower br br it is unfortunate that the choice of <UNK> man for the title was by the <UNK> probably the work of some <UNK> hollywood no nothing studio <UNK> who just didn't get it and not joe those of us who have seen the film know that the <UNK> man is actually joe a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> not a true <UNK> man the deception of the folks marketing this film is unforgivable and for that alone i cannot give this film a high rating imagine this when future filmmakers get together to create the true definitive <UNK> man movie and need a title they will be totally screwed and we are all as serious fans of the genre <UNK> for that br br joe could've become a horror movie icon right up there alongside madman black claw <UNK> <UNK> nature boy billy <UNK> the wooden doll the the moon beast bloody bill the <UNK> killer mickey rooney and so forth but he will always be remembered as a sword wielding <UNK> tackle <UNK> skull face tied to the side of a horse <UNK> man wannabe br br that's too bad
<START> having read this story a while ago i was very excited to see the movie i read the book again it is one of my favorite nicholas sparks books what i think what makes the story is the relationships that was the down point for me in the movie because i think the relationships were poorly expressed in the movie i have no idea what the point of changing main characters roles <UNK> and <UNK> characters the movie didn't at all capture john and relationship maybe if you haven't read the book you might like this movie but i thought it was so dull compared to the book i thought <UNK> was a great pick for john but i had a feeling he was going to bring all young adults out to watch it so i think it was more <UNK> towards them the ending cuts the whole point of the book out so i was also unhappy with that i was hoping the movie was more like the <UNK> or a walk to remember and the way they captured the books i do feel like i wasted a friday night out and 10 bucks on a sappy love story not at all the story i was expecting to see
<START> there could be some spoilers ahead but i doubt it i have no idea how the screenplay for this one made it past the <UNK> it's horrible completely unwatchable i hung in there for 45 minutes about half the running time and just couldn't stand it anymore i was an <UNK> wood fan in the <UNK> see the war and i learned to enjoy mandy moore's shifts from <UNK> to serious this year see chasing liberty which is surprisingly entertaining i've seen bits of run lola run so with three leads i liked this should have been fine it wasn't nobody turned in a good performance <UNK> jones was flat for an aspiring writer he had next to no imagination his violent fantasies looked like they were ripped off from a christmas story and his <UNK> ones were huh a cross between boring and <UNK> <UNK> is absolutely unlikable from the first second and i'd only know that she was supposed to be the girl by reading the box speaking of the synopsis whoever they employed for that job made the film sound funny quirky romantic and quite enjoyable whoever that person was he or she should have been employed to rewrite this script by the halfway point i didn't care about any of the characters anymore moore's lisa is an aspiring actress who's <UNK> and a little conniving for no apparent reason at all but her ludicrous period play which is supposed to be funny in presentation is on a par with the rest of the script there is supposedly a happy romantic comedy ending to this turkey given the character material they had to work with i just can't <UNK> it save your money warn your friends don't watch this movie
<START> alien express is one of the worst movies i've bothered to experience br br the plot is predictable the aliens look like rubber <UNK> puppets the effects would have been mediocre in the 70's but are just atrocious by today's standards couldn't they take a shot of a real train instead of using an obvious model br br the acting isn't great but really the dialogue is the worst part it <UNK> its way into your mind don't you die on me not now if you ever manage to suspend disbelief long enough to be absorbed into the movie you'll rapidly be <UNK> painfully back to reality by the aliens the model train or the clichéd dialogue br br the only reason i didn't give this movie a 1 is that it doesn't deserve to be rated so badly that some poor <UNK> might watch it for the pleasure inherent in a truly bad film
<START> it comes as no surprise that was married to <UNK> who would later direct the most harrowing war film ever made <UNK> and see 1985 ' 'the <UNK> 1977 '  final completed film before a <UNK> death  is built in very much the same <UNK> set during wwii the film follows a pair of soviet <UNK> who try to secure food for their starving army while <UNK> the <UNK> german forces the first forty minutes are <UNK> tense as the two men drag themselves though the harsh snow covered landscape the world around them completely <UNK> of life warmth and colour indeed so <UNK> drab is the scenery that it literally took me this long to realise that the film was shot in black and white br br following the capture by german soldiers the film becomes a cold <UNK> on loyalty and morality whereas boris refuses to <UNK> his army even under extreme <UNK> the less <UNK> <UNK> attempts to save himself is he wrong to do so betrayal is <UNK> but the film doesn't immediately <UNK> his actions are <UNK> instead the viewer is forced to consider what their own response might be in such a situation <UNK> as the bible <UNK> <UNK> both men betrayed their allies to the enemy and were forced to watch them executed however whereas <UNK> committed suicide by hanging at least according to <UNK> of matthew finds even that option closed to him  in an excruciatingly taut climax the belt around his neck becomes <UNK> br br 'the draws its emotional power from astonishing pursuit of realism i have no doubt that the two principal actors spent days on end across the snow covered earth on their hands and knees and indeed so convincing is their misery that i actually developed a cold while watching the film seriously i did interestingly the film on this reality on several occasions as <UNK> himself making a <UNK> for freedom and then being <UNK> down by his german <UNK> this device though unusual works well with its biblical allegory is facing a trial of his <UNK> and faced with a new dilemma at every turn he consistently chooses the selfish alternative his own life the only deciding <UNK> at film's end he is still alive but the nightmare of war and guilt <UNK>
<START> this movie is engaging from start to finish with excellent performances a great soundtrack with original music by douglas brown and a well paced script that's full of surprises br br full of new and not so new faces this movie showcases promising talent especially in the case of craig morris who plays the main character eddie monroe morris who also co wrote the script displays a quiet strength combined with a strong emotional performance as he creates a believable character on screen also a poignant delivery by paul who plays uncle benny with a genuine warmth was so convincing that he made me hungry as he lovingly prepared his italian <UNK> br br great new faces great new music and a great new story what more could you ask for this film is highly recommended
<START> a bus drops off a <UNK> man outside a run down standard oil gas station in the middle of nowhere we never learn where the bus came from or why he is on it or who he even is why is he the only passenger is he a prisoner is he the <UNK> man referred to in the title of the movie has he died and gone to heaven or hell like our man we don't get a chance to stop and wonder he is met by a <UNK> of sorts and <UNK> off to a <UNK> city from day one all the choices are made for him an apartment has been rented a job has been found an office assigned in fact his life is not entirely unlike life in the virtual reality of corporate and suburban <UNK> women are heartless dinner parties are a drag office jobs suck but some pieces don't fit the puzzle <UNK> efficient gray clad <UNK> <UNK> the streets are they some sort of <UNK> or the secret police and why are there no children is the story even set in the real world whenever we think we might be getting some answers new mysteries unfold the <UNK> man leaves you half <UNK> that it's over half wanting more i hope they make it into a computer game soon
<START> have you ever wondered what its like to feel free i am sure that each one of us know the meaning of freedom and never seriously think of using it to our advantage <UNK> <UNK> shows the audience what freedom actually means in this film freedom is described in the form of style represented by discovery of india discovers her inner true love when she is in a <UNK> journey with mr <UNK> <UNK> she looks at life differently and portrays freedom that every woman <UNK> in herself when she is in a relationship br br this film is definitely worth a watch and i saw this the first time in <UNK> international film festival and i left the cinema hall with complete satisfaction br br watch it
<START> i have fond memories of watching this visually dazzling film as a child in the late 70s early 80s on tv now <UNK> 9 in ny though a product of the swinging 60s this film has hardly aged the effects are just as <UNK> as 2001 and in some ways superior the model work is flawless with an attractive cast great color photography and set design and an <UNK> score is a winner
<START> i love this movie it has everything bonnie hunt did a fantastic job co writing directing and co starring in this film david duchovny is just plain hot and <UNK> driver is as cute as ever combine all that talent with david allen <UNK> carol <UNK> robert <UNK> richardson and jim belushi you have a oscar worthy movie i'm surprised they didn't get one if you haven't seen it go rent the dvd watch it once then put directors commentary on bonnie hunt is fabulous
<START> i loved this movie oh my gosh this movie <UNK> so hard i found it amongst some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it which btw mentioned the fact that <UNK> john covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about i thought it sounded interesting and i was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film br br what controversy i thought to myself as i put the tape in the player i was curious i get and my expectations were certainly met i loved it i guess it is a really <UNK> kind of movie but it was so sweet and adorable it was a beautiful romance although at times the directing reminded me of the camera work in 'the <UNK> which i thought at the time of seeing it the director must have been on acid with some of the close ups they did br br ok so it wasn't entirely <UNK> for these two kids to run off and live on their own but it could happen in a fantasy br br but the ending just sincerely <UNK> me off i was so mad with how they ended it it sort of leaves you hanging and i suppose they may address what actually happens to them in the sequel but at the same time i'm almost <UNK> to see that since sequels are almost never as good as the first br br i totally recommend this movie to anyone sixteen and over it's an awesome movie awesome
<START> watching this film made me wonder just why was universal putting out films like this they had a wonderful string of films with all the classic horror films the <UNK> of the atomic age brought on an <UNK> of giant creature films <UNK> ants praying with the deadly <UNK> we have a giant praying <UNK> flying around the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and being <UNK> by the armed forces the bug reaches a tunnel in new york where the soldiers eventually destroy it of course this is all made much more watchable by viewing it on <UNK> who thought it was a good idea to start the film out by showing a giant map
<START> says that <UNK> storm is banned in sweden that is not correct instead you can buy the film almost everywhere like in gas stations shopping <UNK> internet of course and so on often to a very low price because this movie is so bad and nobody wants to see it despite all the tricks to keep up the interest the movie only appeals to conspiracy <UNK> <UNK> and other persons living in la la land and those who knows the truth br br working on a museum with the <UNK> disaster as a theme i have meet them all i have heard about every theory that exists like cocaine <UNK> weapon <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nuclear <UNK> red <UNK> aliens the russian the american the <UNK> the swedish and the <UNK> intelligence often in different <UNK> br br some normal persons have asked why we don't show the film a question only asked by them who haven't seen this terrible nonsense movie br br once again <UNK> storm is not banned in sweden it has some entertaining qualities but what a hell is donald sutherland doing in this movie
<START> this is a terrible movie that only gets worse and seems to never end the acting was bad the plot was worse and the special effects seemed to have been created by a <UNK> grade science class dennis weaver is such a great actor and should have never taken such a part my advise don't watch this movie
<START> ok if you would judge the movie to now a days it wouldn't fit in to well if you watched fi now the stage and everything was pretty cheese i agree but weren't all the movies in the 80's like that <UNK> but too the people born in the early to mid 70's or earlier it has a cult status the plane was on approach <UNK> would run up the tower ring the bell and with his accent would yell da plane boss da plane and you would wonder what everybody's wish would be people who are born in the mid 80's or later wouldn't understand the because if you watched it now it don't have a harry potter jurassic park computer animation fx it was just a stage where you probably could even almost see the wire attached to a guy who's wish was too be able to fly but to us during that time it was a fantasy island
<START> two years after ' took off jim <UNK> jerry and david <UNK> cast one of its stars leslie <UNK> in this hilarious television series a glorious take off of old u s detective shows such as <UNK> played frank america's answer to it had the same style of humour as ' clever visual gags in the background <UNK> <UNK> and recurring characters such as johnny the shoe shine boy who seems to know everything about everything guest stars including william shatner were killed off in the opening credits <UNK> was the first u s sitcom since <UNK> to lack a laugh track many have <UNK> the fact that only six episodes were made but i think it was about right the concept could never have <UNK> a full 24 episode run five years later <UNK> made a successful transfer to the big screen when the first of the <UNK> <UNK> trilogy was released jim jerry david and leslie had the last laugh
<START> many horror fans complain that horror has <UNK> progressed in the last twenty years i was inclined to agree with this until the <UNK> of asian horror films a trend which has admittedly grown dull however it has produced some true classics and a tale of two sisters for me at least stands out as an exceptional piece of cinema and perhaps the best horror film in a very long time br br based vaguely on a korean it tells the sad story of two mentally troubled sisters <UNK> with their father and stepmother after experiencing a few problems on their first night back at home they determine to stick together and deny their stepmother access to their close relationship the tension rises and there is the inevitable snap but what happens after this requires more than a pair of eyes as the story takes several twists and the scares become more emotional and quite real by the end you may need a few moments to <UNK> it all and piece it together in your own mind but it is exactly this pairing of horror and mystery that pushes it beyond the <UNK> of these genres and makes it an instant classic one to watch again and again if only to work it all out
<START> how in the name of decency did this film ever get made br br one <UNK> the subtitles merely say <UNK> on every single frame of this truly dismal effort br br horrendous acting <UNK> dialogue and the lack of talent from everyone involved in this nightmare make for an excruciating 90 minutes br br overall impression br br a bunch of <UNK> drama students got lucky with a <UNK> grant and <UNK> to make one of the most painful films ever made br br this makes hammer horror tv shows look like oscar material br br and don't for a second think this falls into the <UNK> bad it's <UNK> category it's not even that bad br br but the fart lighting scene is probably worth another look
<START> i think that new york times film critic elvis mitchell wrote the best one line review of in the mood for love when he said that it is <UNK> with a romantic spirit that's been missing from the cinema forever how true those words are truly romantic films are so rare these days while films that include plenty of sex and nudity which are often portrayed in a <UNK> and gratuitous manner abound so given this cinematic climate wong <UNK> <UNK> latest film feels like a much needed breath of fresh air in the mood for love is about the doomed romance between two neighbors mr <UNK> played by tony <UNK> and mrs chan played by maggie cheung whose <UNK> are having an <UNK> affair as they try not to be like them but after hanging out with each other on lonely nights while their <UNK> are away on business taking care of a sick mother they fall <UNK> in love and must resist the temptation of going too far br br several factors are responsible for making in the mood for love a new classic among romantic <UNK> in the best sense of that term first the specific period of the film i e 1960's hong kong is <UNK> <UNK> to an astonishing degree of detail the clothes including maggie <UNK> lovely dresses the music e g <UNK> king cole and the overall atmosphere of this film evokes a nostalgia for that specific period second christopher <UNK> award winning <UNK> beautiful cinematography creates an environment which not only <UNK> its two main characters but seems to <UNK> with romantic longing in every one of its <UNK> <UNK> composed frame make no mistake about it in the mood for love was the most gorgeous film of 2001 it should also be mentioned that wong <UNK> <UNK> usual hyper <UNK> visual style is understandably toned down for this film although his <UNK> remain just as colorful third there is the haunting score by michael which is accompanied by slow motion sequences of e g chan walking in her elegant dresses chan and <UNK> <UNK> at each other as they pass one another on the stairs and other beautiful scenes which <UNK> themselves into one's memory the main score which makes its <UNK> sound as though they're literally crying is heard eight times throughout various points in the film and it serves to highlight the sadness and the longing which the two main characters feel fourth tony <UNK> and maggie cheung both deliver wonderful performances <UNK> won the prize for best actor at cannes and they manage to generate real chemistry on screen br br the above elements <UNK> and work so nicely together to create a film that feels timeless <UNK> romantic and in a word magical in the mood for love perhaps more than any other film of 2001 reminded me why it is that i love going to the movies and i guess that is about the highest compliment that i can pay to a film br br
<START> what on earth was that my family and i just <UNK> 2 hours of our life for this piece of rubbish there was no plot no tension only a lot of boredom my kids could do better movies with our video camera br br but maybe we just did not get the point of the movie oh wait my mum did she was the only one who liked it for the following reason at least a film with no cars <UNK> if you are looking for a war film with no fighting in it is still interesting and gripping and has a strong anti war message then you should watch the <UNK> br br i give this film 3 out of 10 because it is good enough for an afternoon <UNK> and because i am too nice
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the one off beautifully he never made another film but created a brilliant portrait of homosexual self hatred in this film that is both <UNK> and affecting he <UNK> the screen presenting the <UNK> <UNK> of a man breaking down under the strain of an increasingly meaningless life br br paul <UNK> is an aging queen who's somehow convinced stanley wayne crawford a <UNK> eyed idiot with no sense of the future to follow his star he's a petty thief who's <UNK> hatred has <UNK> recently he's been forced to skip town and move to a <UNK> in miami as a disguise he dresses up like a <UNK> up old blue <UNK> with as much <UNK> sexual torment as the church lady he tells stanley to tell his friends that he lives with his aunt martha paul himself has no friends spends far too much time alone in the house and has to deal with <UNK> <UNK> lifestyle it would be enough to make any man cross the line into homicidal <UNK> br br again <UNK> portrays paul as a tragic figure who has utterly lost any understanding of how to relate to other people nevertheless there is a certain poetry in his anguish which burns slowly over the course of the film he's tragic but also elegant this is ultimately a very sad film it certainly has many hilarious moments but there is such an <UNK> of <UNK> and despair that the humour is bittersweet this film is worth watching for the performance of <UNK> <UNK> he could have really built his career on martha she's quite a gas once you get to know her just make sure you cut your hair and stop your <UNK> around she really hates that
<START> this film is mildly entertaining if one <UNK> to acknowledge its numerous <UNK> of plot and sheer lack of believability bruce willis as the never seems to live up to his reputation as a cunning mastermind of the underworld instead he <UNK> about in broad daylight <UNK> a <UNK> of shoddy <UNK> why this man has never been captured before or even identified is beyond me not once is the audience impressed by his <UNK> or daring considering the price he demands for his services an <UNK> 70 million his methods are decidedly low budget and stupid br br as for those in pursuit of him they are at least as ridiculous in their behavior they show no sense of expertise instead relying on half baked which sends them <UNK> across the country at their <UNK> incredibly these far fetched <UNK> maybe he bought a boat maybe he's in chicago etc etc <UNK> lead them straight to the who yet again escapes their clumsy grasp br br richard gere whose irish accent fades in and out like a distant radio station plays the inexplicable role of an imprisoned convict who is released from jail to work alongside the fbi he actually makes a <UNK> partner if only because his means are as amateurish and inept as his professional pals at one point he actually confronts the infamous but unfortunately the fbi although they trust him enough to leave him out of their sight fail to <UNK> him with a weapon or any means of communication what kind of operation are they running here br br the film also appears overly <UNK> on gruesome violence which is entirely superfluous and provides no suspense whatsoever the supposedly <UNK> acts more like a demented and senseless serial killer <UNK> people for sport and writing on a <UNK> cheek with blood br br the film's action scenes are both predictable and unrealistic and many moments are ruined with melodrama this movie is poorly executed on many levels the one bright spot being the ever consistent sidney <UNK> avoid this movie if you are in the mood to think as you watch it br br
<START> i first saw this movie at least thirty years ago and it remains one of my all time <UNK> it's a classic the intriguing plot great characters suspense and shocking twist ending all set against the backdrop of the gorgeous big <UNK> coast never get old roy <UNK> portrays johnny a captivating character that grows more mysterious as his true identity unfolds the acting is great and believable viewers get caught up in the web that develops between the <UNK> husband <UNK> wife and the <UNK> stranger <UNK> as i have searched for a copy to buy for years i guess tv movies don't get released to video unfortunately great movie see it if you can find it
<START> this movie is a complete and utter waste of time one of the worst films i've ever seen and coming from me that is definitely saying something in fact i wish i could have given it negative stars instead of just rating it as a pathetic one star awful br br when i rented this movie i had an open mind i find the legend of the interesting and i have a <UNK> for cheesy horror flicks but i draw the line at this one br br the acting sucked the lead male gives one of the worst performances ever looking and sounding unnatural as he delivers his poorly written lines the lead female gives a slightly more <UNK> performance but that really doesn't take much br br the well considering how low budget this movie must have been the creature was tolerable it does however look exactly like someone in a mask and body suit the mask is fairly detailed and might look cool in person but not so on screen br br speaking of on screen you'd think they could have at least used a better camera it looks like it was shot with a camcorder for crying out loud not a very good one either br br i don't know what whoever wrote this abomination was thinking the dialog sucks and just i can't describe what i feel about it at least not without getting in trouble with the site br br my advice avoid this at all costs it's just not worth it if it comes on tv and you have nothing else to do or watch then find something else to do or watch read a book listen to music anything just don't subject yourself to this if you do you cannot say you weren't warned and for lord and <UNK> sake don't rent this sucker it is not worth it even if you get the chance to rent it for fifty cents trust me i know
<START> when i was five years old it was my favorite television show i remembered it was on channel 11 at everyday the show's premise was simple with carole and <UNK> as the <UNK> of this children's television show they sang songs and read stories to us as children it was done in a studio with only <UNK> episodes which was re <UNK> over and over i remember sherlock the puppet in the tree the show taught us how to count add <UNK> and the <UNK> for thirty minutes a day now i learned something new with paula and <UNK> i remember those days as pleasant memories and now i hope the children of today can learn to love simpler things like hearing stories <UNK> props riding the <UNK> and talking to puppets the set was ideal and simple but it was carole and <UNK> who made it worth while while i miss my childhood and those days where the most important thing was watching the magic garden life seemed so much simpler and better now i hope the kids today enjoy the show
<START> i went into this film expecting a slasher and while mute witness does take influence from said style of film making this is much more than just your average slash flick there are a number of thrillers that focus on a certain <UNK> <UNK> is more common blind terror wait until dark cat <UNK> <UNK> to name a handful but the <UNK> of having a mute lead in a thriller such as this are well portrayed and actually integral to the plot as the fact that the lead character can't speak is often the reason why she finds herself in dangerous situations that would be easy for anyone else to get out of our mute witness is billy hughes a make up artist working on a horror film production at a studio in <UNK> she finds herself locked in after hours one night and after attempting to phone her sister for help she stumbles upon what at first appears to be the making of an <UNK> sex flick but soon turns out to be a snuff movie she tries to convince the authorities of what she's seen but finds that no one believes her story br br recently hostel made the <UNK> for showing snuff movie making in a foreign country but this film did it first and actually does a better job it's maybe not quite as nasty as eli <UNK> <UNK> but the gore is more effective and since director anthony <UNK> who went on to direct one of my favourite modern thrillers with 'the <UNK> a good sense of humour into the proceedings mute witness is both <UNK> gory and fun to watch the director certainly has a talent for <UNK> suspenseful thrill rides as this one never stands still the plot is put into action quickly and <UNK> constantly introduces plot twists which give a big helping hand to the overall entertainment value of the film the acting isn't bad for a b movie with young performers <UNK> fay <UNK> and <UNK> richards delivering good performances the atmosphere is gritty and the russian locations are suitably <UNK> which helps the film to retain a foreboding atmosphere overall mute witness is a much better film than you might expect it to be the plot flows well and the atmosphere and tension are spot on
<START> me being one was probably having a brain fart at the time for renting it anyone who actually buys it will enjoy using this as a coaster perhaps a <UNK> this is a dvd i actually found up front where the kids could get to it since dvd's don't seem to be in the position to be put in that tell tale back room with all the big box vhs tapes are i find it rather annoying they stuck this up next to a disney film yep going from dinosaur to erotic ghost has shown what we all think of disney right i <UNK> that low just yet there's no acting in here the only thing interesting is the old 1973 movie trailers for ancient erotic films that i'm amazed have escape from being burned to hell br br 1 10 if imdb allowed <UNK> it'd be 0 10
<START> you get a good portion of steven seagal <UNK> <UNK> and some breathless mountain views along with cow boy scenes or <UNK> use parts of any remains of the horse <UNK> you then add a large piece of <UNK> virus or similar attention it must be more lethal and at least <UNK> level 4 wrapped around a fat <UNK> group leader you add one of martial arts and a <UNK> of explosions and <UNK> for the taste add the classic red indian <UNK> for the extra taste serve immediately br br what is the name of the film you get the <UNK> perhaps the worst film of steven seagal i am sure that seagal tried to say something in this film except the usual i am a cook but also an ex seal but his recipe was confusing and the taste was awful
<START> this movie is the best horror movie i have ever seen the acting is terrible and the plot leaves a lot to be desired but the puppet gave me nightmares for weeks seriously if you have little kids don't let them see this of course i am a little biased because of an irrational fear of puppets and <UNK> also a body double cameo by the guy who does mini me <UNK> and some gratuitous nudity a must in any low budget horror movie all other horror movies will forever be judged against this in my book
<START> i don't think i can add much more to what has already been said about this film however i can offer a small <UNK> from seeing st v in the theater in the last dreadful scene as the camera is pulling out from the camping shot and it seems likely that the credits will start rolling at any second the audience seemed to rise in <UNK> normally for a movie like this at least some die hard fans stay to watch right up until the final <UNK> as the people <UNK> out i remember hearing no laughing and cheerful banter only low <UNK> br br i remember reading a movie review in the local paper in which the critic said that it was so bad that only trek fans would like it what an idiot the fans were the ones most apt to tear it apart first br br favorite worst scene target shooting on a voyager space <UNK> through a <UNK> no less space must be a much smaller frontier than we thought
<START> this is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but still i enjoyed it this time charles is not just fighting one or two <UNK> but a whole army of them death wish 3 has a lot great action scenes and i enjoyed it every single second of it director michael winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and jimmy page providing the music with producers <UNK> and <UNK> still doing there thing and charles bronson is still acting good for paul this movie also made it look like that michael try to end the death wish series and i can't blame him and i love the gun that charles uses death wish 3 is one of the great movies of 1985 and can't get any better than this br br i gives this 9 10
<START> this film is the most <UNK> turkish film that i have ever seen probably <UNK> is the first turkish horror film i must say that i were excited while watching the movie because of some reasons the first reason is that the story is impressive i mean that at the end of the film you realised all the details about movie this makes the film attractive and the other reason is that no turkish man made such a movie like that before this shows that turkish film <UNK> itself by time although the first trial to make a horror movie it was really successful i advice all of you not to miss this movie
<START> a great look at the 60s through the eyes of four friends from their student days in 1960 to their reunion 10 years later a <UNK> immigrant in love with the american dream and struggling to cope with the often violent reality a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> son a soldier and the crazy <UNK> girl they all love good direction and a strong cast do justice to steve brilliant script the dialogue isn't as snappy as in breaking away but the themes of growing up and father son conflict are dealt with just as well and there are still a few wonderfully comic moments among the shocks and drama
<START> i find this film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid but i admire the courage to throw away a script turn the camera on and act a fool i find the performances lighting cinematography sound and whatever film school laws <UNK> martin broke funny speaking from a film directors perspective there is times i just want to drop everything and have fun on the set this film looks like fun when other aspiring film directors ask me advice i just tell them to watch any film by <UNK> ray moore they always return a puzzled look asking me why not watch the masters woody allen scorsese lucas <UNK> i laugh and include that you always want to know what not to do in cinematic story telling first
<START> i absolutely loved this movie since i don't want to give much away it's basically about about a mother and a daughter and the life they have together it's very heartwarming story between the struggles they have i also think natalie and susan have perfect chemistry throughout the entire film this is definitely worth seeing two thumbs up way up
<START> radio is possibly one of the best films i have ever seen while at the same time one of the worst it made me laugh in places where you were supposed to cry and made me cringe at moments you were supposed to laugh it lacked any kind of character development which is usually crucial to a sentimental flick that this is some questions why did ed harris character take radio under his wing this was not properly explained and i'm sure their relationship which is the main aspect of the film is the most pointless if ever seen br br who keeps on giving cuba gooding junior work he is a crap actor and should be <UNK> heavily until he takes up another line of work br br as true stories go this is not that interesting p s the reason i said it is one of the best films i have ever seen is because despite it being complete <UNK> i still enjoyed it laughing at the script and most monologues which are truly the work of either am idiot or someone very clever trying to show how easy it is to release a crappy film about a <UNK> who becomes <UNK> favourite joke the fact of the matter is <UNK> character is comedy fodder for the people who watch the football matches
<START> as a native of new orleans i can state that almost everything in this movie from the atrocious <UNK> to the highly creative manipulation of <UNK> city <UNK> is horrible this is another one of those big hollywood movies that decides to stereotype new orleans as 1 a city full of french sounding idiots 2 a city full of people who sound as if they've just returned from <UNK> summer home 3 a city of <UNK> where every day is <UNK> <UNK> 4 a city of deep mystery where almost everyone practices or is a victim of voodoo i admit that maybe we are a city of <UNK> although every day is not <UNK> <UNK> the big easy is one of the worst films about new orleans i wouldn't recommend it to anybody
<START> i can't believe how dumb this movie truly is the storyline written by <UNK> <UNK> mother is what ruins the movie to the extreme it is straight out dull absurd and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever br br this movie <UNK> so bad for most of it especially at the beginning the story just kept going on and on about their everyday <UNK> with each other often times seeming like a <UNK> in this movie you have an annoying <UNK> couple the poet and his wife who are complete total <UNK> from the start the wife sleeps around with other men to make ends meet while the poet is a <UNK> who <UNK> on cheap <UNK> and women the wife who too quickly becomes friends with his former childhood lover played by <UNK> suddenly gets jealous knowing full well that the two were lovers since they were kids something doesn't seem right here i mean come on get with the program lady you expect br br bottom line is former lovers meet again with new wife <UNK> it then gets jealous then former woman lover gets married and her husband gets jealous <UNK> the crazy drunk <UNK> home crazy husband calls police and they end up going to court for the man's attempted murder charges that's it summed up in a nutshell br br this movie had it's moments such as the quality and good acting by cillian murphy but other than that i cannot believe i watched it i complained about it during the movie and some family members watching it with me fell asleep i decided to give it a chance and i should have stuck to my first instincts
<START> if this film was just outrageously poor would be fine the problem is many take it seriously to make it short a few points br br there is no story no focus no lead whatsoever and all the questions raised fail to find an answer overall the film is extremely repetitive and boring i have been in war torn african countries several times and found all the lingering on local misery and <UNK> very painful to watch but still having no sense br br questions raised are pure manipulation and the truth is that they are no questions but statements br br i am no doc filmmaker but what's the point in raising for example the question of weapon <UNK> if the only element brought to the audience is a local <UNK> statement the director doesn't even bother showing us at least a sequence where he would be waiting near the airport trying to spot heavily loaded <UNK> leaving the area right after a plane landed br br the story of the fish takes up less than 5 <UNK> and is only supported by a sequence where the director films a documentary shown during a local <UNK> did this guy do any work at all br br <UNK> poverty is shown all the time in endless sequences but where's the point one can go almost anywhere in africa with a hand <UNK> and shoot the same images unfortunately where's the big news br br filming the prostitutes watching and crying over images of their <UNK> friend and fellow prostitute is worth the worst emotional <UNK> one can see these days on <UNK> and real tv br br the parallel drawn between the <UNK> devastating the country with over two million starving and the of fish is absolutely pointless <UNK> and makes no sense but to manipulate viewers in typically anti <UNK> and anti western feelings br br there is an interesting debate in france after an academic published a very detailed comment on the film which brought number of <UNK> working in africa for decades to investigate a bit further about several details it turns out that br br the fish waste shown <UNK> in the sun and <UNK> by some local people is not at all meant to be eaten by human beings but is <UNK> to be <UNK> for reasonably good money for animal feeding purposes i think i am not the only one having had the impression that the director suggested the exact opposite br br arm <UNK> is a reality but there again where's the big news but not the way this film explains the issue if the empty planes landing in do participate in <UNK> they actually <UNK> their <UNK> in a different location in africa then go to to pick up fish in order not to make the trip back empty meaning that they do actually land empty in br br people do eat fish <UNK> contrary to what the film suggest around 40 60 of what is taken out of the lake and thousands of people make their living with it good for them it's private business of that kind that will one day take african countries out of poverty and not western <UNK> and endless foreign assistance br br i cannot tell how shocked i am seeing the success of this film
<START> this lasted several years despite the late hour it was on br br like a lot of 80's crime dramas it looked cold both physically and <UNK> this isn't a bad thing though and the obviously low budget actually worked in it's favor gritty during a time when <UNK> was in br br allan <UNK> <UNK> segments as the news writer gave it a slight edge br br the only actors i remembered were scott <UNK> and tony <UNK> the cast of barely <UNK> was a good thing because one could see the group as a whole and not as a bunch of people supporting a <UNK> ' and yes that's a young clark johnson homicide in a recurring spot br br i hope a dvd release is in the future someone out there wanna get on that
<START> irwin allen's first venture into all star spectacle was one all star disaster the story of mankind contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time virginia <UNK> as the blond <UNK> dennis hopper chewing the scenery with <UNK> peter lorre <UNK> on the scenery for weeks as <UNK> marie wilson as marie <UNK> as a <UNK> marilyn monroe that's just some of them br br the film also is known for being the last film which featured all three of the marx brothers though they all have different roles <UNK> plays a monk who is christopher <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the indians out of manhattan island as peter and most astonishing of all <UNK> marx as sir <UNK> <UNK> who discovers gravity when an apple him on the bean br br holding all these portrayals together is a story where mankind itself is being judged a super h bomb is about to be discovered and let loose will do in the world's population it's judgement day a coming br br but mankind has its <UNK> and <UNK> speaking for the <UNK> is old scratch who's been bringing the worst out in man for centuries in the form of vincent price but man has his good side as well and who better than ronald colman to demonstrate man at his most <UNK> best colman and price <UNK> their case before the judge played by cedric <UNK> br br in those three individuals you have some of the finest speaking voices the english language ever knew when the film is on them as they each bring out the <UNK> for their case it's a pleasure to listen to then when the focus is on the individual stories you want to scream in agony br br what was irwin allen driving at i'm still trying to figure it out was he deliberately camping it up with some of these casting decisions if it was satire it just doesn't get off the ground br br this was ronald <UNK> farewell film and while it's hardly something i'd like to go out on i can't think of any man who could have stated the case for civilization any better br br so when you see the story of mankind fast forward through some of the <UNK> and treasure every moment the <UNK> are before the judge
<START> i saw this film because did the score a real disappointment annoying trendy scenes with urban <UNK> and their cliche hip <UNK> cheesy stereotypical mexican border culture <UNK> grandfather with the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in her <UNK> style restaurant a few laughs but <UNK> than <UNK> and sorely lacking in vision and basic filmmaking talent
<START> i'm a sucker for mob <UNK> movies so i rented this movie this movie is a complete train wreck with all the big name actors in this film i can not believe how bad it was it was so bad that i began laughing hysterically towards the end of the film the actor better known as <UNK> or the big dude from the ice cube movie friday does an incredible overacting job throughout the film first thing i told blockbuster when i returned the film was to remove this garbage from their shelves do not rent this movie unless you want to waste two hours of your life if they come out with a sequel i wonder if it will be twice as bad as the first i will be more <UNK> when renting so called movies
<START> if this film is an accurate display of j acting skills i think he made a big mistake leaving television hasn't he watched any films starring david caruso especially cold around the heart along the lines of acting ability what about mary louise she has done much much better yes it is a terrible script <UNK> edited and totally lacking in continuity but skilled actors can and have overcome similar obstacles a very big disappointment
<START> for me this wonderful <UNK> of a film bears repeated <UNK> viewings its about the <UNK> lives of three very different people holly hunter is the obsessive <UNK> producer albert plays the but brilliant journalist william hurt is the <UNK> but dumb new kid on the block news anchor br br the classical love triangle emerges with the stunningly witty and self <UNK> in love with hunter but she of course is attracted to hurt br br this film works on many levels at the very least it is a brilliant comedy with the one liners flying so thick and fast that each viewing bears a new <UNK> of ones that you may have missed last time its also a film about attraction and <UNK> romance br br but perhaps most importantly the film <UNK> the modern obsession with physical appearance and its ultimate triumph over intellect as a <UNK> human <UNK> this is <UNK> by the <UNK> career success of the hurt character in contrast to relative decline br br despite being fifteen years old the film has some relevant messages about modern news values and the continuing decline in <UNK> standards br br this film is a classic in every sense and it is difficult to understand why it has been so neglected
<START> in 1984 the karate kid had some charm to it even if it was little more than a poor man's rocky alas producer jerry failed to realize it was best to leave the story at the point where it had ended and convinced ralph <UNK> and pat <UNK> to make an extra effort to turn the film into a trilogy part iii was the definitive low in the franchise yet someone must have thought the series still had some potential what other explanation could there possibly be for the existence of the next karate kid br br wait a minute next yep <UNK> gone at least he was smart enough to stop eventually and his replacement is <UNK> <UNK> playing a troubled teenager what else named julie pierce now the girl has family issues she also gets in trouble at school said school has a sadistic gym teacher michael <UNK> as it turns out though one of his students is actually a nice guy and julie falls for him this gets her in bigger trouble than before of course lucky for her she is currently living with mr <UNK> <UNK> an old friend of her grandfather who happens to know how to get back at the bad guys br br all those factors ad up to seven clichés and that's just a generic plot summary imagine what the detailed scenes must be like from beginning to end the next karate kid is a tired flat and dull marathon of idiotic lines and set ups <UNK> does thankfully have the likes of boys don't cry and million dollar baby to redeem this disaster but why did <UNK> accept to come back he may have received an oscar nomination for the first movie and was quite enjoyable in the sequels but has nothing to speak for him here even the revival of the wax on wax off gag is <UNK> as for <UNK> he is slightly better than martin <UNK> and thomas ian griffith in part iii but that's hardly a stretch br br so is this picture really that awful not exactly there is one sequence that manages to achieve a weird beauty but when the best bit in the whole film involves a group of asian monks dancing as they hear pop music for the first time in their lives it doesn't qualify as a recommendation to see the rest
<START> the show itself basically reflects the typical nature of the average youth <UNK> and picking up chicks is the common weekend goal at the <UNK> people <UNK> upon the show due to its perverted idea of picking up girls using technique and <UNK> characterization but truth be told practically every young guy is out doing it at the club overall the show really appeals to the younger population as we like to see the outcome of a <UNK> performance at the club as the show offers a comical approach made possible by the judging <UNK> br br 10 10 a cool fun and thrilling series that allows the audience to really interact good job boys
<START> <UNK> martin sheen and kathy bates are superb in this portrayal of a vietnam vet home from the war but still haunted by it bates plays a clueless mother who just wants the family to be a family sheen is terrific as the father who tries to understand what his son is going through but is too wrapped up in his principles to really empathize the setting is <UNK> day and the relatives are coming for dinner <UNK> who plays the returning vet wants no part of family tradition and insists on wearing his combat <UNK> to dinner explaining this is what i wore last <UNK> the <UNK> and family arguments are priceless particularly the <UNK> <UNK> crisis but the ending is both gripping and terrifying it has to be seen to be appreciated br br overall one of the best movies i've ever seen
<START> this mostly routine fact based tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole this is the story of a highly trained military man unhappy with his wife and children <UNK> his demise and runs off with the other woman to support her in the manner in which she is <UNK> he <UNK> banks predictable but not a bad watch
<START> i loved this film because of the dialog and superb acting by <UNK> and <UNK> however i never knew until now watching a bette david marathon on <UNK> that this film is a remake of a 1943 bette davis classic called old <UNK> bette co stars with <UNK> hopkins who she was in a terrible <UNK> with during the making of the movie because bette had had an affair with husband who directed her in a film before they made old <UNK> br br anyway both are worth every minute spent watching i highly recommend this film if you like a lot of dialog and drama it's a study in the psychology of women and their relationships with each other in my opinion
<START> i went in expecting not much from human traffic and came out really pleased the film is well made and acted and very <UNK> shot it has so much going for it it's a film i really recommend especially to those who liked <UNK> or for those who like to argue the debate in the drugs and the media <UNK> tremendous fun
<START> this movie starts out as if it were a comedy it almost appears that the actors are reading off of cue cards especially in the airport sequence william smith plays the role of a hunter who is quite twisted and deranged smith seems to always play villains such as in the ultimate warrior 1975 and the <UNK> kid 1979 to name a few although in this film the villainous role seems laughable this is one of those films where senseless things take place only to fill up screen time such as the girl chasing sequence at the beginning and the long silly motorcycle race i give this film 1 10 i would have liked to see this film on mystery science theatre it would have been hilarious
<START> tom <UNK> unforgettable oz is hands down one of the greatest television series ever created brilliantly written acted and directed it is as close to perfection in any art form film television literature music as it gets haunting in it's extreme brutality it creates a prison world filled with diverse characters that range from compassionate to flat out terrifying it is a show that no matter how brutal it is get through one cannot take its eyes off of the combination of professional trained theater actors with film and television actors allows for a range of diverse and all original performances br br and while the show is universally praised and has had a loyal fan base one cannot feel that it was under appreciated during it's television run because of other hbo dramas such as the sopranos sex and the city and six feet under and while all those shows are fine and borderline masterpieces in their right many people forget that it was oz that was <UNK> first entry into one hour television drama series it was a brave <UNK> first entry and with it hbo hit a grand slam with it this is as good as it gets
<START> an aging roger moore is back yet again as bond this time trying to find out why agent was killed and why he had a <UNK> of a egg with him and where it came from he ends up in new <UNK> india then in east germany after finding out about a russian general trying to <UNK> a nuclear bomb at a circus hoping <UNK> will push for complete <UNK> so he can take control of western europe then the rest of the world br br despite the way it sounds this is really more of a romance i think between bond and <UNK> than an action movie and <UNK> but still somewhat fun but there are way too many attempts at humour in this one at times it seems like it was intended to be a comedy also timothy dalton would have been better than roger moore in this so there wouldn't have been so much of an age difference between bond and <UNK> br br useless trivia the small plane used by bond in the pre credits sequence is now hanging up in a <UNK> and <UNK> restaurant in <UNK> area florida usa br br 1 2 out of
<START> when <UNK> decides to let her cats <UNK> her it spells trouble the <UNK> butler edgar who is next in line to <UNK> decides to get rid of the cats thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible an adventure that lets them meet the charming but not altogether <UNK> cat he helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end br br the force of this movie is in its humor and music edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious <UNK> one of the best scene contains him being chased by the two dogs <UNK> and <UNK> the score is great and like in the jungle book you have scenes that is almost musical in the sense that the story doesn't progress and the focus is to let the protagonists express themselves via dance and of course we like that the score is quite <UNK> br br and of course it's not only me but also my children who love this one br br regards simon
<START> a real hoot unintentionally sidney character is so sweet and lovable you want to <UNK> him nothing about this movie rings true and it's boring to boot
<START> i absolutely loved this film so much emotion in such a small amount of time i loved the beginning and how it completely throws you off guard i love the story and the deer being brought in i know that when i think of deer i think of innocence and <UNK> also in <UNK> <UNK> 2 in the bible it says as the deer pants for the water brooks so pants my soul for you o god which could even connect the last moment when the woman says it will be okay as if she knows she's going with god perhaps i am thinking way to much into it but sometimes it is interesting to see what goes on through <UNK> minds thank you for sharing this masterpiece with viewers everywhere i live in texas and i had it playing on cable i immediately got onto the computer to find out more about this film and this amazing director i really liked the music that was used in the background music can sometimes make or break a film it definitely set the mood perfectly very nice choice br br thanks again br br <UNK>
<START> this is surely british humour at its best it tends to grow on you the first time i watched it i couldn't quite figure out what it was all about but now i can watch the episodes over and over again and enjoy them every time
<START> i watched the beginning twice could not make sense of it and it bothered me for the whole movie br br so work this out with me wayne the good guy jumps on the <UNK> <UNK> the drivers steals the money and takes off br br <UNK> one driver is then killed and the other wounded by the bad guys thanks to wayne who <UNK> them and then watched it happen br br then wayne drops the money in the dirt <UNK> the girl rides into town chuckles it up with <UNK> too bad about the dead guy i guess and then later says he found the money back at the scene and everyone's okay with that br br and he's the good guy and i'm pretty sure there weren't small hand held <UNK> at the time and bell did his first phone <UNK> in <UNK> were they in houses then am i thinking too hard about this one normally i'm happy to suspend judgment to enjoy a movie but this one bothered me and that's a sign the move didn't really work for me
<START> nothing short of magnificent photography cinematography in this film the fact that you keep seeking and hoping for more flying sequences tells you that they have just enough the acting is fantastic the stories are <UNK> woven together and the dogs are splendid br br a must rent view or see br br don't be afraid of subtitles br br its worth a little <UNK> therapy br br 10 10 br br
<START> one of the best war films i have ever seen if not the best it is very hard to talk about such films as it is very difficult to point at any film mistake made the problem is as it looks too real and by that drags you in to the ruins of <UNK> and make you suffer for both sides this is for the reason that this film unlike the most of hollywood films doesn't <UNK> the war or the <UNK> of the main characters instead of that the film makes them heroes only for being human and by that is anti war as much as the reason can offer extremely convincing war scenes and so impressive acting most of the scenes look like isolated theater pieces also german army is played by germans which is so convincing as well the film is produced and realized by germans where you can see their love for details to perfection this is the reason why <UNK> is one of the films i can watch million times and never feel dull i watched the film with my father who fought in wwii and the first thing he said was this is like real this is how the war against germans looked like this is the place you can see how did it look to be a soldier in the worst nightmare of <UNK> in human history and turning point of wwii <UNK>
<START> <UNK> for an evening of pleasure and terror <UNK> cheap special effects cheesy lines yep its the original 1978 movie starting geoffrey land as peter <UNK> and jill <UNK> as <UNK> martin and directed by al <UNK> br br the movie is about an evil ancient spirit that possesses a nurse at a hospital then she starts killing doctors one by one the acting was okay but some of the acting was robotic the storyline was good but the sex scenes were just thrown in there probably to get more views the directing was bad and the special effects looked like a drawing the effects didn't fool anybody the death scenes were pretty good but the director mixed too many things in there that didn't make any sense like the sex scenes the nudity the football player and many more br br overall its a good movie but not the best br br 7 out of 10
<START> the film opens with the director talking to the camera and saying he is going to show a story about street kids whose families live in poverty and must steal and kill to survive in fact the main character <UNK> was played by an actual street kid only 11 years old what follows was one of the most brutal depressing and horrifying film i've even seen i saw it about 17 years ago on a double bill with black <UNK> and have never forgotten it i don't think i ever want to see it again it was just too much br br spoiler ahead the scene which will not leave me is when <UNK> meets a prostitute who has to <UNK> her own <UNK> you don't see her do it but you get a quick glance at what she got out it's almost 20 years later and just <UNK> that scene <UNK> me spoiler end br br the movie gets more brutal as it goes along and ends the only way it can what's all the more harrowing is stories like this really did happen in brazil in 1981 and are still happening today br br a harrowing brutal film but it should be seen if you can handle it i'm surprised this got an r rating i've seen x rated film that are less graphic a 10
<START> this film would be considered controversial today but is still very funny the racial stereotyping is done from the view of humor not hate this film <UNK> off shows how corrupt politicians already were in the early 1930's this film proves it started before the 1970's beyond when it has <UNK> in the united states lloyd is still in his typical genre here even though his character was raised in china br br the meaning of a <UNK> <UNK> in this instance is a person who is running for political office but is being used by the established political machine to advance their agenda in other words they think this guy lloyd is harmless when he runs for office then when he gets elected he surprises them br br this same theme is used later in james <UNK> film mr smith goes to washington <UNK> is more famous has a stronger message this film is more clever subtle which are harold <UNK> br br there is still the heart of romantic comedy hidden with the <UNK> of the movie but today's mainstream audiences would still appreciate the political humor the ending is absolutely priceless i wish someone could beat today's political system in this way i was surprised how much i enjoyed this film find myself wishing harold had done more like it during the 1930's br br at least we have this one i think the person who is <UNK> most in the movie is fictional <UNK> <UNK> i always thought was the wise one but this one makes me believe the wisdom of china was not limited to him is a vast field of comedy lloyd <UNK> in this movie
<START> peter o'toole gives a brilliant performance in this movie i have seen the original version with robert and i much prefer peter <UNK> performance and the movie in general even though it is a musical i've really never seen anything that mr o'toole is in that i don't like he is a brilliant actor multi talented giving performances full of passion and depth clark also gave a surprisingly good performance and was perfect for the part it is an all around heartwarming movie full of <UNK> and bittersweet fun i will always remember in <UNK> phrase the line where mr <UNK> regrets he has never given her children and she replies of course you have hundreds of them all boys thank you for the opportunity to vote for this movie and to voice my opinion
<START> to start out with the script is <UNK> and inane the characters are shallow and formulaic the plot has <UNK> <UNK> and non <UNK> direction is terrible these actors could do better on their own the jokes and <UNK> fall flat the shoot out scenes are clumsy and incredible baldwin directs himself as the wise courageous hero but spends most of his time in power struggles with women particularly with the <UNK> in their tunnel team who is always asking for and denying <UNK> the conductor suffer from absurd incompetence being unable to effectively employ a pistol he has come by <UNK> a <UNK> man with guns stalks through a <UNK> car startling people the next time we see them they are going about their business sitting in their seats talking eating reading <UNK> in the new york <UNK> folks sometimes come on the train to do some musical or dramatic number maybe that's what they thought the happening was
<START> this movie makes you wish imdb would let you vote a zero one of the two movies i've ever walked out of it's very hard to think of a worse movie with such big name actors well <UNK> almost takes it but not quite
<START> <UNK> was a great series it was the first thing i saw <UNK> in and it is too bad copies aren't available a similar situation exists for glory enough for all a british series from around the same time about the discovery of i would pay a good price for both of these on dvd is it really so difficult to get <UNK> on a dvd that is able to be played in the us another very enjoyable series again from about the same time was danger <UNK> a series about <UNK> <UNK> bombs hence the name that one you can get from your local library br br pete
<START> this is a <UNK> biography of a star of the black and white <UNK> shows a certain <UNK> boy johnson whether this person ever really existed i don't know but considering the cast lists a certain lee white and <UNK> <UNK> playing said character as well i assume the man did exist and that this is a white washed <UNK> the pun version of his career the plot such as it is follows <UNK> boy from career heights to depression at the death of his wife in <UNK> his <UNK> of the child to friends and his return at his daughter's <UNK> birthday and stage debut for <UNK> another forgotten man benny fields plays <UNK> boy the man has a lovely <UNK> voice but no acting talent whatsoever and is a boring <UNK> on screen <UNK> george <UNK> tries her best to <UNK> the works to no <UNK> judy clark does the best <UNK> of betty <UNK> i've ever seen although i believe she thought she was being herself the <UNK> <UNK> with many musical numbers for its short running time of 70 minutes earned a deserved oscar <UNK> worth a look
<START> i must admit i liked this movie and didnt find it all <UNK> it could be subtitled three ways of looking at <UNK> tyler three different men become obsessed with the same woman and tell their stories to very different characters one man john goodman tells his story to a priest the very funny richard <UNK> for <UNK> the <UNK> tyler character is an <UNK> saint the second coming of his wife <UNK> for paul character who story to a shrink a fine understated performance by the great <UNK> mcintire the <UNK> tyler character is object of kinky sexual fantasy finally matt rather <UNK> tells his side of the story to a sleazy hit man played by micheal douglas all three of these <UNK> of obsession are told simultaneously and all are amusing the film ends in a <UNK> funny climax that i wont give away
<START> although normally my <UNK> is not for romantic dramas seeing this film left me a little short br br it had promise the characters and relationships could have been explored much deeper than they did yet the story seemed not to understand the direction it wanted to take br br the and parallels within the story especially the three generations of women in the family had a lot of potential but somehow didn't fully <UNK> itself it could have made the film much easier to relate to and <UNK> to which is the aim of any film about lost love and life <UNK> br br imho i think the film suffered from a lack of direction in the writing although harry <UNK> and sandra <UNK> did try <UNK> to breath a little life into otherwise flat character <UNK> br br it's not that this is a bad film some parts leave you understanding the reasons for various plot developments its just that this film is <UNK> and a little flat overall
<START> my mom my cousins and i are pretty big jane austen fans we know all the words to the 1995 pride and prejudice masterpiece and have watched gwyneth <UNK> emma an embarrassing number of times i've read all the books and i've even sat through sense and sensibility and <UNK> a few times so my mom and i thought it would be nice to see <UNK> <UNK> on film br br bad idea this is just about the worst movie i've ever seen it's even worse than the 1998 version of alice through the looking glass or the 1939 nancy drew movie i bought at wal mart for 1 my previous worst movies the first thing wrong which you notice in the opening scene is that the heroine catherine has a gruesome and weird imagination inspired by trashy novels that a jane austen heroine would never touch throughout the novel she has dreams day and night in which she is carried off by some hideous man with a <UNK> wig dragged across a field headed for god knows what all and suddenly rescued by a dashing guy on a white horse br br the second thing any viewer of the movie will instantly notice is the high pitched <UNK> and <UNK> music that is supposed to be the soundtrack no <UNK> classical music or english country dances here it is also evident almost at first glance that the actress for lack of a better word chosen to play catherine is completely off first she is rather unattractive and is rendered even more so by her un behavior her looks and movements are just wacky plus they're completely affected and unbelievable br br this sad lack of acting skills affects pretty much all of the actors in the film not even mr the supposed dashing young <UNK> is decent br br as more and more characters are introduced a strange taste in costumes on the part of the filmmakers becomes evident huge marie <UNK> style clash with the for the most part correctly <UNK> empire <UNK> a french woman apparently a friend of general is made up all in black as some sort of ancient <UNK> nightmare she bears a striking similarity to michael jackson in a black dress her appearance is made even <UNK> by a huge half moon beauty mark on her cheek i also had to wonder about the historical accuracy of the bright red <UNK> that almost all of the women were wearing br br another <UNK> that kept my mom and i howling with laughter for about ten minutes was the bathing scene the first thing we noticed was that men and women were bathing in a big <UNK> together probably not very likely in the early <UNK> then we saw that all the women seemed to be wearing large china or plastic <UNK> worn around their <UNK> with strings the <UNK> <UNK> on the water containing some mysterious pieces of something we guessed it was soap then <UNK> <UNK> then finally when the mystery substance began disappearing between shots we <UNK> it was food but i'm still not sure br br and that's not even half of what's wrong with <UNK> <UNK> my warning to anyone who is considering renting this movie stay your hand and if anyone is considering buying it well i don't even know what to say to that br br you'd think that when the actors and others making this film got about 1 4 of the way through they'd realize what a monster they were creating and stop unfortunately they didn't and <UNK> <UNK> was let out into the world
<START> this is a gem of a film slapstick violence a plenty simon pegg and green <UNK> br br a suspicious looking power plant and an <UNK> <UNK> add to this br br if you haven't seen this i can highly recommend it maybe not quite as good as bottom but not far short br br if you have never seen a man <UNK> by the nose on two <UNK> then what are you waiting for buy this film br br i didn't even see the twist at the end coming when it turns out that ritchie and eddie are both ghosts br br <UNK> 1 boiled egg
<START> this is the most pitiful excuse for a comedy show i've ever seen i'm <UNK> that this guy was given his own show it <UNK> of complete and utter desperation on the part of comedy central trying to fill the void left by the talented and <UNK> dave <UNK> he's a tip from <UNK> bag of comedy gold is a punchline not funny need to give it that extra push into hilarity f ing yell it at the top of your <UNK> simple no and as an added bonus finish half your jokes with then you're re <UNK> or duh du oh man so funny hilarious does the laughter ever stop br br to illustrate my point in a more cerebral way i'll <UNK> an example <UNK> jokes about how retarded it is to <UNK> new orleans because it's so close to the water genius the line of distinction between a great comedian and a hack has never been drawn so clearly while a good comedian would find hidden humor in the tragedy finding subtle ways of <UNK> a joke into something that we can all laugh at and take <UNK> in ned goes for the obvious move the city great wait is that funny ned doesn't have the intellectual capacity to find the deepest meaning of things the <UNK> didn't <UNK> the city ned the <UNK> project was <UNK> and in serious need of federal dollars and behold they broke i guess that's god's way of telling us we shouldn't be there after all he's got a seat in <UNK> what a fool br br <UNK> was a master of turning a tired racial comedic spin on its head he was <UNK> at it and at all points we were laughing with him while <UNK> talks about black people not being able to swim yawn <UNK> took it 300 <UNK> further with the black and blind white you don't have to be <UNK> to be edgy you have to be original br br <UNK> and his <UNK> of fans are like that <UNK> gay dude who laughs all too <UNK> at gay jokes thinking it somehow masks his own <UNK> except of course with ned he's laughing all too <UNK> at the <UNK> du du
<START> i have seen all the film interpretations of hamlet from sir lawrence olivier to mel gibson gasp derek <UNK> captures the true essence of the character from the beginning to the brutal climax superb acting all around this one should not be missed
<START> man the <UNK> really were an horrible decade for movies the movies are lacking in a good style and also the storytelling is often lacking br br this <UNK> entry into the long running halloween series is certainly a bad one you just never really get into the story because it isn't a very well constructed and build up movie br br it's simply a poorly done film that also suffers from its imagine less writing and non compelling characters that are in it dr <UNK> seems to be in it just for the sake of being in it it's a real shame that this had to be donald <UNK> last film role it's nice and also sort of <UNK> that his last role is in an halloween movie but he definitely deserved to be in a better one br br there is never a sense of real danger in the movie and the character of michael myers just never comes across as threatening or scary perhaps it's because he's featured too <UNK> throughout the movie from pretty early on already he does his usual stuff again but without too much class or originality also the attempts to <UNK> <UNK> past don't really work out for the main reason that it just doesn't get explained very well it's obvious that the script went through various re writes before and also very possibly during filming several scenes even got re shot or added after the first cut turned out to be far from pleasing br br the movie more often looks and feels like a made for tv one this is also due to the lack of some real good gore as an horror movie it really is lacking in basically everything to make this a good or even original one to watch br br so far the worst out of the series br br 3 10
<START> a picture starring danny <UNK> and billy crystal they are both famous actors and in this charming comedy <UNK> them trying to murder each other's pet <UNK> billy <UNK> pet <UNK> being his ex wife who stole his book and put her name on it and danny <UNK> pet <UNK> being his <UNK> mother billy crystal is an author and a teacher apparently and danny <UNK> is one of his students this comedy classic is very entertaining and for all ages br br danny <UNK> seems to act like a child in this movie because of his evil mother who keeps putting him down all the time she says things like you have no friends and when billy crystal fell down she said <UNK> him before he stinks up the basement she puts down danny also by calling him <UNK> ass and other things just to make him angry
<START> <UNK> tyler <UNK> tyler <UNK> tyler yeah it's hard to keep your mind off this <UNK> beauty giving an <UNK> picture perfect performance as she simply has <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> night at is a <UNK> quirky and raunchy black comedy with old fashion shades tied in to its familiar but <UNK> crafted and chaotic narrative which has three men <UNK> after the one women and she's <UNK> it to her advantage when you see tyler no wonder why they are <UNK> and would do that's anything to see <UNK> happy and living <UNK> dreams just like tyler there's something rather <UNK> about this feature in that we see the likes of matt dillon john goodman paul reiser who's great and especially michael douglas who plays the hired assassin with cool ease but a questionable <UNK> really having a good time with their roles the <UNK> plot opens up with the main three characters dillon goodman and reiser telling their story of how they came to encounter this divine presence and the eventual affects that she's having on them to lead to an insane climax there's an unpredictable chain of events ranging from <UNK> to sensual where everything would virtually tie in together with a certain ironic <UNK> twist of fate for the characters that see them leaving their reserved comfort zone to fulfill this girl howard direction is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> quick fire gags and <UNK> fun if complicated situations one of the best under the radar comedies in the last decade which will have you under <UNK> thumb
<START> michelle pfeiffer and matthew <UNK> are a joy to watch in this screwball comedy alec baldwin who was an up and coming star when the film was made is a hoot dean <UNK> in a <UNK> of john is hysterical but <UNK> <UNK> as the paranoid and over the top connie steals the movie br br jonathan <UNK> previously known for wacky comedies like something wild and <UNK> and howard proves once again that he is a genius i was not surprised at all when he went on to win the oscar for directing silence of the <UNK> the performances he evokes from his actors in married are inspired and the audience is taken along for a wild and <UNK> ride br br one of the <UNK> most endearing films of the 80's it stands head and shoulders above many of the <UNK> of its era
<START> you've got to watch this movie it is so bad it actually is great br br you've got your crazy but <UNK> captain who of course is having an affair with his worn out used to be gorgeous and of course the mid air <UNK> occurs when the <UNK> enemy and along for the ride to got your ex vietnam vet who is can't handle the pressure of another mid air <UNK> and crash landing then you've got your old crazy army air <UNK> buddy who is flying the chase plane and trying to well i can't tell you what he's trying to do the plane keeps going up up and well and then you've got your greedy and <UNK> corporate engineer and then you've got your ice station <UNK> cold and then lucky saves the bad guy from so they can land the plane and it doesn't end it just goes on and on you've got to watch this it's great you've got to be kidding did they actually show this on commercial television and how it was ever shown on cable
<START> jackie chan movies are typical examples of how offer is bigger than demand well to be honest which demand in this one jackie chan is whatever his name is in this one i doubt if he even knows and he is some kind of race car driver well he drives 10 miles an hour and then the footage is <UNK> up that way i can do all the stunts myself as well during the great finale in which jackie chan wants to arrest the bad guy by beating him in a race we finally get to see how shoddy this production really is chan's fighting especially in the casino scene is decent but when we're talking about special effects dear lord and must everyone crash in this race that's just stupid and here it's really not safe for the drivers there's not even a <UNK> wall in the neighborhood and don't get me started on what kind of awful story this has i mean it's <UNK> it was probably written at gun point by eight year olds but still what a mess i like chan as much as the next guy perhaps more since i saw rush hour but his <UNK> retarded cousin really needs to pick his projects better
<START> this is what they came up with for prop comedian <UNK> first feature film br br a stupid <UNK> <UNK> dude <UNK> an r d enterprise from an old <UNK> jack warden things go less than <UNK> but get much worse when the company is threatened with a hostile <UNK> attempt by corrupt corporate <UNK> the most implausible thing about this movie is that smart girl <UNK> <UNK> smith would find this red headed step child fascinating in the least but then he just inherited millions <UNK> moments include comic larry miller drinking sweat from a plastic cup br br funny comedy try un funny toilet humor and that's exactly where this belongs in the toilet <UNK> twice
<START> i managed to see the mtv premiere of this movie last night and i needed to tell everyone that this movie brought the thunder obviously this movie will be most enjoyed by fans of the d as it has plenty of in jokes for those that have seen the hbo series and has more than enough d for newer fans and the mass of soon to be <UNK> the music really shines with the new songs which is much better than it sounds master possibly the 3rd best song in the world and dude i totally miss you there are a load of excellent scenes the car chase the rock off the meeting and cameos including dave as satan i really could go on for hours but i don't want to give the movie away go see it you won't be disappointed
<START> i chose this movie really for my husband who works in radio <UNK> i thought that it would be more of a movie that he would enjoy and relate too though it was from the eighties so it was a little dated this movie really draws you in at times you just want to <UNK> the host barry at times you just want to send some of the <UNK> who call in to a true concentration camp at times you really feel sorry for barry because he has truly gotten too big for his <UNK> if you know what i mean it was on the drama channel on <UNK> so i am thinking this is a true story if you truly love dramas you will love this even if you don't know all the ins and outs of the <UNK> business if you are an alec baldwin fan and are watching it to see him you shouldn't his part is really a bit part in this movie
<START> this movie starts off on the wrong foot and never really gets it going the first scene shows a life flight helicopter landing and just outside the window you can distinctly see mountains in the background for those of you who might not ever have been to <UNK> there is no <UNK> change the city sits just above sea level and a 5 <UNK> <UNK> is considered a big hill to go along with that scenery any shots outside of the hospital immediately tell the viewer that they are not in <UNK> the trees are all missing leaves or are <UNK> trees neither of which <UNK> has very much of even the hospital itself on the outside is very unbelievable <UNK> <UNK> hospital is one of the top <UNK> in the united states and sits <UNK> <UNK> in the middle of the medical district just miles from downtown <UNK> yet every outside shot of the hospital makes it appear that the hospital is out in the <UNK> or even the countryside br br it is obvious that whoever was in charge of the actual <UNK> storm part of the movie <UNK> out because the numerous shots of radar are all wrong the first radar image in the movie is that of hugo hitting south <UNK> we later see kris kristofferson leaving his job and one of his <UNK> tells him that alison is moving back south across <UNK> yet the radar image he shows has alison clearly moving north off of the <UNK> of mexico into <UNK> probably the initial <UNK> of alison br br as for the acting it isn't all that bad <UNK> williams kris kristofferson and rick <UNK> all do a decent job considering that this is a straight to tv movie the plot of the story is decent and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it a bit more entertaining my one problem with the acting is the portrayal of with big thick southern accents the actors all sound like they are from <UNK> <UNK> and not <UNK> texas br br the movie gets its point across and to the general audience it does exactly what it is meant to entertain if you are looking for a factual account of what happened to the city of <UNK> in june of 2001 then you will be disappointed one thing to keep in mind before viewing this movie is that it is based solely on the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> hospital and not on <UNK> storm alison and the impact on <UNK> <UNK> itself if you are looking for a factual account of <UNK> storm <UNK> impact on <UNK> <UNK> might i suggest watching the weather <UNK> storm stories for <UNK> storm alison br br 1 2 out of
<START> 1930's comedy mystery about the crooked circle a band of <UNK> crooks who set about plotting the murder of some one who <UNK> to <UNK> them enjoyable but really <UNK> little film the movie works simply because the cast headed by <UNK> <UNK> and james <UNK> both of whom would later appear together in a couple of <UNK> films after <UNK> mae oliver dropped out of that series and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of i don't hence the lack <UNK> a <UNK> hour long romp the movie doesn't make a great deal of sense with mistaken identity secret <UNK> ghostly music and people not being who they seem its the perfect thing for a dark and <UNK> night or a late night viewing when one is nostalgic for the late late show
<START> canadian film maker ron <UNK> delivers a solid non stop thrill ride of relentless horror with the superb 1991 sci fi film science crazed a hideous monster takes revenge on his mother a police officer and <UNK> of an apartment building brilliant practical make up and special effects designs create a truly terrifying monster especially when lurking through the atmospheric shadows and smoke of the gloomy apartment settings the characters are developed beautifully with outstanding and surprisingly touching performances from an ensemble cast produced by donna <UNK> newcomer ron <UNK> also penned the film's face paced script <UNK> together an engaging roller coaster ride of twists turns and terror that keeps you guessing until the last frame science crazed will no doubt leave you haunted long after the shocking conclusion highly recommended
<START> after a summer full of <UNK> and <UNK> nurse betty is a breath of fresh air the film is like no other i have ever seen director neil <UNK> proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex his previous two films were the <UNK> in the company of men and the almost <UNK> your friends and neighbors <UNK> <UNK> gives the best performance of her career as betty a waitress who when she witnessing the brutal death of her <UNK> husband <UNK> <UNK> aaron and gets lost in a fantasy world morgan freeman and chris rock play the who killed her husband and are now on her trial the trick to the film is that freeman and <UNK> are really parallel characters while <UNK> falls in love with the image of the handsome and polite dr dave on a soap opera freeman betty nurse betty is a <UNK> film full of life humor love and graphic violence my grade 10 10
<START> the main reason i loved this movie is because <UNK> immature were in it they were in house party 3 when they were 11 but they are all grown up now i was a little shocked at some of the things they were doing in the movie almost ready to tear my hair out but i had to realize that they were not my little boys anymore i think chris did a pretty good job considering that is was his first movie
<START> i saw this movie years about 8 years ago when it first came out and the only memories that i have about it are 1 that it was awful 2 that in one scene <UNK> <UNK> applies <UNK> <UNK> to her arms and legs repeatedly for about 15 minutes straight it seemed that long anyways 3 one scene where a character gets a <UNK> <UNK> into his head in this scene when the hammer <UNK> the head <UNK> like glass it's quite bad
<START> surface was one of the few truly unique shows on tv last season i can honestly say i <UNK> my schedule so i could be home to watch every episode tons of action suspense science fiction etc br br story was of a boy who found an egg that <UNK> into a sea creature the same sea creature that had killed the main character's brother and the woman character had seen most people think it is a deadly killing machine but the one raised from the egg was very friendly br br only problem is nbc canceled it so now we'll never know what happens hopefully sci fi or some other channel will pick it up
<START> i finally <UNK> a copy of through netflix and spent new eve watching an amazing drama unfold it began with a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> getting married to in the of <UNK> <UNK> and then a war takes over their romance has to flee to india and is in a <UNK> camp as she gives birth to a child several years later we see a playful well loved child p s who is the darling or burden of teachers parents and fellow <UNK> alike in a very how to solve a problem like maria sequence on her birthday she is told by her parents and <UNK> that she is not their <UNK> child she was adopted this <UNK> her confident love filled world and she constantly <UNK> on why her birth mother left her several attempts at later the <UNK> parents take her to <UNK> <UNK> to try to find her birth mother the country is torn <UNK> by a raging civil war and the trio are inevitably caught up in the mess but this also leads to their meeting the new one who finally is confronted by and asked why she abandoned her daughter br br the story of a child who has to <UNK> with the fact that she was abandoned at birth her obsessive drive to <UNK> with her birth mother the <UNK> love of the <UNK> parents the demons that drive the birth mother the <UNK> of <UNK> and the horrors of terrorism <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> made a masterful film that <UNK> many ingredients into a saga that is soul stirring <UNK> music beautifully <UNK> the magical and the poignant moments in the film the film has excellent performances from <UNK> <UNK> and an absolute <UNK> role as the abandoned one done by the child <UNK> p s this performance won her a national award br br the cinematography is visual poetry each frame is beautifully crafted and <UNK> shot i am intrigued by the connection <UNK> has with terrorism love and <UNK> i think his exploration of these subjects is absolutely outstanding character was quite unique his passion and <UNK> did not make him selfish rather was well matched with how much he cared for the little girl his one liners were hilarious the mother played by was also quite multi dimensional she was idealistic loved the adopted daughter but also worried about her <UNK> kids the shock angst and obsession of the child was <UNK> portrayed by p s her wide <UNK> eyes did most of the talking in fact the enigmatic characters were those of <UNK> <UNK> and her husband perhaps <UNK> deliberately made them mysterious so as to not give us overt ideas of why they were the way they were the <UNK> of why a terrorist becomes what he or she becomes it also kept him from being <UNK> this was another conflict in which he took no sides but merely reported while showing the human tragedy br br is visual poetry and a soul stirring drama i rarely <UNK> in the movies but this one left me <UNK> eyed and a little this is a beautiful film a treasure and a keeper if you can find a copy beg borrow or steal one today and watch the film
<START> <UNK> i hired this because i thought it was bitter <UNK> 1981 which was recommended after the appearance of the appalling <UNK> <UNK> i checked the recommendation and discovered my mistake ok it's watchable because the main characters are very sexy but the acting is awful stephen baldwin looks <UNK> the whole time which is understandable considering his co star is <UNK> competing with liz <UNK> for the title of the most obviously useless actor on the screen
<START> i picked this film up from the local family video on sale for 1 50 which was probably the first sign it wasn't going to be good watching it with 2 friends neither of them even wanted to finish it because of how awful this movie is i strangely couldn't stop watching it but this film is definitely a <UNK> case of how not to make a movie br br the plot is simple enough and sounds great chuck norris has nightmares about a serial killer he put behind bars the serial killer escapes and his nightmares begin to become reality once more serial murder norris <UNK> kicks this sounds like a great film br br and some of it is pretty good the flashback scene where a man breaks a ladder with his teeth is intense a scene where a van off a cliff and gets crushed is amazing and i learned how to break out of prison using nothing more than gun <UNK> and dental <UNK> but there is plenty wrong with this movie br br one the editor is a moron when making an action or suspense film you have to keep the energy moving there are far too many scenes that are not crucial to the plot left in this movie <UNK> it down and distracting from the overall story at least 10 minutes could have been cut and the pacing would have improved and the film would be slightly better two the sound guy is a moron apparently somebody tried to film most of this movie in an area where you can't get decent sound so most of the dialog is voiced over killing the <UNK> and not <UNK> up with mouths also the music is far too dramatic in some scenes three the casting director is a moron they cast billy <UNK> as a psychiatrist billy <UNK> is a great cult actor from <UNK> county the hills have eyes and others and would have made the proper serial killer or some sort of villain his character is so vanilla that <UNK> skills are wasted four the writer is a moron two plots are in this film the hunting of a serial killer and the romance between norris and his pregnant girlfriend every time i saw that woman on screen i wanted to claw my eyes out and sure enough she never figured into the other plot making her story completely pointless br br will i ever watch this again maybe but unless they <UNK> this film at least a dozen times you never should not recommended
<START> first off i saw another reviewer said this movie was fantastic well nothing could be further from the truth this movie is complete garbage a moronic horror comedy that is not even slightly funny don't take that mean that it's so bad that it's good because it's not it's a total waste of time and money br br here's what i see in this waste of a dvd a group of friends get together on a weekend get drunk and then decide to make a backyard video they grab mom and <UNK> video camera and start coming up with scenes on the spot they all get a big kick out of watching themselves <UNK> for the camera they figure if they think it's funny then everyone will think it's funny well they're wrong this backyard home video is garbage the acting and comedic gore effects are lousy but i guess that's to be expected since this is nothing more then a home video br br on the bright side i guess the fact that this crap got out there gives hope to anyone out there who wants to make a movie if these people could get their movie made and released on dvd then anyone can br br 0 10 save your money
<START> i just saw this film and i recommend it it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom <UNK> was fantastic and emily watson was also very good a very good film indeed about great and <UNK> love tom character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering emily <UNK> character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything i won't say more because it is better for you have to enter the story as it unfolds
<START> this movie is a <UNK> member of my movie library while not a mainstream film it is in my view a highly effective film noir in which eric roberts is totally underrated as an actor i would qualify him as a much better actor than his sister julia who is overrated but that's another review roberts plays the down on his luck ex reporter with the perfect mix of narrative <UNK> and jaded <UNK> two ingredients that are part and <UNK> of any effective film noir the first person narration by roberts enhances the quality of the movie and keeps us guessing on the real motive behind the crime br br set in palm springs everything about the setting in the movie progresses slowly as a metaphor for the theme of <UNK> roberts is <UNK> by his past the police are <UNK> by the rich residents of palm springs who treat them as servants the rich meanwhile are <UNK> by boredom watch johnny <UNK> classic performance as the insightful rich kid who only wants to be loved the isolation of each character is <UNK> and is further <UNK> by the heat and isolation of the desert br br there is an audience for this film if they're looking for a more contemporary version of film noir while there are elements of the film that might have been <UNK> i recommend getting a copy of this film and putting it right between the big sleep and <UNK> in your movie library the film is based on the arthur <UNK> book <UNK> burning and if you like acting in this one you may want to get a copy of the <UNK> in which he showcases his funnier lighter side best line in the film careful careful of what i should've asked only fools ignore the strange <UNK> of trailer park ladies
<START> in queen of the damned <UNK> was more sexy and had a bigger demanding presence she just caught your eye and attention now the movie did have faults like the lack of explaining past what i also did not like was the that the movie didn't really explain or show more of what the relationship between <UNK> and was or was like role was sort of limited in the movie and she didn't appear until the 2nd half of the movie and then to top it off her death came 2 quickly but i liked how fought back when the <UNK> tried to kill her because in the book the last fight between and the <UNK> was rather boring they killed in like 2 <UNK> head got knocked off in 1 <UNK> and <UNK> turned into the biggest punk in the world br br <UNK> played very well and stuart was perfect as <UNK> they could not have picked a better or <UNK> rest in peace <UNK>
<START> <UNK> answer to i know what you did last summer follows a similar story route to its american counterpart one year after a group of high school friends accidentally kill a <UNK> a masked killer begins to pick them off one by one who could have possibly seen them that night or was their <UNK> still alive when they dumped him into the sea br br originality cannot be expected from the teen slasher genre anymore but an effort can still be made to ensure films of this are entertaining and scary record is neither <UNK> out badly <UNK> scenes from i know the house on <UNK> row and the <UNK> among many others and failing to deliver one decent shock throughout the 95 minutes br br acting is decent from the cast who as seems to be the norm in korean cinema approach an uninspiring script with gusto and an <UNK> enthusiasm direction is mediocre at best however a strange choice of camera angles and the worst killer's costume ever <UNK> to downfall most disappointing is the film's ending where the two are that obvious you've earlier <UNK> them as being too blatant br br only saving grace is its bright start the first act is actually excellent and shows the american counterparts how character development and setting the mood are supposed to be done but other than that this is a very poor movie not recommended br br
<START> seeing the cover of this before i watched it my expectations weren't high especially since it was amongst those other crappy horror movies at blockbuster alongside films like junior br br alright not only does this movie have the brainless stereotypical characters the rich <UNK> bag the bitch the sheriff the that knows what's going wrong in the town and so forth but has such god awful dialogue acting directing and cg effects the stone dude was hilarious spoiler i'll never understand why he bit his finger off out of nowhere when he was holding that chick up hostage br br the premise for the movie is just as atrocious as the other flaws from what i could get from it stone was a gold <UNK> during the gold rush and a notorious outlaw he had a of gold spoiler and put a curse on anyone who went after his gold before he was <UNK> down by the locals after he killed some girl but not only did he survive he bit off his own finger and ran off so present day a group of clueless morons find out about this gold mine and of course they are warned by locals about the curse of the forty and what do they do as expected ignored the <UNK> and sought for the gold they get the gold and all sorts of s t goes on thankfully spoiler the bitch gets her head cut off br br that's about it looking at the cover of the film you can tell what kind of movie it's going to be it's just so terrible it's hilarious br br 1 1 2 stars out of 5
<START> not the film to see if you want to be intellectually <UNK> if you want to have a lot of fun a the theater however this is the one lots of snappy banter and some really cheesy banter too <UNK> <UNK> and seth green are very funny as the comic relief exciting and creative <UNK> and chase scenes mark <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> sexy are appealing leads and donald sutherland
<START> take it from me as a camera man who worked for republic studios from 1946 to 1950 and then <UNK> bros and paramount from 1950 to 1993 this is a piece of crap sure it would be great to show it to your favorite friends at a house party but to try to sell this on a dvd is absolutely br br i have seen bad acting in my day but this is no acting the hero is almost laughable and he really thinks he is something judging from his comments on the <UNK> i hate to see his fan club the old films did not <UNK> with the action in many of the scenes what the hell was that garden scene with three of worst actresses i never seen a garden on a ship they could not even <UNK> i would not mind it if they could have once ounce of acting but the only one was the guy with the accent i am sorry but this is not a clever film as some persons are stating i would think horror film buffs would be insulted by this piece of film
<START> yes in this movie you are treated to multiple little <UNK> on the attack in apparently a very warm climate so yes this movie is definitely not to be taken seriously it is in fact a much worse movie than the original as at least with that one the whole production looked like it cost more than a couple of bucks and a video camera to make it has its funny moments but really playing off the <UNK> of your movie and making that be your intended laughs is kind of weak film making if you ask me you can not come up with a good story your effects are going to really be bad hey let us just make the movie look as bad as possible with horrible one liners and we have our movie the first one at least had a somewhat credible story as the snowman in that one attacked during the winter and not what amounts to a resort it also had better effects too this one is just a step or two ahead of hobgoblins as far as the monsters are concerned and you really want to be more than a step a two above a bunch of hand puppets still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea <UNK> being taken out by the mighty frost actually i am just kidding but really it was the funniest part of the movie
<START> lady and the tramp ii is very animated and the songs especially that of the <UNK> dogs are quite good however the family seems even too <UNK> and i can't help understanding that <UNK> is <UNK> when everything is forbidden however i also pity angel who never has had a loving family until she meets jim dear and darling br br in any case it's clear that the original lady and the tramp is better than this sequel
<START> spoilers br br i don't care what anyone says this movie is <UNK> hilarious this is the sequel to jack frost a movie about a killer snowman the snowman is created when a convicted serial killer about to be executed is taken to the execution chamber but the truck crashes with a truck carrying <UNK> manipulation <UNK> that make human <UNK> bond with dirt or in this case snow the first movie was just boring and eventually the snowman is destroyed by <UNK> <UNK> on him br br or so they thought br br this movie takes place about a year after the second some scientists <UNK> jack frost by mixing the <UNK> with <UNK> no explanation is ever given for why they do this they just do meanwhile the who arrested frost in the first is going to the <UNK> unfortunately the snowman comes with him br br this movie has it all it has talking <UNK> that can stand up ice <UNK> that explode when you stick them in your mouth and killer <UNK> yes killer <UNK> they even say <UNK> like babies i'll have to give the makers of this credit the <UNK> are some of the <UNK> little things ever <UNK> up i wish that i could get one as a pet frost finally <UNK> the island as if a killer snowman has the ability to influence major weather <UNK> br br then there's the actors there's manners the fbi agent from the first movie except here he's wearing an <UNK> <UNK> me <UNK> i be an fbi agent and then there's the stereotypical british <UNK> and the stereotypical black <UNK> with <UNK> and finally captain fun the man on the face of the planet bar none br br this movie isn't scary but is is hilarious i laughed my butt off the whole way through and i recommend this for anyone who likes a good bad movie br br out
<START> i'm writing this as i watch the dvd i grabbed for the <UNK> and went to imdb during the first song i didn't know anything about the movie except that a friend said that the show was supposed to be good it has a decent netflix rating too so here i am br br maybe on the stage this worked but i have to say that the sight of chorus boys dancing and singing completely naked just seems silly and the lip <UNK> to a score adds to the <UNK> br br most of the songs and routines are about aspects of male nudity this is my idea of nothing sorry the score so far is generic show tune music nothing memorable or particularly <UNK> everything is to serve the lyrics which i have to say sound like they were written by a <UNK> each song is essentially one extended joke if the jokes were ten seconds they might work these single several minute long jokes don't br br i'm now watching the movie by chapters a few minutes until i get the <UNK> kind of in the hopes that one of them will be different or entertaining enough to keep me from going on to the next scene nope br br okay i'm finished so here's what i think if you have any experience or long standing appreciation of musical theater avoid this it's just not quality if however you're a gay twenty something and have never seen or heard a musical comedy you might be entertained or maybe this would hold your interest if you've never seen a lot of attractive naked men br br i have
<START> i happened to catch this movie on late night tv i saw the opening credits and thought this looks good well i was very wrong while not excruciatingly bad it had some funny and tender moments it lacked any sense of <UNK> br br it started off well enough with kathy having a <UNK> crisis of sorts when her husband leaves her and her singing idol is murdered but kathy has played these <UNK> women so well before think fried green tomatoes the problem wasn't kathy it was the clueless screenplay that <UNK> all over the place it was as if the writers must have been thinking what will we do next the script also felt very contrived br br some others who have posted comments on this movie have wondered why it didn't receive a cinematic release the main reason i think would have been to avoid embarrassment and the critics would have murdered it br br having said all that i thought the small woman who played was fantastic and stole the movie not to mention how beautiful she is
<START> this is one of the best horror movies i've seen in a while an eerie abandon house interesting characters gore and a twisted plot who could ask for anything more in a horror movie it is pretty predictable for the most part but then again most horrors you can figure out within the first 10 minutes so i won't hold that against it the music camera angles and so forth are excellent the sets are well make and very convincing there was pretty much no subplots however it being a horror movie too many alternate plots only take away from what were wanting from a horror anyhow to be scared this one keeps it pretty simple and does just that if i were to compare it to any other movie i would say it reminded me of the remake of texas chainsaw massacre definitely a horror movie lover must see
<START> this is not the worst movie i've ever seen i did not feel like i wanted to remove my <UNK> <UNK> after watching <UNK> it just is not good the jokes are almost funny but fall short all of them the few gags that come close are beat back down by repeating them over and over the production values are well non existent the sound is bad the lighting is bad it just seems cheaply made overly so the dialog well often it is missing many awkward <UNK> they are all just standing around and it seems like someone should be saying something the film even seems <UNK> about what it wants to be it is not always clear that it was intended as a comedy like maybe that developed after shooting started it feels like someone's film project that they threw together the night before it was due and if they had put two weeks into it it could have been good br br and i'm easy to please i thought mom and dad save the world was a hoot i like <UNK> <UNK> mystery men is one of my favorite movies <UNK> <UNK> is well <UNK> <UNK> a classic this turkey just doesn't do it space <UNK> was more believable br br <UNK> <UNK> who can be very funny tries too hard his part calls for a and he plays it <UNK> toward sitcom dorothy <UNK> is ok in her role but not particularly noteworthy br br oh yeah the my watch is always slow line was funny i'll give this movie all the kudos it can get it needs it br br the space vehicle models are not bad but they are few and are not used effectively the space scenes are vague no sweeping passes no close up detailed fly <UNK> not even appropriate action scenes when they <UNK> the <UNK> does crash land very oddly at one point the flight dynamics are terrible worse than anything you've seen they're jerky not smooth the initial battle is stilted and static even though the two ships have just shown that they can <UNK> in their jerky fashion they trade slow shots at close range in a manner that is more reminiscent of a <UNK> century sea battle except not as exciting br br the aliens imagine if all of star wars was the <UNK> scene that many rubber masks could get dull rather rapidly no a few are used as sight gags that work ok the first time but not the fifth br br mercifully if you attempt to watch <UNK> you are likely to fall asleep i got busy doing something else and missed the last ten minutes and did not feel like it was worth <UNK> it if that doesn't say it sucked i don't know what does sadly there is a lot of potential and this could easily have been a good movie it would be easy to remake this and have a decent film br br
<START> first of all season 1 is <UNK> bad the prison is ridiculously unrealistic the characters are so two dimensional they're nearly transparent and the direction is terrible it runs like a bad video of a junior high school play characters wandering past the camera and <UNK> highly timed and <UNK> lines passing off as random prison talk soon the show gets better but not by much the return from the commercial break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue by wheelchair bound <UNK> hill who is played <UNK> by harold <UNK> the only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad performance art monologues most of which take place in an inexplicable <UNK> glass cube and generally have nothing to do with what's taking place in the show br br unfortunately the bad ideas in oz could fill an <UNK> of several volumes consider the whole situation first of all prisoners are able to hang out in plain sight getting drunk doing drugs and they not only have cd players <UNK> they might as well pass out <UNK> knives but all <UNK> mail is thoroughly examined by prisoners christ the place is like a men's club with guards guards that don't do much br br near the end of season two an older <UNK> is <UNK> with <UNK> and all of the prisoners pitch in thick <UNK> of 20 and 50 bills to help send him to <UNK> to fulfill his dying wish these have to be the <UNK> prisoners in the world every single prisoner in oz all of a sudden became caring loving guys except kenny an irritating character but one of the only ones who is consistently convincing even wanted to be nice but that's okay because there is no order or sense in the show so even this is not much of a distraction br br later shockingly there is a boxing scene in which one <UNK> is wearing an i love cops t shirt in prison can you imagine i have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago i sent him an old picture of us with some friends in high school and in the picture one of my friends was holding an i love cops <UNK> <UNK> and one of the woods guys who have been in prison for years and years saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to <UNK> my cousin got lucky br br kenny also constantly <UNK> the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him <UNK> one of them even tried to <UNK> him to go to an english class you may lose track of who is in charge the prisoners or the guards more than one investigator for example goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade personally i would just stop letting prisoners <UNK> <UNK> mail rather than risk the lives of <UNK> br br let's see what else son <UNK> in <UNK> and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs he just got them i guess and make sure to pay attention otherwise you'll miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford when they get bad <UNK> i didn't know guests in maximum security <UNK> were <UNK> such <UNK> treatment <UNK> how about this when <UNK> asks about dr schedule so he can ask what race of <UNK> he was given is so terrified that he goes to the warden and <UNK> his job on the spot do doctors and <UNK> not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners after poet and <UNK> make the <UNK> to the entire prison <UNK> asks to see dr and is <UNK> to his office brought in without knocking and the guard promptly leaves without a word they might as well give him a gun br br i shouldn't go on about stupid ideas in this show but it's like a <UNK> i can't stop it who thought of the chinese <UNK> who can't speak chinese and who disappear en <UNK> from sight unless they're needed who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the <UNK> prisoners who though of <UNK> transplant what's the deal with and <UNK> <UNK> because he clearly doesn't belong in prison and because of the whole thing with his <UNK> <UNK> because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end as it were br br but what are the worst ideas things that go nowhere which are constant an irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb he threatens to blow up the entire prison the bomb turns out to be a dud and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is <UNK> nothing is ever heard from him or about the whole situation again it's like it never happened in one episode prisoners are given dogs to train what the hell if that wasn't bad enough during one training session a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise no one seems to mind br br i also like how anytime some kind of <UNK> breaks out the <UNK> are pulled aside they don't say anything and the guards or warden or sister pete or whoever always says i hope you don't think i'm gonna let this go and then they walk away and let it go the audience won't remember br br maybe i'm spoiled by prison break but oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a play a short one at least a low budget movie there is just not enough here to sustain a multi season tv show then again i watched six seasons of it on dvd sometimes i don't understand myself
<START> i could have done with the seven <UNK> just staying away this sequel should never have been done the first did it all and better the plot was a turkey the acting was turkey the direction production camera work all turkey whoever put out this junk should be <UNK> and <UNK> may they not return again
<START> what a film quite possibly the best i've ever seen the direction the production the score and the cinematography wonderful the acting is also excellent and the man robot scenes have to be seen to be i can not recommend this film enough get it out on video now turn the lights down and enjoy
<START> oh man this movie was toe cringing bad bad look awful story the list of good things is shorter than the list of bad things about this movie br br yes sure it's supposed to be a comedy and all but something tells me that this movie was supposed to be the real deal the movie most certainly does not start of as a comedy but more as an adventurous movie with fun elements put in it you can especially tells they were serious with this by the acting that was in a serious and non comical way with the exception of a couple of over the top sequences obviously it seemed to be me that at first they tried to make a real and serious adventurous science fiction movie perhaps even a franchise but soon began to noticed how bad it all was and simply decided to insert some more and deliberately overdone comical sequence to make the movie seem more like a comedy and prevent it from turning into a complete disastrous mess br br the movie is a weird attempt to mix adventurous <UNK> pirate movies with serious science fiction action the movie was obviously inspired by the star wars movies and its success the movie isn't even too ashamed to copy entire sequences and even the way the story progresses sets characters and robots show similarities they tried to hide this by putting in some obviously <UNK> sequences but i'm not falling for it so the movie is not even original on its own despite its original concept you can say that this movie is a poor man's <UNK> without even really being fully a spoof br br the movie is bad looking with some video games special effects in some sequences even literally awful looking costumes coat of mail and swords in outer space the sound is at times even laughable seems like they shot some sequences without sound and then forgot to add all of the required sounds later again in post production the mixing is also really bad they tried to <UNK> this by putting the sound down to a minimum at times and by <UNK> up the bruce <UNK> musical score br br at times the movie is so busy trying to make the movie look humorous that it totally forgets to tell the story it makes the story of the movie seems extremely messy and poorly written with an almost completely undeveloped main plot it also doesn't help to make the movie really ever flow lots of thing don't get explained and some are even dropped after a while the movie begins as a movie who constantly are looking and steal water since its <UNK> and there is only one planet in the entire galaxy remaining with water on it yeah right however this plot line gets soon abandoned especially in the middle part of the movie in which the movie seems to become a totally different one with different motivations it's just like the one weird and bad silly sequence after the other without really making a click it also keeps the characters way too shallow and uninteresting to care about br br sad to see that actors like john carradine <UNK> huston and a still young and unknown ron <UNK> were attached to this disastrous movie br br ok i admit that i liked some of the moments especially the ending when they go through the time <UNK> was original and fun but really non of this all was enough to save the movie br br i didn't even liked the movie in a campy kind of way br br 2 10
<START> i don't really mind the creative ideas <UNK> in these movies but seriously there isn't one coherent part of the game in this movie that seems to be the trend buy the rights and then just make a movie that has zero to do with what the fans want this <UNK> is almost entertaining because you know you are getting away with hiding behind a lack of skill and control of money not yours that allows you to do this play a game or hire someone to and please make a real movie or stand in the boxing ring and have your butt handed to you as you so claim won't happen br br wow 9 lines of text and i was done had to add blah to bug you sorry
<START> i just got back from seeing comedian it was alright it kept me looking at the screen its just not the type of thing i like to go pay 7 to see br br now don't get me wrong it'd make a great hbo feature if this were something i was watching on tv i'd be hooked right in it gives an amazing look at what comics go through before and after getting on stage it will interest anyone who likes watching comics br br but when i go to the movies i like to be entertained i'm not there to be educated now i know what its like for jerry seinfeld before he goes out on stage great but <UNK> i'd rather just laugh at his jokes than worry about any of that br br one more thing with the bad attitude adams has i'd expect to see him taking my order from <UNK> king before i see his hbo special he wasn't funny he's the kind of person that you love to hate
<START> well i watched this film expecting to be rolling in the <UNK> how wrong i was the film was moderately amusing at best and irritating at worst the slapstick comedy <UNK> of building an <UNK> with <UNK> tools laugh no i didn't i'm very disappointed given steve <UNK> was the lead i've watch the office us <UNK> cracks me up immensely i thought 40 year old virgin was good but <UNK> us why on earth did he accept this script and as for morgan freeman he's old enough to know better br br so the idea seemed reasonable the actors i had every faith in but the execution was nothing to write home about and the ending well it seemed as if they had run out of money or ideas this for me was one of the most contrived endings i could have imagined they took a biblical story and <UNK> it down to a <UNK> tale on <UNK> <UNK> issues not even global issues but a local bill yawn br br in summary reasonable start got gradually worse and for me it was all washed out by the time the <UNK> rolled
<START> leslie <UNK> is usually someone whose movies i really like even <UNK> <UNK> flicks like dracula dead and loving it and <UNK> accused so the fact that i'm <UNK> mr <UNK> should show that it's a piece of junk it casts <UNK> as the <UNK> title character something gets planted on him and he makes a mess of everything it seems like the <UNK> of <UNK> and director stanley <UNK> behind two of jackie chan's movies would make this one hilarious movie but it doesn't it seems like they just have people to do anything and there's no real humor here br br so the original cartoon with jim <UNK> providing the voice was worth seeing so avoid this movie leslie <UNK> has also done much better so there's no reason to waste your time on this also starring kelly lynch stephen ernie hudson malcolm mcdowell and <UNK> <UNK> they probably don't wish to emphasize this hunk of junk in their careers
<START> andy mcdermott tom everett scott is a shy american teenager spending vacation in paris with his friends brad and chris andy saves the gorgeous julie <UNK> from committing suicide in <UNK> tour and has a crush on her he does not know that she is a werewolf they go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves andy is wounded and becomes a werewolf he is advised that the only way to become normal again is killing the werewolf that attacked him and eating its heart this movie is a violent black humor movie the special effects and the soundtrack are excellent <UNK> the song of the band bush i do not know why some readers <UNK> this movie with the masterpiece <UNK> american werewolf in <UNK> the stories have nothing in common only an american teenager werewolves and a city in europe highly <UNK> for fans of werewolf and black humor movies my vote is seven br br title brazil um em paris an american werewolf in paris
<START> i saw this mini series when i was in high school i remember it as being absolutely brilliant and compelling at the time i knew none of the british actors in the series but have since learned that some of today's stars performed in it including sean connery the original james bond among many other roles <UNK> <UNK> queen elizabeth in shakespeare in love among many other roles and <UNK> probably best known for creating upstairs <UNK> but also superb in many acting roles like the other <UNK> i would like to see it again i'm certain the production remains timeless and i would hope that it has been or will be released on vhs or dvd if you get a chance to see it do not miss it
<START> in the mid 1970s my nyc apt building was finally <UNK> for cable tv and since showtime instead of hbo was the only <UNK> channel offered showing recent movies i signed up for it being a writer and night owl by nature i soon discovered the channel was showing movies late at night and until the wee hours of the morning i'd never even heard of most of them american independent films and foreign films that had never been given a u s theatrical release many of them had recognizable star casts and respectable directors and thanks to showtime i discovered many first rate films i and other showtime <UNK> would never else have had the opportunity to see most of these cinematic were indeed dogs but often so bad they were unintentionally hilarious one night showtime <UNK> a little italian made gem called redneck filmed in 1972 given a limited european release in 1973 even though the movie had never been released in the u s the mpaa rating was listed as an <UNK> since the director was one <UNK> the director who made his name with the glorious <UNK> girl and the three leads were mark oliver lester <UNK> <UNK> and telly <UNK> i decided to give it a try and found myself nailed to my tv screen in disbelief for <UNK> minutes as i recall <UNK> and <UNK> played two criminals the former a raging maniac who in one stomach <UNK> scene casually sent a german family to their deaths by <UNK> their trailer off a cliff thereby <UNK> to the wilderness depths below so far so bad then out of nowhere <UNK> as the nice psycho and lester all of 14 when the movie was made are seen both nude in a men's room <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at the kid's body while <UNK> and poor confused lester <UNK> on close ups of naked butt as a not yet jaded member of the movie industry and a card carrying liberal i was as much against censorship then as i am today the entire movie made me <UNK> and being the early '70s when i seen everything in the anything goes movies of that <UNK> era including the uncut version of altman's that cold day in the park a real jaw until it was <UNK> for an <UNK> rating and would have spelled the end for altman's career had he not next come up with something called m a s h i still wonder if anyone else except me ever saw redneck and was appalled as i was <UNK> the actors and movie going audiences is joy <UNK> filmmakers have been <UNK> <UNK> in since the beginning of time but <UNK> <UNK> a highly respected and talented child actor mr lester at a time when he was beginning to make the difficult <UNK> from child to adult actor and i'm sure his film offers had thereby <UNK> to <UNK> junk like redneck mr you should be hanging your head in shame incidentally i was soon to make friends with actors who had appeared in future <UNK> efforts they both <UNK> him surprise
<START> i found this movie to be a simple yet wonderful comedy this movie is purely entertaining i can watch it time and time again and still enjoy the dialog and chemistry between the characters i truly hope for a dvd release
<START> john ford paid the <UNK> his tribute of a special picture made after two big indian <UNK> epics it is a lovely poetic movie full of <UNK> reincarnation of the <UNK> spirit it didn't have to top the big ones that had <UNK> it br br it is extremely simple the camera moves only once or twice in the entire film and never when a director would have made it move to <UNK> a shot ford even <UNK> the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women <UNK> <UNK> along in the dust behind their <UNK> they come and go while the camera remains <UNK> and the audience stays a <UNK> to the march of history not a <UNK> in it of course when ford wants to involve his audience emotionally or dramatically as in ' he knows just how to do it but <UNK> master is a tender nostalgic look <UNK> br br filled with traditional western songs rendered by the sons of the <UNK> it tells of the trek west to <UNK> in of a mormon <UNK> train led by ward bond in the role of elder and two young horse <UNK> ben johnson and harry carey jr and in a series of beautiful images as the <UNK> train fights <UNK> indians and nature in its struggle to reach the land ' the modest manages to capture the history and legend of the west br br ford himself has said that of which he wrote the original story was among the three films of his which <UNK> closest to being what i had wanted to achieve ' br br ford's career as a western director was astonishing more than anyone else he was able to use the genre to protect his feelings about the family society and the american way of life ford saw the frontier as a land to be subdued by a special class of <UNK> and <UNK> whose great sacrifices make the land safe from those who come after these early <UNK> were giants who deserved the legendary status they earned and the <UNK> <UNK> who followed must always hold them in fear and respect ford's westerns often employ flashbacks that emphasize the historical authenticity of his approach br br in master ' for example folk songs on the sound track tell us of the <UNK> of the <UNK> of a century ago and ford shows them to us in almost documentary fashion in one sequence the train is <UNK> in a circle and the <UNK> decide to hold a square dance to fashion a dance floor they have to lay boards over the desert sand and with this ritual celebration ford shows the defeat of the wilderness through the metaphor of <UNK> over the land br br it's a lovely to look at film full of a marvelous lighthearted optimism and it is easy to understand why ford found it so it never breaks faith with the mood and style set in the first few but one is left wondering whether the ultra romantic best suits the chosen <UNK> br br the <UNK> train experience must have been one of the most physically demanding and nerve <UNK> <UNK> that man with his ever set it must have been <UNK> with i wrong to sell up everything and come how can we hope to survive how will we <UNK> the other end every other <UNK> step of the <UNK> br br yet none of this feeling really comes through in <UNK> master the is the general not strike one as particularly it could be of course that the <UNK> were so <UNK> on religious spirit that this tended to act as an in other words their reactions weren't those of normal human weakness if so ford was right and the <UNK> were <UNK> br br what is beyond doubt is the right and proper especially at first meeting of ben johnson and harry carey jr this is the essence of light hearted adventurous youth particularly one feels of western youth of those extraordinary it's a remarkable relationship and it remains <UNK> in the
<START> a few of my fellow writers have covered this movie's plot elements so i will stick to some of the <UNK> remarks br br 1 this is entertaining but not for the reasons you'd think it's cheesy but somehow still watchable br br 2 <UNK> love interest has to be about thirty the christian girl that dan ignores is way <UNK> br br 3 muriel stole his shirt from mr spock also if my guardian angel looks like muriel i'm going to have to apply for a transfer br br 4 okay so apparently dan is responsible for his parents' divorce what kind of horrible guilt trip is that muriel says that it was <UNK> <UNK> that kept his parents together i just thought that was absolutely ridiculous listen i can pray for my parents as much as i want but the only way they'll stay together is if they decide they're going to do it br br 5 i'll echo the comments on how this movie portrays non christians apparently they're all <UNK> bullies br br 6 for something positive david white is a decent actor he gives the movie a little bit of credibility even if he is the only one he pretty much holds this film together on his own
<START> this movie made me want to bang my head against the wall it is hard to compare such badness as this to anything but some say that watching this movie is similar to bleeding from under your <UNK> and that comment comes from the writer's cousin this movie was so flipping bad it made hulk the second worst movie ever look like the <UNK> one of the greatest movies in cinematic history if you like boring family movies with predictable plot lines then you will absolutely love this movie if you have a brain then you definitely will not when i rented this movie i actually fell asleep while watching it the next day i finished it from where i left off and it was the worst decision of my life
<START> enough talent and sincerity went into making this film that i wish it turned out better everyone is clearly doing their best to be true to an intriguing premise but it's too deep a vision too involved attempt at <UNK> mental <UNK> to survive a transition to the screen it is an attempt to capture the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> on celluloid the result is muddled and slow i give it a 10 for effort but a 5 overall
<START> thank god you're here is painful positively painful the title is apt in a sense if aimed at the large studio audience paid to laugh like they were watching the second coming of the marx brothers and trust me they are paid br br as <UNK> <UNK> as the entertainment industry has become i refuse to believe that nbc <UNK> really have faith in this turkey rather i think thank god you're here is what all of you get who didn't watch or didn't appreciate studio 60 which previously <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> monday night <UNK> you want to turn your nose up at <UNK> fine here's some lovely <UNK> direct from menu <UNK> for you to <UNK> around in
<START> let's face it there is no perfect production of hamlet it's simply far too long and varied and cerebral to get completely perfect across the board especially what with the challenges of <UNK> english and shakespeare's dialogue in any staging of it there are bound to be certain moments scenes or <UNK> that one <UNK> with i've seen a lot of filmed hamlet productions olivier gibson branagh scott and now this bbc film with <UNK> in terms of faithful full length productions this one ranks up there with the very best br br most hamlet productions are drastically cut because to perform the entire play takes a stage time of four to five hours this production appears to be complete that is all of the original shakespeare dialogue is intact and so it's essential for <UNK> and shakespeare lovers and though the lines seemed rushed on rare occasion for those less completely familiar with the text for the most part the script is well acted well spoken and well performed subtitles are available and very helpful although upon occasion they <UNK> slightly behind br br <UNK> does a quite admirable job with <UNK> longest and most impossible role i actually cried when hamlet dies and i don't think i've done that before patrick stewart as <UNK> and claire bloom as <UNK> are excellent as are ward <UNK> and david <UNK> and the rest of the very on point cast sets are minimal so we can thankfully concentrate on the play without distraction or attention paid to non <UNK> br br at 3 hours and 45 minutes this full length hamlet is a long <UNK> to sit through but again if you want the real deal it's 100 worth it even if one needs to take an <UNK> for <UNK> i highly recommend this production to all shakespeare lovers and <UNK>
<START> i've loved this movie since the first time i saw it lo these many years ago i'm not sure how many times i've seen it perhaps 10 perhaps 20 this last time i watched it i was struck by a detail that i hadn't noticed before br br toward the end of the picture the <UNK> heroes are conveyed back to the town via <UNK> there are a couple of closeups of the dead men the one that struck me most was a shot of the blond youth all you see on the screen is his profile from head to hands his hands are holding a <UNK> candle the wind is blowing and his thick blond hair is dancing in the wind in tune with the <UNK> of the candle flame the contrast between death and the life he has lost is incredibly powerful the moving hair and candle flame remind us of the life force that once inhabited his body br br every time i <UNK> this film i see something new
<START> the problem this film has is the same problem the tv series had and that s the <UNK> stan and jack there s nothing wrong with <UNK> characters but stan and jack are played by actors who seem to be in their late 40s early 50s and there s something <UNK> not to mention <UNK> as they cop off with girls young enough to be their daughters br br as for the rest of holiday on the <UNK> i found it instantly forgettable it s basically a 30 minute episode <UNK> out to 90 minutes with having all the action take place at a holiday camp instead of a bus station br br amazingly almost a third of voters on this site have given it a 10 come on guys this film <UNK> t deserve more than a 5
<START> it's amazing what you can do with little money dead silent being a low budget movie delivers its promises br br too bad we don't see rob lowe more often on the silver screen lowe is at its best in this riveting thriller no wonder he went from dead silent straight to the tv mega hit the west wing br br dead silent 8 out of 10 br br toronto
<START> this is a terrible movie don't waste your money on it don't even watch it for free that's all i have to say
<START> my wife and i enjoy bad science fiction movies some movies are so bad they are good <UNK> was one of those that one was bad but it had some redeeming qualities it makes you wonder how a self <UNK> actor approaches lines like hey <UNK> br br this one is so bad it has now taken its place as our standard for bad it isn't just a bad movie it really stinks there was the <UNK> strike force the indian that <UNK> around in a black cloak and used a sword for crying out loud he shot down a helicopter with an arrow br br we tried to laugh at this movie but there were no points at which it didn't rise above pitiful we couldn't come up with any redeeming features except for one those were the words the end br br there seemed to be no plot no character development and no point to the movie someone in hollywood needs to be fired
<START> and nothing wrong in that <UNK> <UNK> the comments of and snow <UNK> br br i'm thrilled to find this movie is available on us dvd i've only ever seen it through once i <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> here in london to show it in their conrad <UNK> season some years ago and long to see it again br br barrymore is <UNK> when engaged as in this movie possibly because of the <UNK> of having a renowned german actor as a foil and <UNK> is such a wonderful scene <UNK> doesn't he pick his nose at one point this is one of the <UNK> films to connect <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or and 'the <UNK> of dr or 'the student of <UNK> with 'the spy in and <UNK> br br see it
<START> 1st watched 12 26 2008 <UNK> eugene levy corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs the movie appears to be based on an earlier italian movie according to the credits but was re written by two fairly popular american romantic comedy writers but this one by charles <UNK> nancy meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts the story is about a couple of down and out traveling americans played by richard lewis and sean young who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the <UNK> return upon trying to return it they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the <UNK> <UNK> that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money they freak out and instead of <UNK> the police and telling them the truth they make out like <UNK> from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder the other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a <UNK> <UNK> gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story the other cast members include character actors john candy james belushi <UNK> shepherd george hamilton and others after the police find out about the death they start questioning the main characters and of course they have to work thru their goofy lies to figure out what really happened none of the character actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie out of it's mediocre state despite some funny moments mostly provided by the belushi shepherd couple this isn't a horrible movie it just isn't that good there are plenty of average movies out there and this is just another one for the pile try it maybe you'll like it probably you won't
<START> burt <UNK> and <UNK> in this great cop film <UNK> <UNK> the of the title who is a tough cop whilst working in undercover a drug bust goes wrong and is to vice br br the machine of the title to the <UNK> crew to bring down a crooked <UNK> who is involved in high class prostitution cocaine and contract murder br br the <UNK> crew is played by brian keith favorite <UNK> <UNK> richard <UNK> as <UNK> quirky as an ace sounds man <UNK> as the chief the beautiful english rose <UNK> ward <UNK> a 1000 a night hooker whom and eventually for when <UNK> out an apartment used by the <UNK> br br italian actor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the high <UNK> who has a deadly gang of at his <UNK> and henry <UNK> <UNK> his psychotic brother hit man who is highly strung on <UNK> and angel dust br br the action packed finale <UNK> the remaining <UNK> of the engaged in a deadly shootout with <UNK> which in one the most spectacular ever put to celluloid br br alas hollywood has ran out of <UNK> and is <UNK> a remake of <UNK> machine why bother a <UNK> <UNK> special edition dvd would be ideal not a silly ass remake
<START> i bought this rental return for 1 99 at hollywood and <UNK> i didn't expect much but thought it would be something to fall asleep by at least i quickly noted the very weak storyline the gross overacting by everyone no one talks like that except in cartoons and the seemingly let's make it up as we go along direction i know that the participants in this mess must be very embarrassed by it and i feel certain that it did not help any careers as for this movie buff of 35 years it has now provided a ready answer for the worst film you've ever seen question br br
<START> when i die someone will bury me and if they don't what's the difference who gives a damn huh thus the philosophy of life or lack there of is summed up once and for all in this less than classic but nevertheless fun <UNK> of sergio <UNK> dollars trilogy br br in the opening scene three obviously evil <UNK> ride into a western town and with menacing <UNK> they <UNK> all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes the <UNK> watcher will notice that each of these three bears a striking resemblance to characters from <UNK> for a few dollars more there is one guy in eastwood's <UNK> one in lee van <UNK> black suit and one seeming to act like <UNK> marie but this movie is not about these guys no sooner do they ride into town when they are <UNK> down by someone even <UNK> than they a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the stranger br br no this is an altogether different story br br in an obvious <UNK> of <UNK> the good the bad and the ugly three <UNK> are again <UNK> for a hidden treasure once again there is the bounty hunter and the mexican <UNK> the stranger george hilton is a bounty hunter with a <UNK> for shooting people while dressed up like a priest he is after the reward for the <UNK> gilbert <UNK> but when gang steals three hundred thousand in gold <UNK> the stranger gets <UNK> from his normal line of work br br to round off the trio there is <UNK> <UNK> corrupt bank executive <UNK> he too wants the money for himself but after the money is hidden away the only man who knows where it is gets shot now the only clue to the hiding place is a <UNK> that shows a family <UNK> the game is too find the treasure before anyone else does and any gun can play br br with plenty of <UNK> fist fights and double crosses the action takes these three to the ultimate showdown ripoff a three way draw for the hidden treasure ala the good the bad and the ugly but with a twist br br this movie is not as good as <UNK> films of course but in the end who gives a damn huh this movie is fun 60s <UNK> spaghetti western style there are no rules no enduring <UNK> and no right or wrong just the treasure and whatever it takes to get it and though the movie is not classic the ending surely is hey maybe we all can get along after all for a hundred thousand a piece br br if you like spaghetti westerns check this one out it is fast furious and worth the look
<START> although coming after three star wars <UNK> countless others this movie would look outdated in the 1950s 1 <UNK> mostly consist of 1970s <UNK> effects such as <UNK> etc annoying after a short while you also get a <UNK> creature that looks like a poor man's version of some <UNK> iv <UNK> monster br br 2 sets are mainly ruins in the countryside with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> cities or <UNK> that makes 1950s japanese monster movies look like flawless perfection br br 3 plot is paper extra thin <UNK> must find seven golden stolen by <UNK> gods zombie <UNK> br br 4 action mainly consists in retarded <UNK> up <UNK> check the variety of facial expressions wrestling cheap 1970s <UNK> effects br br 5 acting award goes to <UNK> <UNK> third <UNK> show <UNK> sister with anna <UNK> which says all br br 6 <UNK> make other <UNK> ii italian <UNK> bowl movies such as star crash look like masterpieces br br well considering that main acting exploit consisted in <UNK> a retarded green monster wearing a <UNK> and green we ought to be <UNK> br br watch it forget about it
<START> the movie although not faithful to the original novels succeeds in creating modern gothic vampire vision somebody tried to insult calling it a 1 music video clip actually it is a <UNK> the <UNK> gothic music combined with the music video like shots made the movie so moody and queen of the damned is a mood driven story br br i do not understand the die hard fans who complain on the <UNK> of the story the plot has been <UNK> to be less confusing for viewers who do not know the novels the number of characters had been <UNK> and i have no problems with changing maker or skipping character the biggest change the romance of <UNK> and jesse seemed a very nice addition to me br br actually i think that a faithful adaptation would be a complete failure the slow and gloomy mood that was perfect to century new and <UNK> angst wouldn't fit rebellion and his music and while the book can be slow <UNK> and combining multiple elements yet conveying them well the movie simply cannot do it without turning chaotic vampire <UNK> and queen of the damned can be split into at least three movies the creators had to choose something br br some of the special effects like the flying or walking out of the flames were the only thing i actually didn't like in this movie but death was very nice the cast was good <UNK> was convincing as <UNK> especially on the concert but i preferred <UNK> as <UNK> i loved jesse and <UNK> though and of course <UNK> was perfect with her quasi ancient egyptian accent br br so if you are into gothic music and <UNK> of loneliness and eternity and you don't consider books to be movie scenarios queen of the damned is one of the few movies which show vampires as something more than blood sucking monsters but please do not compare it to the interview movie it has a completely different style precisely as much different as different were louis and <UNK> personally i find it thrilling first to watch a <UNK> existence from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> point of view and then switching to one devoid of all morals but surprisingly <UNK> for a vampire <UNK> br br i'd give queen 8 of 10 as it had some technical flaws but i decided to give it 9 as it's vastly underrated by people who hate it simply because it didn't match their vision of the books which can be clearly seen by looking at the votes breakdown
<START> i'm a fan of jeff bridges so i <UNK> this up on dvd without having seen it previously i instantly became a fan of kevin spacey also br br the general plot of alien in human body has in my experience been done to death but i liked the approach taken in k <UNK> which struck me as quite different and much more sensitive than most bridges makes an excellent doctor you want to tell him what's on your mind and <UNK> expressions and gestures are perfect in the role br br the interaction between and the entirely human characters in the clinic is delightful particularly the subtle manipulation of their behaviour br br the ending is bittersweet i like choice but the final scenes with bridges made me <UNK>
<START> minor spoilers br br misunderstood classic remains one of <UNK> finest and most personal films it may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one ' but people do seem to remember this one mostly for jerry snappy screenplay and paul <UNK> <UNK> songs now while these things are admittedly great as is the movie's <UNK> <UNK> screenplay within the screenplay film break etc what <UNK> 'the muppet <UNK> from the other muppet films is the serious <UNK> thread that runs through the picture it's a road movie all right but like most road movies the pleasure is in the getting there and the achievement of the characters' goals is <UNK> by <UNK> and by the knowledge that they can never really go back again throughout the film we are shown the down side of show business even before the muppets have <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> without a second thought at a phone call from her agent <UNK> expresses the loneliness and regret of a <UNK> life on the road in his haunting <UNK> going to go back there someday ' and worst of all <UNK> is continually tortured and tested by doc hopper who wants him to <UNK> his art for the of purposes one can only wonder what <UNK> would have made of his family's management of the company after his death <UNK> himself <UNK> over his choices in the desert conversation scene and the final <UNK> number questions whether it's all been worth it before <UNK> that it probably doesn't matter either way all this is <UNK> with the expected muppet chaos and satire and deliciously awful jokes and of course the serious stuff wouldn't work if it weren't but 'the muppet <UNK> isn't just another as the rest of the <UNK> return muppet films would become no it's a lovely gentle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business and it's every bit as effective today as it was 25 years ago 9 5 out of 10
<START> i am not exactly how sure the accuracy is with this movie but i can tell you that i was thoroughly entertained by this movie the character of <UNK> played perfectly by phillip seymour hoffman was one of the most unique yet entertaining characters in recent memory this movie informed yet managed to avoid preaching to the audience it made me laugh made me sad made me feel alive and glad to be spending the time to watch the movie it takes no time to understand what is going on and takes you on a roller coaster ride of genuine human emotion i thought i knew my history apparently i didn't know it at all i give this move 9 out of 10 and recommend it for all adults and young adults and the young at heart just not the young but as soon as they are allowed to see r rated movies make it a <UNK>
<START> i was very impressed with what eddie monroe was able to accomplish in regards to its overall affect on me i say this because i know this independent film had a limited budget resources but despite this it comes across as a convincing and well crafted piece of work br br enjoyable from start to finish with several relatively unknown actors which i can't help but believe will make a big noise in the industry in years to come eddie monroe didn't fail to keep my interest engaged and my emotional <UNK> dancing it's a well scripted story with a startling ending despite my effort to not be taken off guard br br many of the cast names listed for this film are names to look out for in the future someone told me that paul <UNK> recently passed and if this is true it's a real tragedy since his stoic performance in eddie monroe is remarkable br br kudos to fred carpenter who has truly pulled out a winner with this one
<START> this has to be one of my 3 favorite episodes from the original tv series br br what makes it great is the battle of wits between the commander and kirk as well as the top notch acting from mark who later went on to play <UNK> father in other tv episodes and movies this is a case where those around rose to the level of the talent around them and shatner <UNK> and the whole cast deliver an outstanding performance in this episode br br the writing and plot are also excellent and i love the direct approach used to show us the characters and the feelings and thoughts of those characters and how <UNK> they are expressed by the actors br br this very entertaining episode ranks 10 out of 10 awesome desert <UNK>
<START> john carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the <UNK> respect that he possibly could the only difference here is that carpenter chooses to stick to the <UNK> core of john w campbell <UNK> short story the secret to this <UNK> success is the unbearable tension that builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other the strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a <UNK> hold carpenter manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery needed to keep the film heading in the right direction be it an horrific scene or a what is in the shadow sequence the film to me is a perfect <UNK> of horror and sci fi the dialogue is spot on for a group of men trying to keep it together under <UNK> and carpenter's score is a wonderful eerie pulse beat that further <UNK> up the sense of doom and paranoia thru the film the cast are superb a solid <UNK> of actors led by carpenter <UNK> kurt russell whilst the effects used give the right amount of impact needed but most of all it's the ending that is the <UNK> glory an ending that doesn't <UNK> to the norm and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it lets wait and see what happens indeed 10 10
<START> this is the first movie i've seen from <UNK> and it's great if you don't know a lot about asia its languages and its culture then this film may be a bit confusing for the non informed people as an asian american who's double in two asian languages one of them being <UNK> and has taken some asian american studies classes this film was easier for me to understand but even without that kind of knowledge i believe this movie is still accessible to its foreign audiences as long as you keep in mind that it's a coming of age type of movie the film is definitely worth seeing just so that you get the chance to see what kind of issues young teenage boys are struggling and having to deal with this is an awesome coming of age movie but filmed and shown in a more artistic and original way the actors are outstanding
<START> truly a great film i stumbled onto it at the video store and rented it because aaron in the company of men and your friends and neighbors was in it as well as the lovely former <UNK> <UNK> model does get nude in the film but that is only one of the many reasons to rent it it's very exciting and the character development is fantastic is one of the most underrated actors working and he steals this film it is very dark and violent but i enjoyed in immensely
<START> the people who bash this movie were looking for it to be as cool and slick as the first one which this isn't this movie was supposed to be the complete opposite as <UNK> 11 this has been said by a lot of the cast members and also the director steven soderbergh <UNK> 12 while it did lack a gripping plot is being <UNK> because it was different then what people wanted if it were released before <UNK> 11 it would be taken much differently not as a failed sequel the problem with sequels is people go into it with a <UNK> idea of what it should be like it and have lots of expectations they should go into this movie with an open mind and not expect it to be <UNK> 11 again
<START> the seven <UNK> between director joseph von <UNK> and star marlene <UNK> were so distinct in look and tone and so different from anything else going on at the time they almost seem to <UNK> a sub genre of their own like any genre they have their outright masterpieces as well as their absolute <UNK> time to send blonde <UNK> back to the farm br br after the seductive hits the blue angel <UNK> and shanghai express in which miss <UNK> established her screen image as <UNK> singer <UNK> prostitute someone at paramount decided it was time for marlene to play a mother there is nothing wrong with that in itself as an actress she was up to the part it's just that nothing else about the format has changed it's like the blue angel plus a kid fair enough the story of a woman who drags her child along on her sleazy <UNK> is a sound premise for a tragic drama but that's not the way this is played <UNK> journey is played as some kind of adventure using her wits and <UNK> to stay ahead of the law this is not some <UNK> example of pre code  it is just <UNK> <UNK> br br although we may be able to accept marlene is a <UNK> <UNK> there is absolutely no way we can buy <UNK> as a director of warmth and <UNK> in spite of this being one of the handful of pictures for which he also took a writing credit <UNK> simply fails to get the story arc the film's emotional payoff is supposed to be the eventual reunion of the family but even at the beginning this is not established as something worth getting back to as usual interiors are dressed and shot to look like either <UNK> or insane <UNK> the home is actually quite a creepy <UNK> environment and it's a wonder little johnny wasn't <UNK> the bed and asking to sleep with the light on br br but as anyone familiar with them will know the point of a <UNK> <UNK> picture is to make <UNK> look fabulous and in this respect at least blonde <UNK> is a success marlene is introduced <UNK> from a forest pool in a bright <UNK> close up and even when she is reduced to <UNK> the camera still loves her the same cannot be said for the rest of the cast whom <UNK> tended to view as mobile pieces of scenery the normally likable herbert marshall is here reduced to a moody <UNK> lurking in the shadows even the suave and lively cary grant becomes just a boring background blob and does not seem nearly interesting enough for <UNK> to run off with br br the only standout moments in blonde <UNK> are song and dance routines especially the renowned hot voodoo number where she parodies her own surreal stage persona by <UNK> from a gorilla outfit but even these feel like they have been cut and <UNK> from a different film fans may <UNK> it as another masterpiece as they are wont to do but for the average <UNK> it is a massive disappointment audiences of the time did not lap it up as they had her earlier hits and this <UNK> the beginning of the end for <UNK> a year later there would be a new queen at paramount  mae west
<START> 20 people rated this a 10 that <UNK> box was stuffed better than a christmas turkey speaking of here's a traditional story hoping to <UNK> back on the current poker <UNK> without success told entirely in linear flashback and when i say told i mean talked to death this film never let's a picture suffice when words can be used to br br <UNK> childhood fascination with cards and his <UNK> with <UNK> might sound like interesting movie material but the director manages to suck the life out of them at no point did i feel the least bit of sympathy for <UNK> a genius at cards who threw it all away on other forms of gambling at which he was not so <UNK> of course this leads as we <UNK> through three musical montages to the inevitable <UNK> spiral of drugs loss of family and finally his redemption sort of big yawn
<START> i like kevin bacon and cathy <UNK> and i love mary stuart masterson but the movie wasn't good at all there wasn't a likable character in the picture and the plot was nearly non existent br br ms masterson is a great actress but she just didn't pull off the tough girl character she had similar problems with her character in the second day of christmas perhaps she should avoid these characters especially those with an obnoxious female child to play off of br br <UNK> rachel wood was unimpressive her character was a brat plain and simple and no young actress could have given harriet any positive feelings br br in the interest of full <UNK> i couldn't even finish watching this picture forty five minutes of my time is enough to waste
<START> ross <UNK> musical remake of the <UNK> fantasy based on james <UNK> enduring <UNK> was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973 sounding off a <UNK> against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in hollywood for years group of <UNK> british and american individuals end up on an <UNK> flight out of a war torn asian country but their plane is <UNK> and crashes in a snowy mountain <UNK> a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called <UNK> la where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and <UNK> content some of the performances by the classy cast aren't so classy the <UNK> mood of the piece the <UNK> burt <UNK> hal david tunes as well as the lightweight direction all <UNK> to make the performers look just a bit silly peter <UNK> is the international peace keeper who becomes involved in a somewhat <UNK> romance with resident <UNK> sally <UNK> is a <UNK> who <UNK> out lines like i got tired of taking pictures of people with their heads blown off so that people with their heads still on and usually under could get one last kick before turning to the latest recipe john as chang an asian who learned to speak english while attending <UNK> is <UNK> self amused but why no songs for chang hal david's dopey lyrics are sometimes jaw dropping on the good ship <UNK> how did christopher <UNK> <UNK> across the sea and the pacing gets <UNK> down with all that <UNK> about the outside world and how nothing is more pitiful today however the production is lush and the general handling strangely affecting the two dimensional characters are so overly serious they actually become endearing and the movie's silliness is <UNK> it ends up being a lot of fun from
<START> why didn't critics like this movie i don't get it this is easily my favorite clive barker effort <UNK> is a bit too rough around the edges the film just never leaves that stupid house and lets face it lord of <UNK> doesn't move at all i have loved <UNK> writing for years especially his books of blood <UNK> entertaining he has a vicious side to him that is totally unlike a stephen king he <UNK> mixes in his own homosexuality and odd religious and elements i love love love love it i also realize however that barker is as much a dark fantasy writer as he is a horror writer and fantasy just isn't my bag puts me right to sleep always has i also think barker works best with short stories his novels tend to wander a bit that was my experience when trying to read the <UNK> game it started out well then 100 pages in i thought where is this going because it wasn't going anywhere br br i read <UNK> the book was based on and thought it was good i especially like the <UNK> on character the way the mask talked to him and controlled him i like the way barker simply presents it black and white there it is he gives it a simplicity that's attractive and believable when asked why <UNK> kills he says simply because i like it probably something jeffrey dahmer said at some point br br but i actually liked the film better than <UNK> i adore the visual attention to detail that barker gives to his films adore it i think it is just beautiful lord of <UNK> had some of this as well some of the drawings in the beginning during the credit sequence it's like an entire <UNK> barker <UNK> up just for the world i'd be curious to know how much was purely his design i know he is an amazing artist who his own style and language as an artist br br is also i think <UNK> most entertaining film it moves very quickly well edited it doesn't drag like lord of <UNK> does a little bit very quick everything in it is just perfect it also works as a fantastic and scary little slasher movie the stuff with the killer in the beginning killing the family and later <UNK> the old man in the shop is really scary stuff that mask is frightening i'd be curious to know if barker designed that as well it's not just a hokey jason or scream type mask something about it is really disturbing br br anyway this is a great flick definitely check it out if you haven't seen it highly recommended one of my favorite horror films of all time in my opinion clive <UNK> best it is scary and violent though be warned
<START> <UNK> murder by numbers starring sandra <UNK> is solid work though not particularly compelling i am a big sandra <UNK> fan and she is effective here as <UNK> detective cassie <UNK> who is not very likable and a broken person too however there is a sense of <UNK> inherent in the story structure it's about the perfect murder executed by two spoiled <UNK> teenagers richard ryan who is the cool one and justin michael pitt who is the sympathetic geek basically richard and justin kill a young woman because they have nothing better to do on a school night they are very smart and very arrogant which is normally not a bad thing but it just doesn't work here tony script does a great job of <UNK> the investigation of a puzzling murder and it is truly by the numbers we have these two punk kids <UNK> their <UNK> and we just want them to take a fall br br this is not a great exploration into the dark side like <UNK> of fortune about claus von <UNK> there are interesting turns in numbers the movie is not so much a thriller but rather a character study of cassie sandra <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of cassie her fear of letting people get in with her and her secret past <UNK> brings courage and strength to a suffering character her partner and sort of love interest sam played by ben chaplin is more a plot than a real character though chaplin does the <UNK> thing very admirably the other nice touch is having richard and justin involved a strange sexual attraction the most interesting thing about numbers are pitt and br br there are many entertaining twists and turns throughout the movie everything is done very competently i saw the movie about a week ago and in retrospect i like it a little more than i did when i saw it however it is just not inspired work sandra <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> deserve a lot better and so do we
<START> i rented this movie hoping that it would provide some good entertainment and some cool poker knowledge or stories what i got was a documentary type look at an average guys life who happened to be really good at cards do i want to see the romance with his wife no do i want to see about everything that went on in this guy's life except poker no well thats what you get with this film the acting is good for such a low budget piece of crap the film never tries to break the mold or do anything original it simply sleep walks its way through the script the ending is disappointing and never really looks deep into mind instead it focuses on what was already obvious he was a drugged out card player with an average life not unlike any other average joe in vegas the movie focuses on the aspects of his life that were un extraordinary rather than the extraordinary the poker scenes in the entire film add up to about 4 minutes of footage achievements of winning the 3 times seem life after thoughts a 10 year old could do a better job directing this movie or maybe it was the script being a piece of crap from the beginning that doomed this joke of a movie br br if you want to see a film about gambling watch <UNK> it at least has style
<START> <UNK> remains the greatest of the pop music <UNK> to have a plot great visuals and a tip top song to wrap the film around michael jackson was at the top of the tree at this time and not so altered in his plastic surgery regime for it to matter here he is in good form the song is terrific he leads the zombies in dance like no other br br <UNK> ray plays the girl who watches with <UNK> as her sweet boyfriend jackson <UNK> turns into a werewolf then to the <UNK> <UNK> of the opening line <UNK> close to he <UNK> around the graveyard with the other zombies and creatures of the night br br the <UNK> glory of all this is the <UNK> voice of the great horror star vincent price speaking in the middle of the record terrific
<START> reeves plays <UNK> a hero in russia br br this is a badly dubbed movie with june <UNK> doing some of the voices unfortunately who ever was suppose to sync the voices to the lips was blind since the words never match the lip <UNK> anyone who says that japanese films are bad have never watched this film br br the film's plot is instantly forgettable and so i've forgotten it in the time its taken the movie to end and for me to sit and write this down perhaps it has more to do with the fact that the film is one of the many that reeves made in hopes of moving away from action to more plot driven sort of films it may have been a good thing for reeves but its deadly for the audience who have to slug through <UNK> such as this where its all court intrigue with very little action br br in reeves defense he was a good actor he just had no real luck in picking films that were any good they all looked great but very few of them didn't put the those watching them into a coma for the film's running time br br this film will put you in a coma watch it only if you have the need for sleep and all other <UNK> means have failed
<START> i saw this film last night and came online specifically to see if others thought it was as awful as i did br br granted obviously some people see a lot in this film that i didn't so if you're one of those people fine good luck to you but i'm a patient person i've enjoyed extremely long films before but this was an exercise in torture for me br br i honestly felt that this was one of those films with little to say and that it was more about style than substance however the style too made me feel like <UNK> my hair out pretty much anything interesting that happens during the course of the film happens off screen it's like a deliberate attempt to make a film entirely from <UNK> the bits that would usually be reserved for the deleted scenes section of a dvd if they were shown to the public at all br br you don't even get to find out in the end anything about the main character <UNK> i had no sympathy for any of the characters in this film except perhaps the <UNK> his goat and the old man who believes that <UNK> live to 300 because they're really smart seriously i was excited when it cut to a shot of <UNK> holding a gun to his head i felt so ripped off when even his inevitable suicide turned out to be gut <UNK> boring br br oh and where was the editor off smoking <UNK> too i swear i almost screamed every time i was subjected to an extended shot of absolutely nothing happening except perhaps someone pacing backwards and <UNK> and then finally there would be a very abrupt cut to the next scene and it would be a year later and we'd missed everything interesting that happened in the meantime and everyone was still wearing the same bloody clothes br br so in conclusion if you liked it great but this review is intended as an <UNK> to the <UNK> you'll love this film if you love cinema <UNK> i've seen posted here and elsewhere see i hated the film and i still included a sly <UNK> reference to its content
<START> you have to acknowledge <UNK> contribution to cinema he gave us both the most over rated film in history the deer hunter and the worst film in history <UNK> gate and before you start with the <UNK> bad but not the worst <UNK> let me explain br br for 20 years i listened to the critics and avoided <UNK> gate actually this was not hard because you are hardly <UNK> with opportunities to view this film then a few days after seeing the <UNK> cut the making and of <UNK> documentary i stumbled on a used 9 99 dvd of the long version my advice after minutes is to seek out the most negative review ever written about this film you will find a wide selection and imagine that the reviewer is <UNK> devoted mother and that she is doing everything she can to put a positive <UNK> on her dear son's movie then you will have an idea of just how big a mess <UNK> made br br while pretty much everything is wrong with this film what ultimately <UNK> the scale to make it the worse ever and a classic <UNK> than example is its shameless <UNK> of history although the association did send a group of <UNK> to johnson county and did have a list of targeted names the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated on the morning of april 9 <UNK> nick ray and <UNK> champion were <UNK> and eventually killed by an army of about 50 <UNK> and texas hired guns who had come to johnson county to clean out <UNK> the citizens of the county then <UNK> the who finally were arrested or rescued by the army women did not <UNK> participate in the fighting and aside from ray and champion there were minimal <UNK> after all these were not <UNK> and there were not <UNK> of immigrants riding in circles around the of <UNK> early westerns to the contrary this was a film making device and not an actual <UNK> of the indians and weeks prior to the arrival of the a number of johnson county residents were <UNK> without trial including jim the keeper of a modest road ranch and his wife ella watson who <UNK> <UNK> as his two leads and he even shows living to a <UNK> old age br br there is no movie making sin greater than <UNK> history if you are going to play fast and loose with historical facts then change the names and locations to protect the unsuspecting audience members who might go away from a film believing what they saw actually happened fortunately so few people saw this film that the damage was minimal perhaps it is harsh to blame <UNK> for his <UNK> of history he could probably escape blame anyway with an insanity defense the film provides plenty of support if <UNK> was insane during the production of <UNK> gate it would explain a lot of things but my vote goes to of directing <UNK> instead of insanity br br there are some good things about <UNK> gate you can actually see on the screen where some of the huge budget went expensive sets beautiful epic camera shots <UNK> dance sequences isabelle <UNK> a strange casting choice that actually worked gives an <UNK> and likable performance although most of her scenes are extremely boring that tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer any reason to care about the characters the dialogue is generally solid if rather ordinary br br but don't fall for the crap that this film experiments with storytelling by carefully crafted moments of character interaction with <UNK> <UNK> like explosions of <UNK> action this implies that there was a method to <UNK> madness is another word for when a filmmaker gets so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible the simple fact is that there is no evidence <UNK> <UNK> a single scene or made any attempt at control or organization what it looks like is that he just turned his <UNK> loose to stage action and to get an endless selection of colorful shots 1 5 million feet of loosely staged scenes then he tried without success to <UNK> this down and fit everything together in post production br br the final battle scene is genuinely hilarious as wearing perhaps borrowed from a <UNK> on the <UNK> <UNK> company throw countless sticks of dynamite at the unfortunately each explosive falls just short of the target and explodes <UNK> after you see this happen 50 60 times you can relate to the woman the one who looks like something out of 'the <UNK> of who puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger this is probably what <UNK> mother did after writing that review br br so believe what you have been hearing about this film since 1980 it is a sloppy <UNK> poorly paced and historically distorted mess of value only as a <UNK> not to make a <UNK> example for film historians and as a source of amusement to those <UNK> about the actual history of the american west
<START> when i went to see this movie it was already a forced choice as my original intent was sold out what then was sheer terror this movie is so bad i could hardly bear it the story is not worth mention a gay <UNK> forms a gay soccer team to play against his old straight team who on discovering his sexual <UNK> gave him a hard time loaded with <UNK> old and <UNK> clichés of gays the thin plot matches perfectly the inane dialogues it is absolutely astonishing that actors as or <UNK> waste their talent and time on such nonsense 1 10
<START> in fact the nature of the whole series is funny but not always funny there are moments of extreme <UNK> as the deeper aspects of human emotion are touched on br br over and again the series comments on the <UNK> of human nature and the life long or in this case eternal struggle to overcome them monkey is both smart and stupid at the same time his arrogance and <UNK> on his own martial skills lead him into trouble in almost every episode is just plain gross sandy has a philosophical turn of mind he has many of the <UNK> lines br br the english translation is a delight ignorance can always be improved upon sandy in his laid back manner but you can't do anything to help stupidity who are you the group of <UNK> are asked we three kings of <UNK> are says monkey br br this is not just for children it is a magical romp for anyone who can suspend reality
<START> i got a chance to see this movie at an early screening in <UNK> and i have been crazy for it ever since the film is based on shakespeare's <UNK> night which i have read and loved and seen on stage a few times so i certainly liked the references but whether you like shakespeare or not it won't matter the movie stands on it's on it is super funny witty and charming amanda <UNK> is hilarious and so was david cross actually the whole cast is great i just happen to be a huge david cross fanatic the cast is hot and the soundtrack kicks lots of cool bands and a few i hadn't heard before but i know they have a cd coming out so i will definitely buy it everyone in our audience laughed from start to finish all age groups
<START> after going to sleep out of sheer loneliness <UNK> wakes from a 100 year sleep to the sounds of a new music he wants to be a part of and the band the vampire <UNK> is born his longing to end his loneliness and his living in the light attitude along with his music anger his fellow vampires and <UNK> an evil that has been <UNK> for thousands of years br br this film is not for those looking for a true book to film adaptation those who have read the books and expect to see it on the screen are in for a huge disappointment this film will appeal to those who really enjoyed the interview with the vampire film br br there are a few plot holes and but as a whole this film was satisfying stuart <UNK> portrays <UNK> with a <UNK> and <UNK> lacking in the previous film the relationships portrayed in the film were very sexy and <UNK> br br as a film the story <UNK> you and draws you in casting is wonderful loved this story and film if you like <UNK> <UNK> and sexual tension you'll love this film
<START> i think this movie lacks so much of substance it is even not worth a discussion br br in the first the package is really disgusting especially the stereotype filming and <UNK> surely joe <UNK> cinematic <UNK> was appropriate and interesting in <UNK> and small soldiers i mean the imaginative and visual pretty story telling of a spielberg <UNK> i really loved these movies but in <UNK> it was a completely failure attacks of toy soldiers and hairy creatures is simply not comparable with zombie <UNK> dead <UNK> rotten beings trying to kill the living without any logical reason just because they hate them br br zombie flicks are characteristic in plain direct unconventional and brutal cinematography nothing to be seen in joe <UNK> debut another point is the annoying content really stupid dialogs between the two main characters a gruesome exploitation of the elder brother dies and leaves the younger traumatized and bad acting and by the way <UNK> is neither scary nor gory and even less entertaining you see it is even not a horror movie br br zombie movies in the decade of their birth it the end of 60s start of the 70s used to be revolutionary provocative through its gruesome explicit content and of subtle social critic the original zombie film was actually a midnight movie named night of the living dead 1968 this one was a low budget movie that covered so many controversial themes it's hard to name them all a visual style of hitchcock <UNK> the american lifestyle of the 70s political <UNK> the upcoming breakthrough of the human rights of black people and the even more upcoming racism as a result on the side of the conservative americans remember the shooting of the black main character in the end of the movie br br if you are interested in the creativity of midnight movies and want to learn more about the most important ones i recommend you midnight movies from the <UNK> to the mainstream br br so steer clear of <UNK> and even so of romero's land of the dead
<START> the worst <UNK> ever br br this had no must see <UNK> and many crap ones at that this took place in las vegas and wwe made it's employees dress up like egyptian gods they even changed howard name to <UNK> which probably doesn't mean anything the sight of seeing jim ross in that terrible <UNK> still gives me nightmares to this day and i'm 21 years old so you could imagine it when i was 7 years old bobby was funny though br br matches included the undertaker vs giant <UNK> in a p ss poor match the <UNK> vs the <UNK> brothers in a useless match <UNK> vs crush in a comedy match and a boring match featuring razor <UNK> vs bob hulk hogan teamed up with <UNK> <UNK> to battle money inc you could clearly see hogan had a black eye in storyline purposes ted <UNK> and irs beat up hogan while he was playing poker or something like that in the <UNK> which is a poor storyline but in reality macho man randy savage hit hogan because savage thinks he's like the hulk no pun intended no not the wrestler but the film character br br the main event consisted of <UNK> hart facing off against <UNK> in a very boring main event match mr <UNK> threw salt in the face of hart and <UNK> won but not until hogan came down and <UNK> <UNK> in 21 seconds br br overall grade e
<START> uncle fred <UNK> ray once again gives us a little of his <UNK> goodness in the form of this soft core <UNK> non classic br br a <UNK> nut pair are out looking at rocks when they come across a <UNK> <UNK> a black hole as the intelligent <UNK> put it pretty soon an attractive cave girl from one million years ago happens into out time line and she <UNK> her way into the future pretty soon her <UNK> other half makes his way into the future as well and <UNK> a path through the <UNK> of the future br br ray again delivers a passable but barely <UNK> fest that has horrible acting but some decent skin yeah it's barely <UNK> but <UNK> if worse comes to worse it will cure you insomnia br br reviews 1 5 or 3 10
<START> the movie is based on a jules <UNK> book i actually have read once about ten years ago i remember i liked the book a lot and this movie does a good job in telling the story the most important thing in this movie isn't the story however but the highly original visual look it has br br the visuals are absolutely beautiful and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors stop motion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie combined by jules <UNK> own unique versions of <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> good directing results in a very well done and convincing visual style that manages to effectively hold one's attention until the end of the movie br br there are some problems as well one of the underwater scenes at the end takes maybe needlessly lot of time for example as the story in the first part of the movie is rushed through quite quickly none of this matters much though since the movie is always highly enjoyable a gem that deserves to be more well known for today's audiences as well a recommended movie for the whole family
<START> it was high time a movie about the situation in a largely ignored asian country like had to be made and beyond is hollywood's answer initially i thought hollywood would <UNK> the events of the <UNK> and add in the <UNK> hollywood spice of titanic type love between the lead heroine and the <UNK> male lead who happens to be an old man thankfully nothing of that sort was in place which may also explain why the film was not <UNK> successful br br anyway the film was honest to god and i was glad at the accuracy of events portrayed apart from the fact that filming was done outside of in <UNK> thailand and that i missed the exotic <UNK> locales i could not find much fault in the film br br you cannot blame the film for the desperation of the people and the resulting overwhelming actions it is after all real events of a civil war the music by hans <UNK> is definitely the of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection to it br br i was only a year old in now during this <UNK> time when i heard a movie was made on my real life experience which i was too young to <UNK> i had to get the dvd and needless to say i could hardly have any complaints about it as it is an eye opening wonder for me
<START> i feel conflicted about this film it is one of the most beautiful films i've seen and provides insightful looks into a lost culture there was an early scene of men in <UNK> and <UNK> sitting around a table with a woman serving and an <UNK> playing that brought tears to my eyes just because of the way it captured a way of life that must be incomprehensible to many today it presents the lives of the characters as being <UNK> bound up with the life of the village another lost concept in today's world symbolism is always fun but it seemed a little dated the fatal flaws of the movie to me were the lack of any compelling dramatic drive and a total lack of humor i never felt like i knew any of the characters beyond very basic universal things like <UNK> over the loss of a loved one etc the people were stick figures in the director's <UNK> involving natural disasters war etc the film was just one beautiful tragic scene after another with no involving narrative thread and no humanity as a result it seemed very abstract irrelevant to the lives of real people in the end i was too bored to finish watching it
<START> so it's not an award winner so what have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly the villain and this one could top the list my husband says that <UNK> and hyde together again is one of those movies that if you've been there and done that you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot i think the whole film is just fun nothing is sacred <UNK> plastic surgery howard hughes there are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate to say that the film doesn't follow the book would be true but then a lot of really good films take liberties with the published word also i recommend this movie to all the old <UNK> among us we may be smarter now but we will still recognize and laugh at many folks we knew ourselves back in the old days
<START> unfortunately i think this is one of those films that if you or i took it to the studio and said <UNK> i make this great movie with my friends mary <UNK> and <UNK> from school ' the studio would have you kicked to death on the spot however if a bunch of massive hollywood names say <UNK> i fancy a to italy with my mates how about it ' the studio writes a <UNK> br br we kick off with the casino boss from <UNK> 11 tracking down the robbers who made off with his cash and then brad pitt is <UNK> catherine zeta jones and then there's some about in <UNK> and italy and such and such and then it all ends somehow br br the film does however include the most shameful moment of both julia <UNK> and bruce <UNK> careers which is a cinematic gem i nearly <UNK> in my lap and <UNK> my eyes out when julia roberts playing tess in the movie pretends to be you guessed it julia roberts bruce willis stands about clearly wondering when he can leave and how much the <UNK> will be br br ah well to be fair i'd have done it for the cash so i suppose i can't really criticize the poor loves but i'm a <UNK> <UNK> not a hollywood legend i guess what really <UNK> me about this film is not that it is boring and pointless and has a terrible story but that i think the actors probably all had good fun doing it i think the actor's entire job is to project emotion <UNK> i feel like i paid to go to the party but had to stand outside in the rain br br watch it if you like <UNK> or fancy or something but otherwise go for a walk
<START> this movie is bad just bad in absolute terms bad br br the dialog jumps off the screen and slugs you in the face with its thoroughly artificial banter and then <UNK> on your ability to <UNK> even trace amounts of subtlety br br racism is bad racism in los angeles can be especially bad i live in the city of angels i can <UNK> to that what is so terrible about the <UNK> in los angeles is its <UNK> nature it creeps at you with a knowing glance or a <UNK> word until just at the edge of a full on fist fight it almost never comes right out and says why did he have to be black br br i can see quite clearly that the car are black the <UNK> partner is hispanic the da is white as long as there is film rolling through the <UNK> i can let the visuals music and words take me to that conclusion without just telling me the conclusion characters <UNK> and we read between the lines to make the connections and conclusions br br that is a <UNK> and trust between filmmaker and audience that trust is raped by this movie br br a good film pulls you in directions as an audience and it <UNK> you with <UNK> to drive to a point this movie beats you down with its point and insults you and your intelligence along the way my unanswered question is why did we as a society say <UNK> thank you
<START> i see there are great reviews of this film already i've got a few points to comment on reasons i thought there was something special about this film br br first and foremost the film is realistic it may not seem realistic to an adult who has forgotten what it was like being a teenager but that's really the kind of that goes on amongst teens all the time second the good guy the guy who treats women with respect doesn't get the girls that's the way it is in real life just the same he's too nice for his own good people are just selfish third it was nice to see a fat guy who had some self confidence i mean that role already takes confidence from the actor i'm not just talking about the character overall i thought the film was a positive surprise that secretly hides amongst wacky teen sex comedies at the rental shelf don't get me wrong it's not all sad it's a good laugh as well
<START> <UNK> is an out of control hard <UNK> detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas the twist here is that is literally a walking <UNK> br br the cheap low brow <UNK> of the show <UNK> its <UNK> and hidden satire that is not to say that is devoid of fart jokes just that the toilet humor is used <UNK> enough to <UNK> consistent laughs not <UNK> and eye rolls the title sequence of the program demonstrates the clever subtle humor used throughout the sequence consists of <UNK> photos of the city set to a <UNK> 70s cop theme in one photo a police <UNK> is shown and the camera <UNK> in on the front license plate <UNK> which is <UNK> the meaningless zoom in <UNK> the production of the typical 70s 80s cop drama and incidentally makes me laugh every time br br all the typical characters are included the frustrated police chief who can't control the loyal minority partner who acts as a foil to <UNK> the regular cops who <UNK> means all are <UNK> for and all are hilarious <UNK> of the typical police drama br br the voice acting primarily performed by larry murphy is nothing less than spectacular voice <UNK> and gruff with a bit of a drunken <UNK> is so clever and unique that it ranks alongside all time <UNK> like <UNK> family guy and homer simpson simpsons though the voice is <UNK> the <UNK> is somehow clear and easy to understand this is a nice change from other adult swim program voices that often require closed <UNK> to understand br br besides the fantastic production and voice acting the script is also hilarious no nonsense <UNK> <UNK> most of the humor particularly in his interactions with citizens outside the police force br br if you have access to the adult swim comedies <UNK> is certainly worth the watching each episode <UNK> in at a mere 8 9 minutes so you really have little to lose
<START> when i saw the trailers for this movie it looked like a good romantic comedy i expected some light <UNK> fun instead i was bored and a little depressed br br honestly there was no chemistry between the leads at all and the movie had little if anything that was funny about it the little girl was adorable when she cried i cried but i thought they might have used someone a little bit younger in the role br br either way the movie was filled with long dull <UNK> or <UNK> opera music i'm not anti opera but i would have preferred them to spend that time letting us get to know the characters who were all stiff and underdeveloped br br i was really disappointed in this movie the whole time i watched it i kept thinking of how much better it could have been
<START> dodgy plot dodgy script dodgy almost everything in fact the most compelling performance is that of joanna <UNK> as lauren but even that does not rescue this pointless and nasty film the director's <UNK> <UNK> to viewers is not merely to suspend disbelief but to suspend judgement br br presumably it is intended to be steamy and menacing but although the film has its erotic moments they are few and far between this sort of thing has been done better by lots of others don't go out of your way to see it
<START> i saw this film while i was in france and i must say that it confused me it is a story of a jewel thief and a young singer who each end up in <UNK> at the same time run into one another and form a connection simple enough well the problem is that this is the sort of film that has ambiguity in both <UNK> the film is not played entirely in order and in reality did what i just saw really happen or was it only a dream given those <UNK> as well as the film being <UNK> it was really hard to follow and i was not sure as to what happened at the end i imagine some deep artsy types could understand this film better than i could and it may require more than one viewing to understand
<START> when i first saw that this movie was going to be playing on tv i only new of <UNK> shore as this joke of a comedian who wore really weird outfits back in the day i still decided to watch it and i was impressed shore brings a fresh breath of air to the screen in this movie he plays crawl a college <UNK> that probably needs his own <UNK> as well carla in an underrated role plays a <UNK> farm girl with a simple family and a movie cliché boyfriend travis when she heads off to <UNK> she meets crawl and he quickly turns her into a <UNK> blonde <UNK> girl she decides to bring crawl home for the <UNK> break when travis decides to <UNK> needs a distraction crawl then decides to make everyone believe that him and are engaged already this leads to crawl <UNK> up the romance between parents <UNK> her brother and even getting the dancers at the local bar to get a little loose i'm not going to reveal the end but i liked it anyway don't rent it if you want a poignant performance rent it if you want to laugh your butt of and enjoy an often missed part of 90's humor
<START> simply put there are two parts of this series that made me cry till my eyes fell out first the part where he was set to wash the toilet but ended up drinking the toilet water while imagining it was the hot director giving him a golden shower i laughed so hard br br second the part where he tried to prove worthy of a swimming school <UNK> he seemed like a pro diving in but as expected he couldn't swim proper at least however the funny part of this was when he finally reached the end and said how was that or something that was so <UNK> hilarious i couldn't stop laughing br br if you get the chance to see this anime series i strongly recommend it one of the best i've seen br br definitely the funniest
<START> perfect double bill for the horribly corny beverly <UNK> is this equally atrocious lame <UNK> <UNK> son in law country girl rebecca goes to wild california to attend college only to be <UNK> by the lifestyle crawl helps her settle in and soon the two are good friends decides to bring the wacky crawl home for <UNK> with obvious fish out of water results br br the only other comic angle steve <UNK> <UNK> named achieves here is a sexual one this he <UNK> us with but to no <UNK> both comic aspects fail <UNK> and you know the film is <UNK> when crawl <UNK> the combine <UNK> and writes his name in the corn field br br dramatically the movie falls short too with several attempts at family and personal <UNK> from crawl <UNK> between them <UNK> shore and carla manage to raise a couple of smiles but little else while the rest of the cast are mere fodder the problem is it's nearly impossible to actually like crawl and you'll find yourself spending the whole flick wondering why rebecca would want to spend a moment with him however if you're a fan of <UNK> comedy son in law is right on the mark br br sunday november 10 1996 t v
<START> this sitcom was a big crowd in the year 1984 1985 that was a time people could see deserted streets in most of the over crowded indian cities whenever there were sitcom on indian television screens all this was the result of the setting up of television <UNK> stations across the entire indian nation this was one of the essential elements of the <UNK> of indian television network <UNK> adopted by the late indian prime minister <UNK> gandhi it was also continued by her son <UNK> gandhi this series provided clean entertainment which a large majority of indian television audience watched on their black and white television sets a funny thing about this series is that it was <UNK> by an <UNK> company dealing in <UNK> products a couple of days ago i caught sight of some episodes of this series but the overall laughter <UNK> was missing this goes on to prove that may be with the ever changing passage of time entertainment material lose their charm and hold over people's minds
<START> <UNK> writing really has more in common with <UNK> and <UNK> than with fantasy adventure writers so it's curious that <UNK> travels has been deemed a children's novel lucky <UNK> br br the same applies to this movie there have been some really awful versions of this story which must be why people are reluctant to look at this version i mean it's a tv movie and it comes from jim <UNK> so how should we expect anything but <UNK> br br look again beauty turns up in the <UNK> places children love this movie enough to sit through all three hours of it but it also takes the time to get <UNK> dark vision right i hate special effects but here they are used to carry the story forward instead of just dazzling us please note that the producers took the trouble to <UNK> classical actors like john gielgud and peter o'toole who perform their eccentric roles with perfection br br dramatically the romance between <UNK> and is rendered touching and poignant as well as funny she's a little girl but twenty times his size the frame story has a theme about absent fathers that many children will relate to and the part about <UNK> in the asylum introduces an element of horror dealing with the abuse of authority apparently <UNK> from val <UNK> <UNK> 1946 another forgotten masterpiece br br the vhs is always turning up in the bargain bin for a few cents which is an insult to the many great artists who put this thing together i encourage audiences to recognize a good thing by getting this movie and inspiring others to watch it although it has a lot to offer children grown ups will find that it stands up nicely to such classics as <UNK> brazil 1984 and other serious fantastic works
<START> the script is very weak there is no depth in the characters the story telling is not the <UNK> thing here the unnecessary action scenes does not really help this one one of the worst movies in history of films
<START> it is unfortunate that between this film in the valley of lions for <UNK> and home of the brave seem to all be based upon common stereotypes about veterans from the wars in iraq and afghanistan the <UNK> the fighting the short <UNK> the broken <UNK> guys freaking out and digging a <UNK> in their front yard when they're drunk etc etc etc br br does it happen yes but not as often as one would think after having watched any of these movies i think that it is unfortunate that these directors producers writers choose to <UNK> their axe against the political establishment by portraying soldiers in such an <UNK> way in this particular film <UNK> didn't even throw us a bone like showing the new children that were born while a family member was <UNK> or the kid who grew up in some ghetto who can now afford college thanks to the <UNK> bill or the couple who can afford a house or start a new business earn their <UNK> etc etc etc instead we are treated to the stereotypes because the people who made this film only want to show you the bad side br br a couple of issues with the film itself 1 somebody screwed up by putting <UNK> in for a <UNK> star with v after he led his squad down a tight <UNK> after having been <UNK> by a <UNK> in a taxi pretty stupid but yes it happens 2 the didn't have any <UNK> armor so we are supposed to believe it is a near the beginning of the war yet every soldier and their brother has an and every possible <UNK> for their <UNK> sorry don't think so 3 timothy <UNK> as a lieutenant colonel it's hard to believe but i just checked an he turned 40 in may so the timing isn't too off 4 he strikes two soldiers to escape being sent to jail after saying that he wouldn't return to iraq upon having learned that he had been stop so he's a fugitive then when he finally turns himself in at the end and they take him back he keeps his rank and <UNK> with the same unit sorry don't think so br br i can only describe it as one giant stereotype of the army and the <UNK> do some of the events portrayed in this movie happen to some soldiers yes however in this film you get practically every stereotype in the space of about 100 minutes and really things just aren't like that for most soldiers returning i wish the director had made a point of doing a little better research instead of starting off with her agenda and then making a film br br of the movies i mentioned at the beginning of this post the best one is probably lions for <UNK> which is more a commentary on the sad state of generation y than it is about the wars in iraq or afghanistan or the bush administration if you really want to see this film wait for cable or netflix it don't pay cash directly to rent it
<START> james stewart plays dr ben <UNK> who with his wife and son are tourists in an <UNK> city they get caught up in the middle of a murder scene the victim <UNK> something in dr <UNK> ear and he is told to do something br br later his son is kidnapped the <UNK> turn out to be a man and woman he knew but the woman is a bit <UNK> than the man br br the song <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whatever we'll be we'll be is one of the best songs ever sung in any movie br br doris day <UNK> stewart's wife and she sings the song mentioned above her performance is oscar worthy i'm surprised she wasn't even nominated br br my score 8 10
<START> a bare faced rip off of <UNK> and not fit to clean its shoes the word <UNK> must have invented for just such an occasion as this <UNK> is wooden as always his moments of <UNK> are laughable as is his accent the is not that at all as we've had so many <UNK> and by the end we're simply <UNK> to flesh rotting and otherwise altogether a real mess
<START> i can not believe i even wasted a netflix rental on this complete piece of crap how long did it take to make this film 15 minutes on a budget of what fifteen bucks i can spend a few hours with my <UNK> camcorder and come up with something better than this <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and it's even available on dvd a very sad thing to think classics like the <UNK> have not been released on dvd but this <UNK> of steaming dung makes it to the format here's hoping my rating of one one one one makes the overall already pathetic rating of 2 5 go down
<START> though not exactly a comedy in the usual sense of the word this more rewarding than any movie full of laughs but devoid of substance i don't think <UNK> movies can be easily <UNK> under narrow genres even the <UNK> are quite complex this movie in spite of its light touch poses a series of problems related to marriage and its shortcomings and what happens when the flames start to die etc i don't really communicate personally with all these issues as i am sure others do but the atmosphere of the movie is extraordinary you almost wish it not to end i have to admit that i was swept away by the bergman of the fifties having come to know most of his later groundbreaking efforts before <UNK> von <UNK> etc the master produced some of the <UNK> warm and touching movies i have ever seen though it's a long shot i have seen this kind of love for human kind in its complexity only in <UNK> movies of the same period a lesson in love alongside smiles of a summer night are worth seeing for bergman fans to have the full image of the man's <UNK> and for those who love cinema with a heart may he rest in peace
<START> i had borrowed the three sarah movies from a friend and had watched them while sick in bed during one weekend i thoroughly enjoyed every one of them i enjoyed how the last movie gave a glimpse of what <UNK> and his sister were like when they grew up in addition i liked the carry through of the billy boy song that first was heard during the credits of the first movie the title sarah plain and tall however the one thing in <UNK> end that i didn't like was the youngest daughter she was a very cute little girl but she just had too much spirit and looked like a brat compared to the other kids even compared to <UNK> but still good natured <UNK> when he was younger
<START> i just got the dvd for <UNK> wars in a shiny new package looking <UNK> stuck it in my dvd player to find a slew of extra fun stuff the extra content on the dvd is even longer than the movie for those of you that have shame never seen <UNK> wars it one fantastically silly star wars spoof of episode iv of course household <UNK> such as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> maker stand in for <UNK> fighters x wings <UNK> and the death star instead of princess leia we have princess ann <UNK> complete with <UNK> you get the point i'm sure mad silliness and a fun ride for any star wars geek like me br br now the dvd wow a director's commentary where he basically goes off on the movie making fun of himself and the project throughout an interview with on creature features remember that and hilarious director's cut and foreign version of the movie all jokes of course anyway this is great i loved <UNK> wars in the theater and am so glad for having the dvd in my collection <UNK> in between mst3k the movie and thumb wars
<START> man is it great just to see young and the restless star melody thomas scott as something other than <UNK> <UNK> newman a doctor with a brain no less and super nice to see her with the likes of the gorgeous <UNK> lamas instead of victor newman br br mel plays a college professor of <UNK> <UNK> who goes to the islands with her son for spring break only to find herself a prisoner of the island <UNK> with a rapidly <UNK> virus handy for her there is the hunky character played by <UNK> who has a daughter just her son's age br br mel shines as does <UNK> with a bit of the overacting from the younger couple interesting premise in these times of chemical and <UNK> terrorism talk worthwhile seeing especially for y r fans
<START> i don't know where most of you were at but where i watched the film we didn't have people singing as some have told they experienced we had people laughing mostly at the campy plot line the horrible dance sequences and the singing of the likes of brosnan the only people in the audience who seemed to be enthralled with the film were the seventies generation folks who were some how <UNK> the past with the songs i was a dj in the seventies and even went to the <UNK> concert at <UNK> in <UNK> in <UNK> of <UNK> so i did appreciate them then and i still do now but this film should have gone the same way as their <UNK> and ended in divorce the sequences were so poorly staged the dubbing and editing absolutely horrible and this has to be <UNK> worst production i cannot believe an academy award winner would <UNK> so low as to do this piece of garbage so save your money wait for it to come out on dvd and then maybe spend your money on something better like cat <UNK>
<START> the only good thing of this movie is its final twist in <UNK> minutes of film we can only save one single idea which was totally wasted in this movie i must say for more than 90 minutes this film is just a collection of clichés bad acting stupid ideas and <UNK> complete lack of suspense stupid deaths terrible special effects all this in a pathetic and unoriginal until the last three minutes where finally a good idea appeared it's nothing outstanding or an extremely original idea but at least was a decent good idea the only one the entire movie has i won't spoil it but i must say i think that idea with a better plot better fx and definitely a better acting would turn into a good film if you watch this movie and can stand it until the end you will know what it
<START> except for the glossy look this show had little to recommend it the writing was <UNK> and convoluted without exception the characters were shallow and unsympathetic the female characters came off the worst reduced to spoiled selfish <UNK> whose soul ambition was to run around in slip dresses and and try to bag a man this aspect of the show is all the more curious as the series was produced by two women the acting for the most part was dull and <UNK> with the cast playing one dimensional characters attacking every scene on the same note this is not entirely the actors fault had they spent more time developing the characters and the storyline adding a little <UNK> of style and humour <UNK> might have been a hit what we're left with is something flat and vaguely unpleasant
<START> this enjoyable euro western opens with a scene that <UNK> a similar scene that sergio <UNK> wanted to shoot for once upon a time in the west but couldn't <UNK> clint eastwood to appear in three tough looking <UNK> ride into a town one is dressed like the man with no name in a <UNK> another is dressed like colonel <UNK> from for a few dollars more and the third is <UNK> like <UNK> except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it our hero meets them in main street behind a <UNK> loaded with three <UNK> any gun can play is a spaghetti western with an in joke on spaghetti westerns since the hero here <UNK> out the three killers aside from a little too much comedy especially in the <UNK> fight sequences this is an above average <UNK> br br the notorious mexican outlaw gilbert <UNK> of and his gang of trigger happy rob an army train <UNK> 300 thousand dollars in gold <UNK> across the frontier director <UNK> g <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> stages the hold up from a variety of camera angles that thrust you into the <UNK> of the action the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> along with the coach carrying the gold and separate it from the rest of the train that houses the u s <UNK> while and his <UNK> keep the <UNK> <UNK> down <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> kills the engineer and his crew and <UNK> it away leaving the other behind to <UNK> for themselves essentially double crosses and steals the gold for himself later catches up with at the <UNK> <UNK> before the <UNK> can reveal the <UNK> of the <UNK> to however a <UNK> sergeant shoots dead before he dies tells about a <UNK> that serves as a clue about where he <UNK> the treasure the <UNK> <UNK> captain of <UNK> <UNK> but he cannot <UNK> the tongue even after he uses his whip on him <UNK> by <UNK> the captain threatens to have the mexican shot if he doesn't talk meanwhile the let a priest speak to but he really isn't a priest the six gun <UNK> stranger george hilton of the ruthless four <UNK> as a man of the cloth and <UNK> from a firing squad unfortunately before is rescued <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of tv's <UNK> sunset strip takes the <UNK> away from him and keeps it for himself <UNK> is the bank representative that was sent to <UNK> the gold he is horrified that the captain wants to shoot <UNK> career at the bank <UNK> on his ability to recover the gold the stranger stages a fire at the <UNK> to distract the firing squad and takes the captain as hostage and tries to escape but the stranger shoots him off the horse before the authorities can <UNK> that is dead the stranger claims the body for the handsome reward he will receive and he rides out with the <UNK> <UNK> thanks no sooner have they left the <UNK> than men show up to rescue him from the stranger from this point on the stranger and <UNK> <UNK> short lived <UNK> among each other as they search for the gold <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who has penned a number of spaghetti westerns such as a few dollars for <UNK> and another <UNK> <UNK> seven for a massacre rely on clever humor and surprise <UNK> to keep the action fresh and fast paced one cool scene has <UNK> <UNK> at a table about to eat his meal when he hears some suspicious sounds from behind him <UNK> <UNK> his drink on the table and sees the <UNK> behind him with six guns br br any gun can play lives up to its title in fact many guns do play and at least twenty or more corpses pile up before fade out this western isn't so much a parody as it is a knock off of sergio <UNK> the good the bad and the ugly mind you bad guys and good guys fall as frequently as ten <UNK> in a <UNK> alley but their deaths aren't depicted in the brutal fashion of a <UNK> western any gun can play doesn't take itself as seriously as the aforementioned <UNK> masterpiece the three leads <UNK> back and forth for supremacy each has a piece of the puzzle that will lead them to the treasure but they refuse to share their information until the <UNK> up finale <UNK> <UNK> colorful widescreen photography is spectacular especially the opening shots of the train along <UNK> tracks with distant mountain peaks up dramatically in the background another great shot occurs when <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> calm this scene happens after the stranger has rescued and the <UNK> arrive to save their bacon <UNK> the <UNK> six gun takes aim at the <UNK> clad tough guy and <UNK> the revolver placing his well aimed bullets <UNK> in and around the <UNK> <UNK> who photographed world war ii thriller <UNK> <UNK> frames the scene with the stranger in the background and his pistol in hand in the <UNK> for a pleasing three dimensional style shot meanwhile <UNK> de lively <UNK> soundtrack is as memorable for its own <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> were for the <UNK> westerns the opening song is reminiscent of a 1950's hollywood western with its catchy lyrics and guitar <UNK> although it isn't a major spaghetti western any gun can play is always entertaining nonsense with interesting plot twists and good performances especially the <UNK> gilbert <UNK> who was <UNK> years old at the time
<START> warning spoilers although it's hard to spoil this film by telling story details br br <UNK> black and white propaganda film is not for everyone it's very old and it's er clumsy what makes it great for me is the soundtrack not the original but the updated soundtrack better still the <UNK> version created my favorite performance is by fritz <UNK> and the chicago <UNK> br br the film is actually funny in places it's reminiscent of the old <UNK> <UNK> dream some of the <UNK> scenes are quite magnificent some of the actors are also quite magnificent the actor who played <UNK> could have been a superstar today <UNK> for the warrior chick definitely a rocker br br this may be the world's best collection on film of <UNK> russian <UNK> there are tons of them they make up the bulk of the spoken lines br br the battle scenes actually look much more realistic than most high budget hollywood <UNK> these guys are as clumsy with their fighting as real <UNK> would be the weapons look nasty so the actors were probably trying to avoid actually <UNK> one another br br the actor playing the german grand marshall is trying really hard to look scary early in the film but he looks like he was really a <UNK> after he's captured he looks so pathetic speaks volumes about the intended audience da br br a really humorous touch is that the german army brings an <UNK> with it played by a character in a black <UNK> watch the russians bring this guy down while he's playing br br after the battle is over and almost all of the germans are dead comes the best part of the film and the music the song sung to the dead soldiers who've died defending the <UNK> this part is so sad it's almost an anti war statement br br ten times as many men as ladies have rated this film wonder why br br warning joseph <UNK> liked this film ironic he killed more russians than anybody those who come to russia carrying a sword will die by the sword
<START> valley girl will always hold a special place in my heart i would say this is certainly the best of the 80's teen sex comedies but that is a back handed compliment this is a good movie period it is very specific in time and place nearly twenty years later this is a marvelous <UNK> yet its story remains timeless this is just romeo and juliet minus the death after all nicolas cage is wonderful showing all the early promise that it turns out he has <UNK> on overblown action <UNK> deborah <UNK> is the revelation of this movie and i can't believe she didn't go on to have a bigger career someone <UNK> her quick this is <UNK> and <UNK> than most films of the genre the requisite nudity seems thrown in by <UNK> <UNK> and while not groundbreaking it certainly is nice to see this kind of movie that respects its characters and doesn't <UNK> its shallow young girls for having fun even <UNK> crew of best friends misguided by <UNK> pressure are never presented as villains indeed her friend <UNK> forced to w <UNK> friend fred has a good time despite her <UNK> and makes out w fred in the <UNK> this will take you back to the early 80's if you were there but it holds up quite well today warning to those unfamiliar with the movie do not watch one of <UNK> seemingly <UNK> <UNK> of it go rent it in its <UNK> glory otherwise you are missing some of the <UNK> most potent time specific dialogue and one can't write about valley girl and not mention the soundtrack of great 80's tunes most of them by one hit wonders which are not only integral to the sense of time and place in this movie but <UNK> well chosen see it awesome little flick <UNK>
<START> this is one of my favorite series all categories all time br br i was fortunate enough to get a hold of the whole series on vhs a few years ago i loved it when i saw it back in <UNK> <UNK> when i was about 12 i love it as much or more today which is remarkable considering my hopefully improved film appreciation and criticism skills most of the movies i liked back then i'm not that fond of today besides for the nostalgia factor that factor is present here as well but there's so much more to robin of <UNK> than nostalgia br br there are only a few bad things about this series first the picture and sound quality is so so at least in the first couple of episodes fortunately it gets better secondly you could have wished for a bit more blood and realism in the fighting scenes although i know that was not an option in this case br br so on to the good things and there are a lot of them first of all michael is robin hood i don't think i have seen him in a single role since then which only <UNK> this fact for me he delivers such a believable performance as robin jason connery had an impossible task replacing him the fact that michael hasn't become a bigger name as an actor is unbelievable or perhaps that was his fate to do this one role perfectly then disappear br br i love <UNK> <UNK> sheriff of <UNK> he is really not a complex character but totally rotten the relation between him and is just hilarious actually just looking at de sitting in his throne bored glaring makes me laugh even before he has said anything another actor that deserves extra praise is ray <UNK> as will scarlet you can really feel the sadness inside of him as well as his hate for the soldiers who killed his wife <UNK> is an actor that finally has gotten his well deserved hollywood breakthrough in films as the <UNK> and beowulf there are a lot of other great actors here too br br i love the portrayal of the robin gang they are having fun playing laughing you really get a feel of the <UNK> between them the <UNK> that comes from a tight bound group such as this those bonding scenes are so important br br i think that it being uk produced with british actors really made it better compared to for example the <UNK> feature film version with kevin <UNK> that just feels fake fake fake christian slater as will scarlet come on the cast being able to speak english with british accent makes it more believable and i get the feeling that the actors as well as the director and writers behind the series can put themselves much more into the shoes of the robin hood gang than an american crew could have the music is wonderful is perfect for the feel of the series the music is another of those things they just nailed br br an exciting addition also is the fantasy and magic spice that is put in there it's not over the top but believable and just makes the whole thing better and more interesting i also love how nicely the mix of comedy adventure and drama is <UNK> br br those are a few of the things that makes this series so alive and so genuine it's by far the best robin hood version i have ever seen i won't wrap up with the <UNK> forgotten quote but one thing that never will be forgotten for me is this fantastic robin hood retelling see it
<START> usually a movie that starts bad stays bad in a <UNK> pattern this bad movie started to seem to get better before going into a <UNK> dive the acting save for the male antagonist was awful the plot was essentially a set up for the final main scene which is probably good as performance art but it was wasted in this movie not sure why this movie was made
<START> i live in mexico city so i have to suffer the trailers for every piece of trash that comes out from all these stupid mexican filmmakers you want to admire a mexican guy for making great films take a look at something by <UNK> del toro specially the devil's <UNK> or maybe <UNK> <UNK> though i really don't like his films but i respect them br br mexican filmmakers often produce some of the most terrible utter trash ever <UNK> la <UNK> el <UNK> <UNK> american <UNK> but this is one of the lowest points in mexican films ever if you respect your brain please avoid this piece of at all costs it would be more intelligent to watch some video of a wedding or to watch <UNK> reality show that's got more iq than everyone in this <UNK>
<START> this movie must have looked when it was being pitched at development stage and getting a redgrave and a <UNK> on board must have excited the money men all i can say is that they clearly did not have anything on that week <UNK> camps it up in the way that only <UNK> can do and i thought that he seemed to more of the actor that he <UNK> in his cameo role in <UNK> a few years back <UNK> jones is not exactly bad he is just clearly out of his depth as a leading man he is really quite <UNK> throughout and if this was a pilot for a tv series it may have just got picked up however the and the camera work were appalling quite why this and a press officer from the met would ever work together is never explained it certainly cannot have been because of the sexual chemistry of which there is none there is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and far fetched plot that you can pass off as original but the whole thing is just so contrived that the two stories just do not make sense at all it was like two stories <UNK> edited in to one just to make up two hours go watch some paint dry for a couple of hours you life will be more <UNK> than watching this rubbish
<START> this is a movie that deserves another look if you haven't seen it for a while or a first look if you were too young when it came out 1983 based on a play by the same name it is the story of an older actor who heads a <UNK> shakespearean <UNK> company in england during world war ii it deals with his stress of trying to perform a shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors the young able <UNK> ones being taken for military service it also deals with his relationship with various members of his company especially with his <UNK> so far it all sounds rather dull but nothing could be further from the truth while tragic overall the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high throughout the two male leads both received oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly so i strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama theater especially shakespeare or who has ever worked <UNK> in any capacity the <UNK> goings on make up another <UNK> of the movie that will be fascinating to most viewers
<START> jack <UNK> is riveting as a marine <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the d i <UNK> play sgt jim moore a tough but fair marine whose job it is to prepare young teens for possible combat no one could have played this role any better that jack <UNK> as a former marine i can assure that this is the most accurate film dealing with basic training in the <UNK> extremely entertaining
<START> this was another one of those shows that i watched to root out the positive elements and because i've been a nick fan for years some of those would be the stage sets b plots guest stars and a few of the main actors that were good i <UNK> in the show through high school as i quickly grew to despise jamie spears along with the other chicks in the show that can't act the only characters i seemed to like were dustin quinn <UNK> michael logan quinn is a perfect <UNK> that eventually started to fit in <UNK> is a complete oddball dustin gets put through a bunch of strange random situations and michael is kind of the comic relief right hand man of logan there's a remarkable difference between the execution acting quality of the b plots that involve them and the a plots that <UNK> a bunch of <UNK> girls and an iconic miss perfect repeating bad lines and <UNK> over guys this show would have been great if the main plots contained the quality of the side plots but the main plots just don't deliver anything when it recently came back in reruns and i tried to watch it again i was more <UNK> towards the girls' abysmal acting and had to change the channel however i will give the previously listed characters credit because they did make the show more or less worth my time
<START> do not rent this movie i ended up buying the previously viewed tape of this for 4 00 that was close to the price of a rental so thought i might as well buy it i'm <UNK> it out after i finish this review the movie which stars lowe is a music video with few lines of dialogue slow moving shots and poorly done editing i thought i'd be seeing a mindless action flick which is what i wanted to see i didn't even get that this movie is an exercise in slow moving shots no script close ups terrible edited and a poorly developed plot i can't believe that is actually ends with a scene in which they think the audience cares about the characters by the end of the movie we still don't even really know who they are believe the hype stay away
<START> it is a story as old as man the jealousy for another man's wife and <UNK> there are even <UNK> against it br br in this story raymond <UNK> perry mason <UNK> is the manager of a runner plantation who <UNK> after the owners wife and feels that he isn't treated with respect the wife the <UNK> barbara <UNK> who was trying to make a comeback after a string of <UNK> affairs was <UNK> after <UNK> who killed her husband paul <UNK> br br but lurking about was a strange woman the <UNK> <UNK> who sees everything and who was capable of some voodoo to avenge the <UNK> which also included another young woman carol to whom <UNK> also <UNK> love br br <UNK> is <UNK> and becomes or thinks he becomes a gorilla <UNK> will have to mate with kong if she ever wants her marriage <UNK> as he goes into the jungle every night br br the end is predictable but the stirring question of this film is why <UNK> would ever be afraid with those <UNK> pointed <UNK> <UNK> out from her chest no animal could get near her to do harm
<START> the rise of punk music was <UNK> documented on film and most people tend to focus on the happenings of other cities such as london or new york penelope managed to <UNK> a <UNK> of los angeles circa <UNK> which proves a vibrant and diverse art music community had <UNK> which <UNK> any other to some the bands read like a who's who of now legendary american punk black flag x circle <UNK> <UNK> fear <UNK> argue that vital bands were missed <UNK> <UNK> and that the movie was the cause of an <UNK> of suburban <UNK> and macho violence however the issues touched upon in the film remain relevant the intensity of the music remains <UNK> and the influence continues to be seen and heard in the <UNK> fashions of today
<START> i must say i didn't expect much about this movie but it turned out not to be bad at all most striking of course was <UNK> <UNK> performance i would never expect to see this fine actor as an action hero the great thing about it is that he really builds up his character i mean it was not like mel gibson or bruce willis would do it he was sensitive and modest for example he's really upset when he kills someone i also noticed that some clichés were avoided when gets his training you would easily expect him to be a rebel and act like any average american would do in such a situation ask what the f is going on and <UNK> to <UNK> but is a professional marine officer he doesn't give up and he tries not to lose his courage in which he succeeds pretty well except for a brief break down on christmas eve which i think was very realistic i'm glad that <UNK> quinn got this opportunity to show another side of him in fact two because he plays the villain as well even although the film wasn't that successful
<START> this movie had the potential to be a decent thriller but it was <UNK> by only having about twenty minutes worth of good script which was mostly used up in the beginning after that holes started to appear in the story that one could drive a truck through the movie followed a <UNK> <UNK> from good to ordinary to bad to ludicrous by the time it <UNK> it's not recommended
<START> now this is a real turkey by the overrated director franco who gave us such classics as las <UNK> <UNK> yes i think that bad films can be great fun i adore the hilarious <UNK> of doris <UNK> and ed wood jr but this one proved to be too much for me it is the first film i rated 1 where should i start the screenplay is idiotic to the <UNK> the dialogue is unbelievably bad the directing seems to be nonexistent the best music cue used repeatedly in this film was taken directly from the movie der 1964 and it's boring poor shirley <UNK> and george sanders in one shot sanders reads a <UNK> comic while his henchman torture a girl this aspect is probably the intellectual highlight of this movie the only thing that <UNK> me was that franco promptly showed female nudity whenever i thought the movie would gain from it this is real directing skill still i'm afraid that a movie in which actors pretend to shoot with machine guns by shaking them is not really worthwhile
<START> a great cast a fantastic cgi monster and a brilliant script if this film had had any of those things then it might not have been amongst the worst films i've ever wasted an hour and a half on <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> have not yet written the complete works of shakespeare but along the way this has appeared in their waste paper bin and somehow it got made into a movie you can tell the the actors regret <UNK> those <UNK> with every word they <UNK> directly into camera the cgi is amateurish in the extreme and they might have created more tension of the cast had been attacked with the <UNK> spectrum it was created on i wanted to like this film it has nice cameo appearances by <UNK> gerard and walter <UNK> so i expected a fun horror movie that didn't take itself too seriously it actually does try to take itself seriously but is about as much fun as trip to the dentist do yourself a favour don't watch this movie you'll only encourage them to make more
<START> how much can you really say about a <UNK> with teeth the plot was really out there but it was something campy to see on a friday night the story has a lot of unexpected twists and it's a great way to offend all you're conservative friends
<START> this was a romantic simple funny movie i really enjoyed it and would definitely say to watch it and enjoy it will smith was funny nervous sweet and just a simple guy who got hit by love it was cute to see him fall for someone and be so nervous and lost as to what to do or say it was great he was great funny as usual eva <UNK> was better than i expected her to be as well i thought there were moments in the movie where will got the <UNK> he was doing everything he could being a good guy and still getting treated bad the ending was romantic and happy and it was great i have seen it several times and would watch it again a funny movie something you don't see a lot of anymore it had the old time feel with a fresh new look
<START> my spoiler is in my pants because thinking about this movie made me so angry i <UNK> myself br br once you finish watching it you stare at the tv set in confusion and horror then there's a soft tap on your shoulder and a voice <UNK> you will die in seven days you turn around and one of your best friends is standing there with a look of absolute hatred for the one that suggested this movie when you were in blockbuster br br i won't lie this is the worst movie on the face of the earth i saw it with 5 of my friends all 18 year old guys and these were our reactions one person actually began crying and <UNK> himself one person screamed and passed out one person stood up and <UNK> out the front door to <UNK> more than an hour later one person simply <UNK> out this one was me one person started <UNK> <UNK> as if he had both cerebral <UNK> and syndrome one person went into a sort of <UNK> <UNK> and did not respond to our voices for more than twenty minutes br br the movie really is that bad there's one part where the retarded cameraman actually <UNK> while holding the camera but the producers decided to leave it in seriously you can hear him <UNK> and swear when he hits the ground there's only one special effect and it's special in the same way that a retarded kid trying to solve a cube is special the camera <UNK> so that the on screen action action n some <UNK> lost in a corn field for 80 freaking minutes does a barrel roll br br under no circumstances should it be watched and the movie itself even warns you of this fact do you know what the <UNK> on the back is some <UNK> should not be ignored i honestly think that the release of this movie to the public is a sick practical joke on the <UNK> part that's not to say however that you should pass it by if you see it at the movie store it would then sit on the shelf for some other poor sucker to see rather buy every copy of it you can get your hands on and mail them to people that you hate
<START> this movie shows what you can create if you have a camera some spare paint and cardboard a toy ship a few friends who acted in community theater and the incorrect notion you can make a film the end result is an unwatchable time <UNK> that you'll skip through unless you take it out of the dvd player and toss it through the window first br br the acting in the opening scene especially by the <UNK> lee morgan as and the toy ship crashing into the rocks before the credits is a good <UNK> of what you're in for with all the <UNK> it looks like this special effect was shot in a kitchen sink i guess figured he save some cash by <UNK> the <UNK> at the same time in terms of bad cinema the funny thing is <UNK> of <UNK> seems to have inspired maybe by coincidence the twist ending of <UNK> the hands of fate yep it's the same lame i was the victim and now i take the mad <UNK> place ironic ending the bigger irony is that two inept talentless filmmakers could make two equally wretched texas filmed horror movies and get away with it br br <UNK> nerd russ harvey is a noble in a great family line why they were great is never <UNK> boring us while <UNK> the death of his family line and <UNK> before his ship even crashes we're also treating to a <UNK> narration throughout the film sadly we aren't so lucky his family's toy ship crashes into some <UNK> in a sink and he's washed <UNK> with his <UNK> captain and some woman conveniently <UNK> on a mad <UNK> island br br meanwhile the count is visited by an evil spirit who dressed in a magic <UNK> outfit <UNK> him with various puppets <UNK> snakes bats all the <UNK> stuff the count william overacts worse than shatner and has a <UNK> difficult time keeping a straight face through the typical madman <UNK> br br i'd be mad too if i had to be in this disaster the woman is promptly killed by the <UNK> <UNK> dogs and the two <UNK> are captured by his <UNK> the count <UNK> them of being pirates apparently his worst fear he <UNK> his <UNK> around a lot apparently his greatest joy <UNK> gets tortured there's a woman who's a servant and one who's a nurse the rotting <UNK> <UNK> in a wedding dress <UNK> in the <UNK> she <UNK> the nerdy noble and is the only effective creepy thing in the movie a lot of inane dialogue at a <UNK> room table the captain gets killed while making a pathetic <UNK> to watching a <UNK> battle a pack of lions it's all an ugly <UNK> to me i spent most of my time on the fast forward button br br anyway the jerk noble and nurse make a <UNK> and think they're going to be rescued by three guys in a <UNK> on the lake yeah we're supposed to believe a lake is the ocean they don't since the <UNK> hair turned gray and he scares the would be <UNK> away honestly i think they simply took the opportunity to row away from this hideous film while the had the chance they head back to the castle the nurse starts rotting like the <UNK> and your stomach by this time and we end with these two getting ready to <UNK> into the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> br br i love old lousy horror films but they must have some sort of entertainment value i feel ripped off even at the low low price of 5 99 for this <UNK> mystery science theater would have a tough time making this one fun i was taken in by a few nutty reviewers who claimed this film had atmosphere and some creepy moments wrong avoid this tripe at all costs and don't even waste a buck if you find it in a dollar bin somewhere this movie makes <UNK> the terror like like a masterpiece of horror and atmosphere
<START> everybody seems to compare this to the matrix and the 13th floor and when i first saw it i would have agreed i was expecting the matrix and was a little disappointed but upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immensely br br the thing to keep in mind is that the matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical <UNK> <UNK> thrown in the 13th floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical <UNK> <UNK> thrown in is not an action movie at all and is not as many seem to believe about reality or any such deep concept it's about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial both in its origin and in its behavior world of make believe br br the most chilling moment in the movie is when <UNK> repeats her scripted line it's at that point you realize that the people in the game have <UNK> <UNK> their free will in order to participate in a story this is made even more frightening at the end when <UNK> <UNK> or rather his player comments on the possibility of spending one's life in the game i sympathize completely with the <UNK> philosophy that providing interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct <UNK> path to the end goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence living in the game is not living at all but is a <UNK> way to spend one's time on earth as comments about the real world there's nothing going on here might as well jack into someone else's imagination and pretend to be doing something interesting although i have to ask whether <UNK> considers this a self <UNK> considering that he himself offers up worlds to be experienced in 90 minute snippets br br upon leaving the theater after first watching this movie i thought it was one of those movies that was watchable only to see how it ended but having seen it a couple more times thank you scifi channel i've realized how much deeper it goes seriously if you've only seen it once it deserves another viewing
<START> the recent death of stephen bach one of the producers of <UNK> gate has raised the <UNK> of at least a partial <UNK> of the reputation of the cursed film moreover the original release the long version was recently shown on tcm exposing the film in <UNK> to its largest audience ever br br i saw the film when it first came out at a packed screening in a 3rd <UNK> cinema across the street from i think it was released on a friday and <UNK> on the following <UNK> maybe that wasn't a fair release but it was and is a terrible film seeing the full length version recently confirmed that judgment and with some thirty years more experience watching and writing about films i am better able to <UNK> why br br first there is the <UNK> phrase <UNK> en scene whose definition is at the same time so simple yet so <UNK> that it <UNK> even after being defined basically it's everything that happens in front of a camera for example a crowd extra will be given a piece of action say just walking by on the sidewalk and a spot to start from when the assistant director yells action the extra will go through their action if there's another take the extra will return to the start spot and go again on action all of the extras do this then say a cab drives up to the sidewalk and the star gets out and <UNK> another principal while all the while the crowd extras are doing their thing this is <UNK> en scene in the theatre they call it <UNK> but cinema is far more multi dimensional br br the importance of defining <UNK> en scene is because when the french critics developed their theory of the auteur the opposite of an auteur was a en scene even more referred to as a traffic cop an auteur was <UNK> involved in the meaning of a film and through the director's body of work a theme or themes <UNK> the en scene was basically a company man rendering in film what had been handed to him on paper it is the difference between say john ford and sam wood br br the second point is how the director michael <UNK> got into the position of directing films <UNK> first gained <UNK> directing the first million dollar tv commercial this depicted a <UNK> floating down the grand <UNK> in <UNK> this commercial never appears on any lists of greatest tv commercials of all time and is notable solely because of how expensive it was and how utterly exaggerated it was the effect is like that of a three year old girl brought out to entertain company who gets her biggest response when she <UNK> her dress over her head cute for a three year old embarrassing for a thirty year old so <UNK> was praised early on for spending a huge amount of money for some over the top image and so he learned br br his first film <UNK> and <UNK> 1974 has a scene where clint eastwood and jeff bridges are passengers in a <UNK> car that drives back and forth back and forth until it drives off the road and the driver opens the <UNK> full of <UNK> which he proceeds to shoot one by one i had the feeling that if the producer eastwood hadn't stepped in that the scene would have lasted until every rabbit had been killed br br which brings us to <UNK> gate i guess if one watches the film on a dvd in <UNK> like a mini series it can be impressive this is because scenes are directed with such a dense <UNK> en scene that each scene is like an <UNK> it's just plain <UNK> to sit through nearly four hours of this its like sex at some point it just becomes a <UNK> there is the opening 40 minutes which takes place at <UNK> brilliantly photographed at <UNK> it is something of a non <UNK> i personally favor the artistic way of unfolding a story as opposed to the more commercial now i'm gonna tell you what i'm gonna tell you of most films however the whole <UNK> adds up to only one line kris kristofferson and john hurt went to <UNK> together now twenty years all of that time money and effort not to mention all of the <UNK> attention and energy just to deliver this almost useless piece of information br br then there's the scene in the street between kristofferson and which just goes on and on with a populated city of background extras and horse drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver a tiny bit of <UNK> information it's just so <UNK> there is just one scene after another like this it's like trying to eat a thirty pound pizza then there are these long conversations of <UNK> details and <UNK> witless dialogue which go on and on and are <UNK> and boring br br of course any single scene <UNK> looks brilliant overall it's a rich piece to spin <UNK> <UNK> about seen in <UNK> with the possibility of fast <UNK> through the boring bits or turning it off if feeling <UNK> en scene whipped it's basically <UNK> but don't let anybody tell you it's a good film when i saw it in 1980 there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene where kris kristofferson is on his horse and he turns one way and then the other and does this about six times that's symbolic he said of he doesn't know which way to go that is basically at its <UNK> the basis of every pro <UNK> gate critique br br watch it if you must but be <UNK> this is not a film whose time has come this is a stinker which will smell for all time br br <UNK> gate is historically inaccurate in the extreme i recommend the book of the <UNK> by <UNK> on the johnson county war
<START> one of the worst movies i have ever seen excruciatingly slow moving boring and stupid lots of juvenile bathroom humor drawn out into painful tedium i like jeff daniels but he should stick to acting and forget writing i am amazed this is rated as high as it is i call it a turkey
<START> john carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great <UNK> of sci fi and horror <UNK> the classic body <UNK> theme and taking it to the extreme a remake of the howard <UNK> produced 1951 original carpenter keeps the cold war themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop of alien <UNK> and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation of the <UNK> setting carpenter's direction as always is excellent as his camera <UNK> through the lonely world of the characters whose environment is about to be <UNK> by the <UNK> fear of body <UNK> but here and much like the work of david <UNK> carpenter doesn't hold back on the incident as through some fantastic special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore however he never loses touch with the human side of the story as in the face of everything shocking happening in front of us we are left with perceived notions of trust and suspicion br br 9 10
<START> <UNK> starts in present <UNK> as four <UNK> dean richard <UNK> ray richard <UNK> jeffrey douglas junior jason jones are about to <UNK> the electric to an <UNK> building <UNK> for <UNK> as they search for the relevant <UNK> stuff they come across a set of doors that according to the buildings blue <UNK> shouldn't be there being <UNK> all that they force the doors open to have a look find a room full of computers scientific <UNK> as they mess around with some buttons a <UNK> to a parallel universe opens dean junior accidentally <UNK> in with ray <UNK> following soon after in search of their friends unfortunately they've all ended up in an exact parallel earth that has been taken over by a mutant spider thing that either eats people or turns them into mutant soldiers with which she uses to protect herself do whatever she wants them to really in a desperate <UNK> for survival they team up with a few of the last remaining humans including the original <UNK> of the <UNK> dr richard colin fox who says that with the help of our <UNK> boys he might yeah might be able to build another <UNK> to take them back home br br edited directed by david wu i thought <UNK> was pretty crap it's as simple straight forward as that really the script by case robinson young is preposterous to say the least has plot holes in it you could drive a tank through for instance is this film really trying to suggest that a few mutant spider things no bigger than a couple of people in size took over an entire world how did they do this if this parallel earth was the same as <UNK> where the hell was the army the police all of our weapons a few fragile looking spider things against literally <UNK> of humans the whole flawed stupid downright <UNK> concept constantly <UNK> me throughout the entire film lets not forget that there is a inter dimensional <UNK> to a parallel earth in the basement of most buildings that have sat there <UNK> for decades remain in perfect working order right then there's the nuclear <UNK> the size of a <UNK> the fact one <UNK> can make it work perfectly purely by accident as he randomly <UNK> a few buttons in a room that probably had spread over dozens of pieces of equipment what about the wonderfully thoughtful guy who sets an explosive bobby trap in his base without telling anyone what if one of his mates had set it off found themselves blown to pieces by their mates <UNK> bomb you wouldn't be best pleased would you what about food do they grow their own in little <UNK> <UNK> i could go on on all day long about how flawed ill conceived poorly written <UNK> is but i can't be bothered the character's are clichéd annoying as is the film as a whole which obviously doesn't help the only half decent thing i can say about <UNK> is that it's short it moves along at a fair pace but when all said done it's still crap br br director wu has to take a large of the blame here for a start the film looks cheap the editing that he is credited with is terrible there's lots of annoying inappropriate slow motion shots that come from nowhere the action scenes are almost identical become incredibly boring very quickly he uses that highly annoying quick cut technique along with a bit of the old jerky camera movement now i don't know about anyone else but i hate this editing style as it just looks a complete incoherent mess in fact i don't know a single person who does like this sort of thing i'm puzzled as to why filmmakers think people do forget about any gore just a few shotgun wounds to the spider zombie soldier guys they don't have red blood anyway so it doesn't relate to reality in my mind br br <UNK> was made for tv the american sci fi channel i think it looks every bit as cheap low budget rushed as you would expect it's all so bland forgettable flat dull the special effects are far from special the spider thing lacks imagination when finally revealed the acting was ok considering everything else was so poor i still can't believe the <UNK> <UNK> was wearing in this br br <UNK> is crap i can't really say anything good about it other than i've sat through worse films that's the sole reason i'm not giving it 1 star a quick glance at the imdb user ratings for <UNK> <UNK> what i already knew in that it has more <UNK> votes than any other there is very good reason why
<START> this isn't a bad tv movie is short for which means <UNK> such were formed due to the increasing demand for soldiers as the soviet union was taking heavy <UNK> all through out the war these consisted of <UNK> and <UNK> soldiers who were given the chance to clear their names by proving themselves in combat they were looked down upon as <UNK> and were <UNK> easily during combat without much regret or much honor on the part of military they were often sent on suicide missions and suffered extreme <UNK> the ones who refused to fight were executed on sight needless to say their lives sucked br br there were some very nice performances by the cast especially by who played <UNK> who played and roman who played major however the series isn't really that <UNK> in part because it's too long it could've a lot shorter and as effective br br although it's about war has very mild violence and pretty much no gore it relies solely on the actors to make it work and after all it's a tv series so the producers didn't want to scare off the viewers and the <UNK> br br explores the cruelty of the soviet regime and why so many men chose to fight the nazis instead of joining them personally i'd rather be a fascist then a communist given the circumstances presented in the film one character explains that the <UNK> stripped his farm clean and his family died of <UNK> out of anger he burned it down which got him arrested for destroying property and he ended up in the <UNK> <UNK> as a criminal <UNK> on how his mother killed her youngest son to feed the rest of the family both men explained that they fought for their <UNK> rather than the for the <UNK> br br the <UNK> <UNK> had one marine naval <UNK> who raped a girl killing his <UNK> in the threatened his other <UNK> to keep his mouth shut about both <UNK> and then <UNK> injury when it came to fighting on top of all that the girl committed suicide due to shame i imagine if enough marines watched this movie they'd pick up <UNK> and riot on the streets calling for a <UNK> or an official <UNK> from the producers br br to say the least i'd recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in the former soviet union or world war ii i don't think i wasted 500 minutes of my life
<START> for weeks i had been looking forward to seeing this movie only to find myself hugely disappointed after <UNK> in my opinion the only good thing <UNK> <UNK> had going for it was the amazing scenery used as backgrounds the story line was all over the place <UNK> character sarah was very difficult to understand and what on earth were all the many close ups of her face for it brought absolutely nothing to the story if there was one at all a better actor for the part of boy could also have been selected to me it sounded like he read his lines straight of the script while shooting his scenes overall a real shame as it could have been such a good movie
<START> 2001 a space odyssey br br is it a <UNK> an account of the history of mankind an exploration of man's <UNK> attempts to advance technology only to have technology destroy him is it about the fragile balance of time and space a lesson in evolution or is it just a spectacular effects show a film kubrick made only to show us the <UNK> possibilities of the motion picture and present to us the truth that images are exceedingly more powerful than words br br 2001 a space odyssey is all of these things one of the most films ever created it's almost more fun to <UNK> and discuss the ambiguous plot design and events of the film than it is to actually watch but it's left open to discussion intentionally if kubrick had explained the meaning to his wondrous 1968 classic <UNK> 22 on <UNK> list of the greatest 100 films ever made my personal 21st favorite and nominated for 4 academy awards director original screenplay art direction and visual effects which it won for it would have lost half its fascination all of its complexity and a good portion of its cinematic worth we would only be left with the technical <UNK> which in itself is worth <UNK> br br because every shot is worth taking the time to look and there is plenty of time 2001 is very <UNK> and also <UNK> distant detached the emotional <UNK> and slow pace pay perfect tribute however to the unique visual experience 2001 begins with <UNK> ape <UNK> who <UNK> from <UNK> of the planet to hunters and after discovering a giant <UNK> in the midst of their desert home then in one of motion picture <UNK> most inspired jump cut edits as a bone is tossed into the air and becomes a satellite jumping forward a couple thousand years into space where <UNK> have discovered a similar object on the moon and next the film following a crew of space mission as they follow the <UNK> through space accompanied by their <UNK> computer hal who attempts to <UNK> the <UNK> and kill the crew before finally the lone survivor is launched through space and time in a <UNK> of drug induced colors that probably gave hippies an <UNK> shock back in the day to grow old die and be <UNK> a star child <UNK> br br this pacing and emotional is also in sharp contrast with the film's most ironic scene the destruction of hal as the <UNK> final <UNK> <UNK> the machine down <UNK> in the holy aura of red light kubrick has always used as a repeat <UNK> hal singing a lovely tune it is a strangely emotional experience and it's all genius br br other notable aspects of kubrick's masterpiece is the memorable voice of hal a calm somehow sinister douglas rain the minimal use of dialogue kubrick was wisely <UNK> of his images to <UNK> the film giving only banal <UNK> lines to his actors the most famous being open the <UNK> bay doors hal <UNK> dancing around in <UNK> to <UNK> music and that first awe inspiring shot of earth slowly revealing the <UNK> of the sun in front of it played to the sound of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br 2001 shall always remain a mystery and will forever be a testament to the <UNK> strongest point visuals are more powerful than writing it's all from one of film <UNK> most legendary and best directors whose unique vision was always his own 10 10 br br open the <UNK> bay doors hal 2001 a space odyssey
<START> here we go another pop star breaking in to the grand tv land and from my observations from her pop careers directors saying yeah your great <UNK> you could be a real star maybe some day you'll be in the a list movies they would do anything to expand the show there just not a pretty face but have an acting ability as well almost overnight <UNK> has some how found the ability to act by watching actors like james dean or clint <UNK> please give the real people in the world that have to sit behind that box and have to suffer pop stars <UNK> in trying to act please <UNK> stick to your pretty pop videos with your <UNK> <UNK> and don't insult the british with your efforts as an actress anyway i'm going back to my working class job and think to myself god i could do that but yeah remember i'll be working till i'm <UNK> if i live that long and yeah you put your feet up girl with your <UNK> every three months <UNK> marry into money right <UNK>
<START> probably the worst creature feature ever <UNK> vs python was a million times better then this that wasn't great either bad acting bad effects guess what the dvd is one of those one with 3 hours of previews before the main menu probably the least scary movie ever no blood or violence people are stupid and keep using <UNK> when they have no affect on these animals the only cool part was the <UNK> <UNK> that was pretty cool i name of the island is just a rip off of jurassic park boring <UNK> not worth even looking at but i suppose the characters stupidity is pretty funny so it would make a good comedy film but definitely not a thriller
<START> i watched the first show of each series just to see and what a waste of time the girl from <UNK> she was fat so yeah she should be in fat friend but no one every lost <UNK> br br like <UNK> made a big mistake with this br br bad girls is better br br i feel that the whole show was just about large people trying to loose weight but never did then they tried to have love storyline oh my god what a a waste of time and also air time this show has not been repeated on 3 4 yeah thats how good it is br br i would say do not by <UNK> box sets just a waste of money br br beware
<START> rush in <UNK> is simply an amazing dvd this concert is one of the peak moments of the history of rush and they deliver their music brilliantly and with more power than ever br br i was lucky enough to actually be in this concert and not only that i was in the very first row grabbing the gate that separated the audience from the stage it's the first and only time i've seen a rush concert live and it was a dream come true for me i have no words to accurately describe this experience but i can tell you it is one of the highlights of my life br br some people complain about the sound of this dvd saying it is not very clear and polished but the sound you listen is real true to how it was in the concert it is raw and powerful and so authentic that every time i watch it i go back and re live that beautiful moment many artists record live shows and then they make a lot of <UNK> so the final product is far from what the actual concert really was sure you can achieve a very sophisticated and polished sound this way but you don't get the real thing this is not the case with rush in <UNK> this is the real deal i admit that i enjoy those fancy sounding concert dvd's i love music and the sound is a very important aspect but it's refreshing to listen to a concert that is so honest you listen to rush just the way they sound in a live performance no tricks no <UNK> this is a real live concert dvd br br i highly recommend rush in <UNK> the set list is fantastic and the performances by <UNK> alex and neil are mind blowing not to mention the crowd you can see how much they love rush and sing along to every tune even which is an <UNK> i actually appear singing twice in tom <UNK> i sing always hopeful yet <UNK> and in i sing only reflect it's just a few seconds but i simply couldn't believe my eyes when i saw myself in a rush dvd awesome i hope you enjoy this magnificent concert from the greatest band on earth
<START> truly a great leap forward in the perfection of painful cinema br br everything about this film is bad acting if it can be called that lighting sound script if there was one editing direction camera work it is all atrocious there is not a single element that is done well if i thought that this was intentional then i might give the film some credit but i can not believe people would set out to make such a film br br this film is worth buying and screening to your worst enemies
<START> this movies made me suffer and i loved it loved it it haunted me for days i think erika is the kind of character you simultaneously <UNK> and <UNK> the most terrifying sex scene ever caught on film this is the best of <UNK> work so far he is the only living director to <UNK> pace since kubrick the violence in this film is gorgeous in a word the film is about self hatred in a sentence the film is about trying to find love in order to stop hating yourself and finding that that is a hopeless hope
<START> i remember when i first heard about jack frost i was in video at miranda with my family on a <UNK> video hiring tradition it was at this time that i worked up the courage to venture over towards the horror section of the store <UNK> the various titles i finally came across jack frost the cover was enough to convince me that the film was beyond my viewing pleasures years later the film disappeared only to be replaced with the inevitable yet unnecessary sequel i once again <UNK> to the horror section and picked up the case only to come to one conclusion the film would be but not intentionally br br jack frost 2 revenge of the killer mutant snowman quite a title follows off where it's predecessor left it sheriff sam is seeking <UNK> after his <UNK> and jack is now in the form of anti freeze to escape his past sam and his wife head to an island hotel where he is in the company of a wide variety of slasher film stereotypes including <UNK> female models thick headed sports <UNK> and <UNK> staff however jack is released from his <UNK> grave and is back to his icy methods he heads over to the island and proceeds to kill anyone that would prove to have an awesome death only sam can stop him br br let me just say that this is a straight to video film so it's bound to be bad but this is terrible even in the eyes of other over the top films the camera work is poor using a camera that would make a soap opera look <UNK> half the actors look like they've come out of a porn shoot and the other half look like they've come out of a retirement home but in actual fact they've actually come out of an asylum there is an extensive use of special effects used in the film which tends to alternate between bland <UNK> and cgi that can be <UNK> by an <UNK> and the death scenes are mostly off screen showing us little of what has happened to the hapless yet deserving victims but the film is most memorable for it's killer one liners such as there's something that needs a little christmas <UNK> and i know <UNK> you officially f ing dead ultimately the whole purpose behind a film like this is to make a popcorn flick for those friday nights of boredom and even it fails at that to make a sequel to a film that was a poor slasher with a concept that a child would find unbelievable must've taken some nerves of or a total frontal <UNK> to director michael thanks for wasting my time to everyone <UNK> avoid like <UNK>
<START> in <UNK> <UNK> a country divided by religion and language the civil war between the pro government and the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> a organization has claimed an <UNK> <UNK> 000 lives since 1983 human rights groups have said that as a result of the war more than one million people have been <UNK> homeless or living in camps the impact on children and families caught in the conflict is <UNK> <UNK> by acclaimed <UNK> director <UNK> in his 2002 film a peck on the cheek winner of several awards at the national film awards in india while the civil war is merely a backdrop for the story of a young girl's voyage of discovery the human cost of war is made quite clear and gives the fighting a universal context pointing the finger at global arms <UNK> as the source of <UNK> br br beautifully photographed in southern india by cinematographer <UNK> k in a setting <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> the film tells a moving story about an adopted 9 year old girl who sets out to find her real mother in the middle of the fighting in <UNK> <UNK> played with deep feeling and <UNK> by p s in a memorable performance is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents <UNK> <UNK> and j d were forced to flee when the fighting broke out leaving her in a red cross camp in a loving flashback we see <UNK> parents father a prominent <UNK> writer and mother <UNK> a tv personality marry to <UNK> their <UNK> of the darker skinned little girl br br young has no idea that she is adopted until it is <UNK> upon her abruptly on her <UNK> birthday according to the parents' prior <UNK> while she is playing tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that you are not our daughter and the response is predictable <UNK> she questions who her father was what her mother's name was why she gave her up and so forth but few answers are <UNK> runs away several times until her parents agree to go to <UNK> <UNK> to help her find her true mother now a fighter for the <UNK> the family's <UNK> in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions handled mostly with skill by though a sequence where the family was caught in a <UNK> felt amateurish br br a peck on the cheek is of course a bollywood style film and that means tons of music and melodrama the melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors however i found the musical <UNK> of songs by a r <UNK> counter to the mood of the film with their slick high production techniques and fast paced music video style editing yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told <UNK> the film's limitations <UNK> cinema has been criticized by many even within the country as being too clichéd and commercial yet a peck on the cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that <UNK> serious issues that it successfully the line between art and <UNK> is not a <UNK> but a tribute
<START> i loved the movie i loved timothy dalton and <UNK> <UNK> the movie had many different locations in it i really liked when ann <UNK> realized she could not make <UNK> love her and when scarlett and ann where together and ann <UNK> for taking <UNK> and scarlett just told her not to worry she would get him back it had a great story it told you just can not compare it to <UNK> it just has so many great scenes i love both scarlett and <UNK> of course do not forget to have a <UNK> handy
<START> it is hard to imagine two actors of such class and experience as michael caine and michael getting involved in such an embarrassingly inept film the responsibility for this ill judged production has to be down to the writer neil jordan and director <UNK> <UNK> i doubt i've seen such a bad film with such good credits in a long time the comedian dylan <UNK> who made his mark as the <UNK> and incompetent <UNK> owner in the tv sitcom turns in much the same routine here except with such excess and lack of comedic control as to leave one <UNK> it is easy to see how the story could have been made to work for the situation is an interesting one and loaded with comic potential a classical actor caine tries to rip off the mob and co with the <UNK> of a bumbling wannabe colleague <UNK> with predictable results it could have and should have been good sadly it was not to be
<START> i have seen several <UNK> <UNK> films yet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he <UNK> smiles and laughs <UNK> might have been equally <UNK> in ten <UNK> the magnificent seven the brother <UNK> and the mad woman of but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one he is <UNK> and <UNK> to watch in every shot br br equally fascinating and sexy without <UNK> her clothes is deborah kerr the script allows her to <UNK> a <UNK> that is not visual but suggestive she <UNK> this sort of role years later in the night of <UNK> the film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the release of the group from the <UNK> of the russians in fact she is shown as running away from the russian major in contrast to the <UNK> story or the story yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical <UNK> of the kerr character br br kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view but she is a superb actress she puts her soul into the characters that she portrays which often <UNK> with the spirit of the character it is this <UNK> that makes her roles in the journey <UNK> <UNK> and the night of <UNK> memorable br br why is this an unusual film it is not easy in hollywood to see russian characters portrayed as good people dr <UNK> was an exception romance of a horse thief was again great cinema by abraham but never acknowledged as such because of the <UNK> towards <UNK> in the post mccarthy era br br the film is also unusual in its casting great french actors gerard and <UNK> <UNK> rub shoulders with jason <UNK> jr and british actor robert <UNK> in many ways the film is international than american all four are great actors and add to the entertainment br br those who have read <UNK> and works will find the film is not true to either work yet the film can stand on its own as its <UNK> <UNK> version has a <UNK> charm of its own provided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group i think <UNK> deserves to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the making of the film while <UNK> bits of both written tales e g the last bus ride and the final kiss br br but i do have one why do hollywood never acknowledge the sources that inspire the stories only recently e g insomnia have the original works begun to be mentioned <UNK> in the credits
<START> firstly i'll admit i haven't seen vampires los <UNK> but i've seen the original vampires film and love it i rented this film having heard nothing about it i didn't expect to be impressed i wasn't br br i love the idea of shifting the action to the far east which should have opened up a lot of new <UNK> for the action sequences as well as the story line but not enough was made of this the fight scenes and the <UNK> chases were painfully boring br br there were some parts i liked like the way the <UNK> team weren't shown as heroic good guys as they were in the first movie br br i'd been hoping since i saw the old hammer movie legend of the 7 golden vampires a few years ago that someone would one day make another good asian based vampire film this was not it
<START> the end of <UNK> as it should appeal to general citizens mass <UNK> alike is likely to become of cultural <UNK> status the film uses super cynical analysis by authors policy makers and social <UNK> on the <UNK> created by suburban style living mainly in the post war era br br what we have created in america is a place with none of the <UNK> of country life and none of the <UNK> of urban city life this is the <UNK> that is laid out for <UNK> and the film on the <UNK> idea of oil basically in the most general sense that the world is <UNK> or at it's peak oil production and when we realize this in full major lifestyle changes will be in effect whether by our best interest or forced violently upon us by a quality of living even the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> couldn't describe to us br br if nothing more the end of <UNK> will <UNK> the viewer <UNK> in their gut creating a sickening feeling this is bound to happen it's a bleak <UNK> on our inherent way of life the <UNK> lies particularly in each respective viewers critical analysis of the film i <UNK> many <UNK> viewers <UNK> the film as smug liberal propaganda like a <UNK> moore film what they fail to consider is that a reaction like this is all too normal when such a message hits so unbelievably hard to the lifestyle of the vast majority of the masses br br this is the truth and as a student studying city planning i can tell you that we better get prepared now because what slim chance we have of maintaining quality of life in this <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> resources is <UNK> faster than a race of people stricken by the black plague
<START> 12 17 <UNK> all i can do with this film is <UNK> on my impressions i wasn't given the changes don't know the score and am not <UNK> in the genre i always had problems following <UNK> changes anyway <UNK> player <UNK> so i was pretty well limited to doing the basic keep the tune in mind and ad <UNK> around that what <UNK> me up about this incredibly moody black and white blues piece was the <UNK> it gave me in my head and heart in trying to figure out whether to go with the ensemble or pick out a path along the tune story i guess i went with the tune as usual i kept getting lost on the changes too deep extensive over my head probably still it was a gas to try to keep pace i admired the actors' playing to the theme and story line i didn't see some things or things others seem to i didn't feel the light skin gal was trying to pass as much as she was either oblivious to the color issue or was trying to ignore it at first later she came back fighting the brooding light skin young man his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ludicrous was ambiguous <UNK> and perhaps his best feature remote what i thought after the shadow curtain closed on this provocative piece is the foundation of a thing like this is it a way of finding reality by setting up a stage <UNK> it with <UNK> characters and giving them a melody and theme is it any more real or truthful than a well crafted script without the benefit of editing and <UNK> is <UNK> heroic <UNK> than crafted work where is there greater or <UNK> truth in <UNK> art craft or in <UNK> and well i am still lost in this question i loved the film it got me lost in a cool blue <UNK> evening where i just had to go home and get out my horn guess what i broke out in a twelve bar blues riff tried and true couldn't make myself stray from the tune reality is just too scary <UNK> says give them a 7 and more i'm on break
<START> i didn't understand what that line meant i do now i didn't really want to see dirty dancing either i'd rented it out but never watched it and today i did and i thought it was a really fun great movie that makes you want to get up and dance alright it was cheesy at times but it's still a great movie i can't believe jennifer grey was 27 in this movie my friend and i thought she looked about 18 or 19 20 at the most i guess this is attributed to her acting talent and she did really look awkward at times patrick <UNK> is also very good but you can tell he is in his thirties and seems a bit old nevertheless still very good i love 80s songs so it really struck a <UNK> with me and the love story yes i'm a romantic was so wonderfully done i thoroughly enjoyed this movie <UNK> my expectations
<START> mexican werewolf in texas is set in the small border town of <UNK> where anna erika fay lives her best friend is <UNK> <UNK> hughes she has a mexican boyfriend named <UNK> gabriel who are determined to track a beast down that has been <UNK> the town killing <UNK> several residents including some of their friends local mexican legends speak of the an evil creature from myth legend <UNK> i'm struggling now because not that much else actually happens br br written directed by scott i won't beat about the bush here simply say that mexican werewolf in texas is awful period the script only ever mentions the word werewolf once the rest of the time it's referred to a in fact i suspect this wasn't really conceived as a werewolf flick at all the <UNK> creature looks mostly <UNK> more like some vicious dog there is no reference to anybody changing during the full moon it actually attacks during the day on a couple of occasions there is no transformation scene at the end when it is killed it doesn't change back into anyone either to be honest apart from the title there's nothing here to indicate a werewolf film at all even then the title is just a rip off of the highly popular an american werewolf in london 1981 this is the type of home made crap that i personally think is killing the horror genre how long has it been since there was a true low budget horror classic like dawn of the dead 1978 the evil dead 1981 halloween 1978 or friday the 13th 1980 which were all made on shoe string budgets maybe the blair witch project 1999 but that's it in recent years crap like mexican werewolf in texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered a classic the character's are awful things just happen around them the dialogue is rubbish the pacing is terrible the story sucks virtually sent me to sleep as a whole this film is just crap i'm sorry but i don't know how else to describe it br br director does nothing to make this watchable there's the annoying hand held camera type cinematography which could easily give someone a headache quick you'll miss editing which just <UNK> <UNK> in equal measure it's not scary there's no nudity there's no tension or atmosphere the special effects are awful the monster really does look poor it's no wonder keeps it in the shadows or cuts his scenes so quickly you never get a good look at it there's virtually no colour to the picture either it's either almost pitch black or over <UNK> desert sand <UNK> which makes the thing an eye sore as well the gore consists of some fake guts blink you'll miss them a few bloody wounds a severed arm big deal br br with a supposed budget of about 300 000 i admit the budget was low but i simply refuse to accept that for making such a rubbish film there are plenty of low budget horror flicks that make their <UNK> budgets go far the whole thing has the look of a home movie it has no style is <UNK> bland dull to look at the acting sucks too although you probably already knew that br br mexican werewolf in texas will probably con a few people into renting buying watching it because they might <UNK> think it's a sequel to john classic which it most certainly isn't it isn't even a proper werewolf flick either don't be fooled this is awful i'm fed up of having to waste time money on home made amateur crap like this
<START> an odd <UNK> <UNK> biopic of <UNK> thomas in which we hear little more than a dozen lines of his poetry instead we have to endure a raw character seen through the <UNK> of his <UNK> relationship with wife <UNK> miller and childhood love <UNK> knightley matthew rhys plays thomas with sufficient charm to <UNK> us against his otherwise <UNK> self interest and cillian murphy makes up the <UNK> tense br br the film never seems to decide on where it's going there's no arc so much as a from one end of the war to the other seems much more interested in his two female leads who wouldn't than in the man who brings them together and then <UNK> them miller is the choice of the two i found knightley competent at best but then i have never found her sympathetic but they both offer dreadfully inconsistent <UNK> accents other funny decisions include too much for the <UNK> character of william murphy arty production <UNK> double that is neither <UNK> nor symbolic and the old <UNK> act of period footage which doesn't blend 4 10
<START> not only did the effects and acting in this movie bite but the story was terrible br br a scientist discovers that a <UNK> <UNK> will hit the moon world leaders ignore him he builds a shelter then everyone is upset that he is playing god br br how lame he built the thing why is everyone entitled to access totally lame story don't waste your time
<START> <UNK> is such a terrific disney classic that i just loved so much as a kid still to this day i can't resist watching it it's just such a wonderful and charming film with great animation and lovely songs i really miss the animation films like <UNK> they had perfect voices not to mention the hand drawn animation that makes it perfect for the family <UNK> is also very witty and clever the story was just so wonderful this film is just beyond irresistible i think the most memorable moment for me was the cats playing the piano learning the lol it was just so cute with the piano playing and painting br br and her <UNK> are very <UNK> in their huge mansion mainly because their lady is very rich and treats them like they were her children but when the lady feels it's time to make her will she leaves everything to the cats and not to her butler the butler gets angry and takes the <UNK> on the road and them in the middle of no where and the <UNK> wake up and with the help of a smooth street cat by the name of thomas they head back home to their lady but learn the <UNK> of being a cat br br the <UNK> is just a perfect disney movie that i feel is a bit over looked i would always highly recommend this movie for kids or families it could be enjoyed by anyone the songs and story is just memorable i will always join in for the movies best song everybody wants to be a cat such a great tune i also love those dogs that <UNK> the farm where the cats were abandoned they were just so cute this is a terrific film please watch it you won't be disappointed br br 9 10
<START> <UNK> and juliet 1996 is another jewel in the troma studios film <UNK> like the toxic <UNK> <UNK> war class of <UNK> 'em high terror <UNK> and sgt n y p d this film is an instant troma classic james <UNK> <UNK> romeo and juliet taking a medieval tragedy and it as a modern day street punk drama if you have seen or read the play before nothing much has change except it has been br br lloyd kaufman adds his own twisted vision to the screenplay and makes it highly enjoyable film the actors handle the script very well i was surprised by how well they performed the dialog a lot better than some hollywood big budgeted actors <UNK> a monstrous budget and expensive sets i enjoyed this movie very much lloyd kaufman doesn't disappoint because you know what to expect from his films and other troma productions i would rather watch one of his films and be entertained than watch an boring expensive movie with <UNK> over paid actors lame scripts lazy directors and those awful c g i special effects br br i highly recommend this movie if you like fun films with cheesy special effects over the top acting and inspired directing then this movie's just for you
<START> not wishing to repeat what everyone else has noted i will only say this br br nearly everybody says they loved curly best but i will put <UNK> <UNK> up against any of other the stooges shorts br br i think it's the most hilarious from start to finish as well as being the most re watchable br br the off key singing student christine <UNK> cousin basil routine and of course <UNK> j p are highlights but only around the <UNK> impeccable timing and the great writing too br br <UNK> said

<START> i have to confess that i slept in the cinema while watching the first <UNK> movie but this one is simply fantastic it is really funny and it leaves the first one miles away it has gags and funny situations that made me laugh since the first minutes of the movie and i only stopped laughing when i reached the car to return home i repeat this movie is spectacular is really funny and <UNK> is a real babe
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is an indian <UNK> and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name played by the wedding <UNK> from <UNK> wedding <UNK> you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern india there's no bend it like beckham backdrops and stereotypes and only slight <UNK> to the music and dancing of bollywood however the soundtrack is well worth <UNK> but rather the feel that you are seeing the real india <UNK> the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to <UNK> the performance of the five professional actors fortunately for us <UNK> companion is a young and beautiful french woman in search of a journey with <UNK> of an y <UNK> mama <UNK> trip toward self discovery without the sex and fatal disease this beautiful film <UNK> and brings the <UNK> mind against the initial <UNK> of the protagonists all identify with traits of both and the cultural <UNK> disappears as humanity steps in most <UNK> put the movie's central theme everyone has a love story don't let yours pass by teaches us a great deal about love on a number of levels don't let this film pass you by
<START> this film blade master may be cheap clumsy in appearance and it is sometimes but it shares thoughts on problems that are way beyond the era this film is set in <UNK> is the chosen one that has to protect the earth against a terrible weapon that is compared in an unforgettable and unpredictable way to the atomic weapon he goes through obstacles as a character who is just more than muscle power although he has quite is lot i would say this aspect of the movie makes it <UNK> a film like conan the barbarian which is the least i can say quite brainless it doesn't <UNK> in any ways the great adventure movie that is conan but it gives <UNK> his <UNK> that he shares not with the barbarian for a lower budget movie this film does good in terms of setting and the fights are most of the time believable the villain has with is prisoner throughout the film one of the most interesting psychological confrontation that gives tension to the movie even if <UNK> seems way too fit for the task to loose br br what gives this movie that little extra are those scenes that may look quirky but worth of mention the fight with the <UNK> god even though he is a gigantic puppet is well handled as the snake with good <UNK> remains a <UNK> and the fight is quite convincing the movie <UNK> in a most unusual way quite <UNK> but breathtaking the sequence the scene itself is not introduced properly read not at all where did <UNK> get that machine it's pretty unconvincing but it leads to a really poetic and beautiful <UNK> sequence that <UNK> is the culminating point in the movie <UNK> <UNK> in a place where few human fantasy heroes have been br br if blade master is not among the great fantastic movies of all time is no surprise due to its lacks it's a bigger surprise considering the philosophical way it chooses on the confrontation between good and evil the truth it speaks and the heart it shows that this movie is so i suggest it for every fan of the genre and try take it seriously as an intelligent movie that's to be taken more seriously than it seems
<START> the subject matter of this film is potentially depressing a man about thirty with no job little education three kids from a failed relationship living in his parents' house but with a dream of directing feature films but about a half hour into the movie you realize that mark has a <UNK> supply of drive and ambition it's just that it's all <UNK> into his need to direct movies and nothing else will make him happy the movie jumps all over the emotional spectrum but in the end you come away feeling happy because you've just gotten to know some wonderful people go to see this you'll end up wishing it was longer
<START> this film is a <UNK> fires on the plain referred to is the burning off at the end of <UNK> time a happy memory for <UNK> he <UNK> this in his mind many <UNK> and at the end of this bleak film like a man dying of <UNK> he he is home and this last illusion is all he has left billy <UNK> the big carnival ace in the hole is the only film that comes to mind that is as bleak as this little masterpiece by <UNK> <UNK> while i think the whole film is brilliant two scenes that come to mind are when a platoon of japanese soldiers trying to escape <UNK> on there are <UNK> by americans and <UNK> true horror and as an american soldier and a pretty <UNK> girl soldier are having a cigarette on the side on the road she smiles as she with the <UNK> then her face changes to rage as she <UNK> two japanese soldiers trying to she grabs a gun and kills them with joy the american soldier attempts to stop her but has no chance to me this speaks volumes at the committed by the japanese in the <UNK> all in all a great film if you have the stomach for it
<START> for people who have absolutely no idea of what a comedy is that not only includes the people who liked this movie but the people who made it what could they possibly have been thinking madonna playing judy <UNK> please she can't even play madonna if there actually is a madonna i hope <UNK> dunne was paid well he deserved every penny he got because if this didn't kill his career nothing will i'm sure that the few people who actually paid to see this movie left it feeling like their <UNK> had been picked madonna is apparently past the point of feeling embarrassed by her virtually complete lack of talent as an actress but you can't help feeling embarrassed for her anyway she has no connection with the rest of the cast it appears like she showed up on the set and said ok i'm here i'm gonna embarrass myself by doing the absolute worst judy <UNK> impression anyone's ever seen now stay the hell out of my way and then <UNK> to do exactly that i know the phrase rotten madonna movie is redundant but it certainly fits this it's painful to watch a totally inept and talentless actress make a complete fool of herself but it apparently doesn't bother her as she does it again and again br br the only remotely funny thing about this comedy is that she actually managed to find people who gave her the money to make it now that's funny
<START> in my opinion a good documentary especially one dealing with controversial political issues should be informative and as <UNK> as possible the point should be revealing the truth this means in particular having among the <UNK> experts on the subject and <UNK> of all sides this film is a failure in this regard most of the interviews included in this film consist of men off the street on the question of peace in the holy land the wall itself the supposed subject of the film is given no serious treatment at all for most of the interviews the <UNK> simply waits to be approached and asks general questions such as what do you think of the wall she does not approach random people near the wall and ask them how they have been directly affected by it outside of one <UNK> the israeli general in charge of the construction we have no experts on the subject to provide us with the context e g how and when the project began whether it has been successful which groups are for and which against the project etc br br outside of the interviews a very large portion of the film consists of extended shots of <UNK> scenes such as head on shots of the wall construction of the wall and people getting off a bus these shots take up far too much time in my opinion it's nice to see what the wall looks like but the 20 30 minutes of head on filming of the wall and only the wall are excessive clearly these shots accompanied by <UNK> music that conveys a sense of mourning are included for the sole purpose of <UNK> in viewers feelings of loathing for the wall
<START> <UNK> of white and various <UNK> a beautiful nude random images that is what this little experimental short film is br br it's kind of interesting to think how in the early days of film such images could be transferred onto film but despite my love of a lot of surreal images and films and a fascination with the bizarre this film just didn't do it for me br br i'm not sorry i watched it but if there is any underlying meaning in it i don't get it visually it is not that outstanding in my humble opinion as an example of i suppose it would fit in quite well since it seems to reject any semblance of logic or reason though i would have preferred that it do it in a more visually interesting way br br but to each his own
<START> this is a stereotype plot a young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school this leads to <UNK> from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight br br the fights are not of high standards they are way too simple in a way that 1 1 is simple to every adult the fighter has trained and enters the ring but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking the coach yells do this and do that with no success and after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly does what he is told and hits his <UNK> once this results in a turning point in the fight although our hero has been taking a beating of his life up until that point think about the rocky movies and you'll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really takes the fights are also shot poorly br br there final thing that <UNK> this film up is the stupid romance cheesy music and awkward moments are not what i call entertainment br br these guys really could have made some quality entertainment but the director wasn't up to the task or the other crew in my opinion maybe they had a small budget i don't know but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10
<START> this movie has a look and feel of many fresh directors closeups and focus on the emotions being experienced by the actors the point of the film was presented from many angles and expressed well by the relatively inexperienced cast the point being have faith in jesus christ and the <UNK> church oh and if you read or hear anything contrary to the <UNK> of the prophet it is just fuel for hatred
<START> i rented this movie with my friend for a good laugh we actually got laughed at by the clerk at the video store because of our questionable movie tastes unfortunately i don't remember the first half of the movie because all i did was stare at the giant metal <UNK> jane wore and i didn't hear anything either due to the incomprehensible <UNK> the other thing that was able to grasp my attention besides her metal mouth was her questionable fashion sense this movie was made in 2005 but it seems like the wardrobe people jumped all the way back to 2000 for the clothes if you remember the days when aaron carter was considered a <UNK> and you like high <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> length <UNK> then this little trip down memory lane is perfect for you
<START> i first saw the knowledge during a <UNK> television marathon on one of the local independent stations in los angeles back when it was new i enjoyed it very much along with danger <UNK> br br that a movie i saw once over twenty year ago should stick so well in my memory is a testament to it's originality and the quality of the performances by the cast br br i looked for a dvd copy here in the u s a and found none i finally <UNK> and bought a uk dvd off ebay and was delighted to find that it has no region code so those of us that would like to see this little gem can get a copy
<START> enjoyed this film which deals entirely about an average family so it appears ben travis jeff daniels plays the role as a father who is only interested in one son who is excellent at swimming and wins many however he hates it very much and even his father ben has very little to say to his other son tim <UNK> and even his daughter penny michelle williams who is fortunate to be away in college the mother sandy <UNK> weaver tries to hold the family together and even she is completely ignored by her husband also a very tragic event happens in the family which changes everyone's personality young and old start using drugs smoking pot and drinking all the time at parties there is even a homosexual scene and at the same time there is even room for comedy and of course there is a very dark secret that sandy travis finally tells her son tim
<START> that movie while slightly flawed was entirely entertaining about half an hour into be cool i started to have hollywood homicide flashbacks but guess what this is worse even the dance number is bad i like most of the cast in this movie so that makes me feel bad about writing a negative review of it but i feel <UNK> the rock andre 3000 and vince vaughn were in a comedy no one else seemed to decide what movie genre they were acting in i feel bad for travolta because he brought the same <UNK> <UNK> from get <UNK> to this movie he was totally consistent in the role but this movie is so different from the original that the character sticks out like a sore thumb i was going to give this movie 4 10 because i like the actors so much but there is a conversation in the movie about a certain song that is so <UNK> i couldn't believe the performers actually said it if you want to go to the movies this weekend there should still be some oscar <UNK> out there that would be a much better way to spend your time
<START> i am surprised so few have good words for this movie for its time the 80's it was a very entertaining and engaging story casting was good story was good special effects were remarkable for the time period deserving of an 8 10
<START> dan <UNK> and the dan band are so o o o o o good they must be seen to believe does anyone out there have a copy of the bravo concert for sale please if there is an upcoming release let us all know i checked the bravo site but there is no future date <UNK> for a repeat performance by the most appealing guys ever choreographed the dan band what great energy they <UNK> <UNK> themselves about with cute american boy attitude based on butch sensitivity being wrapped up in <UNK> and tears making men and women alike fall in love with them i hope enough people can influence the powers that be at bravo to bring the show back into our lives as a semi <UNK> special
<START> the martial arts movies got huge in the 60's in parts of asia but with the growing popularity of the infamous shaw brothers films america was bound to catch on this movie was the first to be presented in america under the warner bros label and it did in fact start a <UNK> here that <UNK> the 70's with martial arts films many of the films to follow would pale in comparison but some were great and many like enter the dragon which came out shortly after this one became huge success stories and made <UNK> out of these fighters br br fast forward almost 40 years later and this movie still holds up most shaw brothers films are as good today as they were back then and truth be told no films have been made in this genre to compete with those made by the shaw bros back in the day br br i like to think martial arts are like porn and nobody watches porn for the plot just the action well same goes with m a films and most of them are just a bunch of great fights with little story this one is an exception it doesn't have an amazing story but there is one there br br the main guy played by lo <UNK> actually stands out amongst karate film heroes he never <UNK> and he never fights just because he can he is often seen as weak and less of a fighter than most but when he must fight he is damn well the greatest alive i really loved this character many of the bad guys were memorable and the fight scenes were just presented so amazingly even a small role with <UNK> <UNK> can be seen as the huge <UNK> and <UNK> is in my top 5 as greatest martial artist film stars ever he was also in the above mentioned enter the dragon br br the production as i've said over and over is wonderful you can't beat the the direction was something unlike i have seen much in films of the 70's the use of color was well placed and made this movie stand alone and rise above the others when the light shines on <UNK> hands as he does the iron fist its pure beauty br br the music was superb as well martial arts films were to asia what westerns were to italy two separate art forms with so much in common the countries making these films had all genres but the japanese films were what was making waves there as the spaghetti westerns were in italy with their many differences the styles of these two genres were neck and neck as seen in movies like 5 fingers of death the fights were easily compared to <UNK> cowboy stand offs and the music tied the genres together so well the music here borrowed a little from <UNK> but it was still very original br br many films were inspired by this one and when i watch it i can see everything from the master killer to <UNK> having been influenced the most obvious movie to have been influenced was kill bill which to me is the greatest of all time many of the sets quentin used are complete <UNK> of ones seen here and he used the music from this film even though the music he used was the music borrowed from <UNK> and the fight scene at the end of kill bill <UNK> 1 with the bride and o <UNK> is at times exact in comparison to the fight with <UNK> and the japanese thug at the end of this movie br br i have seen many martial arts films a few even better but this is a must see for fans of the genre you can't go wrong here the movie starts off slow but 15 20 minutes into it it picks up and doesn't slow down
<START> ok what was this story about again i am afraid that i never read the book and frankly this was one of the most confusing movies that i have ever tried to watch in a long time i get a bit confused on the number of flashbacks between the nurse the patient and the man with no thumbs the film didn't even really explain what they were looking for in the desert until they found it or even how in the world they all knew each other to come together br br after recently seeing the pride and prejudice movie with colin <UNK> i have been trying to do a study on his film career by watching other movies of his and <UNK> other than what a girl wants i am not finding much where he played in that was any good i am definitely not saying that he wasn't good he is really one of the best actors i have seen in the modern day film but the content and quality of the films he plays in have a lot to be desired br br the english patient is another perfect example of where the director writer and crew are just too close to their subject matter to see that the viewer is not getting the picture  literally the entire movie seemed to be to showcase ralph <UNK> as a dramatic actor with long periods of <UNK> that was a bore nothing is really explained and every one of the subjects from the beginning seems to need a <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> scott <UNK> character seems to enjoy describing erotic stories standing in front of a totally male audience and <UNK> other men other than her husband colin <UNK> who plays her husband does not necessarily have all his <UNK> in place and is supposed to be a secret agent  i guess and ralph <UNK> walks around like a roman mr <UNK> sorry colin who thinks he knows it all the rest of the cast is cast pun intended to the four winds as the plot wanders on br br the subplot of the mental <UNK> of the nurse juliette <UNK> and her motives and involvement with andrews is another confusing element that leaves the viewer with an <UNK> taste but of course the viewer is still <UNK> how in the world the first two characters thomas and <UNK> ended up having sex the first time anyway what was the attraction there was no chemistry and no build up just a slap <UNK> thank you br br and isn't it romantic that <UNK> ended up a <UNK> helping the germans by giving them <UNK> to the desert sarcasm br br to describe this movie i would have to simply say how to impress your with your and cheat on your sweet adorable husband who loves you br br the final unbelievable section of this plot is to <UNK> how anyone would choose ralph <UNK> over colin <UNK> <UNK> had very little opportunity to demonstrate any of his acting talents  in fact when watching the movie i thought it must have been one of his first the scene where he had been waiting for his wife all night was perhaps the only two second clip that is worth seeing in the movie at that i have no interest in watching it again br br the best scene i liked was the plane crash where <UNK> is trying to take them all out too bad he missed it would have saved an extra twenty minutes of even more <UNK> film <UNK> desert scenes were pretty neat though
<START> pink <UNK> is a movie no word can explain it was just as good i thought it <UNK> films starting with a multiple beginning and ending with a shocking but clever ending pink <UNK> is one of the best films of the year don't miss this opportunity to see a great film rent it on video or see it at a late midnight showing like i did but just see it
<START> a very suspenseful giallo from the director of 1974 this one begins with a brilliantly handled sequence involving a priest a little girl and a broken doll however the main story is about maniac david <UNK> marrying a traumatized <UNK> to kill her for her money the plot whilst not original is really suspenseful the acting is good and there are several <UNK> and gory murders the score by <UNK> de is quite effective some of which can also be heard in lucio <UNK> the new york <UNK> 1982 highly recommended for fans of italian cinema
<START> if you think hannah montana or the <UNK> life are at the bottom of <UNK> sitcoms then you've obviously never watched is without a doubt the worst show i've ever seen from the lifeless acting to the low budget sets the show <UNK> of <UNK> like last <UNK> chinese <UNK> left to <UNK> in your <UNK> car br br the show revolves around a pretty <UNK> and supposed to be funny girl named <UNK> as she and her friends make a live web show called <UNK> lives alone with her older brother who seriously needs some <UNK> or something because he's a few cells short of a brain br br the plots of the shows are highly ludicrous and <UNK> annoying but having to watch <UNK> and her friend sam do their little show within in a show is even worse they basically show weird pictures and stick things up their nose as the laugh track plays over and over i mean seriously every two seconds the laugh track seems to come on for no reason br br so what's the point of this review you may ask just to <UNK> well yeah but i'm also warning you to beware of this show because seriously if i had to choose between watching and barney no questions about it i'd choose barney
<START> it's all there two classic anti hero buddies a <UNK> chase through beautiful swedish scenery guns violence sex and a butch cassidy sundance kid style finale br br add a touch of <UNK> and some distinctly danish humour and you've got this excellent road movie
<START> a mean spirited repulsive horror film about 3 murderous children susan <UNK> is totally wasted in a 5 minute cameo even though she receives star billing if your a julie brown fan you'll want to check it out since she's naked in a couple of shots all others avoid
<START> boring <UNK> and stupid <UNK> is a waste of time the <UNK> were a joke real people do not just stand out in the open with out any cover hoping to get shot first so many things wrong or bad not worth the effort to list except one major flaw at 500 <UNK> for 20 minutes about <UNK> miles west of l a and the water is deep even at that none of the people would have survived the <UNK> from being subjected to of water pressure for more then 20 hours when they were brought up just a awful
<START> i didn't hate this movie as much as some on my all time black list but i consider it a total <UNK> of film jeremy <UNK> iron jeremy ron jeremy think about it scene one is very good all the rest are crap
<START> beginning where it left off doctor who rose her alternative dad mickey his alternative counterpart ricky and small gang of rebels find themselves at the mercy of this realities version of the this second part of the 2 episode arc feels more like a doctor who episode as opposed to the previous part which honestly felt like more of an episode of the <UNK> show <UNK> which granted was a great show in it's own right the arc as a whole was enjoyable enough as i'm one to <UNK> to the <UNK> that any who is good who but at the same time it's inevitable that this will be compared to the <UNK> episode of the previous series and said comparisons would only make this seem like a lesser work as it is i just feel that this story could've been done in one episode remember in the first part of the review i said that these type of stories dealing with alternative realities usually have no lasting <UNK> well that's not the case here but what changes overall feels <UNK> on and not really in keeping with the character br br my grade c
<START> this is by far the best stand up routine i have ever seen john <UNK> one man show tells the supposed story of his life in a <UNK> of lines and situations by far better than any other comedy out there
<START> peter is top notch he is acting and looking great feels like watching a live play great camera works and i was sad it was over can not wait until it is on the big screen super cast this could be a big hit i like the way the kids interact as sister and two brothers really made me think of my own brothers going through a situation like what peter the happy father who thinks he will end his life after a big party the colors and sets were delightful to the eyes helps so much to draw you into the film play i was so happy to see peter not be <UNK> this guy could always act and now this is a movie that gives him that range i recommend you take your family to this movie perhaps the teenagers will not get much from this no guns fast cars dumb lines stupid fart jokes but your adult kids will love it good show for a night with them br br jason
<START> though it's a christmas movie christmas in <UNK> could have been done any time of year as it's the story of a soldier who spends what is to be an <UNK> time with a martha stewart type that's what he thinks in reality the lady in question portrayed by barbara stanwyck has a popular magazine <UNK> about life on a farm with her husband and baby she has no farm no husband and no baby nor are the many <UNK> she hers they belong to the restaurant owner nearby when her no nonsense editor sydney <UNK> insists that she entertain soldier dennis morgan she <UNK> the aid of her boyfriend to use his farm and she <UNK> herself and the <UNK> there there's even a baby well actually there's more than one chaos ensues and the <UNK> becomes increasingly difficult to play out especially when stanwyck falls in love with morgan br br this is such a wonderful movie and even if you're <UNK> depressed christmas in <UNK> can lift you right out of it barbara stanwyck is wonderful as the career woman turned <UNK> despite not being as flashy as crawford or davis she was nevertheless able to do what any role called for she could be cheap elegant warm nasty cold and or sexy and she makes it look easy on top of that she is always attractive and <UNK> dennis morgan is a handsome and charming <UNK> as an added bonus he gets to use his irish <UNK> fiancé <UNK> <UNK> is all business and you can tell he's not quite right for stanwyck s z as the fake uncle real chef is hilarious especially as he <UNK> stanwyck can flip a <UNK> before an audience br br i can imagine the impact this delightful film had at the tail end of world war ii it must have been a real <UNK> for the better times to come
<START> i don't know maybe i just wasn't in the mood for this kind of movie but it was full of trite melodrama it was too long and seemed at least mildly disjointed granted i didn't pay full attention for a more entertaining depiction of the battle of <UNK> see enemy at the gates true some pretentious folks will <UNK> because it's a hollywood film and doesn't show the gritty reality of war like this wonderful foreign film does but it has better flow and is all around just more fun to watch besides there are already enough gritty war movies and this one just seemed done but hey you might like it so go right ahead it just wasn't for me
<START> i would most definitely have to say that this is the most terrible movie i have ever seen it's not just the actors that are bad but also the fact that the camera person taped the wall and the <UNK> for about 5 minutes at a time anyone that likes this must be crazy this movie is a waste of time
<START> led an extraordinary life and his story is told rather well in all american we follow incredible journey from young norwegian boy to iconic american football legend produced in 1940 the film may at times seem a touch dated and at times downright hokey and the filmmakers do lay it on a bit thick at times as is and lovingly portrayed you may come away thinking should have been nominated for <UNK> when in fact he was after all just a football coach but it is <UNK> that he had a great impact on the game of football as well as having a tremendous impact on the lives of so many of the young men he <UNK> this film shows the great impact he had and gives you an insight into why he is so <UNK> to this day br br playing pat o'brien gives an impressive performance it's <UNK> <UNK> movie to carry and he makes the film and the character his own the real life was renowned as a great inspirational figure and <UNK> performance will make you understand why the only <UNK> comes early in the film when o'brien in his early forties is playing the college student in his early <UNK> all the makeup in the world wasn't going to make that believable and the effect is rather jarring but as the character ages and begins his legendary <UNK> career o'brien fits the part perfectly br br as for the rest of the cast one name jumps out and that is of course ronald reagan playing the young charismatic but ultimately doomed football star george in the grand scheme of the film it's not really a large part with reagan appearing for no more than 10 15 minutes but the performance has become legendary thanks to <UNK> famous win one for the <UNK> speech it's a brilliantly played scene chock full of emotion reagan may not have been on the screen for very long in this film but he certainly made a tremendously positive impact in a winning performance br br the rest of the film strikes a balance between football and life in general with having great lessons for his young men in both areas for football fans and history buffs there is a rare treat as actual <UNK> footage from <UNK> dame games of the era is interspersed throughout the film it's a rare opportunity to see just how much the game has evolved in the last six plus decades and an opportunity to see legendary <UNK> <UNK> put into practice if you're a <UNK> dame fan you'll probably enjoy the fact that the <UNK> dame victory march provides a seemingly constant soundtrack for the film if you're a <UNK> dame <UNK> well then you're probably not watching this movie anyway all american is an inspiring uplifting emotional film perhaps a tad overly sentimental but that's not such a bad thing it's a very enjoyable film one well worth taking the time to see
<START> i rented this tv movie version of and out of my library last <UNK> and simply could not believe my eyes where should i begin no effort was made to make the play look remotely like it was about the <UNK> war all the actors were wearing <UNK> dress moreover most of the actors were too old and horribly miscast with his white beard looked older than <UNK> was at least 30 hector looked like a spanish pirate <UNK> was badly played anyway and was a <UNK> br br likewise the action is poor the duel between <UNK> and hector is short and amateurish the camera angle focuses more on face so we can only see what is going on in the background which is frustrating in itself nor is the at the end given it's due respect we do not see and fight nor anyone else for that matter paris and <UNK> just seem to mud <UNK> in front of even death was <UNK> all this was a major disappointment considering i <UNK> through a very dull 2 and a half hours of bbc costume drama to get to that point br br nonetheless it wasn't all bad i thought the incredible orlando as and john as hector were well played even if they didn't look quite right i'd say the same about kenneth <UNK> as <UNK> since he didn't have the striking <UNK> and was a bit dry at times spoiler the climax at the end the death of hector was perhaps the best part of the film <UNK> dialogue here is excellent and sums up the attitude of a cold seasoned murderer however the <UNK> of the scene when <UNK> <UNK> on what was head sets it apart anyway br br charles gray as was delightful as a sleazy old <UNK> and i thought the actress playing did an ok job the war <UNK> however was annoying and i think that the play would have been better perhaps if he had been murdered by <UNK> instead of a like hector br br conclusion ok but could have been better if it had had a younger cast and costumes that at least attempted to look ancient not to mention the lack of action 5 10
<START> don't you just hate them slashers that never seem to get started it sometimes takes them a full hour of lame red herrings before some real action takes place tourist trap isn't like that if it's typically gruesome <UNK> you want than it's typically gruesome <UNK> you'll get plenty of it and constantly from start to finish this movie contains what is probably the greatest opening sequence in 80's horror cinema when a teenager on a <UNK> after engine trouble is trapped in a deserted house and <UNK> by a creepy collection of wax <UNK> four other <UNK> to the slaughter arrive at the house and encounter an utterly insane maniac that looks somewhat like a mixture of <UNK> from texas chainsaw massacre and one of those mad from old wax museum movies tourist trap is exciting horror entertainment with some genuine suspense grisly images ultimate weirdness morbid humor and terrific make up effects the plot twists aren't always original and the acting is pretty lousy but seriously who cares the fast pacing and the <UNK> killer icon caused this tourist trap to earn a spot amongst my 5 favorite slashers a bit surprising is the total lack of nudity though too bad because all the girls look ravishing and after only 10 minutes the obligatory line who needs a bathing suit is spoken
<START> much of the commentary on this board revolves around <UNK> the <UNK> of some comparison to r dogs made on the dvd cover forget about all of that this film er home movie is utterly horrendous how can anyone with a shred of credibility claim this as being 10 10 there is no plot none i couldn't believe that i spent money to rent this more on that later and that i had fooled myself into believing that this based on box cover art and some sort of film fest award <UNK> had potential the only thing i do really remember was that unbelievably one of the annoying main characters was supposedly <UNK> with a bullet to the head and he ends up surviving the wound and making it to the final credits alive wow and killers has a sequel double wow br br true story i actually was in so much denial that i had wasted my money and life force on this rental that i kept the <UNK> for what must've been six months i kept telling myself that it never actually happened the video on top of the tv was an illusion a mental symbol of my self loathing after someone pointed out that is was indeed real and that i needed to get a grip i decided that i couldn't just leave it there i thought how many others have i denied the suffering of sitting through the viewing of this masterpiece by <UNK> killers all to myself i had to do the right thing and return it back to the hell from which it came br br so as i imagine most of the <UNK> of imdb would do in a similar situation i <UNK> up some major courage and drove to the video store at <UNK> after making sure that no one was around i got out of my car still running of course slipped the movie into the drop box <UNK> and <UNK> the hell out of there never to return br br i guess i expected that some <UNK> from hollywood video corporate would come looking for me the bill must've <UNK> up to something like 1 <UNK> by that time so i moved away from the area however <UNK> much like the killers storyline nothing ever happened
<START> i love the book it's full of passion romance tension and the movie drags along taking two <UNK> stars with it <UNK> <UNK> was already a major star in australia having starred in <UNK> and releasing her first single the decision to cast her in the <UNK> was surely a marketing <UNK> for me it didn't pay off br br <UNK> may have been great in <UNK> but she was far too sweet and innocent to play the <UNK> lola and she wasn't of asian descent as lola was charlie <UNK> was an excellent <UNK> but there was no chemistry between him and <UNK> br br by and large the movie was boring it dragged on it lacked the passion of the book it focused heavily on <UNK> and in general was completely disappointing
<START> i knew full well when i rented this dvd that it could very well be one of the worst movies i've seen in my life but to say that it was one of the worst movies i've ever viewed would be putting it lightly i'm wondering if there isn't some legal action that can be taken against the individuals that allowed this film to produced i mean the <UNK> had to come from somewhere someone had to put up money for this to be produced br br i'd <UNK> several production values that led to the failure of this film but this film <UNK> every production standard in the universe i couldn't make it thru the entire movie as i started getting <UNK> the from horrendous filming techniques i also can't tell you how many scenes i just ended off during because of the inexplicably horrific dialog br br i feel like i've been <UNK> <UNK> for life if you viewed this movie before getting this warning you should think about starting a support group with me for the poor people who did view this monstrosity
<START> there is a version of <UNK> that is shown with a live <UNK> orchestra chorus <UNK> and the movie if it's ever performed within a day's travel of you see <UNK> done that way the <UNK> city <UNK> did it with the choir one of the finest anywhere a couple of years ago i think i cried through the whole thing it was one of the most emotionally powerful movie experiences of my life i'm listening to <UNK> on the radio right now and it still tears me up there are movies that i love and classical music pieces i love but there is no combination i can think of that comes close to the impact of <UNK> performed in real time
<START> i really liked the idea of traveling between <UNK> and i even liked the <UNK> quinn tension in early episodes some of the worlds they created gave the main characters extremely interesting backdrops for their stories however as the show went on there were more silly <UNK> among the friends and less of a true bond there was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more <UNK> and every world had one of the characters falling in love the writing just got boring and everything was way too over the top too bad it would've been nice to have a closely <UNK> band of friends a la star wars traveling to different <UNK> on tv for several years rather than a tired band of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> <UNK> 100 often referred as tarzan with clothes on but it's not at all in the same league as his far superior tarzan series basically the jungle jim series became a tarzan replacement for johnny <UNK> after he started getting too out of shape for a <UNK> in jungle jim he is fully <UNK> it can't compare to the tarzan series in any way not in acting screenplays or quality of production it's pretty hokey stuff this one is the first the best in the series and that isn't saying much too much stock footage is used and it is so obvious the score is overdone and the plot is lame and the production is so poor it makes it hard to watch at times
<START> i rented this movie because the dvd cover made it look like it was going to be a ridiculous college comedy like van wilder or animal house i took it to my friend house to watch for movie night we ended up stopping it 15 minutes into the film and watched <UNK> mountain instead i don't know if any of you have seen <UNK> mountain but it isn't great either however i would have to say that the alan thick jim carrey duo made it a more enjoyable watch br br i later finished <UNK> <UNK> this movie was slow and the humor was forced this movie reminded me of some <UNK> that i saw in some of my earlier production classes in college i was left wondering was this the film that <UNK> broken lizard to make <UNK> also how could this movie suck so bad <UNK> was good and club dread was decent don't see this movie
<START> when i found out there was a christmas vacation 2 i couldn't wait to buy the dvd i sent off my money and watched it as soon as it came through the letter box i love all the national <UNK> films with chevy chase in it and i bet he was glad he wasn't in this one i couldn't believe how bad this was you would think it was impossible not to laugh at a national <UNK> film but believe me it is this film probably looked like a good idea on paper having cousin eddie as the main character he started to get on my nerves from early on in the film and became totally unfunny by the middle of the film and by the end of the film i had gone brain dead and couldn't remember what had happened
<START> sorry for any spoilers that this contains but if you want to read on anyway i really wonder why so many people are so high on kevin <UNK> let's just take a quick look at his work as a screenwriter shall we there's scream 1 and 2 plus the story for the next one which i think are pretty funny but very overrated besides by making scream into a franchise it <UNK> to become a parody of horror movies and simply became another one then there's i know what you did last summer which is essentially the same movie again he co wrote halloween <UNK> but even he had the sense not to take credit for what he did on that monstrosity then comes the <UNK> which i can only say was god awful lots of fun to make fun of though don't even get me started on the ridiculous soap operatic <UNK> creek i could <UNK> about how bad that is for hours so then we get to teaching mrs <UNK> first of all there are tons of little <UNK> in this one for example in most high schools that i know of the <UNK> is not the only one who gets to go to college this idea that katie <UNK> character would never go anywhere unless she was <UNK> was absurd haven't you ever heard of financial assistance damn it also i don't think you get <UNK> from high school or don't get into college because of cheating on one test there are a bunch of other ones but i'll skip to the big one now the ending really bothered me they committed a crime but it was ok because the teacher was a bitch great do you know how many of my teachers i could kidnap based on that logic i'm sure the police never took any statements to find out the whole story either that sure wouldn't be necessary helen <UNK> was good she added some nice flair to a character who as a previous <UNK> noted had no reason for anything she did and has anyone else noticed that katie holmes absolutely can't act her self <UNK> became incredibly annoying you wanted me to fail blah blah blah her last two scenes with mrs <UNK> were the worst the only reason i don't regret losing 8 25 on this disaster is because she got beaten up a bit no wait i do regret losing the money it wasn't real and she survived mr <UNK> if you're reading this you've made the same movie some violence and or scary stuff <UNK> by wise ass kids who make sarcastic jokes and references to other movies just a few too many times now i count 6 so for not including scream 3 and whatever follows it and i would really appreciate it if you would stop otherwise i might just have to kidnap you and <UNK> you with a <UNK> ok
<START> the worst part about this film is that it did not have to be so terrible br br they had a nice budget though so do many films they made it look slick and pretty and best of all they had the 21st century lesbian <UNK> audiences who would embrace a lesbian positive film and yet the writer and director went out of their way to lift every single <UNK> film bit about lesbian torment and confusion at <UNK> schools you know the place all lesbian love lives and dies br br this is a theme that has been done again and again and again in film but something that viewers if one uses this voting forum as a clue cannot seem to get enough of br br every element of this story was so over the top <UNK> phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through the lead characters say it all the crazy abandoned genius rebel lesbian tough girl well they took a super pretty femme like <UNK> <UNK> and tried to rough her up but it didn't stick much <UNK> pretty rich girl who is destined to <UNK> her br br watching them every step of the way is character 3 a dopey well meaning wide eyed good girl <UNK> i say <UNK> <UNK> because she shares her every thought with the audience via the <UNK> most inane monologues br br her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk hearing them make love with their noises was um you know like well okay she says about her 2 <UNK> roommates who roll around in the bed next to her br br later she asks graham greene the accomplished native american actor who is completely wasted in a roll as a <UNK> is it wrong to care what people think br br sorry but is she a teenager or is she age 7 br br granted <UNK> <UNK> as polly the tortured dyke others do an okay job for the horrible lines they are forced to utter <UNK> has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera she would do well in a decent project so this is in no way a criticism of the acting br br but this story is shameless in <UNK> every single stereotype about lesbians all rolled into one character they couldn't stop with her polly being an angry crazy passionate secret genius who finished <UNK> problems for the speechless teacher oh but that's after she <UNK> with the teacher who <UNK> <UNK> her of <UNK> br br that's a word they males use against us women she says <UNK> out of the <UNK> br br is this all the writer could come up with or maybe we should ask why stop there br br <UNK> and co went on and made polly a poetic dark child who <UNK> with wild <UNK> by screaming their name in the woods br br cue the slow motion sci fi <UNK> atmosphere br br then we have her writing to her birth mother most lesbians are love <UNK> <UNK> in case you were in the dark br br then we have two teachers one uptight one a zany type with loose neck ties who <UNK> around all of the action the school looks awfully big for just 2 teachers and give dark child <UNK> bird girl tense looks <UNK> i wonder if something well you know um funny is happening between these two teachers br br there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done <UNK> happens but surely the writer and director know that lesbians exist in much more sophisticated times than this schlock br br i cannot reveal the ending out of respect to those who force themselves to sit through <UNK> the end but if you are not laughing i can only guess you are crying and not for the right reason and i don't mean the <UNK> make out scenes
<START> with all of the r movies out today it's hard to find something you can take the whole family to see my kids loved it it was good clean fun i would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to take the whole family out for a nice evening at the movies
<START> minor plot spoilers ahead br br how did such talented actors get involved in such mindless <UNK> br br drivel robert deniro plays a dumb hollywood version of the standard br br violence prone tough cop i e he beats up the bad guys and rolls his br br eyes at cops who prefer to stick by the book and eddie murphy plays a br br not so tough cop who would rather be an actor i e he screams out br br freeze police and has his tough look down pat naturally they br br are <UNK> when <UNK> loose cannon tactics get him in hot water br br with the media and he is essentially <UNK> into starring in a br br cops like reality show take a breath <UNK> that's as funny as it br br gets br br no energy was put into the script it feels like a pale <UNK> of br br every copy buddy movie tossed into a <UNK> with 15 minutes starring br br yes deniro himself as pretty much the character he is playing here br br the jokes fall flat the action feels <UNK> and no one seems to be br br having a good time it's dead on the screen br br please don't waste your time even if you have an <UNK> br br for one of the actors avoid it and do them a favor if this br br makes money these kinda of scripts will be perfectly acceptable br br for actors of their quality br br and to mr deniro you used to make serious films i remember them br br they were good you were nominated for awards for them remember how br br much fun that was now after analyze this which was good meet the br br parents which was also good and the adventures of rocky and br br <UNK> which was not good i think we need to see you <UNK> br br yourself less and being yourself more casino feels like a long time br br ago and no i don't count 15 minutes as serious bobby anyone who br br took that media satire seriously must get their weekly world news
<START> received this dvd from the accent range which is a label which <UNK> in art house <UNK> they released <UNK> and a range of <UNK> <UNK> br br the thing that struck me about alex strangely titled film modern love is that it is an impeccable film that <UNK> with perfection and vision a film that takes us into the mind of mr joe average <UNK> with voices in the head visions and madness it's set in rural redneck australia the film doesn't <UNK> or praise the folks like so many australian movies ie our films are full of <UNK> <UNK> or people with hearts of gold etc etc etc br br not in this film the spirit of stanley kubrick <UNK> large here it's not flawless but has a <UNK> attention to details a romantic streak and a mood that is <UNK> if not <UNK> br br minor <UNK> the transfer looks <UNK> front credits were <UNK> they don't fit in frame br br also one of the short films is <UNK> it stops half way
<START> i discovered the <UNK> in a dvd store and thought it could be a real action thriller no it´s instead a low budget movie with a ridiculous story it´s no doubt a cable movie and not one for the theatre fortunately after 90 minutes the movie stops otherwise the audience should have taken an anti virus against sleep one thing came over it was the nice country the film has been shot you can really feel the american air but <UNK> all i hope for steven seagal that he finally succeeds in a big hit it is not a must see because i and my wife voted average 4 10
<START> this movie was boring very much like underworld only even less interesting it's not much of a werewolf movie and no where near a horror film the lead couple were boring i totally didn't care about vivian and <UNK> and there was so little character development that i didn't care about any character in the film the plot was paper thin the <UNK> were basically <UNK> i did like the wolves themselves might as well have have done a wolf documentary i would have liked that better i wouldn't recommend this movie i didn't find it fun or interesting it just drags and everyone in it is a boring drag this movie could win an award for how not to make a werewolf film
<START> lacks the spielberg touch it's an all out assault on the senses featuring in your face dinosaurs watching this film was a bit like a roller coaster ride from hell br br the script is lame it simultaneously asks and then leaves too many questions unanswered also we don't really get to appreciate the humans in the film for all they're worth for example william h macy is too great a talent to have to compete with <UNK> thugs for our attention and laura dern was especially sympathetic in in this film she's barely a <UNK> on the radar screen br br the whole experience was t o o m u c h too much noise too many surprises too many characters dying off too much predictable gratuitous violence br br word to the wise vote yourself off this island br br i rated it a 3 for special effects i took off the other 7 points for having absolutely no originality
<START> to truly appreciate this film you had to be there acting or have been a crew member br br yes i am <UNK> and at the <UNK> old age of <UNK> have serious doubts about what we were doing did br br it all started out to be like a john waters type thing friends acting badly in bad films somewhere along the line the fun <UNK> people who were supposed to be friends didn't speak anymore and bad became worse br br i regret the bad image i might have projected try to fit in size one gold <UNK> pants br br other than that the film sucks so badly i would not even make my mama watch it br br to my director cast and crew i say br br why can't we just all get along br br it's been over twenty years people
<START> like in so many movies of the past you would think hollywood would learn this by now makes for a very disappointing movie not to mention make sure the kidnapped victim is alive first before paying the <UNK> br br maybe this film wants to remind of these basic facts in case it should ever happen to one of us why the long walk in the woods and can a city guy really go through the woods without getting lost just an opportunity for some sentimental dialog that was meaningless in the end br br i had to listen to part of the director's comments in the special features section from the great moves that redford has made in the past <UNK> for one surprised he agreed to star in such a film the director's comments and reasons were weak br br the best parts of this movie was the scenery can't wait for spring to come
<START> i'm a big fan of sleaze and horror movies when you put them together that's my sweet spot horrible sleaze you're not going to get it in this film though br br there is certainly sleaze in the form of girls being kidnapped and tortured tied naked to various things the sleaze isn't very sleazy though it didn't register very high on my sleaze <UNK> mainly because none of the girls were in the least attractive nor did they attempt to act as if they were even threatened they seemed to be thinking more about what was for lunch or maybe when they could score some crack br br forget the effects they were lame in the extreme the <UNK> was contributed to by the bad acting effects are harder to believe when even the actors and actresses aren't buying into them br br cinematography was pretty bad they could have hired a couple <UNK> from a porn movie and done better in fact that might have raised the sleaze factor enough to make it enjoyable as it is there are a lot of dark shots where you can't see very clearly and what you can see isn't looking too good br br the horror factor is <UNK> <UNK> zero <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i've seen kids movies that were more frightening there's no camp here either it's just a movie that attempts to be shockingly sleazy but doesn't even come close
<START> if hollywood had the <UNK> of the audience at heart we would see 20 films a year with the kind of wholesome <UNK> that is behind this film there are several experiences of personal growth in this movie and while the characters are still very human even the lessons learned are not that greed will profit you or do <UNK> others whatever you want as long as you are okay with it no this is what our sad <UNK> lives need more sense more love more do <UNK> others as you would have done <UNK> you more hope thanks ursula this movie has an intelligent wit not mama cracks that run rampant in the so called comedies people need to feel good this movie will make you feel good and possibly inspire you to better your life and the lives of others <UNK> every person counts in ticket sales this is a truly independent film if you want more quality films you have to support them
<START> but you probably have seen it or else you wouldn't be here it's so obscure that you probably stumbled onto it like i did because this little known gem receives no word of mouth br br from the very beginning you know how the storyline will shake out but watching as our innocent <UNK> nurse puts the pieces of the puzzle together is high quality entertainment most horror films <UNK> viewers with graphic displays of torture but don't look in the basement plays it subtle which makes for superior suspense note to horror filmmakers some of us do like subtlety lovely and <UNK> nurse charlotte takes a job at a <UNK> but is <UNK> when she learns that the head doctor who hired her had a gruesome accident and she is now the <UNK> to a mysterious doctor who we all know isn't a doctor at all the suspense is built through <UNK> <UNK> of events with assistance from many of the patients but which of the patients can charlotte trust this is a gem and is my absolute favorite true horror movie i love re animator and evil dead but they play more for the horror comedy crowd br br violence quite tame for horror standards but there is a decent <UNK> of gore throughout the film the opening scene is classic no other horror film starts out better and the end has its fair share of gore as well br br nudity eager to fall in love <UNK> betty chandler spends a good deal of time naked attempting to seduce half the men at the <UNK> betty chandler is a <UNK> and i am shocked that this is her only film credit br br story the story is well handled despite the premise getting a lot of <UNK> in hollywood the script has a knack for building suspense and never fails to place poor charlotte in a <UNK> situation br br acting betty chandler does the best job here as <UNK> capturing <UNK> with <UNK> in an <UNK> form the judge was splendid as well <UNK> facts before he came to a verdict while <UNK> as charlotte gives a genuine performance as you will feel for her character
<START> i wonder how someone could <UNK> on this movie it is based on an actual story it is not necessarily about <UNK> itself so to the one that posted on here that they need to make a real <UNK> movie you missed the point this is not another typical sports movie where a team sucks they hire <UNK> <UNK> and turn the team around and win the championship and give everyone the warm and <UNK> it focuses on a story it shows how someone can change his or her life for the better the movies now days are all about sex drugs <UNK> etc that is hollywood i am a big fan of movies but i have to say this was an inspirational movie with a great message if you consider yourself a tough guy don't watch the movie it won't live up to your standards if you want to watch a good inspirational movie this is a good one
<START> walt was particularly fond of quality so how come the producers at disney would release such a terribly edited roughly acted even for family fare mess of a movie the big green had a good concept and since it is disney you know how the movie is going to turn out obviously but the big green is horrible the jokes are lame and steve <UNK> still alive pulls in another terrible performance on his resume br br kids with too much time on their hands in small town are offered an opportunity by their new teacher to play soccer the kids don't know a thing though and <UNK> for us we get to see steve <UNK> try to hit on the teacher from beginning to end br br the speed up camera work does not work the big green is full of <UNK> the pace of characters to move the movie along kids are not idiots they will catch on if you give them enough of a hint without showing all that garbage <UNK> for once in his life should have turned down an offer to join this movie also the pretty olivia <UNK> should have called this one off too the big green can be known as 'the big bomb '
<START> arguably the finest serial ever made no argument here thus far about flash gordon professor and beautiful <UNK> <UNK> traveling in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet along the way in <UNK> spectacular and action packed chapters flash and his friends along with new found friends such as prince prince and the awesome king pool their resources together to fight the <UNK> and <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> of and the jealous <UNK> of his daughter aura now she's a car this serial is not just a cut above most serials in terms of plot acting and budget it is miles ahead in these areas produced by universal studios it has many former sets at its <UNK> like the laboratory set from the bride of frankenstein and the opera house from the phantom of the opera just to name a few the production values across the board are advanced in my most humble opinion for 1936 the costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and first rate we get <UNK> men shark men lion men high priests creatures like dragons and oh my and many many other fantastic things are all of them believable and first rate special effects no way but for 1936 most are very impressive the musical score is awesome and the chapter <UNK> are well written lengthy enough to <UNK> viewer memories of the former chapter and expertly scored director <UNK> <UNK> does a great job <UNK> everything together wonderfully and creating a worthy film for alex <UNK> comic strip lastly the acting is pretty good in this serial all too often serials have either no names with no talent surrounding one or two former talents here most everyone has some ability don't get me wrong this isn't a shakespeare <UNK> by any means but buster <UNK> does a <UNK> likable job as flash he is <UNK> aided by jean <UNK> <UNK> and the rest of the cast in general with two performers standing out but before i get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the hayes office i see more flesh on flash and on jean rogers and <UNK> than in movies decades later the shorts <UNK> and unfortunately for all of us professor frank shannon wears are about as form fitting a pair of shorts guys can wear the girls are wearing mid <UNK> throughout and are absolutely beautiful jean rogers may have limited acting talent but she is a blonde <UNK> <UNK> is also very <UNK> and <UNK> and beautiful but for me the two actors that make the serial are charles <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and fun <UNK> is a class act jack tiny plays king <UNK> rousing hilarious a symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of <UNK> steals each and every scene he is in the plot <UNK> here there and everywhere but flash gordon is the <UNK> serial space opera and the basis for loads of science fiction to follow excellent
<START> i usually seek to find good in movies even the bad ones unfortunately this movie is one where i fail miserably and the fact that there's barely one positive review on this board shows many imdb reviewers share my pain br br i don't usually watch sequels but i just had to see this since i love rosemary's baby so much what a mistake that was it simply <UNK> my belief in the fact that most sequels are lousy though thankfully very few are as bad as this in fact in my mind this isn't even really a sequel it's a satire on how bad a sequel can be movie recommended very highly for not viewing at any time ever
<START> <UNK> q is a great romantic prom movie amy jo johnson <UNK> q is a great actress i think she did a great performance i hope that sometime that the disney company could put this movie on dvd i think it's kind of cool and a little bit hilarious it's kind of sad when <UNK> q dies in a car accident in the beginning at first it makes you want to cry or <UNK> but in the middle when no one suspects <UNK> q it gets kind of funny and surprising there is a little bit of mystery in this movie but not much but still i would recommend this movie to the whole family if they enjoy comedy mystery or romance type of movies it's great i think that amy jo johnson as <UNK> q is cute
<START> this is an adaptation of a <UNK> <UNK> book which i did not read young <UNK> earl lives with his mom liz diane lane in a <UNK> lower east side new york apartment he dreams of joining his <UNK> father studying a fierce tribe in south america liz has boyfriends and does coke when he is caught <UNK> coke for her one of her customers liz is a legitimate <UNK> a rich mr <UNK> <UNK> her out in return for being his full time personal <UNK> in his huge estate in new jersey they are driven there in a <UNK> with her strung out lying in the back seat with her dress <UNK> way up and <UNK> showing this and a few low cut dress scenes is the only exploitation of ms lane some may be disappointed but i'm sorry she had to do all that stuff in <UNK> to make the a list that lady has more talent in her little finger than streep roberts and sally field do in their entire bodies and its time she was given her due when they arrive <UNK> makes friends with <UNK> and has a coming of age with his new girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> liz meanwhile joins <UNK> and dates an <UNK> doctor she miraculously <UNK> up instantly <UNK> however does a lot of drugs along with sex with his new friends seems like an ok guy but gets jealous when <UNK> takes <UNK> on a hot air balloon race instead of him and this leads to tragedy br br the genius of the story and movie is that they cut from the violent acts of the fierce filthy rich tribe to the warriors it's a little implausible though that when liz finds out what happens to her son she merely demands action from <UNK> and does not either contact the authorities or settle it thelma and louise style there are elements of a gothic romance with a revelation by the village idiot also they do almost no plot or character development prior to the move to liz for instance like <UNK> pearl <UNK> in walk on the moon had an <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> at 18 and felt trapped this is in the book but not the movie still these are minor shortcomings the movie will be in full release 12 <UNK> <UNK> over a year after the original release date and i just couldn't wait br br there were lots of red carpet moments in the theater i saw the movie at with almost the whole cast except diane lane q director dunne said she was off filming a movie i know she didn't promise to be there but i came from way out of town and it would have been such a thrill to see her in person the movie is a definite best picture <UNK> as for acting sutherland was quite good and so was the boy who played <UNK> lane was magnificent as always but i only recall one or two emotional scenes when she catches <UNK> with drugs lets get f d up together mother and son and with <UNK> your twisted <UNK> she would fare better with a supporting actress nod but it wont work that way unless they give it to her for a body of work
<START> this film does not have the outstanding visuals that american beauty or the ice storm offered and because it was made after those films it cannot be marked as very original either the music though subtly brilliant sounds very much like that of american beauty br br the story has some similarities with the ice storm in particular as well as <UNK> weaver without intent perhaps the film seems to try to recreate the success of the two aforementioned movies too much at times the story tends to stay a bit more shallow than it's bigger more successful brothers by having too much going on or by not delivering the most effective dialogs here the writing cannot measure with that of american beauty but that can be said about most movies ever made even the best and there is still a lot to like said music score and <UNK> given the cast effective performances of note is <UNK> <UNK> who would shine a couple of years later in the outstanding into the wild br br overall i can recommend this film if you like suburban dramas though it's not the first one on a list of must sees which would be topped by 1 american beauty 2 the ice storm 3 little children br br after you've seen and liked those check out this one
<START> i think that <UNK> is the best scifi since <UNK> 5 and is one of the best sci fi television series of all time <UNK> up there with dr who <UNK> 7 red dwarf mst3k and the aforementioned <UNK> i find the characters and races of <UNK> are much more interesting and imaginative than the typical humans with <UNK> that are found in many series the effects are quite good and the stories engaging despite missing the bulk of season 2 and some of season 1 i find the character development very well done
<START> i guess only a selected number of audience members really had any interest in watching how a male hustler in new york <UNK> but i'd be willing to bet that even these brave souls were turned off by the irritating <UNK> technique and deliberately <UNK> sound recording on display here the fact that these inherent were a direct result of the film's low budget underground experimental nature is i'd say beside the point anyway for those so inclined the film features extensive male nudity and joe understandably became an underground  and gay  icon br br the episodic structure showing the day to day routine of the hustler protagonist offers a couple of mildly interesting scenes his meeting with and eventually posing for an eccentric elderly artist the one where expresses his views on his unusual line of work and his particular <UNK> <UNK> to a couple of <UNK> including perhaps the of <UNK>  a <UNK> nerd perhaps mercifully the film ran for only <UNK> minutes against the <UNK> claim that its complete length is <UNK> but the latter could well be a mistake br br i had watched a few other of <UNK> <UNK> and this one is decidedly not as satisfying as the most tolerable example i've run into yet bad 1977 and only slightly better than the likes of my hustler 1965 which were mostly a strain to sit through the fact that this was only the first part of a trilogy did not well but as the saying goes you gotta to do what you gotta do and the other two <UNK> had to follow in quick succession br br despite my generally negative reaction to it flesh is nevertheless still valuable as a 1960s time capsule and as a prototype of the underground scene of that era both <UNK> and in real life for the record an image of from this film <UNK> the <UNK> of the self titled 1984 debut album and <UNK> candy darling who appears here rather <UNK> was <UNK> in candy says the opening track of the <UNK> <UNK> eponymous 1969 album although the latter band is my all time favorite and one of the reasons for this is that through their unique and ground breaking music they described a lifestyle so utterly different from my own this is truly a case where i'd much rather experience something <UNK> instead of visually
<START> genre cartoon short with no dialogue african girl and lion br br main characters the lion and the bird br br what happens a lion wants to eat an african girl called there is also a rather confusing bird is he on or the <UNK> side br br message br br my thoughts i agree with lee <UNK> this is rather mean on poor african people i like how the main character who is an african girl is quite a nice main character but they still portray her <UNK> and make a younger audience not like her very much just because she's hunting <UNK> charles m jones i don't like the lion very much and i think the bird is all right i suppose personally i prefer charles m <UNK> looney tunes cartoons in the future br br if you want to watch this anyway then i recommend the website youtube just type in on the space in the main page and you're there br br i wish charles m jones had been <UNK> to in this short so there br br recommended to people who are interested in old cartoons and or people who are just messing around on you tube
<START> i have never seen a b movie like this one on the part that the <UNK> <UNK> is being killed a hand of a woman appears on the tape handling the stick how bad is that lol i seriously laughed and wanted to stop seeing the movie but i kept watching it to see if this movie could get worse lol it is bad for itself poor <UNK> the only nice bit is the first time you see some special effects of <UNK> face moving apart from that the whole movie is awful it's not really worth your time if you don't really have much to spare but if you have nothing to do go on treat yourself with some z movie <UNK> b movie is still too good for this one lol
<START> this film is about the encounters of 7 couples on heath in one sunny <UNK> afternoon br br it shows 7 different types of couples married divorced breaking up a relationship homosexual elderly blind date and <UNK> service they are not connected to each other apart from the <UNK> location so that is a disappointment the film is a <UNK> of conversations without any discernible plot the film jumps from a pair to another without any logic i find this film boring and <UNK> the only redeeming feature is the great weather throughout the film it is sad that talents like ewan <UNK> and sophie get wasted by this film
<START> i love this movie it focuses on both issues reality and fantasy reality because hey we all wanted a date from that popular guy billy and some of us haven't been <UNK> yet right be honest br br another real issue is because of the pain people gain from <UNK> and <UNK> high school life remember it the fantasy is finding your true love when you're 25 and still in high school not really fantasy but close enough br br although some parts are unbelievable it was a great movie there are no other words to describe such incredible work and the story was wonderful drew barrymore did a <UNK> wonderful job same as the hilarious david arquette the people who worked in the movie are all wonderful didn't i just repeat that br br never been <UNK> is one of the movies that the later generations should watch it shows reality and some not issues for people like you and me
<START> i actually saw the evil on the big screen i saw it as part of a double feature during the early 1980s don't remember the other film when i was in my mid teens the film is bad cringe worthy bad embarrassingly bad the effects are atrocious you can clearly see the cable pulling the black girl across the floor there's absolutely nothing scary about it in fact i laughed throughout the film br br the story tried to create this big built up for the climax when we're suppose to finally see who's responsible for all the evil goings on and we see <UNK> victor <UNK> who's as scary as an <UNK> <UNK> seriously what where they thinking <UNK> who was a villain on the batman tv series is one of the <UNK> actors ever to grace the big screen and i just cannot imagine anyone being remotely terrified of him br br the evil is all but forgotten now for good reasons but it's actually a very funny film and i wish i could see this turkey again just to see that black girl being pulled across the room by an unseen force with that very visible cable
<START> hi today i looked this film because of the medium 5 6 imdb rating i thought it would worth viewing also the comments here were quiet good but after start watching this movie i quick realize that this movie isn't anyway near a 5 6 its just boring you can describe the movie with some words also its just the standard horror movie story with all the standard horror movie scenes i don't know why people still like those films or why they vote such films better then a 1 3 in imdb just some examples br br bunch of people arriving from somewhere or going driving to anywhere they meet somehow on their journey strange people but hey maybe they are just nice so hang out with them then a very important scene for every horror movie oh my cell phone isn't working oh oh mine too is that strange but we don't need them so enjoy our ride our strange person is a strange psychopath better we all sit back and scream a while till he starts cutting parts from us or killing some of us after a while the bunch of victims get a weapon or chance to escape <UNK> they never think about running away or even kill the psychopath if they got the chance they just talk about what to do until the psychopath got his weapon back with any of the handful of standard tricks they got in those films and all running back as usual screaming some more to kill oh and in the end it gets really <UNK> sometimes the bad guy wins sometimes some of the victim can escape wow great movies ok if i never ever saw a movie of that kind i would say it is a movie which can be watched but if anyone ever saw any movie of its kind it should be just a boring waste of time because nearly everything in the movie you know before you even watched it because it every time runs like the standard horror movie <UNK> maybe there is a windows program out there 2 0 you can just pull some <UNK> buttons and get the new <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kind of movie
<START> i have not seen a better comedy than the king of queens for many years i rate it one of the best ever i've just returned to ireland from arizona on american <UNK> from a <UNK> trip and by chance they showed several episodes i laughed my head off and later i asked the <UNK> to play again and they did thank you <UNK> the acting from all the team is first rate and especially from kevin james <UNK> and <UNK> stiller but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb i love all the cast they are so funny there is a hard edge in the king of queens that i love and is seldom seen in today's tv comedy both <UNK> and kevin play off each other so well that every situation is believable and hilariously funny i have just purchased the 2nd season while i was in <UNK> this week and i intend buying the full set the next time i am in the us my son who is <UNK> old also loves this show and its brilliance is that it has the magic to reach out to different generations i would like to thank all those involved with this amazing show it's so appreciated to see this kind of tv show in what is in my opinion an era of poor tv fair in general these days with the exception of re runs of seinfeld and such like thanks for a great show
<START> there's simply no redeeming quality about this film ok some of the costumes are ok but they're nothing you can't see in say the conan flicks and what's up with hair i can't believe this is part of a series i will say one thing about this film it was deemed bad enough for a righteous <UNK> by the early cast of mst3k and i suggest to anyone that's curious enough to see how bad this film is to watch that version of the film for moral support if nothing else
<START> i normally am a <UNK> for poor movies but this thing <UNK> br br do not watch this movie br br terrible effects and very little humour what the hell was the point of making this movie no gore to speak of and no acting to speak of br br i could only manage 45 minutes of this rat dropping of a movie and that is rare for me br br something positive to say about this drivel cover art was ok i am pretty sure the movie has a ending too even tho i did not make it to it br br the rats were <UNK> and blew their lines constantly they lacked intensity and seemed just to be going through the <UNK> for their <UNK> the actors were worse
<START> the violent death of <UNK> <UNK> da <UNK> only eight years after the <UNK> of this film only adds to the <UNK> of powerful message the film is split into two <UNK> the first in a <UNK> where a group of youngsters are abused and <UNK> by the violent law <UNK> and <UNK> the second backdrop is the city where they are confined instead by their own actions and morality which includes <UNK> <UNK> and killing different characters who enter their lives br br the <UNK> gender and sexual roles in the film allow for constant changes in the characters as they interact with other people particularly interesting is character of a <UNK> who is mother and lover to some of the children her reaction to the arrival of a prostitute is both poignant and tragic br br there is no happy ending to this story and i <UNK> to watch it with caution as there are some very uncomfortable scenes to watch especially in opening twenty minutes but whilst watching it it is important to remember that this is not just a fictional tale the actors are not trained professionals but instead boys selected from the <UNK> <UNK> they actually lived this life that is portrayed so vividly on screen and in da case died at the hands of the police who are depicted so brutally a documentary a piece of fiction it borders on both but it certainly makes for heart wrenching material and is a film that actually leaves you breathless and thinking long after having watched it br br 10 10
<START> i have realized that many people have commented on the nature of this show being racist and <UNK> but i don't feel that is what this show is about br br the show is about parents who weren't ready for kids and are now not ready for teenagers this show helps to bring humor to a very hard topic that is sometimes over looked <UNK> br br yes we have all had shows that had families in it for example family matters step by step family ties full house but it always would have the same old recipe to it's episodes <UNK> cuts from school and gets caught by her father they have a heart to heart conversation and music is played and it's over with a two week <UNK> that after an <UNK> dad gets a smile and the show is over where is the comedy in such a situation where is the realism with the war at home you get real situations from a real father type figure most parents that watch this show hear some of the lines the parents put out and they either laugh cause they know they've said it or they nod their heads cause they know they've thought it and never had the guts to say it the war at home has situations that bring out great comedy as a father thinking his son is gay doesn't sound funny most think it makes the father <UNK> but the comedy comes in the bumbling father trying to talk to his son to open up what parent knows the right thing to say especially in a situation as this i greatly recommend this show to anyone that i know has a sense of humor and especially to anyone who is a young parent or was young when they had kids you relate to a show like this when you are either
<START> this movie is something horrible i was laughing all the time i was forced to stop in some scenes because my mom thought it's not polite to laugh when people are dying but in this movie even death looks ridiculous especially when <UNK> tommy is sucked into one <UNK> br br explosions of cars thrown onto buildings by the forces of wind look like ones from the old school side game called r type dialogues are very bad and i am interested how they managed to <UNK> some of the actors to play in this movie it is simply amazing how such bad movie can make it into the tv br br only real reason to watch this movie is to have some fun of nonsense and absurdity
<START> this movie is excellent angel is beautiful and <UNK> is adorable his little when hes scared and the funniest parts are when <UNK> is caught under the curtain and when angel and <UNK> are singing never had this feeling <UNK> i totally recommend this movie its coming out on special edition on june 20 the cover has <UNK> on a garbage can and angel underneath the <UNK> br br i just cant explain this movie more than romantic charming hilarious and adorable the <UNK> scenes are funny all the <UNK> dogs have something special too funny i laughed kids will love it buy it when it comes out it has new features
<START> this is burt <UNK> citizen kane <UNK> nothing else he was ever involved in came close to approaching <UNK> machine it seemed to me that he put everything he had into it it is a movie that is in love with movies the opening sequence where detective single <UNK> <UNK> a bus load of <UNK> is an immensely exciting piece of cinema everything moves so quickly once it has started to go wrong that it appears to take on a life of its own a brilliantly achieved effect it looks cold tense and dangerous on mr <UNK> streets the <UNK> house looks dirty and tired full of desperate people on both sides of the law shouting <UNK> out trying to do deals or just stay alive into this underworld <UNK> the recently a reward for a <UNK> drugs bust caused by a corrupt cop he and his team are part of the vice squad information they pick up concerning a crooked politician leads them into the world of high class call girls and ruthless drug watching the apartment of one such call girl rachel ward falls in love with her portrait on the wall i know i know and when a woman's body is found with its face shot off in one of the rooms he thinks its her well i did say it was a movie that loved movies the scene where she walks in on him works beautifully even if you have seen the original the film is full of good touches i particularly like charles war story subtly acted and shot in sharp contrast to <UNK> <UNK> and torture which is suitably harsh and brutal i must mention <UNK> <UNK> and henry <UNK> as two <UNK> but equally evil brothers with absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever they are full on every time they're on screen and are no loss to society when their time comes mr end being extra special indeed as has been mention this is a clint eastwood movie that clint never made the biggest compliment i can pay <UNK> machine is to point out that in my opinion clint eastwood couldn't have made a better job of it the soundtrack is of an equally high standard featuring sarah <UNK> joe williams julie london <UNK> baker and other top class artists randy <UNK> street life plays behind the title sequence and i can never hear it without in my <UNK> eye seeing <UNK> along the sidewalk like other i have never understood why this film was a bit of a flop i hope it is due for a critical <UNK> particularly at a time when so many cop movies and shows without a quarter of its energy <UNK> and sheer <UNK> de <UNK> are <UNK> from the <UNK> if you're ever tempted to think of burt reynolds as a burnt out one trick <UNK> put <UNK> machine in your video machine i promise you won't be disappointed
<START> one would think that with the incredible backdrop of wwii <UNK> that the writers would come up with a script nope there is no story here it's like porn vignettes of violence interrupted by pathetic <UNK> and meaningless dialogue br br a bunch of germans march around shooting and getting shot slowly there are fewer germans to march around shoot and get shot then there are no germans to march around shoot and get shot br br pretty bad br br
<START> <UNK> seems to be turning out some quirky movies recently actually <UNK> seems to be developing its own little film industry i recently saw very annie mary which i thought was very good but plots with a view is not only quirky it's laugh out loud funny has a cast of wonderfully talented actors brenda <UNK> is amazing and a plot that while not entirely original is so cleverly written that one is always <UNK> picking up what might almost be throwaway lines it was the kind of movie that i wanted to watch again immediately it was over and one of very few that i would actually like to own even though many of the characters are caricatures and you have to have been to a <UNK> village to appreciate that they are also very human and the <UNK> between <UNK> and <UNK> is a joy to behold
<START> how on earth can you have such fantastic actors in such a miserable creation this is one of the most stylized pieces of rubbish i have seen in a long time not only is it poorly written it is a product of shoddy direction and editing the cinematography is so horribly manipulative and unoriginal and the montage <UNK> beyond belief the actual ideas behind the plots <UNK> toxic waste climate change are all fine to begin with but where the production direction team takes them is a big <UNK> of filth the likes of which are seen in one episode and this is a scientific series i am a <UNK> and all i can say is that the science in this film is utter crap almost embarrassing to watch i really felt bad for the actors involved since they were all extraordinary
<START> but other than that there's almost no redeeming social value to this sequel to the original <UNK> adventure where the heck are all the people from the original including the rescue crew michael caine <UNK> his most <UNK> performance to date although he later <UNK> himself with jaws 4 down the road slim <UNK> is just embarrassing as a stereotyped texas and generally you just have to wonder why did they bother irwin allen's last stab at <UNK> in on the disaster <UNK> i guess
<START> i bought x m on dvd in a two pack with destination moon now i see why the <UNK> did that no one who had ever seen this movie would buy it on its own br br i cannot <UNK> what school system turned out the reviewer who claimed that is great in its <UNK> of how space travel would take place launch straight up and then do a 90 degree right turn and circle faster and faster until you reach escape <UNK> i don't think i recall that from the apollo program never mind that the <UNK> should be <UNK> once they shut off the <UNK> gravity changes directions every time they pass through the <UNK> to the engine room going to the moon but missed it no problem it's just a hop skip and a jump with a helping hand from divine <UNK> and you'll be at mars and ok if you want to put life on mars given the state of <UNK> knowledge in 1950 it was a forgivable convention for the sake of the storytelling but can you make them look at least a little alien these martians looked like extras from the cast of 10 000 b c i can accept some scientific mistakes but this wouldn't pass <UNK> with an above average second <UNK> br br and that's aside from the screaming plot holes 12 minutes before launch as you're reminded of constantly by the <UNK> p a voice saying x minus so many minutes the <UNK> are giving a press <UNK> i guess the time <UNK> is why dr didn't change out of his coat and tie before <UNK> into space and how handy that even though they were planning to go to the moon and had pressure suits for that they brought <UNK> gear and <UNK> just in case they ended up at mars they're lucky they landed anywhere since apparently the method they had developed for landing was to have dr e look out the window and tell the pilot lloyd bridges to <UNK> down the every now and then note to the <UNK> of the 2 how about giving the pilot a window seat br br <UNK> the previous comments on the casual <UNK> that had eye candy dr lisa <UNK> doom them all by repeatedly <UNK> up her fuel <UNK> but hey that was the early <UNK> she was there to fill her <UNK> not a useful function br br x m is notable for being one of the first of the first films to say <UNK> we're all going to blow ourselves up with these here a bombs but one can note that about it without wasting <UNK> minutes watching such dreck by the way that message might have had a bit more impact had there been some money in the budget for actual sets of the martian city ruins rather than just <UNK> paintings br br i can appreciate good bad sci fi for the unique way the future used to look and for the inherent if condescending humor you can find when when we look back on the <UNK> of audiences 60 years ago but this film must have been insulting even then x m isn't even suitable for an mst3k style <UNK> sometimes bad is just bad br br anybody want to buy a dvd used only once i swear
<START> wild rebels was probably a fun second film at a drive in movie triple feature 40 years ago it hasn't aged very well but it was never meant to age well it was obviously intended to be <UNK> forgettable fun from its <UNK> taken on that level it's a good example of the biker flick genre br br several elements help <UNK> it from the dozens of similar films being <UNK> out at the same time the <UNK> steve comes off as somewhat of an unimpressive <UNK> he's not especially brave tough talented or handsome although he does win a fight with a tough biker gang member halfway into the film and the girl gang member chooses to help him over her fellow gang member at the end of the film the soundtrack is quite well done featuring a nice style bass drum riff that keeps things moving and <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> things up quite a bit and although the script is pretty shallow all the actors inhabit their cardboard characters convincingly and with a fair amount of energy br br there are plenty of <UNK> technical <UNK> terrible for <UNK> scenes that occur in broad daylight <UNK> <UNK> in a swamp fire <UNK> <UNK> stuck on the soundtrack instead of police <UNK> a bank sign made of <UNK> tape on a ceiling <UNK> a <UNK> that sounds like a winchester 30 <UNK> shotgun <UNK> that cut down people 100 <UNK> away a detective killing a biker on a 3rd floor landing from the ground with a revolver with a 2 inch barrel br br there are a whole bunch of goofy story elements linda the girl gang member a bank guard with a drug filled <UNK> the final shootout takes place inside a <UNK> police don't actually block roads the police apparently never heard of <UNK> and the police detectives apparently never heard of <UNK> bugs or having their undercover guy wearing a wire br br but the plot <UNK> along the cameraman knows what he is doing the pacing in most scenes is pretty good and there are some nice <UNK> one liners and dialog <UNK> here and there that keep the energy level up my favorite man you're messing with private stock ie linda so no don't seek this one out or anything but if a copy of the <UNK> version should fall in your hands you should have some good shallow fun watching it vastly superior to five the hard way or the or even <UNK> in gold three other <UNK> covered counter culture movies
<START> something of a disappointment lee j <UNK> is the anti union head of <UNK> in new york his partner in the business is killed when an elevator is unleashed and <UNK> twenty seven floors to the bottom of the <UNK> in the scariest scene in the film br br <UNK> doesn't know it or doesn't let himself realize it but the man behind the killing is richard <UNK> who <UNK> the business from union <UNK> br br then son <UNK> <UNK> returns from europe determined to learn the business and join his father in running a clean shop he's shocked shocked to learn that <UNK> has been <UNK> the union members and killing a few who have become <UNK> irritating br br robert <UNK> is one of the <UNK> who is killed by a couple of <UNK> <UNK> led by wesley <UNK> <UNK> leaves behind a widow <UNK> <UNK> with whom <UNK> understandably and takes up br br in the end <UNK> pays for his self deception <UNK> and <UNK> get their just <UNK> and <UNK> winds up with the <UNK> <UNK> after whom an opera house is named br br there isn't a <UNK> in any line of dialog a couple of lines are stolen <UNK> from on the <UNK> you'll talk yourself right into the grave the plot is <UNK> and holds absolutely no surprises vincent <UNK> direction is pedestrian the photography is flat an uninspired though there are a couple of nice shots of new york streets br br lee j <UNK> can act in this case it must have been easy for him because he <UNK> johnny friendly from on the <UNK> only this time with a soft heart richard <UNK> can act too joseph <UNK> in a minor part does a good job <UNK> <UNK> hits her marks says what the script demands and does what the director tells her to a stunning woman her life <UNK> early on the director and photographer do a good job on wesley <UNK> he has white hair a face eyes the color of a <UNK> lake and he's sometimes shot through a wide angle lens than turns his surprisingly <UNK> lips into those of some kind of <UNK> fish i don't see him as a low <UNK> muscle man though he and <UNK> should have switched roles harold j stone is his reliable self although he's forced to be more italian as tony than comes naturally to him nobody else in anything resembling a major part is more than mediocre and some performers don't clear even that bar <UNK> <UNK> may be a nice guy in real life but he's <UNK> <UNK> and belongs in domestic dramas on afternoon television br br great title suggestive of intrigue and shadows some good people in the cast a potentially explosive expose of a business nobody knows much about but which deals in <UNK> br br and it all comes out like this
<START> although the video box for many copies of this film claims it is about people turned inside out this is a total lie in fact apart from the opening segment the film isn't even a horror movie with its <UNK> treasure <UNK> of fish people and mad scientists it's a lot more like a doug <UNK> adventure movie obviously this film is no work of art but it's kind of fun to watch just be warned that the beginning is quite gory

<START> in the film we see the faces behind the monumental shift in the history after it is <UNK> from the <UNK> and we see the motives behind those men into whose hands the raped and starving country fell br br is not a movie for the hyper masses it demands the attention of its viewers with raw truthful acting and intricate packed dialogue little of the main plot is shown through action it relies almost solely on words but there is a recurring <UNK> that is only action and it is the stroke of genius that makes the film an <UNK> and powerful <UNK> of the tense political struggle that the independence gave birth to br br this film is real it is raw depiction of those in power and those on the streets it is eye opening in its content and it is moving in the passions and emotions of its superbly portrayed characters br br whether you are a history fan a film buff or simply like good stories is a must see
<START> there are certain scenes in this film like the hero's first meeting with super <UNK> shirley <UNK> where it seems to be on the edge of breaking sexual <UNK> and doing its premise females want to rule the world by making men slaves justice but it never <UNK> to the result is a film with no sexuality and some tame violence despite the choppy plot the film is not overly bad until its climax where its <UNK> runs rampant terrible editing <UNK> of stock footage worth seeing only as a <UNK> 1 2
<START> from the makers of underworld we have by far the worst werewolf movie i have ever seen it is basically a <UNK> version of underworld yet lacking vampires not a big deal cool effects a big deal and generally just about everything that can possibly be done right to produce a decent film dealing with <UNK> the biggest deal of them all a twenty something <UNK> chocolate maker named vivian is currently <UNK> in romania ever since her family was hunted down and executed in front of her years ago in america for being werewolves there she belongs to a small society or pack of werewolves and is apparently chosen to <UNK> <UNK> the pack leader gabriel whose son some <UNK> with a british accent takes it upon himself to hunt outside of the pack they have apparently been discovered in other countries prior and want to remain settled in romania by avoiding negative attention so of course such activity is considered forbidden vivian ends up falling in love with an american artist who is oblivious to her involvement with the group of blood <UNK> <UNK> when they end up discovering the secret relationship things get messy when someone is killed and the human is forced to participate in a deadly tradition in which he is set loose in the woods and is hunted giving the pack a chance to <UNK> into their <UNK> <UNK> all this really consists of is a big leap before they light up and land as a wolf very <UNK> effects the entire movie is like a <UNK> down underworld with some <UNK> romantic montages and very little action watching this in the theater i could not wait for it to end a <UNK> boring disappointment avoid
<START> <UNK> 1993 was an incredible movie in my opinion it is one of finest the movie itself <UNK> feelings of sympathy fear confusion happiness and sadness <UNK> role was unbelievable in fact he gave obsession a new face <UNK> innocent and <UNK> character <UNK> greatly with <UNK> fiery and passionate character sunny <UNK> role made the good guy role seem like the bad guy one the fact that <UNK> not sunny captivated the audience's attention proves that everyone has that helpless inner drive to pursue something that's not really in their hands even though the movie is several years old it surpasses any recent one the song <UNK> mere was full of passion and meaning his personality fit the role perfectly he should seriously consider re starring in a similar film
<START> watching <UNK> is the movie equivalent of trying to eat one's way out of a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> three hours this indian film is a <UNK> sweet sentimental soap opera that starts off like king <UNK> moves on to romeo and juliet in the middle section then heads back again to king <UNK> for its tear <UNK> finale br br raj is a bank <UNK> who seems to have everything a man could possibly want out of life a wife who <UNK> him a family who loves him and a job from which he is about to <UNK> after a lifetime of faithful service even though raj and his wife <UNK> have been married for 40 years and have four grown sons they still act like a couple of love struck <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> their eyes at one another and <UNK> sweet <UNK> into each other's ears almost to the point of <UNK> in fact the whole bloody <UNK> is so happy loving and <UNK> that they make the von look like a dysfunctional family in comparison the parents and children joke together laugh together even perform <UNK> choreographed spontaneous song and dance numbers together like many bollywood productions <UNK> is a drama interspersed with a great number in this case far too great a number of musical sequences br br anyone who knows anything at all about storytelling is aware that such <UNK> bliss can not be allowed to go <UNK> for long and that all that joy is merely the <UNK> to some awful catastrophe destined to come crashing down on the heads of our unsuspecting <UNK> knowing this we spend the first hour of the film in <UNK> expectation wondering just what form that disaster will take when it does finally arrive the occurs about an hour into the film when raj <UNK> to his children that he and their mother have decided to move in with one of their families leaving the choice of which one it will be up to the kids and their respective <UNK> suddenly like king <UNK> discovering the <UNK> hidden in the <UNK> <UNK> raj finds out that his children are not quite as loving <UNK> and eager to share their homes and lives with their parents as he had originally thought understandably horrified at the <UNK> the kids in order to foil their parents' plan come up with a scheme in which raj will go live with one of their children while <UNK> will live with another then they will switch off until eventually each of the children has had a chance to host both parents and then the cycle will repeat itself ad <UNK> much to the <UNK> of the kids the parents <UNK> to the plan even though the two are deeply in love with one another and have never spent any time apart thus the second and most of the third hour are spent with the two aging albeit married lovers <UNK> away for one another while their <UNK> <UNK> little <UNK> do everything in their power to make their parents understand how <UNK> they are in their homes br br one of the major problems with <UNK> is that it lacks subtlety in both its storytelling and direction the love that ray and <UNK> feel for one another as well as the almost <UNK> <UNK> of the family unit is laid on so <UNK> in the first hour that the film almost <UNK> under the weight of the sentimentality then virtually without any warning the screenplay turns on a dime and <UNK> the kids into <UNK> self centered monsters and the parents into passive whiny victims of that <UNK> raj and <UNK> are a little too long in the tooth and a little too self <UNK> to be doing the dreamy eyed <UNK> <UNK> love bit more appropriate to <UNK> school kids than the parents of four grown children the purple <UNK> style in which every emotion is <UNK> and <UNK> leads to intense overacting and a heavy <UNK> on corny reaction shots and melodramatic music for <UNK> the musical numbers convey a certain <UNK> joy in the beginning but they go on for so long and turn up so frequently that they quickly lose their <UNK> and serve only to pad out the material to <UNK> proportions at least a full hour could be <UNK> from this <UNK> production with no discernible harm being done and quite a bit of good there really is no reason why this film needs to drag on for a <UNK> three hours most <UNK> of all is the seemingly endless <UNK> we are subjected to an the end a speech in which raj who has somehow managed to turn his experiences into an award winning <UNK> <UNK> us all on the of parent child relationships for ten straight minutes at the very least br br <UNK> is a sappy corny saga filled with more sugar and goo than a king sized box of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at your own risk
<START> this is one of my favorite films for many reasons to begin there are standout performances from lovely debra <UNK> as a princess dancing girl from michael <UNK> as the villain handsome young jeffrey hunter investigating crime in her city state and others the film is an unusually colorful adventure and we even see the princess <UNK> the dance she later performs for once she manages to <UNK> hunter before she learns he is on her side also the photography the costumes by lionel <UNK> music and the film's style are unusually fine add to this rousing action intelligent characterization and fine direction by veteran <UNK> jones of a <UNK> <UNK> script set in ad and you have the ingredients of an enjoyable <UNK> near eastern but there is much to praise about the unusual and well developed storyline here as there is much more to praise other than the film's swift pace well managed physical action sequences and superior technical aspects <UNK> trained actors such as michael edgar <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jack <UNK> and <UNK> drake are not <UNK> found in one b film together nor are there fascinating sets a variety of locales and a mystery of the quality that is <UNK> here one way of <UNK> a film is if i were guaranteed to live through the experience would i choose to <UNK> these events and perform these actions since my answer is a <UNK> yes in this case this film remains one of my choices as a favorite and very underrated cinematic work could it be that us <UNK> all too frequent disdain for females as warriors and <UNK> that as in so many other cases has caused closed minds to this <UNK> film's obvious anti <UNK> and pro entertainment qualities
<START> i've just seen a couple of episodes of <UNK> hour but i must say that they were enough to impress me this series is just so impressive and interesting i'm definitely going to follow it br br first of all i must say that the acting is top notch patrick stewart plays his character ian the scientist <UNK> and <UNK> and he makes the audience believe in the character other characters such as rachel are also believable and although they sometimes are a little cold due to the way the series is filmed they're interesting br br the stories told by this series are also interesting for example one of the episodes i saw was about <UNK> and a man who was trying to clone humans the way the episode was developed and how ian stewart kept following clues and saving people was amazing in addition it made you think about <UNK> and how good or bad could this be br br anyway i think this is one good tv shows i just hope it keeps going on like this interesting thought provoking and with good acting even though it's filmed in a kind of cold way little lightning cold photography lots of close ups it never stops being interesting highly <UNK>
<START> there are few films that have had me waiting and waiting for release more than this one this is the latest film from the dead gentlemen group responsible for the original <UNK> film and the demon hunters films this group has not been terribly active over the last few years but this film is a definite reason to try and keep things up in following their progress br br this film follows a group of <UNK> who are trying to finish a campaign run by a <UNK> frustrated by his <UNK> disregard for his story with the help of some new blood they attempt the campaign again with hopes of finishing this time br br this movie is a breath of fresh air in the movie community and a great improvement over the original the movie shows respect for the game much like the original movie did but on top of that this movie shows a dramatic improvement on special effects <UNK> it above the simplicity of college films the acting is fairly decent and the jokes are quite funny br br unfortunately many of the jokes are in jokes so if you are not a <UNK> you may not find the film as funny as others so this is why i give the movie an 8 instead of the 9 that i initially thought of any case if you are a <UNK> or know about <UNK> check this one out you will enjoy it
<START> i have read all of jane <UNK> novels right the way through once a year every year since i was 9 years old and received the modern library edition of her <UNK> works as a birthday present br br i loved this movie for its romance and for the music which stayed <UNK> in my head it was an interpretation of course not an emma or a sense and sensibility but something quite different and something catherine herself would have loved and oh to be loved by this passionate henry this was the henry of <UNK> imagination and she is the romantic heroine she read about in her novels and which was promised to us by the practical jane austen who tells us right at the beginning that the unlikely catherine will indeed be one i wonder if jane was being entirely satirical in her novel perhaps she too could imagine such a henry br br i haven't seen the film in many years at least a decade but i have been yearning for it ever since
<START> <UNK> back to those good old days of 1971 we can vividly recall when we were treated with a whole season of charles chaplin at the cinema that's what the <UNK> guy called it when we saw him on <UNK> old talk show we can't recall just whose it was either <UNK> or woody <UNK> one or the other the guest talked about sir <UNK> career and how his films had been out of <UNK> ever since the <UNK> <UNK> of the former little from los on the grounds of his being an <UNK> alien no <UNK> he's not from another planet br br charlie had been deemed to be a due to his interest and open <UNK> into various political and economic systems everything from the <UNK> movement from the <UNK> and before the <UNK> to <UNK> in its various forms were fair game for discussion at <UNK> hollywood parties which of course meant the inclusion of the soviet style which we <UNK> call communism br br <UNK> mr <UNK> <UNK> was both <UNK> by one little detail he had never become an american citizen br br anyhow enough of this background already br br suffice it to say that he had become non in the united states of america it was high time to get the old films out of the <UNK> and back out to the movie houses it'd sure be a great gesture by us easily <UNK> and quickly forgetting br br it would be a fine gesture to the great film making artist besides the academy of motion pictures arts <UNK> was planning to honor chaplin with a special tribute at the 1972 oscar show this would surely be a <UNK> yet <UNK> <UNK> of pathos a plenty for having america invite charlie back and have him come and receive a special academy lifetime achievement award in front of a world wide television audience <UNK> in the millions br br besides that would be a natural for promoting the chaplin season at the theatre remember the little tramp was as <UNK> as a <UNK> man as he was as a film maker the program consisted of <UNK> of modern times city lights the great dictator <UNK> a king in new york and finally the chaplin <UNK> we remember being very excited in the anticipation of the multi date film fest br br in our fair city of chicago it was <UNK> for the <UNK> theatre on rush street the <UNK> lead off with modern times and all of the others would be shown one at a time each staying for whatever period was necessary in order to satisfy the <UNK> desire to view each picture as we recall the very last on the schedule was the chaplin <UNK> br br in retrospect we look back and wish that they had begun the run with <UNK> as there were undoubtedly <UNK> of <UNK> much like ourselves who knew very little about his <UNK> in motion pictures except for those <UNK> <UNK> and mutual silent shorts that were being shown as regular feature on so so many <UNK> shows all over the country oh well once again no one <UNK> me br br <UNK> on today's <UNK> guest film the chaplin <UNK> we found that it was actually three separate pictures carefully bound together by the use of narration by chaplin himself some lively themes and incidental music once again written by chaplin and some happy talk and serious narration <UNK> by chaplin he opens up the proceedings by making use of some home movie type of film depicting the construction of the chaplin studio in hollywood as well as some film taken of some rehearsal time showing director chaplin <UNK> just what he wants to a group of actors br br this segment was well done and well received by the audience both the building humor and the rehearsal were <UNK> by making them seem <UNK> the rehearsal naturally the building by use of <UNK> up the <UNK> <UNK> process the old trick makes it appear that the buildings were almost building themselves br br this <UNK> of shorts <UNK> three of <UNK> short comedies from his <UNK> with first national pictures roughly that being <UNK> to <UNK> the choice was well thought out and gave us a wide variety of subject matter and mood br br first up was shoulder arms charles chaplin productions first national pictures <UNK> as the title suggests it is a tale of world war i released in october of <UNK> with about a month to go before the <UNK> day of november 11 it was a comedy of comical army gags and a romance between private chaplin and a french girl miss <UNK> the <UNK> is fast physical and in the grand old tradition of <UNK> the enemy the german army br br displaying an excellent example of the old <UNK> about children and dogs bringing folks together the next film a <UNK> life chaplin productions first national <UNK> <UNK> the parallel lives of <UNK> tramp and a newly adopted stray <UNK> the movie story involves families two of them one <UNK> <UNK> one <UNK> and both <UNK> us with some big surprises br br as the finale we have the <UNK> chaplin first national <UNK> was a good choice to have as the finale it was bright light and tight it was an <UNK> into the area of the western spoof comedies of such type having been done since by every comedian and team the <UNK> in the story is not of your standard <UNK> variety but rather a dude or <UNK> who has <UNK> out west the tramp is not only that guy but his character is an escaped convict who is <UNK> thought to be the new <UNK> of a western town's church br br our rating that is <UNK> and me is that's four br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i was blown away by this film i'm one of those people who just takes a risk with movies that don't especially appeal to me sometimes and i've got to say this one paid off i mean wow even my young boys enjoyed the film 5 and 6 at the time though i'm quite certain this was not <UNK> to their age groups br br this movie was clean too which is a great plus it is so great to sit down to a movie you thoroughly enjoy without profanity violence except one very brief scene or anything else one is likely to find morally <UNK> br br this movie brought you along on a journey you are so ready to believe because of the great acting you feel the vast range of emotions portrayed along with the characters br br i never thought a golf movie would have me at the edge of my seat but i couldn't help being intensely interested in how this one would turn out i have nothing to compare it to since i have neither watched golf in reality or on film before but everyone did a great job in keeping the pace and emotions captivating here the score also did wonders excellent excellent score br br even if you don't think this would be your kind of film watch it you may be pleasantly surprised i certainly was
<START> william haines sparks this tale of a <UNK> <UNK> who thinks west point will really be something now that he has arrived terrific <UNK> comic performance by haines was his trademark one that made him a top box office star from <UNK> 1932 and one of <UNK> biggest stars joan crawford and william <UNK> are fine too and although this storyline may seem trite now this was a huge hit putting haines and crawford in a college football a national <UNK> during the <UNK> story after haines blows off his big mouth one time too often and nearly gets <UNK> by fellow <UNK> he turns in a wonderful performance as he <UNK> his pride and gets into the big game against navy even with a broken arm he wins the game for army and <UNK> his place at west point it's easy to see from this film and show people with the always underrated marion davies why billy haines was a huge star of the time he needs and deserves to be remembered
<START> yes said title line does actually appear in this movie why i'm not sure when the line was actually being said didn't somebody in the crew filming at some point laugh i would have liked to see the <UNK> from this movie mostly because i think they would be more entertaining than the movie itself br br <UNK> by director jim i know what you did last summer comes a teen slasher movie that seems to assume we haven't ever seen a teen slasher movie before of course he's not to be given all the blame there are also three writers responsible and this is somehow based on a video game that's still in production the title of said game is <UNK> but upon looking for information on it i came up with absolutely nothing br br and so we begin the movie i would like to say before i continue that i wasn't expecting this to win an oscar when i am in the right mindset i enjoy a fun horror movie to pass the time i think there exists an opportunity for an effective original and smart slasher movie <UNK> is not this movie br br there is almost no character development at all that's fine you don't expect a whole lot however instead of a well <UNK> cast of a few this movie decides to introduce us to the following many horror movie cliché characters br br 1 the final girl she has just broken up for her boyfriend this means that at some point in the movie when they are in peril they will decide to get back together again which more than likely means he will die and she will be the last remaining survivor of the movie <UNK> is played by <UNK> <UNK> without much enthusiasm i might add br br 2 the boyfriend he's just around to co exist with the final girl until his demise sure he can save her but he's doomed and we know it eric is played by jonathan jackson br br 3 the <UNK> usually horror movies only feel the need for one of these but here we have two they they steal they might show their breasts not in this case or they might possibly be <UNK> a <UNK> of the genre they also wander around in <UNK> lit areas all on their <UNK> usually saying things like hello is there anybody there <UNK> and patty suitably named are played by <UNK> phillips and <UNK> br br 4 the jackass sure he looks pretty but he's the idiot in the movie that's inserted purely to be an idiot he says stupid things does stupid things has obviously never seen a horror movie and is one of enjoyable kills you watch this kind of thing for sean is played by d j br br 5 the girlfriend she loves the jackass even though pretty much nobody else does and she's usually the one left alive for a while so she can scream and cry until she starts <UNK> and gets left behind rachel is played by laura <UNK> br br 6 the creepy janitor in this case the creepy gas station attendant enough said ray is played by rick <UNK> br br i could continue but i think you get the picture the remaining characters aren't so much common as they are equally there's the gay guy as ricky who definitely got robbed as far as screen time is concerned and the one who knows what's going on of course none of that matters because at first everyone always thinks that one's crazy is played by <UNK> good br br there are a couple other characters namely a deputy played by method man but he and others are killed off pretty quickly and get even less character development than the following clichés br br so you're probably thinking why does this movie require such a deep analysis it's just a summer horror flick for out loud based on that question does it deliver the goods yes and no the acting isn't particularly convincing even given the amount of talent involved <UNK> phillips was <UNK> for her performance in larry <UNK> bully and <UNK> <UNK> has been an up and coming talent for a while now br br so what about the gore there's some that's really about it a lot of the bits are cut <UNK> namely a scene involving <UNK> face and a used to remove paint from cars br br to the <UNK> credit there are a couple interesting scenes i liked the bit where part of a house was literally ripped off so that the <UNK> villain could get to the characters br br if this had all been centered around a smarter screenplay in which the characters didn't make the same dumb mistakes literally hundreds of horror movie characters had made before them it might have made for a more enjoyable experience all of the most interesting characters are immediately killed off in the first third of the movie and then it just becomes a not particularly interesting <UNK> until we know it's just the creepy janitor and the final girl br br i suppose i must be a little jaded but as a horror film fan i'm left wondering why i should have bothered when i could easily have written a better screenplay myself i won't even mention the numerous instances of terrible cgi
<START> after three outstanding bbc television <UNK> and a christmas special the bizarre and grotesque yet <UNK> lovable characters of bleak fictional town <UNK> <UNK> make the jump to celluloid along with their creators the league of gentlemen br br mark <UNK> steve <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are the more familiar three quarters of the <UNK> with the central roles shared between the trio in an added twist the final member of the team jeremy <UNK> is portrayed by actor michael sheen br br where to start <UNK> sheen is in conversation with his writing <UNK> when horror of horrors he is paid a visit by two of his characters both <UNK> <UNK> and edward <UNK> are unhappy at the decision to kill off the <UNK> inhabitants you're not real screams <UNK> in vain as the local <UNK> from hell exact their revenge mayhem ensues as reality and <UNK> <UNK> with the vast array of characters entering our world to save theirs br br confused you will be as the camp innuendo ridden <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is forced to take on the daily <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> is kidnapped by <UNK> butcher <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br with shades of an even more demented misery <UNK> attempts to force <UNK> to rewrite the film thus continuing his life but leaving <UNK> in charge is never a good idea the <UNK> comedian becomes <UNK> in the latest post <UNK> adventure the king's evil entering a typically twisted <UNK> century england complete with cameos from victoria wood peter kay and david warner known as george of <UNK> due to his <UNK> line of clothing <UNK> saves the day and is treated as a hero but for the denouement of the film he joins characters old and new at the church of <UNK> <UNK> to meet with their makers br br for fans of the series the film is a must see and yes it does feature <UNK> albeit a little too <UNK> pen loving pauline mickey barbara and cursed vet matthew <UNK> are some of the other favourites on show and the portrayal of themselves plus <UNK> as <UNK> is also a fascinating insight br br the league of gentlemen are the <UNK> of british comedy they are ambitious groundbreaking witness the excellent series three and not happy to rest on their <UNK> they also <UNK> opinion <UNK> br br certainly their macabre sense of humour is not for every <UNK> and while not written exclusively for <UNK> a grasp of the storyline would benefit those who have previously viewed the series nevertheless apocalypse is a film in its own right and the league will no doubt manage to attract a new breed of fan as well as <UNK> and pleasing existing ones
<START> ugh this is the worst <UNK> hands down no good matches hulk hogan <UNK> his over <UNK> bald head yet again in the main event the spot light <UNK> not one thing note worthy on this tape oh i take that back this is jim <UNK> first <UNK> but other than that it has nothing worth a major bust br br 1 out of 10 stars <UNK>
<START> as jennifer used to say on square <UNK> gag me out the door i would definitely vote this movie on <UNK> worst movie list br br dennis christopher plays t t a guy from chicago who goes to california his brother's jazz records he is supposed to be a barney placed in the locals only surfing community but he acts more like he is new to civilization just try to get through his sex scene without <UNK> there are also the on going adventures of the rest of the local population that the viewer must endure that of duke seymour <UNK> the <UNK> expert who tries to get t t to act like a normal human being the obnoxious drunk surfers who cheat on their girlfriends and the guy who makes a bet with another that he can live in car for sixth months br br california dreaming is just a big old mess it starts out like a typical seventies romp complete with bad 70s music even though this movie came out one year shy of the 80s and dennis christopher comes off as the most <UNK> loser it makes the movie hard to watch keep your finger on the fast forward button even if this movie was supposed to be about the <UNK> culture the surf scenes are almost total garbage the people at the surf contest look as though they can't keep from falling asleep br br i guess the only cool thing is seeing <UNK> roberts outside of her role as <UNK> on the sitcom that's 70s show and <UNK> wasn't bad he was just in a bad movie
<START> i always wanted to see <UNK> <UNK> in blue for a very long time i've always been intrigued by the title the star and the desert but for some now pretty clear reason this film is never shown on tv or i've happen to miss it if it's ever shown well after watching the dvd i now know why the movie is rarely shown it's because it's not that good in fact i'd say it's pretty much of a mess br br <UNK> <UNK> in blue was made by a first time director and it shows the film is mainly a series of vignettes with absolutely nothing holding it together more like a collection of short movies <UNK> strung together the movie can be boiled down to this intro murder cop and girlfriend together intro credits cops going to work crazy guy tells story cop finds dead body cop and chief and girlfriend at bar chase scene etc the scenes just don't flow together they're very <UNK> independent from each other and because of this the characterization is weak borderline amateurish the scene at the bar with the girlfriend the scene at the farm with the hippies the scene with big john and the chief yelling at each other were cringe worthy i almost stopped the film during those awful moments br br the film <UNK> lack of experience is in evidence throughout the film the style like the 1970s is all over the map the intro credit scene makes the movie look like a commercial for law <UNK> then it tries to be a buddy film big john and <UNK> then a murder mystery then a melodramatic love story etc a film doesn't have to have one particular style in order to be successful but i'm afraid the style in <UNK> <UNK> in blue was confused you can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he was going with it br br the film is not a complete disaster while the content of <UNK> <UNK> in blue is almost amateurish the look of it is extremely and <UNK> professional the cinematography is stunning every frame is worthy of an <UNK> at an art gallery or because the first and last time director was involved in the music business worthy of an album cover the beautiful look of the film gives more <UNK> to the finish product than it really deserves and thanks to robert <UNK> acting of a really badly written character the film maintains a certain level of realism even though nothing else makes much sense what's remarkable about the look and composition of the film is that it's been copied and <UNK> a million times over the intro credits reminded me of something like top gun which was made 13 years later scenes of johnny dressing up with his clothes on the bed reminded me of american <UNK> strangely enough <UNK> <UNK> in blue has a very contemporary feel to it due to the stunning visuals even if the story and the philosophy behind it are hopelessly outdated br br so <UNK> <UNK> in blue is on one hand a remarkably underrated and overlooked film because it obviously influenced a lot of future filmmakers out there when it comes to the look and composition very few films can claim to have achieved this and legendary cinematographer conrad hall should take full credit but on the other hand is also deservedly forgotten because the poor characters confusing story and muddled direction none of which are worth of remembering
<START> although inevitably linked to the 70's decade the concept of exploitation cinema is actually nearly as old as cinema itself moreover universal studios practically invented the term with their long running monster <UNK> dracula frankenstein the wolf man and the mummy every original classic <UNK> a couple of sequels at least and after a while they even thought up the idea of making genuine monster house of frankenstein released one year earlier and also directed by c was quite a successful effort with interesting ideas and <UNK> performances but house of dracula is a little too loony for me to recommend it the plot suffers too much from extremely irritating situations forced twists dialogs and  most of all  a far too short running time to elaborate the <UNK> personalities like they deserve <UNK> stevens doesn't receive top billing but plays the most fundamental role as miracle a doctor who's challenged to cure count dracula carradine from his <UNK> <UNK> for blood and fix lawrence illness of <UNK> into a hairy wolf man whenever the moon is full during a <UNK> walk in some <UNK> they also pick up the <UNK> of <UNK> monster and the good doctor himself eventually <UNK> a <UNK> hyde <UNK> due to a bad blood <UNK> the last <UNK> to the messy party is a female <UNK> though not of the <UNK> dame something is very wrong when you're watching a movie that is literally stuffed with horror icons yet the only character in the whole movie that is able to freak you out is an ordinary <UNK> going by the name <UNK> the actual monsters are dull and their once fabulous backgrounds are fully <UNK> count dracula is a whining <UNK> is a <UNK> and also whining old <UNK> and the frankenstein creation  well his share in the plot isn't even worth mentioning there's a serious lack of atmospheric settings and nifty photography in this universal film especially compared to all their other efforts and the abrupt climax is a disaster
<START> square pigs as a way of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> space is the one and only clever moment in space <UNK> believe it or not dennis hopper has done worse see the american way but this movie is way up there on the cream of the crap scale i think the best way to describe the viewing experience is that space <UNK> will please no one too cartoon like too be taken seriously an almost total lack of humor and poor character development virtually <UNK> disappointment the beer and popcorn crowd might tolerate one viewing but all others have been warned to avoid space <UNK> for all of the above reasons <UNK>
<START> i hardly know where to begin br br huge continuity issues bad acting etc for example sam is supposed to be far from any people yet you can see the <UNK> <UNK> cut into the mountain next to his head br br but the most fundamental problem is that the essence of the book <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the way to improve the lot of his entire family is not even touched upon instead in the movie he gets <UNK> off at his family and leaves his wealthy parents to be by himself and when he gets tired of it he goes home where is his development where is the arc br br if you have never read the book and can get through the hokey double triple <UNK> visions of the <UNK> and terrible production quality <UNK> <UNK> fire winter winds stopping their howling for the dialog and then <UNK> etc i guess it might be ok for an 8 year old br br but compared to the sophistication of the book it is a terrible disappointment br br read the book instead
<START> i saw this hallmark television movie when it originally aired i lost interest in the story because a character was said to be a witch i just was not in the right frame of mind to watch this film but hallmark stands for the best quality films now there is a reason to give this film a second look clive owen who plays damon just might have a chance to be selected as the next james bond <UNK> when pierce brosnan passes it on clive owen might have to wait until the year 2008 the other reason is the female lead is catherine zeta jones is now a celebrity she was an unknown at the time and became an academy award winner for outstanding supporting actress in 2003 joan <UNK> as mrs is also in this film i like the opening line in this film deliver my heart from this <UNK> lonely place send me a great love from somewhere or else i shall die truly i shall die
<START> big fat liar is a pretty funny movie but as i was watching it i thought about something some of the events that occur in this film are unbelievable so really the film is kind of a big fat lie there is no way that he could've gotten away with all of this here are all of the unbelievable stuff br br 1 when he <UNK> his father had <UNK> on a <UNK> and acts like he is the father jason frankie couldn't have gotten away with that well luckily for us he didn't so it didn't stick with it the outrageous br br 2 even if the grandmother was blind she still could've figured out that that wasn't her <UNK> br br 3 they couldn't have gotten on the plane <UNK> to l a acted like they were coat <UNK> sneak into the studio and then and then well some of the film is a little unbelievable but it doesn't hurt to tell a little white lie trust me i do it all the time br br big fat liar though unbelievable at times is fun it's also very funny but let me just say one thing before i continue this review if paul <UNK> wasn't in this movie it would really suck it would be horrible big fat liar is also pretty funny though corny at times i give it a thumbs up br br big fat liar
<START> this was one of the <UNK> movies i have seen in some time i'm in my late 40s and watched it with my son in law early <UNK> and son 17 the scenery was beautiful but the story was a bust we watched about an hour of it and turned it off i spent more time on my during the hour that we watched it than i spent actually watching the movie i gave it a 3 because i enjoyed the scenery and cinematography otherwise i would have given it a 1 i'm sure there are people who are really into the art of it all who will find my review appalling but we're all entitled to our own opinions right i couldn't figure out if this was supposed to be a chick flick where the focus was on the mother or if it was supposed to be a movie for guys with the focus on battle and adventure in my opinion it didn't succeed in either
<START> mr wonders if this movie was produced by the same who produced the <UNK> z tv series of course not br br this is a hong kong real action movie based on the first episodes of the japanese original cartoon which was also based on a comic book series and i really don't know if it was produced under the license of the <UNK> creators br br however the story of the monkey boy with special powers is an ancient tale known all over asia in japan the name of the boy in the tale is in china it is in korea it is etc and the story in <UNK> has much to do with that tale br br by the way as i said this movie is based on the first episodes of the <UNK> series which was followed by <UNK> z although i think the us version had a different airing order and all the scenes related to sexuality were also contained in the original cartoon series without so much overacting and so much <UNK> on it but because of your comments i may suppose they were completely removed in the american dubbing br br anyway i agree with you about the overacting in the film and about how poor this adaptation of the original cartoon is but maybe because of that nobody can forget it after watching it
<START> to say i was disappointed is an understatement an amateur film made by professionals i was about to leave the theater in two or three occasions something i've never done i was stopped by <UNK> <UNK> really she rings true the only one i should say this new women are less modern than the george <UNK> women of the 30's this ones are acting for us trying to be with it but their conflict is exactly the same as it has always been in movies anyway the fun of the original was based on a crisp <UNK> and very funny script a masterful direction and an cast all the elements that are missing here tv actresses with models and oscar <UNK> winners there wasn't anything <UNK> about it the whole thing felt like a put on improvised in the moment without a clear objective 2 10
<START> in 1974 the teenager martha maggie grace moves to the high class area of belle <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> night eve of halloween she was murdered in the backyard of her house and her murder remained <UNK> twenty two years later the writer mark christopher <UNK> who is a former la detective that has fallen in disgrace for <UNK> in o j simpson trial and moved to <UNK> decides to investigate the case with his partner stephen weeks andrew mitchell with the purpose of writing a book the locals <UNK> and do not welcome them but with the support of the retired detective steve <UNK> robert <UNK> that was in charge of the investigation in the 70's they discover the criminal and a net of power and money to cover the murder br br murder in <UNK> is a good tv movie with the true story of a murder of a fifteen years old girl that was committed by a wealthy teenager whose mother was a kennedy the powerful and rich family used their influence to cover the murder for more than twenty years however a <UNK> detective and convicted in disgrace was able to <UNK> how the hideous crime was committed the screenplay shows the investigation of mark and the last days of martha in parallel but there is a lack of the emotion in the <UNK> my vote is seven br br title brazil not available
<START> i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing i q points for each passing second i guess that nobody at the network that aired this <UNK> watched it before putting it on imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these
<START> i spent many a <UNK> night after watching 2001 not only because of the psychological horror of which 2001 is a masterpiece but also because of the way it brought me a restless soul some clarity to the way i observe the universe it changed my way of thinking in a very profound way and after reading the novel by arthur c clarke i found myself once again inspired a writer as i am by the level of imagination br br the space odyssey is not something one can just go and see one has to be ready for it or it cannot be understood in fact i don't think it can be understood at all at least not all of it at once it is a philosophical journey to the <UNK> and beyond a masterpiece of it's genre and still after <UNK> years technically quite impressive all the way to the powerful musical soundtrack featuring by richard <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> br br take all the time you want but eventually you are going to have to see this film if it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me it can certainly do it for you as well br br or maybe i'm just plain crazy
<START> i really liked the movie thought it was very entertaining as well as dramatic but i just had a question about the music is the movie i haven't been able to find any kind of soundtrack if there even is one and specifically i was wondering if anyone could tell me the name of the song that is playing while the boys are going down the river on their way to new orleans i thought it was something along the lines of my great escape but i've searched on the internet books pretty much everything i could think of to try to and i just can't find it anywhere if someone could help out it would be greatly appreciated thanks
<START> this was a great movie it was a completely enjoyable adolescent fantasy so what makes a movie great technical details i think that if that were the sole <UNK> our culture would be the <UNK> for it so this movie is to the godfather as new wave music is to <UNK> the point is it is one of the best movies of it's type i've seen the women are all beautiful as are only seen on california <UNK> when movies are being made it has a little of everything a kind of battlestar <UNK> meets <UNK> meets the playboy <UNK> video meets wayne's world there is plenty of charm and a reasonable albeit predictable storyline that keeps you interested until the next bit of eye candy <UNK> the screen joe <UNK> may not have his brothers career but does a good job of bringing focus to the story as the <UNK> adolescent uncle bud contains plenty of expected <UNK> such as female rock band playing without the <UNK> <UNK> in was that intentional if you're attracted to the box rent the video you won't regret it as is promised it is good non violent erotic fun
<START> these are the kinds of movies i loved and still love growing up unlike big budget movies that <UNK> huge plot holes and never acknowledge them this movie takes in all in <UNK> and just makes something you can sit back and enjoy br br there was some film student earlier that complained it wasn't a list material but that is not the point the point of this movie is that no everyone likes huge cgi <UNK> filled movies there are a lot of people who like movies that are meant to just entertain you and not get as much money as they can br br besides its also nice to know that good ol' bruce isn't dead yet
<START> parts the horror is a horror all right there are of course the bad fashions of the late 70's there's the really bad acting from dick <UNK> to peter graves and then there's the <UNK> themselves their days mostly consist of running jumping <UNK> and wrestling with each other when they're not doing that they learn about america not the band america or the song by neil diamond but an america where they go on to become part of a greater society but they're given some strange drug then they have all their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> general <UNK> was right and they are placed in the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> or christmas when they will be out and <UNK> at about <UNK> degrees or so <UNK> that's not what happens but it would've been a lot more interesting than what's shown mario of super mario brothers fame makes a delightful cameo as a doctor who <UNK> with dick <UNK>
<START> the back of my dvd describes the plot of el after his capture in the wilderness the legendary <UNK> creature escapes into the city creating mayhem and panic as they pursue the deadly beast an animal control officer and scientist dr realize that a vigilante with his own suspicious plan is also tracking the <UNK> killer for a mysterious research facility run by the diabolical dr this <UNK> horror flick is somewhat amusing if you watch it under the influence of alcohol the script is completely silly the acting is wooden beyond belief and the direction is amateurish two rubber suits are easily the best thing about this movie 3 out of 10 and that's being extremely kind
<START> actually i feel like having my review be that one word my friend whose opinions i almost always trust about movies especially horror movies warned me not to rent this no matter how tempted or bored or desperate to see a new horror movie i was because it was a complete waste of time unfortunately i haven't talked to him in a while and i was in a hurry to pick a movie and thought <UNK> the heck how bad could it be ' why don't i learn what was i thinking did i think it would magically turn into a better movie while sitting there on the shelf for years waiting to be rented br br the <UNK> concerns a guy who edits films for some company his boss is a jerk the guy who had the job before him went insane and blew himself up in the pre credits sequence so for some reason the boss picks nerdy for the special project of editing loose limbs splatter movies he never says what ed is supposed to edit but i guess that doesn't matter ed is upset by some of the clips working on them up at this house all by himself that the boss has decided to <UNK> him to for no apparent reason he asks his boss if he can stop or do another project but his boss doesn't care he starts to slowly go insane supposedly from watching the clips and wants to carry out the gory murders in real life or has he been this way all along please note that i am making this plot sound much more deep interesting and coherent than it actually is br br we don't care about the characters at all or have any sympathy for them or even hate the bad guys the plot is really really boring and predictable the splatter isn't even that gruesome or creative this is not worth renting just to see the gore because what there is isn't interesting or original br br all the to sam <UNK> just come off like really bad <UNK> and no one in the movie is anywhere near good looking enough as bruce campbell so you can't distract yourself with that i think an evil dead ii dead by dawn poster is only <UNK> displayed in one scene in the hopes that sam <UNK> will be <UNK> and not consider any sort of legal action a trained <UNK> could have written a better screenplay every time i hear lines like are we having fun yet which even bride of re animator couldn't pull off without making me <UNK> i start feeling like picking up some sort of deadly weapon myself characters just appear out of nowhere with no explanation wandering in only to get killed this might be ok if the movie was even remotely amusing or entertaining but it was all i could do to keep from fast <UNK> through most of it fortunately i chose to pay some bills and balance my <UNK> at the same time the movie was playing trust me it did not require my full attention i still felt like 90 minutes of my life were wasted just by having this on in the background br br don't watch it no matter how tempted you are you'll hate yourself for wasting your money horror fans will be completely disgusted by how incompetent it is even those who haven't seen too many splatter movies should stay away as there are so many movies out there you could rent that are much more well worth your while if you want something brainless low budget and fun rent something else complete waste of time with no redeeming qualities whatsoever be smarter than i was at the time and don't be fooled by the warning not for the faint of heart on the box you have been warned br br
<START> ok so maybe it's because i'm from the north east of scotland and i talk just like the guys in this film but i found this great fun cheap fun to be sure but plenty of effort has gone into making the film look great and the actors certainly give it all i was actually quite <UNK> when they died in <UNK> when the captain finally fell the script well it s a game of 2 the opening half of the film is well written and sharp the last half hour is not so great with many questions left unanswered this will <UNK> annoy others as it annoyed me but nevertheless good fun and a very smart first feature from
<START> said to be inspired from disney's the little mermaid on the cliff by the sea is japanese animation master <UNK> miyazaki's next big work after the well received spirited away in 2001 and <UNK> moving castle in 2004 in his signature style of <UNK> fantasy <UNK> and children characters are on display once again br br the boy lead in the film discovers a trapped in a glass jar while playing by the <UNK> below the cliff he stays with his mum lisa <UNK> above and <UNK> it shakes the jar <UNK> to try and get the out but the little is stuck he then tries to pull it out but it just cannot come loose then place the jar on the ground before <UNK> a small rock onto it breaking it into pieces instantly while suffering a small cut on the finger he then <UNK> to see if the is still alive as he <UNK> it the <UNK> by <UNK> the blood off his finger suddenly excited quickly rushes back to the house and put the in a small bucket of water in hope that it will survive it did and he named it br br the above scene would <UNK> what is to come for the remainder of the film it is of the interactions between and and it is one that <UNK> miyazaki did <UNK> well in portraying he must have a keen sense of observation and understanding of how children behave before he depicts this chemistry of communication between the two main characters the behavior of the children would also <UNK> into the rest of the film in their further encounters br br the affection between and grew as the film progresses from the moment brought to school in <UNK> car the best moment came when the two were reunited after a brief <UNK> when father <UNK> george a magical sea <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> before <UNK> her in a magic bubble with kind intention br br <UNK> who was once human has grown to refer humans with disgust for <UNK> the sea and stealing its life but all wants is to be human and be with so for a second time she escapes accidentally <UNK> his father's precious store of magical <UNK> into the sea creating a storm of <UNK> waves and the small town in the process br br what follows are the adventures of and in the <UNK> town br br is there a happily ever after in this one would true love <UNK> you find out br br looking at the art in on the cliff by the sea there appears to be a <UNK> from miyazaki's past works in terms of rendering it looks unfamiliar because the environment apart from the characters at play in every scene is not colored in the usual fashion as in spirited away 2001 and <UNK> moving castle 2004 the <UNK> appeal is <UNK> from what appears to be color <UNK> drawings the objects and characters are also not as detailed as before br br this is peculiar if taken on face value but from the way the story is written and told the possible explanation is that miyazaki is allowing the audience to view the film with a child's <UNK> yet allowing the adults to <UNK> on a japan when they were younger this move could have prevented <UNK> <UNK> new to miyazaki's work to see it the trailer did nothing to promote as well taking the case to japan however would be a different story as miyazaki's <UNK> far than <UNK> any marketing technique br br in summary though the whole did not equal to its parts aside from miyazaki's ability to cast <UNK> and animated characters the film lacks elements of thrill and wonder when <UNK> against previous works resulting in a <UNK> of big screen presence br br the sparks of and failed to light up the film in a big way but moments of warmth kindness and love can still be found in <UNK> the film as one that is not made for the kids but of the kids who everyone is or once was
<START> br br this film has some really impressive action scenes the humor and action are <UNK> well though the intensity of the film does not sustain itself till the end the last scene is a slight anti climax in terms of action quality and astonishing of the scenes <UNK> it the humor doesn't seem to be so ridiculously clumsy as in many other <UNK> movies and this film is of totally other class than most american action comedies of recent years <UNK> <UNK> wan acts as a typical <UNK> police hero who <UNK> at <UNK> orders from incompetent police superiors the <UNK> of the film is built on the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of the drug gang <UNK> the police force while providing a serious dose of lead <UNK> with a variety of machine guns leaving plenty of corpses in it's wake <UNK> is especially impressive as an ultra cool <UNK> gangster in this woo like piece of action where tough guys are truly die hard
<START> imagine a world in which everyone treats anyone nicely no foul word is ever <UNK> office <UNK> is nonexistent and your boss invites the office crowd regularly to self <UNK> <UNK> where you can chat about latest interior design styles everything is neat pleasant well just nice in other words you are in hell after being dropped off in the middle of nowhere mid thirties <UNK> starts a new job as a book keeper in a small clean city from the beginning he feels foreign in this proper <UNK> world of superficial kindness surrounded by pleasant but lifeless interior architecture and likewise colleagues food tastes of nothing drinks don't get you drunk no children anywhere after initial steps of fitting in <UNK> <UNK> for ways to escape the bland new world he doesn't know where he came from anymore but still remembers rich tastes true feelings anything beyond the non <UNK> life he's leading now the <UNK> man <UNK> ideas of and <UNK> but here the cruelty is the <UNK> <UNK> unlike <UNK> this is not about narrow minded <UNK> more a fable of our urban free world <UNK> of fitting in it mostly reminds one of the ingenious fight club scene in which edward norton walks through a mock <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with macabre humour this <UNK> <UNK> tale convinces on every level story characters and relevance a true screen gem 8 10
<START> larry bishop directs writes and leads this soft core porn plot less biker movie about nothing to do with anything to call this one of the worst movies of 2008 is being kind to the garbage that i spent money on while in theaters its one of the worst movies i have ever seen i felt sorry for the girls mostly who probably think they're in the making of a feature film when in all reality they're making a porno they walk on the set for four days say some sexual lines to disgusting old men thirty years older than them then take off their <UNK> and run around naked for the four days they're on set i can only assume this was larry <UNK> only way to get laid you see shot after shot directly on a girls <UNK> shot after shot of bishop walking up to some random chick and grabbing her most intimate parts as if he were shaking her hand how this crap was even <UNK> is beyond me why tarantino has his name on it is beyond me but he's been slowly <UNK> away since 1994 so i can't say i was surprised br br after 15 minutes you get that awful feeling that only horrible and i mean horrible movies give you when you see it in theaters the pain you feel is <UNK> after 15 minutes i wanted to cry for being so stupid and wasting not only my time but my hard earned ten dollars there isn't one redeeming quality or one moment in the movie that creates any kind of reaction or shows any kind of <UNK> that these people had any idea of what they are doing if you don't see naked women all that often then i guess this movie would be for you if you're eleven years old you will probably like it you can't even laugh at it because every idiot making it was laughing about the crap they were making the acting is awful the writing is awful the production is awful and the directing is awful it's not even worth your time renting it to see the car crash stay away stay very far away you shouldn't even be reading these reviews i shouldn't even be writing one
<START> this tv show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on tv today horribly predictable obscene usage of slow motion photography cheesy story lines chuck norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything the way he chooses to make each episode into a public service <UNK> is really annoying his acting sucks so bad that it makes a person cringe with embarrassment i will give the series some credit though it does get entertaining at times but not enough for it make any difference with all the negative points this series has i still prefer it over reality tv it can't really get any more worthless than that
<START> wow what a lovely warm rural film the story focuses upon <UNK> taylor mickey rooney a young male <UNK> whose journey takes him to a quiet rural <UNK> town there he stays with the brown family <UNK> liz taylor their youngest daughter who <UNK> subtly befriends has a passion for horses and wins one at an <UNK> this horse is a beautiful <UNK> referred by its previous owner as a <UNK> but <UNK> re names him pie not long later <UNK> suggests to enter him in the grand national race <UNK> and her family are against the idea but soon agree and <UNK> and <UNK> began to train him for <UNK> most famous horse race  this film is a beautiful example of what british films are like i remember i first saw this when i was eight and on my summer holidays my parents taped it off the tv and i <UNK> to it instantly  watching it most days instead of the large collection of disney films that i owned br br i believe it was one of liz <UNK> first movies and a good one her character is <UNK> but sweet  her acting is extremely convincing especially when she portrays her love for horses it's also a good chance to see angela lansbury in one of her early roles who co stars as older sister who spends most of her time in the film being smitten with a boy in the town i must say she was a gorgeous lady when she was younger beautiful blonde hair and a <UNK> <UNK> face although she doesn't have a major part in the movie she dose have a number of scenes so not to disappoint her fans parents reading this i must emphasis  if you can get hold of a copy of this please do if you're children love animals  i strongly suggest you show it to them they may find a few scenes boring but you see <UNK> riding the horse on many occasions throughout the film and would most <UNK> entertain children a lovely and nostalgic film i might just go away now and put it on
<START> before i really <UNK> this film off i just want to say i absolutely loved it br br firstly how many times in the film did the characters use the phrase you're right i'm sure i was counting in the hundreds before i gave up and started watching the film again br br secondly what the hell is with those blue monkey things ok so the family led very private lives and had one brown eye one blue eye but since when does that <UNK> people into <UNK> <UNK> blue zombie creatures br br and finally <UNK> faithful here will protect <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i'm having as much fun reading the user comments as i did watching the movie it seems that this is the classic either love it or hate it movie and i have to say that i not only am on the love it side i'm going on a <UNK> to say it this my favorite movie ever thank heavens i found it in the first place almost impossible to find i was lucky about ten years ago to record it off a late night <UNK> channel of course my liking of sellers may make me a bit biased but i can't see how anyone with a <UNK> dry sense of humor like me can not be in love with this flick the plot is great but perhaps as a previous poster said maybe the reason why it's not a widely known movie upset the medical field the acting is great i can see why some may say the acting was horrible but that's what made this movie so great it's total tacky <UNK> and the humor is gut <UNK> i'm proud to say i have watched this film no less than about 20 times and have pretty much every line <UNK> this film is genius
<START> the only thing romantic about this movie is the pain and anguish of romance if you are expecting this cinematic adaptation of another nicholas sparks novel to follow the <UNK> formula of previous films such as message in a bottle nights at and a walk to remember think again nobody dies from an accident trying to save somebody else and the romance here doesn't <UNK> these characters if anything it makes them even more miserable than they were br br a soft spoken special forces army sergeant john <UNK> <UNK> of g i joe has a memorable two week <UNK> while on leave from the military with an <UNK> college girl <UNK> curtis <UNK> amanda of <UNK> who is spending spring break in south <UNK> <UNK> doesn't drink smoke but she tells john that her head is filled with profanity inevitably john and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in love with each other and launch an endless exchange letters of love letters that are sleep inducing by any standard is off in the world serving the military in some <UNK> corner of the globe while she is away at college <UNK> his letters in class just as they are getting hot and heavy between them <UNK> terrorists crash planes into the world trade center john along with his buddies in a wave of <UNK> without discussing the option with <UNK> br br meanwhile another guy shaggy but likable family friend tim henry thomas of e t the extra <UNK> who has a <UNK> child named alan becomes the object of sentiment she is the kind of girl who helps build houses for the less fortunate and wants to start a summer horse ranch for <UNK> children she <UNK> what seems forever before she finally contacts with the eponymous letter indeed she <UNK> him for a man with a disease later she <UNK> to john that she knew the sound of his voice would have broken her resolve to marry tim so she doesn't make that <UNK> call predictably john <UNK> over lack of communication during a routine mission our hero takes a couple of terrorist bullets in the back and winds up in germany while all this is <UNK> is trying to come to terms with his own <UNK> collecting father mr richard <UNK> of step brothers who suffers from syndrome it seems that his father is on his last legs after john gets out of the hospital the lead female character lacks a shred of respect and her betrayal of amounts to a pretty low blow his father and commander keith robinson are the only sympathetic characters in this long distance romance br br dear john gives new meaning to <UNK> love stories <UNK>
<START> i remember seeing this at my local blockbuster and picked it up cause i was curious i liked movies about <UNK> creatures i like movies about werewolves vampires zombies etc this is based on half <UNK> a half human half <UNK> creature that <UNK> on the people of africa br br the movie is horrendous the actors are terrible there is no script whatsoever it's all improvised the whole thing is filmed at night because they say that is the only time you ever see it it's obvious bull <UNK> they film at night to make it scary but they have failed to scare me after the first person was killed i put this back in the case and took it back to blockbuster one of the most boring movies i've ever seen br br now you are probably saying i have no right to review a movie if i haven't finished it well this is one of the films that didn't deserve to be watched all the way through br br 1 star out of 10 this is really bad
<START> okay so i forgot to watch and only caught the last episode thinking it was the first or second honestly i thought <UNK> would have at least one more installment to resolve plot points the rangers are left stranded on the <UNK> we'll have to eat the horses for one thing little <UNK> is <UNK> for another what a <UNK> ending but my biggest complaint <UNK> if this was the finale is that the episode had no suspense no big climax no dramatic <UNK> even the last fight between blue duck and buffalo <UNK> was badly staged the whole episode had terrible pacing which is what drives a western steve was watchable karl urban a <UNK> for johnny <UNK> played call like a man with a <UNK> case of <UNK> all looks and <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and what's with the rangers they talked big about cleaning up texas then around <UNK> in the middle of town getting drunk and how nice of hal <UNK> to <UNK> val kilmer his mark <UNK> wig and the set of austin was like the fake rock <UNK> from blazing <UNK> all <UNK> i admit i was drawn into the plot but that's mainly cause there were many things i didn't quite get thanks to coming in late in story if i'd watched from the beginning i might not have gotten to episode three now i have to go watch <UNK> to <UNK> my palette
<START> i love this movie and disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore i think they should definitely put <UNK> q back on the air at least one night so we can record it but if not does anyone know where i can find it my email is aim com please email me if you know where i can find this movie online or anywhere i told my kids about this movie and i think that they deserve to see it also all these disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring i need <UNK> q back it was a great movie and had great actors and i don't see why it was taken off the air if everyone loves this movie so much why was it taken off the air please take my comment into consideration and along with all of the other comments made to this movie thank you have a nice day
<START> at times when i watch this movie i start to think that the people who made this movie were on drugs what's wrong with this film i'll tell you bad plot bad jokes bad acting and flat out characters everything just bad br br the movie is about <UNK> vargas a two bit <UNK> hustler who is given the chance at 50 000 to survive for 24 hours by a german hunter who kills people for a living so now <UNK> must think of ways to out think this hunter before he gets killed br br i know what your thinking what the hell is this a another wannabe ace <UNK> trying to get money really this plot is just dull and confusing at times it changes the story plot and you get lost during the film br br as for the funny scenes this film i had a straight face oh yeah i did smile a couple times but nothing laugh out loud besides the jokes are corny and seen before it's like watching ace <UNK> meets dumb and dumber but bad br br as for character development it's dry and flat you don't learn much about the main character <UNK> all you know is he's a annoying <UNK> hustler but that's it he doesn't change his image or be a little smart just corny as for the german hunter all you is that he's crazy and wants to go back to germany really you start to wonder why is this guy living on an island if has money to go to germany the <UNK> son <UNK> <UNK> better but not much he's really a coward and is snake obsessed for reasons by the end he stands up to his father and sides with <UNK> br br as for the acting no only were there any memorable but just over the top for example john is so over the top with performance and <UNK> fit in his role he's out of place as for <UNK> jones who plays the hunter same thing but gives a stereotypical performance as well as for the rest either just no used enough or just over the top br br overall bad comedy that you'll find for 2 00 at k mart
<START> it's funny your worst nightmare always seems so far away br br dark characters a married couple alan <UNK> polly hunter and a <UNK> norman <UNK> are <UNK> into a game full of hidden sexual energy and <UNK> now and then <UNK> breaks increase the tensions and give much space for interpretations good acting and a story which if not using the brain will leave you in confusion you have to watch it twice at least the very strength lies in its <UNK> and in alan <UNK> of course those who love him will love this movie br br conclusion it is not a typical prime time movie but well done
<START> dan <UNK> in his prime stars as burns a mental asylum <UNK> who poses as his own shrink to travel out to la la land and host a popular radio talk show while the regular host <UNK> <UNK> in his <UNK> prime takes a vacation along the way <UNK> <UNK> up with walter matthau a fellow <UNK> and the rest is sheer hilarity <UNK> and matthau play off very well off one another <UNK> stunning real life wife donna dixon is along for the ride as yet another shrink the ending feels a bit rushed and contrived which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this film my top rating an 8 a lost '80s gem
<START> i thought this was a really well written film i've heard of radio the person before this movie was even created and i can't begin to describe how good cuba gooding jr was in it it will make the women cry everyone laugh and most everyone will leave smiling
<START> sometimes a movie cannot easily be classified such a film is tank girl part cartoon part comedy and part action flick i'm sure somewhere there is an audience for tank <UNK> but it is extremely small perhaps punk comic book readers most viewers will be looking for an early exit or living with the fast forward button the only redeeming quality are short bursts of humor find me a <UNK> and a pair of <UNK> but these tiny moments of comic relief are far <UNK> by the <UNK> action sequences there is no character development which is not surprising since the source is a comic book do yourself a favor and avoid avoid avoid <UNK>
<START> leonard <UNK> gave this film a <UNK> bomb rating in his 1995 movie and video guide what film was he looking at kid vengeance or god's gun are bombs this film is a delight it is fantastic it is <UNK> it is well <UNK> it is beautiful photographed making a brilliant use of colors right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and <UNK> you off that this film is a well done satire of the whole spaghetti western genre the film is played for laughs from the beginning to the end with <UNK> to douglas fairbanks <UNK> sunset strip and the famous showdown in the good the bad and the ugly <UNK> <UNK> george hilton and gilbert <UNK> work brilliantly together to make the satire work it is too bad mr <UNK> rated this film so poorly as it is <UNK> one can only guess as to his reason i suspect that he missed the point of the movie entirely and was expecting something more serious than this film is meant to be kudos belong to everyone involved in this project this film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about <UNK> movies and appreciate satire
<START> what a waste of great acting talent this is a shame because with catherine <UNK> mathieu <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mastroianni and <UNK> not to mention others less well known in america that's a lot of acting talent to waste this film by <UNK> was a terrible disappointment after having enjoyed his kings and queens and this film left me completely bored and frustrated to the point where i actually left before the movie ended the movie <UNK> around its central storyline involving catherine <UNK> illness getting <UNK> by every <UNK> storyline and supporting character that appeared on screen the movie also gave us too little character development to understand why the different characters disliked each other so much this was a story of family <UNK> so that the <UNK> of coherent narrative became even more critical finally the soundtrack which <UNK> from hip hop to bach to <UNK> <UNK> dream was at odds with the emotional <UNK> of the movie and further <UNK> any emotion the viewer should have been feeling at the time the photography the director often began scenes with a mainly dark screen where our only sight is through a small opening making feel as if we are watching through a <UNK> that then <UNK> was also pretentious and <UNK>
<START> out of stars br br let's see 14 divided by 20 times the square root of 13 equals 23 which was my <UNK> <UNK> favorite number and the year she was born 23 minutes past the <UNK> hour <UNK> the number any way you choose and <UNK> be very scared be extremely scared when you throw in a brain dead looking <UNK> to go with 23 and you have <UNK> latest attempt at a dark suspense fest with the number 23 oh yeah 23 is also my record in <UNK> shots at my favorite dive on <UNK> street in the <UNK> state in the union br br carrey carries the film to about it's halfway point then we lose sight of him not caring much don't look for any crazy expressions to come from the comedian carrey as you have seen in the mask and me myself and irene no and don't expect an <UNK> of a character as he did with andy kaufman this role is a sad and peculiar for <UNK> where's the <UNK> when you need him i know we don't need him virginia madsen like usual is underused as the supportive <UNK> and peculiar wife her talent like <UNK> is <UNK> and it's almost painful to watch her try to rescue her underdeveloped character from near <UNK> br br to give credit where credit is due there are a couple of interesting scenes in the number 23 that showcase some very <UNK> cinematography they are <UNK> enough on their own without having to be convoluted within the incoherent narrative of this silly story br br i don't know about you and i realize this is a work of absolute fiction but i don't know of anyone who often reads his novel in a <UNK> dark basement or spends his time at <UNK> on a regular basis like carrey does in this movie <UNK> keeps his film dark and blood red and gloomy and rainy and <UNK> and gloomy and rainy and <UNK> and on and on and on from beginning to end even and the lost boys had a little more daylight in them and we're talking about medical students obsessed with death and teenage vampires br br if you feel like watching this film even if it's out of mere curiosity make sure you do it while enjoying about 23 that way you can kill 23 birds with one stone
<START> the movie was surprisingly wonderful especially considering the last sequel the third was dark and semi interesting but it wasn't nearly as fun or enjoyable as this it is filled with comedic lines about martha stuart <UNK> <UNK> masturbation and it was actually done effectively during gruesome and disturbing images the movie wasn't scary or suspenseful and i'm sure that it wasn't the director's intention it was fun because of the silliness jennifer <UNK> over the top and sexy performance the <UNK> of the dolls were so well handled the movement of mouth lips tears in eyes knife in chest and the costumes the dolls were just marvelous and it made the gruesome deaths more considering the fact that they were done by wonderful dolls the new <UNK> look was great and <UNK> was very cute a few scenes with <UNK> <UNK> the human <UNK> even made my father smile jesse and <UNK> were surprisingly well very attractive and the special effects were cool the ending was so <UNK> and the fact that they could make another as good is quite unlikely it may not be as suspenseful as movies like halloween or urban legend but it is certainly more fun
<START> it's really too bad that nobody knows about this movie i think if it were just <UNK> up a little and if it weren't so low budget i think one of the major film companies might have wanted to take it i first saw this movie when i was 11 and i thought it was so powerful with the many great yet illegal <UNK> that mitchell goes to just to keep his family together it inspired me then and it <UNK> me now if you're lucky enough to find a copy of this movie don't miss it
<START> how could they take such a beautifully animated gem like don <UNK> all dogs go to heaven and it with a <UNK> cheesy uninspired sequel the haunting music and delightful characters are gone now replaced with tacky animation and an unimaginative plot br br the pros charlie sheen is sometimes fun as charlie but he lacks the charming tough guy attitude that brought him to life by burt reynolds i did particularly enjoy the songs i will always be with you and it's too heavenly here br br the cons there seems to be no connection between this and the original in the beginning charlie is <UNK> with carface but wait a minute isn't this the same character who was responsible for charlie's murder and kidnapped the sweet little orphan he loved i guess that all changes in heaven but why isn't anne marie even mentioned if itchy makes it to heaven wouldn't <UNK> and killer make it too what is with <UNK> the voice in the original it sounded feminine and charming and in the sequel it sounds like a whiny bitchy parrot the new characters aren't all that great except <UNK> and the animation is better compared to a generic saturday morning cartoon the constant <UNK> humor is flat and unfunny and the heart just doesn't work when compare to the original which had such a moving <UNK> touch that makes me cry every time br br all dogs go to heaven is one of my all time favorite films how don <UNK> allowed this sequel to be made is beyond me br br bottom line not all sequels go to heaven
<START> <UNK> heather graham <UNK> a night club in nyc and lives with her husband carl luke wilson a photographer after about 500 days of marriage <UNK> comes home to find a note from carl that he needs some space and a <UNK> of daisies her favorite flower jo promptly puts the daisies in the <UNK> and <UNK> the button soon after she <UNK> on a journey to find carl somewhere out west because after all she is committed to carl however when she finally tracks him down in texas jo camps out near his home at first hoping to find clues to his decision to leave she meets a gorgeous <UNK> neighbor <UNK> can't spell his name but jo <UNK> his attraction to her when she learns carl may have a new girlfriend she decides to <UNK> a mexican american <UNK> <UNK> for advice jo is committed but does that mean anything to carl this is a very imaginative quite humorous look at the marriage <UNK> it's quirky script and offbeat style is downright <UNK> graham is just great as the <UNK> woman who is having a hard time letting go wilson does not give his best performance but is adequate as the mixed up husband the rest of the cast is quite nice however with <UNK> the gorgeous one wonderful as the sexy neighbor the scenery both in new york and in texas is very lovely and the costumes are fresh and fun if you like romantic comedies and independent films this one is made to order for you it walks to a different beat that is most attractive but still delivers in the ultimate happy ending category
<START> set in the mid <UNK> when the british is <UNK> new zealand <UNK> wilderness to establish <UNK> the daughter of a british army surgeon sarah samantha <UNK> falls in love with the son of one of the leaders the is an <UNK> tribe and a dangerous people for the europeans to deal with by the time <UNK> child which she calls boy is born his father is dead by the age of six boy is kidnapped by his father's family and sarah will begin her search for him with a man <UNK> sutherland who is deeply in love with her br br two time oscar <UNK> <UNK> is definitely the star of this movie sutherland is a total waste also starring are cliff curtis stephen rea <UNK> and david this movie is rated r for some sexual content and violent battle scenes i find the title river queen very misleading and the dvd cover with sutherland only and making you believe he is the leading star should be a crime
<START> very silly high school teen flick about <UNK> trying to prove themselves better than the rich <UNK> sound familiar this television movie from director rod <UNK> <UNK> and some dukes of episodes believe it or not says nothing does nothing and surely will entertain very few br br notable for its who's who of television cast including michael j fox bob denver <UNK> and todd bridges different <UNK> this lame effort barely <UNK> over the line also stars anthony <UNK> e r br br saturday september 5 1998 video
<START> johnny <UNK> and the boys of jackass go over the top for jackass number two at a press screening the laughter was so loud and <UNK> it was hard to hear all the dialog the stunts are over the top and the pranks are funnier and more outrageous than ever before br br all of the guys put their limbs on the line to make a great film and they succeeded if you like this genre you'll love this film if not don't bother br br some of the funniest bits are the pranks the guys play on themselves and they have no regard for what happens to them they'll do anything to make a stunt work br br many critics <UNK> johnny <UNK> for a less active role in the first film but not to worry he is front and center in number two and they have enough footage in the can to be half way through a number br br this is a must see for fans of this type of humor br br chris entertainment editor <UNK> bend <UNK>
<START> please do not waste six hours of your life watching this as i did the fact that i did is not a very good reflection on me the only redeeming acting job in this <UNK> was by wes <UNK> how a with similar roots can not even be in the same universe as <UNK> <UNK> is beyond me it was a disjointed rambling incoherent story plot lines were not developed action scenes were almost laughable and the big ending disappointment was a fitting ending to this mini series val kilmer who i have thought as a <UNK> actor played one of the strangest roles that i have ever seen him in his final scene in the show had to have been a filler by the director i have been reading these reviews for years and this show <UNK> me to sign up
<START> i wanted to see this movie ever since the previews came out i don't understand why everyone is so hard on this film it may not all be technically true to the sport of <UNK> but this film is not mainly about the sport it's about a <UNK> team that is taught how to be more than the world expects of them they are taught to become men and not <UNK> vain boys hollywood is never 100 correct in their productions they are there to make a product that sells something entertaining the story of coach and what he has taught over the years is simply amazing he teaches about service honor integrity and moral <UNK> how many other movies are teaching that to our youth these days i was proud to see such an amazing story that taught <UNK> and respect
<START> this movie isn't worth going to the theaters to watch i did and i didn't like it the effects on the movie are really well done and you get a laugh here and there but the story is really bad it seemed like they had run out of ideas and what is that of <UNK> and <UNK> getting along that totally destroys <UNK> mythology and i guess they forgot that powers only worked during the night if you really must see this movie rent it when it comes out don't go to the movies for this br br they could have done a lot more with this than they did it felt like they just wanted to do a movie to show off cool animation and effects
<START> i love movies that take you into them a movie that actually leaves you feeling weak when its over and this kind of movie is rare br br <UNK> is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen this movie has a cutting edge to it a main stream cast for such a low budget why is it that a man with this much talent and charisma not to mention sex appeal in ways beyond most other actors can do this with so little money to work with these actors really believe in his script and raw talent as a director writer and actor i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him <UNK> i have heard of you through so many different circles and do not let the jealous people of this world get to you martin gets this fellini got it and you will always get it the fire and passion in you is what we love to watch on screen <UNK> for being different and having the guts to write like you do you are a one of a kind director do not listen to the empty <UNK>
<START> this is a below average <UNK> with the cliche everyone in the living room routine charlie chan is a secret service agent doing government work and he must find who killed a scientist working on a bomb to defeat german u <UNK> in world war two there is little to recommend with this movie since the neither the bomb nor the scientist nor the war have much to do with the plot charlie chan fans will most likely find this movie disappointing who who cares
<START> down <UNK> is not a great movie but then again very few flicks are so if your looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom this is a great movie without the <UNK> no sharp <UNK> or graphic violence spoil this light comedy about a bunch of <UNK> who are assigned to a <UNK> submarine they are set to fail their tasks so that a general can get his extra star they must take on the entire us navy with it's nuclear <UNK> but they are <UNK> and this is a comedy so you can guess the outcome but you root for those <UNK> and this makes it a very entertaining movie watch and enjoy eight stars that is
<START> a feminist <UNK> in which if you the viewer believe that i wild animals are seldom <UNK> by singing but instead attack kill and eat the line that never attack unless <UNK> was a hoot unless <UNK> means that it sees flesh ii homosexuality is both <UNK> per se and its acceptance almost always associated throughout history with signs of a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> iii few women are <UNK> in this one virtually every woman is presented as having no <UNK> for men or women iv divorce is far worse than infidelity v land is there for human beings to use develop and enjoy <UNK> it is as <UNK> upon a mother of an adult son to keep in touch as it is upon the son <UNK> a mother raising her son alone is an unfortunate and real tragedy for the child <UNK> the of a parent for worthwhile ideals is a good and healthy thing <UNK> adults continue to bear a responsibility for their sexual behavior no matter their age and the duty to engage in this most intimate and giving of acts only within the most intimate and openly <UNK> of relationships marriage believe me you are not going to like this film essentially it's a howard stern sort of fellow who is brought down by a jane fonda sort of woman think the electric <UNK> it's ugly stuff because the values the ideals of the screenplay are all so <UNK> br br i share the other <UNK> about the odd things in the writing a why would this man lose every girlfriend he has because he refuses to reveal that his mother's death and funeral caused him to be unable to keep dates with them it's a mystery why he just keeps saying it was personal when faced with angry and disappointed women huh br br b there's an enormous <UNK> i e the screenwriter wants to have it both ways by telling us that the <UNK> mother loved the father with everything she had and then later we're told that there was only one great love in her life her lesbian girlfriend br br c the underlying legal <UNK> are nonsense we're never told that the has any right to live at the property merely that she shall determine the timing of the sole title and right to <UNK> the property yet somehow the film makes it appear that the is the <UNK> <UNK> which is crazy try to think of any of any will who uses the property before the <UNK> are <UNK> it doesn't happen br br d the <UNK> throughout this film is that women are equally drawn to men and women it's just absurd thus we're told i that penelope ann <UNK> character is dating other men near the end of the film after having been with the for five years and before that in a fulfilling relationship with the protagonist ii that the <UNK> <UNK> after being devoted throughout her adult life to her kind husband is now dating another woman iii that one girlfriend upset with the protagonist would now therefore like to try a woman br br iv that a male <UNK> is eager to date the protagonist v that mary kay <UNK> character naturally looked at other women in college and they looked back she says with an idiotic flip of the head br br this is all just ridiculous br br i agree with others about the sound of the dvd i had to keep it at maximum volume and repeatedly <UNK> to understand names phrases br br this is a film by someone who really <UNK> traditional <UNK> by any man hates the notion that a man is needed to raise a child <UNK> the idea that there is any necessary connection between marriage and sex the film is out to <UNK> and that kind of propaganda of false messages doesn't sit well
<START> combining serious drama with adequate comedy is <UNK> at the best of times looking for comedy in the muslim world pulled it off thanks to a <UNK> subject and a fantastic script not to mention albert <UNK> excellent character portrayal but man of the year can't come close by comparison it has a messy message <UNK> in with forced jokes and a twisted love story that is completely unbelievable br br the premise initially seemed very promising put a jon stewart like comedy news guy up for president of the united states and see what happens this independent runner is tom <UNK> robin williams <UNK> a successful tv personality who is <UNK> into running by his audience along with him comes his manager jack christopher walken click and his writer eddie lewis black seeming to have very little chance at a successful run tom <UNK> amazingly wins the election br br but did he <UNK> green laura <UNK> the exorcist of emily rose is a computer <UNK> at the company who designed the new <UNK> for electronic voting at stations she finds a <UNK> in the system that is quickly swept under the <UNK> by the <UNK> owner and his dark attorney alan jeff goldblum independence day <UNK> to lose <UNK> of dollars if word of this gets out the <UNK> evil men decided to <UNK> and or kill <UNK> to make sure she never tells anyone but <UNK> is able to get to president <UNK> <UNK> and finally <UNK> the <UNK> this is where the unbelievable love story starts <UNK> too <UNK> goes onto saturday night live and explains everything to the world thus <UNK> himself as the newly elected president and ending the careers of those at the computer company oh and saving ms <UNK> life br br does any of this sound funny the comedy is <UNK> <UNK> into the story and is often awkward robin williams <UNK> for a few moments during a debate but is quickly <UNK> as the gravity of how he became president bears down on him br br the message of the film is interesting and <UNK> too that special interest owns presidential candidates i'm sure there's substantial truth in this and if you wanted to make a movie about it you could if you wanted to make a comedy about you could but man of the year isn't it
<START> this film has made e mad i believe the original of this film 'the <UNK> was an awesome film worth buying and watching a lot i strongly believed that they should make a sequel but when i saw this i thought again br br this film has <UNK> the whole idea of 'the <UNK> mask mode a baby flying around in a room my little brother who is seven didn't even laugh and he is into these childish movies but this was worse a load of crap i am telling you now please do not watch this film it is a waste of money and a waste of time instead you could actually be having fun watch 'the <UNK> but do not i repeat do not watch this hunk of junk thank you
<START> this is one of those star filled over the top comedies that could a be hysterical or b wish that you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth pulled instead unfortunately one night at is a classic b br br goldie hawn recently commented about town and country that it's a big problem in hollywood that they start with hiring the actors and putting together a deal before a script is completed you have to figure that not only did they go into this picture without a complete script they also <UNK> it daily maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studio that say it's the script stupid br br this is also one of those movies where you find yourself feeling sorry for the actors most of the way through they're working their <UNK> off trying to make all this seem hysterical but they know most of it is going to be accompanied not by belly laughs but by the sounds of the <UNK> you can hear inside the silent theatre br br is it an <UNK> disaster not entirely there are some smiles along the way mostly due to the efforts of the actors i probably would have gone out of the theatre thinking eh it was okay so why the undeniably hostile tone in my review the ending if as it's been noted the rest of the movie is just all a setup for the ending then it misses spectacularly i really wish i could speak specifically about it but i hate people who give too much away even in warning suffice it to say that as soon as you see john goodman behind a bent over paul reiser nothing given away here it's in the trailer get the hell out of the theatre and go out thinking eh it was okay the rest of the movie is tacked on and <UNK> <UNK> and you'll be appalled that there will actually be people laughing at this mess br br if you loved there's something about mary or meet the parents both great movies then don't bother to see this movie go have those teeth taken care of instead
<START> when the trailer for accepted first came up many people began to get excited about seeing it really excited who could blame them it looked like fun but that's exactly the thing people went into accepted looking for a good movie but if you think about it accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie it's meant to be a film that <UNK> its crowd without too much effort being given that being said for those of you who expected a great film you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one think that and you will truly enjoy the film because you'll rid yourself of your idea that the movie will be fantastic bottom line watch the movie and have fun but don't look for anything groundbreaking
<START> this movie is definitely one of the finest of its kind a age story of love and <UNK> the depth of its story line is one that will stir the inner most emotions of love and hate with some very interesting twists this is a must have movie for not only the lesbian audiences but for all viewers i can't say much more or i will spoil the experience for a new young audience who might just be coming out another fine work for sarah waters it also is a great way for sally <UNK> to win over audiences who only get a brief glimpse of her talent in another sarah waters work in <UNK> the <UNK> it is also a must see
<START> i normally wouldn't waste my time <UNK> a useless movie such as this however i'm off of work this week so i have plenty of time to <UNK> in meaningless <UNK> to start let me say that i frequently enjoy non commercial non mainstream non american cinema feel free to click on my user profile for a supporting filmography that said there are plenty of bad movies that are released in countries outside of the u s trust me i've been tortured by hundreds of them lost in <UNK> is one particularly bad film br br the opening half hour is an impressive non stop <UNK> of moral <UNK> this film provides some classic morals that belong on the same level as kim <UNK> <UNK> bad guy 2001 br br 1 women actually enjoy being raped 2 rape should be <UNK> praised and respected 3 feel free to rape any woman you like because while your doing her she'll eventually start to like it and reach <UNK> 4 if you're wife gets raped make sure you blackmail her rapist for lots of money but if he doesn't pay just repeatedly bang his slut of a wife as <UNK> 5 if you're wife gets raped be sure to screw and <UNK> her the next day while playing the role of the rapist <UNK> her with lines like did he fu k you like this 6 if you're husband is a rapist just accept it 7 after you personally get raped <UNK> your rapist and hang out with him whenever possible br br how can anyone in their right mind care about any of these characters they're nothing more than a bunch of <UNK> who not only live their lives in <UNK> ways but actually <UNK> in their <UNK> and support each other don't <UNK> me though i'm very capable of enjoying films that depict <UNK> and morals that are <UNK> to my own <UNK> the killer 2001 and <UNK> <UNK> 1999 are very interesting portrayals of <UNK> <UNK> strange circus 2005 is an exceedingly perverted play on child sexual abuse marriage is a crazy thing 2002 is a <UNK> <UNK> on traditional marriage even <UNK> based movies like running on <UNK> 2003 and 2001 have entertained me on occasion the difference is that those films actually have some interesting psychological content and character development to them whereas lost in <UNK> has virtually none br br it's known that people with <UNK> <UNK> exist on this planet but without some kind of character development or psychology behind the acts themselves you end up with a superficial exposition of despicable behavior why exactly does bing bing eventually <UNK> and care for her rapist why does the wife of a rapist accept his behavior <UNK> the filmmakers never bothered to tell us even the obvious <UNK> of rich and poor classes was <UNK> conceived and in the end served as a mere <UNK> <UNK> it all feels too bland and forgettable after the filthy opening half hour <UNK> br br other reviewers here seem to have confused moral ambiguity with complex characterization the reason you can't choose which person to root for is because they weren't developed properly don't think that this movie has complex characters just because they're not clearly defined on the contrary the reason they're not clearly defined is because we know nothing about them or what they're thinking this is hardly a positive <UNK> of this movie br br on the positive side the camera work and acting are quite good but everything else just gets <UNK> and <UNK> as the film progresses you can place this alongside trash like turning gate 2002 what time is it there 2001 <UNK> 2002 and the aforementioned bad guy
<START> now maybe it had something to do with the fact that i saw this movie at a low point in my life when i was really trying to figure out where i was going and what i needed to make myself happy but this film really spoke to me jane is an although she has so many positive things going for her she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life she is strong and intelligent but she was cheated out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a second choice life she seeks out new challenges and happiness seeking desperately to fill the hole in her heart <UNK> is an exquisite jane as we journey with her we feel the depth of her despair the torture of her desperation and eventually the strength of her conviction the beautiful is also very well cast and an asset to the production allison is a scene <UNK> as a <UNK> character with impeccable timing i highly recommend this film although it's low budget it has big budget writing and production values ps great <UNK> scenes with two beautiful sexy women women will love the story and characters but there's something for the men here too
<START> i shot this movie i am very proud of the film it was a great experience which shows up on the screen <UNK> is an excellent <UNK> who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we <UNK> while <UNK> the film the sets are amazing and well crafted for each character john york and his team built sets that not only fit the characters they worked well in shooting the film allowing us to move <UNK> through walls and from one set to another each character has an amazing arc which makes for a great story i feel like all of the actors gave excellent performances i disagree with some of the other comments that say the acting was not good watch it and decide for yourself
<START> viewers of independent films know that once or twice a year they are going to see stories about dysfunctional families and they have come to expect them and it's becoming more of a challenge to keep them fresh but here despite the good cast it just seems more of the same story is about the travis family who is trying to recover from the suicide of matt <UNK> who was a very promising high school <UNK> ben jeff daniels is the father who <UNK> from everyone and has never treated his other son tim <UNK> <UNK> as well as matt but he does communicate of some sort to his mother sandy <UNK> weaver who finds his <UNK> of pot and starts to smoke it br br spoiler alert sandy also starts to <UNK> with much younger men like the check out <UNK> at the <UNK> store but when she attempts to buy more marijuana she gets <UNK> and <UNK> off to jail she doesn't tell anyone what happened but she does discover <UNK> on <UNK> body and also that ben has taken a leave of absence from work after all this happens sandy falls ill and lands in the hospital where her life is in danger which forces ben to realize that he may have to come to terms with losing another part of his family br br this film is written and directed by dan harris who has worked with bryan singer on <UNK> and also the upcoming superman film and while his script allows these characters to have genuine moments of expressing their pain and confusion the story for me just has too many things thrown in the script touches on so many different areas that you need a <UNK> to keep track of them all including drugs sex love infidelity abuse neglect <UNK> with homosexuality and a life threatening illness if all those scenarios weren't enough for you harris then <UNK> on a plot twist at the end that's supposed to sum up and explain most of everyone's feelings towards tim while i did roll my eyes at least 2 or 3 times with the way the script kept one thing after another i must admit that i didn't hate this film and i have to credit the actors for that everyone has at least one good scene somewhere in the film but i wish the story would have concentrated more on weaver and her character than <UNK> weaver is exceptional and with a <UNK> script she could have had a role that maybe would have led to an oscar nomination but instead we get endless scenes of <UNK> at parties or his <UNK> with the neighbor next door harris shows he can be a good writer director but with this effort he just throws so many different things at the audience that the material just becomes <UNK> and contrived
<START> i remember viewing this movie when i was a kid i recall it terrified me immensely and it stayed with me all these years i spent a couple of years trying to find it online didn't remember the title only the storyline after searching and searching i came across a vhs that was being sold on e bay i was excited and when it finally arrived i <UNK> it into the vcr and couldn't help but feel a bit nostalgic needless to say i was slightly disappointed this wasn't the movie i remember watching as a kid it was boring at times and i found <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> extremely annoying both performances by reid and <UNK> <UNK> were good overall but the movie wasn't scary i think any movie is worth viewing to form you're own opinion but sometimes well
<START> <UNK> created the russian montage theory and this film is his finest example it took years before someone could <UNK> his ideas and make them work the <UNK> 1999 nonetheless the baby <UNK> scene really demonstrates the <UNK> nature of granted like most movies it gets long in some parts the beauty of the film is amazing one of the best silent films i have ever seen
<START> <UNK> park in its second half is my favorite of <UNK> novels and <UNK> price my favorite of her <UNK> so i'm <UNK> by the unhappy fate she's suffered in her big and small screen <UNK> the only good reading of the character i've heard was done for radio by amanda root who gave it the same quality as she did the character anne in the film of <UNK> a stern sure heartfelt moral <UNK> if the actress had been younger she would have been good visual casting as well but the that have reached our eyes to date have more <UNK> respectively mary crawford ruby the <UNK> girl and in this incarnation a <UNK> serving <UNK> or possibly <UNK> with her high moral principles pulled down a <UNK> br br well i had hoped for better but had feared worse the serial had a solid edmund in an actor who was best at likable <UNK> and the perfect i e perfectly <UNK> mrs norris otherwise it was <UNK> the film which was apparently intended as a <UNK> or some other bad theatrical idea came off as a mixed up <UNK> after such <UNK> and the more recent <UNK> of this <UNK> sister pieces the new <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> i couldn't help but have mixed expectations for this one and on the whole it left me feeling slightly better <UNK> to it than not it <UNK> the novel intelligently and in the end left me with much the same feeling as a comic book version might on the other hand to do so it had to <UNK> most of the characters except the <UNK> and it incidentally <UNK> or eliminated most or all of the most memorable things in the book including its most famous character and what should be if it isn't its most famous scene br br the character is the <UNK> aunt norris always ready to direct other people in what to do but always managing to avoid having to do any of it herself here one gets no sense of that at all and with her goes much else her remark that cuts through <UNK> considering who and what you are sir <UNK> discovery that she has forbidden <UNK> a fire in her room all these years and his <UNK> <UNK> for her <UNK> honesty in <UNK> during a visit home that aunt norris for all her faults could manage the household better than either of her sisters but then that entire trip is missing from the story and so is most of what goes on at the theatrical <UNK> and most of what sir thomas on his return and in fact sir thomas himself and his wife are different from what they were above all the scene in which crawford <UNK> to <UNK> one of <UNK> most complex is <UNK> to a bare telling missing from it is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of what she knows to be right and what she knows to be very probably true against all the <UNK> crawford and anybody else can throw at her to a male reader now no less than when it was written it reveals with <UNK> clarity <UNK> at any rate as far as i know what a woman goes through in trying to deal fairly but firmly with a man she has reason to <UNK> it's a brilliant scene in the novel on tv it's just a scene br br and <UNK> oh <UNK> when will we see your like
<START> my daughter already wrote a review of this movie in my sign in but i want to add a few words br br <UNK> was one of my two favorite movies as a child the other being 'the wizard of the cinematography the acting the script and the music all came together is such a wonderful little heart felt drama that it can still bring tears to my jaded eyes based on a book by <UNK> the script followed the book quite well the characters are so <UNK> created it's easy to become emotionally involved with the entire family and the quaint little irish village in which they live the premise complete <UNK> believes in her horse and herself enough to chance a try at the greatest horse race in the world is awe inspiring to any young person especially a young girl in the 40's a time when girls were sometimes ignored as humans beings let alone <UNK> you would have to be terribly hard boiled not to appreciate it's merit br br but the perspective i <UNK> most about this movie is the <UNK> innocence in it's moral message it's almost magical how <UNK> and apple the movies were back then i was really taken <UNK> by the imdb reviewer who asked <UNK> the world ever really this <UNK> ' and then <UNK> to <UNK> the director for his <UNK> regarding overnight travel involving the two main characters my answer to his question is an <UNK> yes the movie going world was that <UNK> in the 40's br br my grandparents remember taking my mother to this movie when it was released then my mother took me to see it when i was young and my daughter was lucky enough to be born at a time when she could watch it repeatedly on video tape now we have it on dvd it's been a family favorite for generations albeit generations of horse lovers it was never about sex it's about coming of age it's about believing in yourself and working hard to reach your goals also so old fashioned it wasn't even about the prize money it's about the girl child who understood her horse had what it took to the <UNK> and yes the director was indeed concerned with elizabeth <UNK> lack of physical development because the book made a big deal about <UNK> brown liz <UNK> character having to cut her hair and <UNK> her chest so that she could pass as a male <UNK> when she went to the grand national this was a guys only sport back then i think there have only been 12 women ever to compete in this race it's almost insulting that anyone would bother to think the <UNK> thing about this particular movie besides anyone having had anything at all to do with an adolescent girl and her horse would know that the only thing they ever think about with stars in their eyes have four <UNK> and a tail br br and now for a great bit of trivia the stunt riding was performed by the now famous <UNK> monty roberts i believe he is given mentioned for his riding in the movie credits br br i give this movie a 10 out of 10 i never get tired of watching it again
<START> i felt last <UNK> episode was slow and kinda of boring at times i honestly don't think it has to do anything with the writing because i know the story was well staged and tried to keep things in place i thought it wasn't that bad but overall i didn't enjoy it the most blame has to do with the director of that episode stephen williams i always hated stephen <UNK> directing if jack <UNK> continues with this episode from the season premiere he would have kept it in a good pace and keep things <UNK> to keep things interesting i'm glad jack <UNK> is directing next <UNK> episode and it'll be much better and i'm glad he got first episode to direct and i'm curious what he will pull off this time since stephen williams had directed too many episodes before br br i always keep thinking that stephen williams needs to be thrown off from the show he doesn't even do anything interesting with the show br br why does the opening have to be done with a target thing while being in the helicopter it was so boring bad perspective of camera work too
<START> the various law order and <UNK> <UNK> had better be glad doesn't pass through the lady cops and would all be enthralled and the males be subject to such soul <UNK> <UNK> melting <UNK> speed kicks wouldn't you just love to see david <UNK> <UNK> and that know it all on <UNK> get <UNK> <UNK> pulled from their respective <UNK> ice t might start crying and get back on the trail br br low low budget bad but enthusiastic acting and a vision at what <UNK> offered to its <UNK> <UNK> bands soul singers the last <UNK> of old style circuit <UNK> that dance <UNK> james brown wilson <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a host of others came from those <UNK> to glory while their peers <UNK> on in local or <UNK> stardom <UNK> ray moore came from that background and the character of is a mix of the bold black who through he shouldn't have went to the joint the <UNK> didn't have a warrant how his middle aged self <UNK> a loyal stable of kung fu is a mystery only a student of <UNK> can explain but all that is beside the point it's a glorious home movie of a legendary performer that compared to the mirrors of actors ranging from established hollywood to indie film hits its mark a fun dumb movie
<START> i think the movie was one sided i watched it recently and find the documentary typical of western movie makers that was biased without substance the fact is prostitution do exist everywhere in the world not in alone and not because of this fish business there prostitutes were there way before the russian and other business people arrived in poverty is indeed <UNK> in africa let alone and this is not because of fish <UNK> business in fact the fish industry has helped millions to support their families on their daily life this movie just <UNK> the good image of this peace loving country as for the arms trade the film could not <UNK> if there is any truth in that indeed looking <UNK> at the films one is <UNK> the authenticity of the film maker it seems that their trying to prove their point by using a few characters which can be done for anything really yes is a poor country yes there are prostitutes and street children but they are not the product this business it is just a common scenario in most poor countries indeed the world over even in the western world what a load of rubbish br br the pilot themselves are talking of sending weapons to <UNK> which is more than south of and the war was in also miles away from the director could not give evidence how these weapons were transported from to br br in short the films lacks focus and <UNK> it is quite easy to find the character anywhere in africa and has nothing to do <UNK> nightmare or fish <UNK> what a load of rubbish br br the truth is the <UNK> <UNK> has not <UNK> all other species in the lake contrary to what the movie portrays and also less than 25 of all catches from lake victoria are <UNK> the rest is consumed <UNK> so lets get that one right
<START> what a waste of time i expected better from cameron diaz i guess it wasn't really her fault for being in a terrible film the film does not capture the beauty of europe and wasn't successful in leading the audience into suspense or wonder weak attempt at storytelling and <UNK> dialogue is dull and wasn't able to convey what i sometimes think simplicity is beauty no love energy electricity on screen too bad 1
<START> this <UNK> of the classic musical <UNK> todd does not do the production justice but is still quite enthralling br br firstly the most enjoyable aspect of this version is the production design from the <UNK> multi set to the startling then the staging is excellent right down to the <UNK> br br the main failing here is in the performances people give oh they're believable all right but it is quite frustrating when nobody seems to be hitting their <UNK> on time in a song as fast paced as say kiss me in fact the actress playing <UNK> is not only off <UNK> to a dismal degree but also slightly off key and angela <UNK> slightly overdone cockney accent is a bit irritating one more thing too what exactly is so bad about judge <UNK> performance of <UNK> that it is banned from the american theatre but not the cannibal <UNK> a little priest br br otherwise this is an excellent production it's a thrill to watch people do what they love and i'm not even talking about meat <UNK> with a twist
<START> i went to an advance screening of this movie thinking i was about to <UNK> on <UNK> minutes of <UNK> lines mindless plot and the kind of <UNK> acting that made the <UNK> one of the most <UNK> displays of cinematic <UNK> of our time but i was shocked shocked to find a film starring <UNK> that <UNK> to the soul of the audience shocked that <UNK> <UNK> could act in such a serious role shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions not since <UNK> have i seen this <UNK> full of depth and complex emotion <UNK> seems to have <UNK> the serious acting he played with in <UNK> effect these two actors came into this film with a serious focused attitude that <UNK> through in what i thought was one of the best films i've seen this year no its not an oscar worthy movie it's not an epic or a profound social commentary film rather its a story about a simple topic <UNK> in a way that brings that audience to a higher level of empathy than thought possible that's what i think good film making is and i for one am <UNK> impressed by this work bravo
<START> this movie was definitely scripted with <UNK> <UNK> fans only in mind i am someone who has never played the original game and watched it with a friend who was a series fan from a visual and technical standpoint this movie is just as good as the spirits within if not better but from a story standpoint i was pretty lost one major plot weakness that stood out to me was the scene where all of the children dying of were brought to the healing reunion by the three all told there were about 15 kids in all <UNK> i thought that this was an illness of <UNK> proportions i understand why they did it that way time budget but it just seemed cheesy after all the explanation about how the bad guys needed to collect all of those who had cells so that could be <UNK> the <UNK> version that we had some fan sub from the internet was a pretty direct translation and therefore probably added to my confusion br br it did <UNK> my interest in <UNK> <UNK> however and i spent a few hours on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> reading about the main characters and the plot once i read the <UNK> children <UNK> things made a lot more sense if you are a video game or sci fi fan this movie is a pretty good flick but like a previous review said it comes off like a 90 minute fight scene you never really get to know any of the characters and the story does just seem to jump from scene to scene without much explanation even though some explanation just might be required thank goodness for
<START> after the success of the first two <UNK> films in 1972 and 1974 respectively francis ford coppola <UNK> on an ambitious attempt to bring home the reality of the war in vietnam which had <UNK> with the fall of <UNK> to the <UNK> in the plot was loosely based on the book <UNK> of darkness ' a story by joseph conrad about <UNK> a <UNK> company agent in the african jungle who has acquired mysterious powers over the <UNK> much of this including such details as the severed heads outside <UNK> and his final words the the br br in the film sheen plays an army captain given the mission to <UNK> into cambodia and eliminate with extreme prejudice a <UNK> officer who has become an embarrassment to the on his journey up the river to the camp he experiences the of the us forces high on <UNK> or drunk with br br although as a result of cuts forced on coppola the film was accused of <UNK> when first released it was by the most serious attempt to get to grips with the experience of vietnam and a <UNK> <UNK> of the war film in 1980 the film won an oscar for best cinematography and best br br apocalypse now was re released in 2001 with fifty minutes as a result the motion picture can now be seen as the epic masterpiece it
<START> <UNK> variety was a unique hybrid program that was both a parody of and a tribute to the programs it represented br br it was most directly a mock up of the classic 1970s favorite the sonny cher show with thomas lennon and <UNK> <UNK> playing a divorced show <UNK> couple who were somehow forced to host this program together the female of the pair <UNK> over the male and the constant <UNK> of insult humor the couple tossed at each other plus sketch comedy bits and performances from what are most kindly described as <UNK> acts br br the hybrid was the mix of fact and fantasy of course there was no mr and former mrs and the <UNK> <UNK> johnny was likewise equally fictional but all the acts that performed were certainly real and some were even entertaining but there were also some acts that would have clearly been better suited for the old chuck <UNK> <UNK> show br br the show itself was really more like an extended sketch from <UNK> it was <UNK> from the mtv series the state after all and some would suggest that it would have been better as a five minute bit in the mix of a program like that one rather than a stand alone series but <UNK> variety certainly should get high marks for original concepts and even though it was often more odd than funny it was certainly worthwhile especially when they road <UNK> to las vegas and brought in even <UNK> acts to perform it's unlikely we'll ever see anything like this on television again
<START> i thought godzilla 2000 was the worst movie ever until i saw this monstrosity my friends and i went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie we could not find one since we have seen almost every movie created we decided to look in the low budget horror section we looked for the most attractive cover featuring scantily clad women we finally decided on last <UNK> party the <UNK> we made a mistake it seems as though this movie was filmed with the <UNK> camera that could be found in k mart the actors were picked up at a salvation army and as for steven tyler we will just leave that to the imagination the plot of this movie was ridiculous spoiler alert while watching the movie there is absolutely no closure at all then come to find out all the events were just a dream this movie should also have been about 30 minutes if all the camera <UNK> on still shots and <UNK> of walls were taken out it would have been much shorter all i can say is i'm glad there <UNK> a sequel
<START> the inspiration for the naked gun movies casts leslie <UNK> who had only recently started doing comedy as the incompetent but heroic frank always having to solve an absurd case like airplane and the movies based on the series the humor relies on mel brooks style spot gags and silly comments namely the yes it is remarks along with the fact that <UNK> remains very serious despite the nonsense around him and of course the final frame in which something keeps moving br br it's too bad that the show only had six episodes at least it <UNK> the movies you can't go wrong with leslie <UNK> in these sorts of roles i suspect that they all had fun filming it really funny br br before airplane leslie <UNK> had starred in movies like forbidden planet harlow and the <UNK> adventure as late as 1987 he co starred in nuts alongside barbra streisand and richard dreyfuss but since the first naked gun movie it's been all comedy all the time
<START> despite the potentially fascinating premise series 7 is weak attempt at attacking reality television aside from its bargain basement production values which present an <UNK> 10 minutes in the overall tone of the film is misguided several reviewers have attacked the acting in the film but i think the real problem is this lame attempt to make the film into a farce aside from the fact that the jokes are not funny a pregnant woman <UNK> a lot a young girl gets a bunch of guns it doesn't <UNK> with the overall tone of the film had the makers actually made series 7 to bear a striking resemblance to actual reality tv colorful yet hollow edits lame sound effects sweeping camera motions maybe their point would have been more solid or at least more <UNK> instead series 7 <UNK> through the already <UNK> world of death and game show you can just imagine the director <UNK> himself on the back for stating the obvious
<START> this movie is too stupid for words even if you consider it to be a parody on movie making if you consider it to be completely camp even than you're wasting your time watching it for you've seen it a hundred times before but maybe you are a big fan of high <UNK> girl voices you're still loving <UNK> and ken and you can stand this typical '80s electric guitar background noise well than you'll have a chance
<START> i too saw this movie when it first came out i was a teenager at the time and i saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife i remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds the cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly the boy was a little much but the girl character was very interesting i thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend i have not seen the movie since and i wander why it has gone to the <UNK> i would love to watch it again to see if it was as good as i remember the <UNK> john sound track was excellent
