<START> this is the first jean <UNK> silent film i have watched and perhaps rightly so since it is generally regarded to be his best besides being also his first major work overall it is indeed a very assured and technically accomplished film which <UNK> the fact that it was only <UNK> <UNK> effort for fans of the director it is full of interesting hints at future <UNK> movies especially the diary of a <UNK> 1946 and the golden coach <UNK> â in its depiction of a lower class femme fatale <UNK> desired by various <UNK> who disgrace themselves for her â but also the rules of the game 1939 â showing as it does in one sequence how the <UNK> servants behave when their <UNK> backs are turned away from them â and french <UNK> 1955 â <UNK> is seen having a go at the <UNK> dance at one point personally i would say that the film makes for a respectable companion piece to g w <UNK> <UNK> box <UNK> <UNK> von <UNK> the blue angel 1930 and max <UNK> lola <UNK> 1955 in its vivid recreation of the <UNK> life of a <UNK> br br having said all that the film was a <UNK> critical and commercial failure at the time of its release â a <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> himself later referred to it in his <UNK> which not only personally cost him a fortune he eventually <UNK> the resulting financial burden by selling off some of his late <UNK> paintings but almost made him give up the cinema for good <UNK> <UNK> is quite different from <UNK> sound work and owes a particular debt to <UNK> von <UNK> foolish wives <UNK> a film <UNK> greatly admired â and on a personal note one which i really ought to <UNK> <UNK> having owned the <UNK> dvd of it and the other von <UNK> for 4 years now anyway <UNK> is certainly not without its flaws a deliberate pace makes itself felt during the overly generous <UNK> minute running time with some sequences the horse race around the mid point in particular going on too long br br the overly mannered acting style on display is also hard to take at times â particularly that of catherine <UNK> <UNK> and raymond <UNK> <UNK> georges <UNK> one of her various <UNK> <UNK> technically they are being their characters i e a bad actress who takes to the <UNK> lifestyle when she is <UNK> off the stage and an immature <UNK> respectively however like anna <UNK> in the golden coach <UNK> <UNK> wife at the time by the way is just not attractive enough to be very convincing as <UNK> epitome of <UNK> as another admirer describes her at one stage who is able to <UNK> every man she meets other <UNK> in the cast are <UNK> <UNK> himself <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> most <UNK> <UNK> count <UNK> jean <UNK> as an initially skeptical but eventually tragic <UNK> of <UNK> and future distinguished film director claude <UNK> lara billed as claude moore and also serving as art director here as <UNK> close friend but who is secretly <UNK> with the <UNK> neglected wife br br the print i watched â via <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 3 disc <UNK> <UNK> â is for the most part a lovingly restored and beautifully <UNK> one which had been previously available only on french dvd being based on a classic of french literature by <UNK> <UNK> no less it cannot help but having been brought to the screen several times and the two most notable film versions are dorothy <UNK> in 1934 with anna <UNK> and lionel <UNK> and which i own on vhs and christian <UNK> in 1955 with <UNK> carol and charles boyer which i am not familiar with
<START> trash bad movies usually ain't bad because i will find them enjoyable this one is so bad that i am out of words to describe it its below bad there is an <UNK> in the beginning of the film that tell you what to do during the movie needless to say the <UNK> and a dozen of beer couldn't help me seat through the entire film one <UNK> <UNK> this one to <UNK> which is certainly <UNK> and an insult to our intelligent obviously this <UNK> had a plan to <UNK> you into buying this dvd br br if you are considering renting this one put it down if you are thinking of buying dont think if you unlucky to have this dvd dont play it throw it in trash bin immediately
<START> after the usual chase scene jerry accidentally winds up inside a bottle of invisible <UNK> which was part of a chemistry set he quickly discovers he's invisible so the predictable results occur meaning he uses his new hidden condition to torment tom jerry often is just defending himself but often he has sadistic streak in him that <UNK> the cat whenever possible even when <UNK> br br here he makes tom think his eyes are <UNK> him when cheese from a <UNK> disappears before his eyes or milk from a dish tom can't take anymore so he tries to sleep this nightmare off but jerry sets fire to his <UNK> man i hope little kids didn't ideas watching these cartoons back in the <UNK> and <UNK> i always found jerry the little mouse more evil than cute br br thankfully in cartoons generally whatever damage a character suffers is gone within seconds and he's back to normal br br the best part of this cartoon is about two thirds of the way through when tom figures out what the story is with jerry and tries different methods to <UNK> where the mouse is located such as putting <UNK> on the floor to see his <UNK>
<START> cry freedom is an excellent <UNK> for those wanting an <UNK> of <UNK> cruelty in just a couple of hours famed director richard attenborough gandhi is certainly no stranger to the genre and the collaboration of the real life mr and mrs woods the main white characters in their book and in this film lends further authenticity to cry freedom the video now in release actually runs a little over 2 and a half hours since 23 minutes of extra footage was inserted to make it a two part tv miniseries after the film's initial theatrical release while the added length serves to <UNK> the film's forgivable flaws uneven character development and <UNK> stereotyping in particular another possible flaw the <UNK> on the white characters' fate over that of the african ones may work out as a strength viewing crying freedom as a politically and historically educational film as i think it should over its artistic merits the story is one which black <UNK> know only too well though the younger generation may now need to see it on film for full impact it is the whites who have always been the film's and the <UNK> target audience hopefully driving them to change now twelve years after the movie's production cry freedom is in many ways a more interesting film to watch almost ten years after black majority rule has been at least <UNK> in place <UNK> cry <UNK> ideals remain by and large <UNK> it therefore remains as <UNK> as ever for white south <UNK> particularly the younger ones who have only heard of these actions to see it and <UNK> the film's messages in total contrast to american slavery and the jewish <UNK> exposure south <UNK> struggles have been told by a mere two or three stories cry freedom cry the beloved country ok count it twice if you include the remake and <UNK> did i miss one all three dramas also clumsily feature american and british actors in both the white and black roles not one south african actor has played a major role white <UNK> indian or black and yes i did miss another international south african drama <UNK> and <UNK> though this also highly recommended biopic was released after black majority rule was <UNK> <UNK> was played by a black american sidney <UNK> who also starred in the original s a themed cry the beloved country while the <UNK> <UNK> was played by a bald very british michael caine a good performance if you can dismiss that the very essence of <UNK> is <UNK> anti british feelings until local <UNK> tv and african films start dealing with their own legacy cry freedom is about as authentic as you'll get as <UNK> as the whites particularly the <UNK> are portrayed in the film any <UNK> non casual visitor to south africa even now in 1999 not to mention 1977 when cry freedom takes place will generally find <UNK> attitudes towards blacks restrained even understated looking at cry freedom in <UNK> it is amazing that <UNK> can take place at all and it is but cry freedom at time shows not much has really changed in many people's minds yet and that the black <UNK> goal to freedom and <UNK> is still ongoing this is why if you're a <UNK> to the situation cry freedom is your best introduction
<START> what did the director think everybody who has read the biography of artemisia is left impressed by her guts to face a public rape trial in renaissance times and even suffer torture in order to show that <UNK> was guilty that fact shows the real independence and <UNK> in her most terrible hour she stands her man why do movies depicting renaissance have to be so <UNK> beautiful and romantic are we afraid to see the gritty side of life or has the hollywood happy happy mood won while i would always defend a director's freedom to create his own reality in a movie i cannot make sense of turning <UNK> life story on its head very disappointing choice by the makers of this film
<START> heavy handed <UNK> writers using characters as <UNK> to speak for themselves predictable plodding plot points say that five times fast a child's imitation of britney spears this film has all the <UNK> of a lifetime special reject br br i honestly believe that jesus <UNK> and julia <UNK> set out to create a thought provoking emotional film on a tough subject exploring the idea that things are not always black and white that one who is a criminal by definition is not necessarily a bad human being and that there can be <UNK> circumstances especially when one puts the well being of a child first however their <UNK> ends up being <UNK> into preachy dialogue and trite situations planted to move the plot along the decent production values and interesting use of documentary style camera footage are not enough to accomplish their aim when the script and the acting fall flat br br logic is often <UNK> for the sake of creating tension <UNK> first tries to blackmail <UNK> into <UNK> in her documentary in exchange for helping them escape then in the same breath basically tells him not to trust her because she's not helping them out of <UNK> well duh and for a man on the run <UNK> is far too <UNK> by a temper <UNK> <UNK> well being is so important to him that he's fleeing capture and jail or <UNK> for her but he's willing to risk all that to <UNK> her when she doesn't want to go to mexico right talk above over <UNK> <UNK> third when <UNK> <UNK> charlie gives the phone to detective bright she is remarkably <UNK> especially given her <UNK> did she really think she was <UNK> oh yeah i would have turned myself in <UNK> <UNK> detective <UNK> could wipe the floor with her br br to be fair i'd like to list the things i liked um i liked the midget and i liked the fact that the midget was named sexy there's cross dressing always a plus juvenile cross dressing no less harry is infinitely <UNK> than <UNK> but my favorite moment in the film has to be when <UNK> kicks detective not so bright i also find it interesting that in a heavily minority cast which i much appreciate by the way the black character is the racist one too bad it's just thrown out there and not further explored br br there's a distinctive unconventional score but it's nonetheless generally context <UNK> not <UNK> mood or tension in any scene except the pathetic <UNK> <UNK> every time the main character is in anguish as though they think his acting doesn't show it enough <UNK> in case you weren't sure he's upset and we have the musical <UNK> to prove it ' br br stilted clichéd dialogue results in a depressing lack of subtext everything has to be spelled out in dialogue even when the body language had been up <UNK> then conveying it just fine for example every <UNK> speech <UNK> makes and mrs <UNK> <UNK> that her child won't be <UNK> into bed with them in the morning br br <UNK> tell me about mama <UNK> what shameless blatant exposition introducing the generic dead wife she's always the most beautiful woman the widower had ever seen the <UNK> he had ever met why can't we see a man cry over a woman like shakespeare's she may be fat ugly obnoxious but his love for her is deep as <UNK> now there's a story which would move me br br the police always being literally one step behind them gives many scenes the out of place feeling of a french farce most boring foot chases ever bright and lightning are so out of shape and easily fooled he certainly isn't quick as lightning and she well i don't feel the need to spell things out some guy dragging along a small child <UNK> a <UNK> cop complete with macho biker picking a fight but then being <UNK> by a child to quote margaret <UNK> that's so sad would we ever see this on <UNK> ' br br hackneyed and over the top <UNK> ex <UNK> as an <UNK> would you really <UNK> checking his green card just because he can quote the author of the inspirational saying on a poster behind your desk br br plus several scenes including the above <UNK> to <UNK> into porn <UNK> i'll do this favor for you as long as you do something for me ' i can almost hear the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br when the parents view the footage shot of <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> mom's freak out is the most real the movie feels unfortunately this is <UNK> by the fact that she looks completely <UNK> by his emotional speech right up until she goes <UNK> a more <UNK> look would be more convincing here br br i'm in constant awe of the stupidity of the main character doing things for the sake of plot holding up a <UNK> store without a mask visiting the dead girl's grave and why doesn't the mother recognize his face from when she saw him before he drove off <UNK> seem awfully familiar ' br br what is the purpose of that wholly unnecessary somewhat gratuitous scene with <UNK> and the <UNK> enhanced bartender character development <UNK> too little too late br br speaking of unnecessary traits that never went anywhere detective <UNK> saying skeptical detective bright must be a <UNK> shows how little he really knows about the occult and i don't think that believing in fate quite qualifies as voodoo <UNK> <UNK> br br at the end when bright holds <UNK> as he dies wait why does she care now her character is as inconsistent as <UNK> what she has to shoot him just because she said <UNK> or i'll <UNK> she's cared so much about her integrity thus far he was <UNK> there was no need for lethal force what's wrong with shooting him in the leg to <UNK> him br br finally <UNK> <UNK> acceptance of her mother's death giving dr knight peace over his daughter's death so forced and the <UNK> of the family whose child was killed becoming <UNK> new family it <UNK> me that she could be a <UNK> for their little girl it's also unrealistic that a white couple would take in the latino daughter of the man who killed their own daughter i'm not saying there aren't generous loving people who would do that i'm just saying that the characters here are never developed far enough for me to believe that they would do that br br i find it offensive that another imdb reviewer said that of course as a woman she was moved by the sappy scenes i am a woman who <UNK> my emotional movements for moments that don't wax sentimental in a <UNK> manner br br co writer co director co star <UNK> said himself he wore too many hats during this production too many <UNK> may spoil the <UNK> but one cook alone just might end up making an after school special br br in conclusion this film's title has less to do with the story and more to do with the feeling of regret <UNK> and loss accompanying the revelation that you will never see your money again
<START> well i have to admit this was one of my favorites as a kid when i used to watch it on a home <UNK> as a super 8 reel now there isn't much to recommend it other than the inherent camp value of actors being terrified by <UNK> of human <UNK> the special effects are pretty silly mostly <UNK> of <UNK> on <UNK> and <UNK> ghost images br br but there's something to be said for the sets the large mansion in which it takes place is pretty creepy especially since it's mostly <UNK> probably due to <UNK> reasons br br it definitely <UNK> more laughs than screams however just try not to get the <UNK> when the wife who does more than her share of screaming goes into the <UNK> and is confronted with the ghost of her husband's ex
<START> falls into the film category of way too ridiculous in the dialogue and execution <UNK> to be taken seriously whereas <UNK> if you know what i did last friday the <UNK> or my <UNK> back know they are bad scarecrows doesn't evil dead set such a high standard for the comedic horror on a budget genre that scarecrows is simply out of place br br <UNK> of <UNK> are immediately at play as there are no hints of noise or <UNK> in the <UNK> and <UNK> of an <UNK> plane the repeated display of a picture of 3 men just screams for a story arc but nothing comes although the men are obviously the scarecrows there is no explanation br br knowing this film is too serious for it's own good may produce some <UNK> i don't recall if joe bob <UNK> ever <UNK> scarecrows but i believe that he wouldn't <UNK> this low however with an imdb rating of over 6 there are many people that disagree
<START> titanic is a classic i was really surprised that this movie didn't have a solid ten overall in the imdb user <UNK> maybe it's just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays but when it was first made it was really something when the movie came out people <UNK> to the theaters when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the <UNK> crowd many people died on that ship and to convey that on film with the <UNK> and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to and let's not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose whether or not their relationship was a <UNK> of someone's imagination it was lovely they barely knew each other but they would die for each other they trusted each other they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money i'll never let go jack titanic is a great film down to it's very core it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting excellent cinematography beautiful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie
<START> there is no reason to see this movie a good plot idea is handled very badly in the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense the reason for the killings are not made clear the acting is awful nick <UNK> obviously needs a better director he was excellent in in the bedroom but here he is terrible <UNK> benson from buffy has to change her character someday even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed even though the movie was 80 minutes which is too short for a good movie but too long for this one there are no deleted scenes in the dvd which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the characters br br don't spend the time on this one
<START> nice movie with a great soundtrack which <UNK> through the rock landscape of the 70's and 80's <UNK> describes a generation it describes life in a small village near <UNK> hometown of <UNK> the singer who wrote the book that inspired the movie it describes life of young people and their problems relating to the world it reminds of <UNK> with a bit of italian touch
<START> truly one of the most dire films i've ever sat through i've never actually taken the time to write one of these but felt compelled to after witnessing this <UNK> to film making and feel somewhat <UNK> to be wasting my time on such a piece of turd to be honest there were so many parts that <UNK> me with their complete <UNK> and lack of sense e g when would the police force ever shoot people with <UNK> <UNK> when would <UNK> ever through out such people for lack of a cure why was the guy who spotted him <UNK> on his wife wandering around outside in his dressing <UNK> whilst carrying a gun as she rolled around on the bed also the characterisation as we've almost come to expect in such films was awful e g the way the blonde guy i don't remember his <UNK> name and don't give a toss anyway completely turned against his girlfriend and ran off to leave her and i ended up wanting them all to meet grisly ends the production was horribly disjointed and the cinematography nothing to write home about
<START> this is a nice little horror flick that fans of indie films will really appreciate it has good acting lots of gore and a decent plot one will be reminded of movies like the hills have eyes and <UNK> it's obvious that the budget was not all that big but the film really makes up for it with atmosphere and solid performances by the actors which seems to be lacking in a lot of today's big budget special effects filled films the film really moves along and there is excellent direction and good camera work there are no wasted scenes so the film's length is a bit short in addition it looks like the ending leaves an opening for a sequel which would be very interesting as well so grab some popcorn turn down the lights and enjoy this one
<START> well well <UNK> touched a bit of a nerve there didn't he he was a genius while he was <UNK> his various characters' <UNK> into <UNK> for a couple of decades but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption or even some good advice might be found in the bad old catholic church the <UNK> than <UNK> alternative movie crowd gets extra vicious worse still <UNK> <UNK> character faced with experiences that nothing in her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has an explanation for is <UNK> forced to deal with those experiences on another level that of the spiritual you know the realm of the ignorant and <UNK> the sort of thing that the art house <UNK> are supposed to be above oh the horror so she finds her marriage the idea that it might be a uniquely important commitment <UNK> by what seems <UNK> like divine <UNK> people who find this idea <UNK> <UNK> offensive could maybe ask themselves why they <UNK> jump into attack mode at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their lives but they probably won't sure this film has some problems notably <UNK> <UNK> delirious <UNK> as the overwrought nun 1950s style <UNK> and all and the dialogue between marie <UNK> and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the <UNK> school of <UNK> interpretations though hitchcock's movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom having <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> but sadly nicolas <UNK> appears to have <UNK> a critical <UNK> as much for even asking the question as for the possible answers this film presents
<START> i absolutely loved this movie it was so good this movie is told by the parrot <UNK> point of view paulie is given to the little girl marie as a present paulie helps marie learn to talk and they become best friends but when paulie tells marie to fly she falls and the bird is sent away that's when the adventure begins paulie goes through so much to find his way back to marie this movie is so sweet funny touching sad and more when i first watched this movie it made me cry the birds courage and urge to go find his marie for all that time was so touching i must say that the ending is so sweet and sad but you'll have to watch it to find out how it goes at the end the janitor tries to help him after hearing his story will he find his long lost marie or not find out when you watch this sweet heart warming movie it'll touch your heart rating 10
<START> just cause is a flawed but decent film held together by strong performances and some creative though exceedingly predictable writing sean connery is an anti death penalty <UNK> brought in to save a seemingly innocent young black man blair <UNK> from the ultimate penalty to set things right connery <UNK> to the scene of the crime where he must <UNK> not only with the passage of time but a <UNK> sheriff laurence <UNK> twists and turns and role <UNK> abound some surprising some not as the aging <UNK> attempts to unravel the mystery the climactic ending is a bit ludicrous but just cause is worth a look on a slow night
<START> you can tell they spent 5 making this it is a waste of your time ugh there is not anything remotely good about this movie i don't know why i kept watching it the chick is not hot horrid acting you could do anything and its a better use of your time like watching tv playing <UNK> video games i feel robbed simply robbed of my time i have never made a review for a movie before as you can probably tell but this movie i felt like i needed to save the poor souls that are about to watch it and looking on imdb before to see if its decent and looking at the comments there was no action no hot chicks no budget <UNK> acting it screams bad movie the whole movie is in a room
<START> deep shock plays out like a tv movie a whole cast of commercial quality actors a poorly designed creature to be the bad guy and a script that is more full of technical political <UNK> and <UNK> than it knows what to do with br br i checked out the movie because of the creature i love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheaply made videos and right off the bat i got disappointed because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie the actors i expected because of the type of film it is really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point the music was typical not thought out action <UNK> music br br i liked the design of the computers and technical equipment along with the mini sub design the movie even <UNK> really well with <UNK> screens letting you know which set you're watching the story unfold in but there isn't much of a story here anyways br br this movie gets a 3 10 stars imo the boring search and destroy mission to blow up the north pole and these creatures protecting it kinda lame even <UNK> is the <UNK> on love relationship between two of the characters that you don't see coming <UNK> this one up to being a movie which tries to get actors' careers off the <UNK> and into a video don't bother
<START> i have been looking for this movie for so many years i saw this move when i was nine and loved this movie i called disney all the movie stores and the net no luck what a waste it was a very good movie it will be missed
<START> wow this is very unusual in one regard usually the first movie in a long string of sequels is the best of the bunch people are surprised when a sequel is actually better with tarzan i thought this movie was the worst of the bunch or at least the first six which <UNK> my tarzan collection dvd package i will gladly watch the sequels multiple times but i am through sitting through this turkey thanks to several characters br br well let's start with the good news first br br the good plenty of action with a lot of wild animals on display even if they are just stock footage you see lion attacks <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you name it and you see several of the different <UNK> of all kinds including <UNK> called <UNK> in the movie since this movie was made almost 75 years ago i can't knock any of the realism because they didn't have it in the movies that long ago they do the best they can so you put up with actors talking in front of fake backgrounds however <UNK> did a lot of action scenes and was in great shape he and <UNK> make a well built handsome couple if there ever was one in those golden years of cinema br br the film has historical value with so many sequels in that it shows how tarzan acquired jane and his <UNK> of learning the english language br br the bad from the moment jane parker is taken by tarzan almost every scene with her is maureen <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> and screaming scene after scene it's enough to give you a headache and it ruins the film thankfully she <UNK> down in the sequels but not in this movie the movie also does no <UNK> for the great white hunter image as c <UNK> smith playing jane's father and neil hamilton as harry holt the <UNK> guide shoot at every animal within sight whether the <UNK> is threatening or not these people are kill happy particularly smith on another note it's too bad there isn't anything in here explaining how tarzan got to be in the jungle in the first place there is no history of him in here or footage of his growing up he's just there when jane and the group get to a certain point in africa
<START> in the film <UNK> do <UNK> him it features a relatively intimate look into the <UNK> as well as general <UNK> into the lives of various <UNK> empty people seeking ways to fill themselves enjoying the <UNK> of nature from the beginning to the end of the film we observe the <UNK> of the various characters we learn of their shortcomings and their desires the overall complexity captured within human life and yet the <UNK> simplicity of humanity although the film is slow moving it can be very <UNK> it does not force any ideas but allows the ideas to come about themselves it allows the concepts to reveal themselves br br the film ends as well and as suddenly as it begins and one truly understands the meaning of <UNK> that love is often an act of <UNK> and the many mistakes that we make it is a look into everyday life very well and beautifully done br br if you are looking for action or for intense drama this is not the film for you however if you enjoy honest original and meaningful films that are not forced and without <UNK> this is a great film to watch
<START> ok so i am like most people give me free tickets and i will go and see most things now that <UNK> cinemas are so good i remember the old flea pit single screen cinemas and i am the healthy side of 40 in england this film was released as liar it's a dog it is a total waste of good celluloid 4 10 for the <UNK> and set only
<START> it tries to be the epic adventure of the century and with a cast like <UNK> <UNK> christopher lee and john rhys davies it really is the perfect b adventure of all time it's actually is a pretty fun <UNK> adventure that even with it's flaws captures your interest it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it even if it's made in the 90s it doesn't have a modern feel it more has the same feeling that a old errol flynn movie had big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but i'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had this on the other hand just has the real feeling you just can't hate it i think it's an okay adventure movie and i really love the soundtrack damn i want the theme song
<START> i'm going to spend as much time on this review as the writers did on the script this is easily the worst sequel ever made br br they killed <UNK> johnson not only was mark <UNK> performance god awful so was everyone <UNK> the physical comedy was forced flat and predictable the script seemed to have been written by <UNK> monkeys using the pen names <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> how the producers managed to squeeze out such vile cinematic <UNK> is beyond me they even managed to make veteran actor ray <UNK> look like a talent less <UNK> director michael <UNK> should be ashamed of himself br br i want the <UNK> minutes of my life i spent watching this <UNK> memory of a brilliant comedy back so i can try and convict everyone involved for this cinematic atrocity
<START> i saw this movie in a theater in chicago and should have enjoyed it since i love <UNK> but if the first half an hour is <UNK> done the rest is just sub predator video fodder a long chase through those post modern empty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> my girlfriend fell asleep i still like <UNK> though but not this
<START> writer director henry <UNK> has done a wonderful job with his film panic from the year 2000 and that includes his choice of cast william h macy tracy <UNK> john ritter <UNK> campbell donald sutherland barbara <UNK> david <UNK> <UNK> has cast <UNK> and ritter in decidedly un funny roles and the offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we normally see br br panic is the story of a hit man alex macy who actually works for his father sutherland he covers his true profession by doing mail order work by all appearances he and his wife <UNK> and their son sammy <UNK> are a typical suburban family unhappy with his life alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist ritter telling only his mother <UNK> in the waiting room he meets a young woman campbell to whom he is immediately attracted which <UNK> his situation further his mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist when alex receives his next assignment he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatrist br br this is a profound story of a gentle good man made into a killer by a monster of a father with his mother's knowledge who kills to please his father but also can't stand up to him and quit his rage is so deep <UNK> that he has lost emotional <UNK> to just about everything and everyone except his son and it's finally his son who wakes him up out of a nearly <UNK> <UNK> when it's time for panic to moves it does quickly br br panic doesn't seem <UNK> at all in fact it moves very slowly but it moves slowly not because it's poorly made the <UNK> is deliberate <UNK> <UNK> own psyche slowly coming out of the fog by making a decision about sara the campbell character and by seeing his mark his own psychiatrist as a living breathing human being alex starts to make the connections between what he does and who he is and how they don't <UNK> and the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche <UNK> br br william macy gives another brilliant performance as a loving father a distant husband and a cold killer the child of two monsters who never cared a damn for his feelings or desires a man who realizes finally that he has to step up to the plate or have the cycle repeated br br this is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater it's too adult too small too subtle too character driven and too good
<START> the grudge is a remake of <UNK> own series of popular japanese horror films <UNK> knows he is not dealing with anything new so he does what any intelligent person would have done in his place he forgets logic and concentrates in giving viewers a fun ride he uses <UNK> known clichés associated with ghost stories but <UNK> plays with these elements in an imaginative manner the <UNK> narrative is not a mere gimmick but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives at the end all i can say is that if the only purpose of a horror film is to scare the audience the same way a comedy is to make people laugh this movie succeeded with flying colors i watched it in a theater with an audience and it was fun to see viewers go wild over this one it probably doesn't play as well in your living room
<START> what we have here is a compelling piece of low budget horror with a relatively original premise a cast that is filled with familiar faces and one of the most convincing filming locations in the history of horror films so could anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated prison is the <UNK> director <UNK> american debut which still counts as his best effort even though he went on making blockbuster hits like die hard 2 cliffhanger and deep blue sea the story entirely takes place in an ancient and <UNK> <UNK> prison re opened for the cause of over population in other more modern state <UNK> inside the former execution <UNK> the restless spirit of the electric <UNK> last victim still <UNK> around the now promoted warden <UNK> <UNK> lane smith was there already 40 years ago when this innocent man was put to death and the spirit still remembers his vile role in the unfair trial it seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived viggo <UNK> plays the good car thief who has to prevent an even larger body count and <UNK> field is the <UNK> social worker who slowly <UNK> the secrets from the past br br prison contains over half a dozen memorable gore sequences but it's the <UNK> tense atmosphere that'll stick to you for certain unlike any other horror picture from that decade prison features an amazing sense of realism by this i refer to the authentic scenery and the mood inside the prison walls of course and not towards the supernatural murders that are being committed even though these are genuinely unsettling as well the film's best parts are images of realistic and tough prison drama sequences combined with visual mayhem and shocking horror the absolute best terror moment providing me with nightmares ever since i saw it at rather young age focuses on a <UNK> death struggle involving <UNK> wire haunting the screenplay only suffers one flaw but that's a common one almost inevitable i guess clichés the story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding we've got the ugly fat <UNK> with his <UNK> boy toy the cowardly and racist guard avoids confrontation at all costs and  naturally  the old <UNK> wise black con who serves a lifetime did i hear anybody yell the name morgan freeman don't stare yourself blind on these clichés is my advise as there are so many other elements to admire the photography is dark and <UNK> the mystery is <UNK> long and successfully and the supportive <UNK> roles of class b actors are excellent the fans will recognize tom everett tom <UNK> <UNK> and even immortal horror icon kane <UNK> forget about wes craven's god awful attempt shocker or the downright pathetic cheese flick the chair this is the only prison <UNK> worth tracking down especially considering viggo <UNK> <UNK> popularity nowadays i heard he starred in a successful franchise involving <UNK> <UNK> and other fairy creatures this true 80's horror gem <UNK> to get an <UNK> dvd release
<START> may contain a spoiler of sorts the mere mention of <UNK> glover is enough to send some <UNK> <UNK> in a bunch his landmark appearance in back to the future as george <UNK> has sealed him into the american conscience forever more recently he has been trying to get back into the <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> and <UNK> br br this time however <UNK> has made a <UNK> minute cheap <UNK> film at times it reminded me of genius while overall it almost insulted me but not because of its content content what is it is a movie where in one half of the movie all of the actors have <UNK> syndrome giving it a <UNK> feel to it the other half of the movie includes <UNK> glover adam <UNK> and a guy with cerebral <UNK> this all had the feel of what john waters was attempting to do with desperate living and simultaneously feeling more successful and failing miserably br br the half with the <UNK> syndrome actors also features many many killed <UNK> it is about a guy who has <UNK> and ends up killing one he is also tormented by a bunch of other people and a <UNK> he falls in love with 2 girls one of which he has sex with in a graveyard he also has a falling out with a friend who <UNK> him br br in a weird semi interior set <UNK> glover is the director of this show he is something like the control of the guy's mind and the cerebral <UNK> guy is something like the sexuality well he at least gets <UNK> in explicit scenes there is other shocking imagery made humorous like nazi <UNK> crossed with shirley temple and <UNK> in black face saying they're michael jackson br br in the outside world the <UNK> is still dealing with his love of killing <UNK> and being beaten by the other people they beat him with rocks and such later they beat the <UNK> after putting him on trial br br back to the interior <UNK> glover is still the <UNK> of his set and tries to control everybody but fails miserably br br what is it makes less sense than dr <UNK> and has more than a passing style stolen from it the claustrophobic mental space feels very much like the way the no wall sets of dr <UNK> felt claustrophobic they also had some dialogue that was absolute nonsense and it was all wrapped up with <UNK> imagery for humor br br the problem is about 20 minutes into the movie maybe a little more what is it runs out of imagery for the next <UNK> minutes we keep running on the same sets of images only introducing new imagery in the form of an <UNK> puppet show the movie seems little more than a movie which attempts to push the <UNK> in offensive and taboo imagery it tries to mock and confuse the audience but the issue is that it only has enough different imagery for a 40 minute movie br br even worse than that the cinematography set design and everything else felt very very cheap and almost <UNK> it felt like ok this is the way we can do it and get it out of the way it didn't feel interesting and was quite boring dr <UNK> on the other hand had amazing cinematography and framing the difference between the two is quite astounding br br rating c
<START> this film has great acting great photography and a very strong story line that really makes you think about who you are how you define yourself how you fit in whether you accept to play a role or break free there already are excellent comments dealing with these aspects i want to comment on the <UNK> setting of the film basically it's two people on a roof there is <UNK> of place and time with 2 protagonists and the radio acting as the choir many directors have turned greek <UNK> into film many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a greek tragedy but no director in my opinion has succeeded as admirably as <UNK> <UNK> in approaching the <UNK> and force of the great greek <UNK> both in story line and <UNK> setting a masterpiece
<START> i saw chan is missing when it first came out about four years after moving from san francisco to new york maybe it was the perspective of a few years away but this movie seemed to capture the essence of the city and its people better than anything else i'd ever seen still does it concentrates on one particular community the chinese but that's fine because so much of the city's soul is <UNK> through the settings the faces and the maybe above all the voices of the characters br br this isn't the <UNK> san francisco the settings are humble and everyday a taxi cab the kitchen of a chinese restaurant <UNK> district row houses little <UNK> apartments and small business <UNK> the <UNK> a <UNK> elder center this is what the city looks and feels like day to day to the people who live there even now in the era of <UNK> <UNK> urban <UNK> unlike say dirty harry in its own way an excellent san francisco movie as well everything is filmed at street level we come to understand the characters' points of view from the perspective their surroundings give them not from some fancy <UNK> shooting br br wang apparently filmed in b w because he didn't have the money to do otherwise yet one of the strongest visual elements of the movie is the natural light he achieves the often harsh <UNK> quality of the <UNK> is one of my closest <UNK> with san francisco it seems to expose everything bringing the buildings the hills the other <UNK> down in scale and in a funny way making the people you pass on the streets seem more individual and potentially closer to you than they might in another place <UNK> photography perfectly conveys this and even helps the story along at points br br wang captures the speech and <UNK> style of chinese and other san <UNK> better than anyone ever has i think if there's such thing as a true san francisco accent it's what you hear from the <UNK> taxi <UNK> <UNK> i think who appears talking on the phone in one scene listen to the way he calls the person on the other end ya <UNK> br br the story is poignant and despite a few very small <UNK> makes its points beautifully about the <UNK> that pull at the hearts of people living in old immigrant <UNK> including the justified political and ethnic <UNK> and little ironic <UNK> that help to fuel them all this is <UNK> <UNK> perhaps why some <UNK> here think the film <UNK> it doesn't suffice it to say that the two cab <UNK> quest for chan becomes a quest for something more personal br br chan is missing finishes up with a <UNK> <UNK> sequence backed by a goofy novelty song from the 1930s i guess about san francisco and all its crazy diversity an american caricature yes but somehow not entirely off the mark either
<START> words fail me this film was extremely difficult to watch and in <UNK> i really wish i hadn't done it although i attempted to sit through it until the end credits i have to admit i couldn't last for more than hour so my opinion could be unfair however this film would require the most impressive final third in the history of film making in order for it to be given a review which is anything but vicious br br please do not watch any part of this film
<START> to compare this <UNK> with an old low budget porno flick would be an insult to the old low budget porno flick the animal scenes have no meaning nor do they represent this man and his crimes even in the <UNK> sense of <UNK> the synopsis on the back of the dvd case says in part <UNK> retelling of the btk killer's reign of terror this is not a retelling a retelling would suggest that you are being told the truth of what happened or how or why none of these things are true i'm an enthusiastic <UNK> of serial killers and have seen some pretty crappy movies about them and honestly this is not one of them this isn't even about the btk killer save yourself some time and a few bucks and rent dahmer instead that serial killer movie is accurate and true however if you just have to see this movie for yourself check it out for free at your local library and even then you'll still feel cheated
<START> written by the writer who penned the excellent murder rooms series which <UNK> <UNK> adventures with doctor joseph bell i was looking forward to this and i wasn't disappointed it was quite slow moving with a lot of emphasis on <UNK> frustration at sherlock holmes which was very accurate and excellently portrayed it was an interesting character study and very well shot on digital video unusual for a period piece the acting was excellent all round particularly tim <UNK> and brian cox although the actor who portrayed <UNK> whose name i cannot remember impressed me no end an excellent character study which has about the same amount of twists as any normal sherlock holmes case do see this if you get the chance
<START> one of the best movies i ever saw was an irish movie titled philadelphia here i come i read the play before i saw the movie and loved them both it's the story of a young man preparing to leave ireland to go to america because he can't earn a living in ireland it is told both from the perspective of the young man whom the other characters in the film can see and another young man representing his <UNK> thoughts and feelings but who cannot be seen by the other characters in the film it is a very sad movie but deeply touching and i would recommend this film to anyone who wants something to think about i love any irish movie or almost any movie about ireland and any film that has the late irish actor <UNK> <UNK> in it gets my vote i would watch that man chew <UNK> for 2 hours on screen and unfortunately i have terrible shame to have lost him so young
<START> i actually thought this is a comedy and sat watching it expecting to laugh my ass off pretty soon in became clear this is no comedy or at least not a <UNK> carrey <UNK> one what kept we watching was the characters the movie starts with some pretty grim troubled people gathered together to try and fight one of their basic fears fear of water fear of swimming we start to get bit by bit into their lives witness their troubles guess of their thoughts br br actually i made it look much darker than it actually is and besides the chain of events soon brings some light and hope to their lives br br i probably wouldn't have watched the movie had i known its not a comedy but rather a drama but i had good time enjoyed the story and don't mind i spent about 90 minutes with it br br many films treat the alienation between people in the western world this movie shows how people can get together and help each other br br and if in the light of dying day you meet her don't let her pass you by and leave don't loose her she is your gift from the sun br br 9 10 br br peace and love
<START> i had seen marion davies in a couple of movies and really couldn't understand her appeal she couldn't dance for <UNK> she didn't attempt to sing and as for her acting she seemed in a <UNK> but i hadn't seen her silent comedies and this film is wonderful rather than kidding her own image as has been suggested here to me it seems a satire on gloria <UNK> who did start off in slapstick comedies went on to highly emotional women's pictures and did end up marrying a count marion a top <UNK> also did a funny rabbit imitation whenever she wanted to be seen as grand that was gloria <UNK> spot on br br colonel pepper <UNK> henderson has <UNK> all the way from georgia to hollywood determined to prove that his daughter peggy marion davies will be the greatest star ever their hope <UNK> and they are down to their last 40 cents when they meet billy <UNK> william haines who works at the slapstick studios and promises to get peggy a job peggy thinks she is going to be a great dramatic actress but the studio think she is a fantastic comic they convince her to make the film and at the preview she is a great success charlie chaplin asks for her <UNK> but she doesn't <UNK> him and treats him pretty <UNK> who was that short little guy when she finds out she <UNK> peggy and billy get a call from high art studio but only peggy is wanted and suddenly she is on her way there is a funny scene where she sees a star she doesn't think much of it's marion davies br br she finally gets a chance of being a dramatic actress but she can't cry it is a hilarious scene as the director tries everything to get her to cry and when he succeeds she can't stop her new leading man andre paul <UNK> convinces her to forget her comedy past and become elite and sophisticated she even <UNK> a new name patricia <UNK> she also seems to have forgotten billy and her dad she has developed a star personality when the slapstick studio picks the same location as <UNK> movie billy is thrilled to see her but quite <UNK> for her <UNK> attitude when she calls him a cheap clown he realises that she is not the girl he once knew br br after a studio <UNK> a magnificent <UNK> shot of some of the greatest stars of the day patricia gets a call from the boss it seems her films are a flop and no theatres want to book them the public are tired of her mannerisms and want the old peggy back she and andre decide to get married she dreams of being a <UNK> even though billy says that andre used to serve him spaghetti in a little <UNK> downtown and is no more a count than he is on her wedding day billy visits and after a hilarious <UNK> pie fight she realises that billy is the one for her br br it was amazing to see all the guest stars john gilbert is seen going through the mgm gates <UNK> cody is talking to <UNK> <UNK> who not only wrote it but several <UNK> romances that were made into mgm movies william haines another actor whose movies i had always wanted to see was great especially in the <UNK> scene he had wonderful comic timing harry <UNK> was hilarious as the comedy director there were so many hilarious scenes in this film and marion was at the top of them all i'm giving this film 10 out of 10 br br highly highly recommended
<START> as others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or <UNK> br br we all know after seeing <UNK> and acid house that scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world but unlike <UNK> and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work and even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie br br the fact that this movie won a couple of <UNK> shows how bad the british film industry is at the moment i thought the aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the british industry is even worse br br this movie is so bad i wouldn't even bother renting it from the <UNK> section br br do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide <UNK>
<START> there are some comments about this film that say that it is a bad and silly one and such an excellent actor as pierre <UNK> should not have accepted to act in it br br i think just the opposite that even when the film is strange and has some weaknesses the performance of pierre <UNK> is so <UNK> that it <UNK> the film in something excellent br br his performance is probably the best in history br br the film itself has a very <UNK> scene about the <UNK> of wine in the <UNK> br br for somebody who does not believe that a priest  even a <UNK> one  can <UNK> it in <UNK> blood the scene is perhaps bizarre but for somebody who has been raised in a catholic <UNK> it is very <UNK> even if quite unpleasant br br the scene of the death of the younger priest is tremendously shocking but it is very well acted pierre <UNK> turns the crazy act of murder in something understandable within the <UNK> madness of his character the tortured <UNK> <UNK> who in this terrible way comes back to his duty
<START> i like to keep my reviews short and simple but this pretty much sums it up you can not beat the original two for a number of reasons one of which including the directing talent of chris <UNK> br br this movie had terrible directing covered up by even more terrible acting i cant even believe these people are considered actors br br painful to sit through and watch the storyline was a complete joke about a secret chip and russian terrorists on a <UNK> quest to get it back horrible rent one of the original <UNK> and enjoy yourself br br the movie wasn't even set during christmas like the original home alone was turned from an excellent christmas time family comedy movie to a joke with no moral or plot
<START> upon seeing this film once again it appeared infinitely superior to me this time than the previous times i have viewed it the acting is stunningly wonderful the characters are very clearly drawn brad pitt is simply superb as the <UNK> son who rebels the other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect robert redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of <UNK> of the 1920s the scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and <UNK> of western montana all in all this is one of the finest films made in the 1990s br br you must see this movie br br
<START> born to boogie is a real <UNK> though a rock fan for nearly thirty years i only first saw the film a few days ago and rank it among the top rock films of all time the <UNK> terrific the cream of t rex and the visuals consistently exciting and unusual leaving this viewer <UNK> any more past directorial efforts of <UNK> <UNK> who did a fine job here if you love the music you'll be in t <UNK> throughout as marc <UNK> really is the star of the piece front and center even the fact that some songs are repeated doesn't matter a bit different <UNK> <UNK> musical <UNK> and bizarre visual concepts are all used to lend different <UNK> and a great deal of upbeat humor to what could have ended up as <UNK> a concert film in other hands as rich and full packed as born to boogie is the film's only about an hour long but what is there is totally satisfying <UNK> lies my only criticism the video package states something like <UNK> minutes and at least one online source claims the film to be <UNK> minutes but apparently it's more like <UNK> minutes of <UNK> fun
<START> why did i waste my money on this on the last day of sundance i want a <UNK> can i have my 16 back while i was watching this film i kept waiting for something to happen nothing did happen the only way i even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot which was not really like the film why did the director zoom in with their handy <UNK> and then zoom out it was not very artistic why did the director show <UNK> <UNK> her nails for fifteen minutes why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading or was that the point i felt like phantom love had no story at all and to be honest i felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film
<START> this movie is incredible if you have the chance watch it although a warning you'll cry your eyes out i do every time i see it and i own it and have watched it many times the performances are outstanding it deals with darkness and pain and loss but there is hope this movie made me look at the world differently <UNK> experience according to my english teacher also if you've seen it note the interesting use of shadows and light home room is a phenomenal movie and i rate it 10 10 for real because of the excellent acting amazing plot and heart wrenching dialogue very tense very moving doesn't give all the answers but makes many good points about <UNK>
<START> i was very disappointed by this movie i thought that scary movie although not a great movie was very good and funny scary movie 2 on the other hand was boring not funny and at times plain stupid br br the exorcist <UNK> spoof was probably the best part of the movie james woods was great br br now i'll admit that i am at a <UNK> since i have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first where i had basically seen them all but bad comedy is still bad comedy br br something that really hurt this movie was the timing which ruined some of what might have been good jokes scenes and jokes drag out way to long br br also the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again for example the talking bird ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time but it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying the routine between the wheelchair guy and <UNK> chris elliott was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless br br some jokes even got repeated from the first movie for example the <UNK> i guess you would call it of cindy anna <UNK> was funny in scary movie because cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he <UNK> her but this time around it was out of place and not funny br br the bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around the <UNK> humor was excessive though and rather <UNK> in the second film br br <UNK> spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie br br but i did enjoy <UNK> marlon wayans who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film the scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film br br don't get me wrong i love the wayans family and their humor that is why this film is so disappointing they have a lot more comic ability than endless <UNK> jokes
<START> set in <UNK> although one might easily mistake it for 1987 judging by the <UNK> and clothing the running man sees all round good guy ben richards <UNK> framed for a crime he didn't commit after a daring prison break he is captured and entered as a contestant in the brutal tv game show the running man along with some fellow <UNK> and the pretty token female <UNK> maria <UNK> <UNK> br br used by the <UNK> government as a way of controlling the masses the show <UNK> <UNK> against a range of colourful and often quite camp opponents each having his own unique killing style <UNK> fires electricity from a special suit <UNK> uses <UNK> sub zero has a razor edged ice hockey stick and <UNK> prefers a <UNK> to finish off <UNK> but these killers are no match for ben richards who <UNK> each one in a <UNK> gruesome manner followed by the obligatory <UNK> br br towards the end of the movie ben joins a group of freedom fighters in a battle against the authorities and gets to exact revenge on the show's nasty host <UNK> br br twenty years ago arnold <UNK> ruled the action movie universe and to his legion of fans he could do no wrong the <UNK> <UNK> had a successful formula that almost guaranteed box office success for his movies comic book violence plus logic free plot plus pretty female sidekick plus witty one liners minus acting ability <UNK> massive <UNK> the running man <UNK> followed this blockbuster recipe to a t and <UNK> mostly male teenage audience <UNK> it up myself included br br now two decades later and having just finished re watching the movie for the first time in years i find it a strange movie one totally devoid of technical merit decent acting and convincing effects yet somehow totally entertaining directed by paul michael <UNK> best known as <UNK> dave <UNK> from cult 70s cop show <UNK> and <UNK> and adapted from a short story by stephen king writing under the <UNK> de <UNK> richard <UNK> the running man is cheesy 80s <UNK> that looks both incredibly cheap and very dated yet despite or maybe because of the film's <UNK> it has a special charm which is hard to describe br br with no attempt at creating a realistic near future setting the film provides plenty of unintentional <UNK> check out the scene in which ben discovers <UNK> secret <UNK> of forbidden <UNK> tapes marvel at the crap <UNK> graphics used on advertising <UNK> and the running man board game as a graphic designer i found these particularly amusing be amazed at the distinct lack of convincing technological <UNK> br br the running man may be utter rubbish but it is hugely entertaining utter rubbish that i have no <UNK> in <UNK> to fans of arnie and sci fi action in general
<START> not sure why this movie seems to have gotten such rave reviews br br while watching bang one night on tv i found myself bored by the nonsensical random plot which was occurring on screen the entire movie seems to be nothing more than an exercise in meaningless artsy <UNK> self <UNK> on the part of the filmmaker the fact that the director writer goes by a one name <UNK> only <UNK> this sense of <UNK> br br those interested in indie flicks would be better off looking for something better written and dare i say more entertaining than this complete waste of time
<START> this film i thought was the great journey that forrest <UNK> should have been it's a rare treat to watch a cable movie in the middle of the day and come across a foreign film that is done so well this film is very well acted and i strongly suggest it to anyone who can take sub titles
<START> still love it 17 or so years after the first time i saw it in fact i discovered that i had lost my copy of this and was very upset despite it's non association with the original which as a kid i never noticed and as an adult i don't care about this is what cartoons should be like just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone i'm more than glad that my parents raised me on this kind of thing rather than the cartoons we see today that teach our kids nothing the music is great and gets stuck in your head forever i have <UNK> the entire soundtrack at one point or another
<START> arthur is middle aged rich <UNK> who drinks like a fish arthur does what he feels like and says whatever comes into his mind he likes to <UNK> about his <UNK> and knows that he is a spoiled brat he spends money on people he don't know and finds everything funny arthur must marry a high class girl to <UNK> a big fortune but he falls in love with a poor waitress <UNK> minnelli she looks really weird br br this is a damn funny film i watched this film because a very famous indian film <UNK> is based on the character of arthur although <UNK> is definitely inspired by <UNK> i think they are two different films <UNK> is just fun its very corny at times there are so many fantastic one liners in the film its not a laugh riot but it has some fantastic moments my favorite scene is when arthur meets his <UNK> father and he keeps talking about the <UNK> <UNK> moore sure has some comic timing he is very good with words and body language i loved the scene where he talks standing to a <UNK> couple in the hotel about a <UNK> country and he keeps talking to husband and wife in two different directions john gielgud got an oscar for this film i don't know that actor i don't think he did a great job but may be if i watched more of his work i may agree in future movie has some flat <UNK> but not very long ones looking forward to watch the sequel
<START> my first review of <UNK> is into the blue 2 the <UNK> the story is about two <UNK> played by chris <UNK> and laura <UNK> who love to explore hidden <UNK> at a bottom of a local <UNK> one day after a day of exploring they are approached by a couple played by david <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> they tell the young <UNK> that they want to hire them to explore the <UNK> and find a rare <UNK> about <UNK> hidden treasure that is reported at the bottom of the <UNK> br br next day the four dive to the bottom of the <UNK> and of coarse after a whole day of diving they find nothing a few more days past and the two hired <UNK> found out that they a part of a major deadly plot in which they can't escape otherwise they will be killed they were hired to find two big <UNK> one contains a nuclear <UNK> and the other contains a core br br the movie also has a back story about another person brother of the lead character trying to <UNK> things up with his girlfriend i <UNK> this part of the story was a waste of time this also includes a very steamy sex scene between the couple which to me is a complete waste and wasn't needed to be shown br br however apart from that this movie does have some good underwater photography and the colors blend in well which is why it receives 4 stars into the blue 2 is a sequel only by name none of the original actors or characters return it has a dumb plot stupid characters and a boring climax
<START> young handsome muscular joe buck jon voight moves from texas to new york thinking he'll make a living by being a stud he gets there and finds out quickly that it isn't going to be easy he goes through one <UNK> experience after another at the end of his rope he <UNK> up with crippled sleazy ratso rizzo dustin hoffman together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to florida but will they make it br br very dark disturbing yet fascinating movie director john <UNK> paints a very <UNK> portrait of nyc and its inhabitants in that way it's dated the city may have been this bad in 1969 but it's <UNK> up considerably by now he also uses every camera trick in the book color turning to black white <UNK> dream sequences flash <UNK> flash backs especially involving a rape shock cuts weird sound effects you name it it keeps you <UNK> and off center but i couldn't stop watching br br there isn't much of a story it basically centers on the friendship between rizzo and buck there is an <UNK> that they may have been lovers the final shot sort of shows that it's just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold cruel urban jungle br br this was originally rated x in 1969 the only reason being that the mpaa didn't think that parents would want their children to see this nevertheless it was a big hit with high <UNK> back then x meant no one under 17 it also has been the only x rated film ever to win an academy award as best picture hoffman and voight were up for acting awards as was mysteriously sylvia miles who was in the picture for a total of maybe 5 minutes it was eventually <UNK> to an r with no cuts when it was <UNK> in 1980 br br also the excellent song everybody's <UNK> was introduced in this film and became a big hit br br a great film but very dark i'm giving it a 10 don't see it on commercial tv it's cut to <UNK> and incomprehensible
<START> this post may contain spoilers br br although it was 5 years after the series ended and wb was currently working on justice league this animated movie is a welcome addition to the video library why well if mask of the phantasm <UNK> the first 70 episodes of batman the animated series and <UNK> <UNK> the 15 episodes of the adventures of batman and robin then mystery of the batwoman <UNK> the final 24 episodes of the <UNK> knights version of batman kevin <UNK> once again delivers a voice over performance that is nothing short of excellence and perfection i admit i was a bit <UNK> when i heard about batwoman and all i could think about were the old 50's comics of batman but i was blown away by the batwoman character her look her costume which i assumed inspired bruce wayne to create the costume on batman beyond and the fact that this movie keeps you guessing who batwoman is all the way through if you want to know who batwoman is then buy or rent the dvd barbara gordon makes a cameo appearance and i think the writers were trying to hint that bruce and barbara had something going on between them like they did in batman beyond tim drake appears as robin but his role is a small one and sadly there is no sign of or mention of dick grayson <UNK> <UNK> which leads me to believe he has established himself in <UNK> his city in the comics br br of the three suspects for batwoman my favorite is kathy <UNK> who looks an awful lot like <UNK> <UNK> kelly <UNK> did a great job as one of the other suspects when it comes to the villains i'm glad the penguin was one of them but i did not like the fact that they replaced paul williams with david <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> just didn't sound right same thing goes for robin the new guy did okay but just as i was starting to get used to matt <UNK> they replaced him it's interesting to note that kevin michael richardson who voices <UNK> <UNK> is now the voice of the joker in the batman series and we finally see what rupert <UNK> looks like <UNK> since he didn't show up in the <UNK> knights episodes the late john <UNK> will be missed although i enjoyed henry <UNK> as the voice of <UNK> if he had to be replaced they got the right man in the form of hector <UNK> i only wish they could have used two face <UNK> or the scary new version of the scarecrow br br the musical score and especially the soft sounding intro were superb i wish that was on a soundtrack and i especially enjoyed the beautiful and talented <UNK> in the iceberg <UNK> along with her song <UNK> <UNK> while some feel that this movie is weaker than the mask of the phantasm and <UNK> i find it just as strong and enjoyable as the rest plus like i said earlier it's a full length movie based off the <UNK> knights version of batman which i think gives a good balance i would at least recommend renting this dvd first before buying it for those who might be <UNK> of this movie but personally it's well worth the purchase i give mystery of the batwoman a 9
<START> the <UNK> is a dark comedy starring pierce brosnan as an aging hit man who befriends a straight arrow happily married american businessman greg kinnear in mexico although the <UNK> julian ironically <UNK> noble appears to be a tough guy on the surface underneath he is really just a mass of <UNK> and <UNK> a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and <UNK> thus on his birthday he reaches out to danny a man who has lived his life playing by the rules and who becomes strangely intrigued by <UNK> unconventional lifestyle in fact both men find in each other the person they could never be but wish they could become in their <UNK> <UNK> moments of self <UNK> br br although the film is a bit too reminiscent of analyze this and midnight run to feel entirely fresh and original the <UNK> nevertheless earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting brosnan looking aged and almost used up sinks his teeth into the role of julian in a way he never has before playing a man who seems <UNK> unable to make a serious connection with another human being brosnan is flip and <UNK> one moment then genuine and sympathetic the next he always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale kinnear is also excellent as the regular joe businessman who finds himself pulled ever more to the dark side as his relationship with julian <UNK> hope davis does a fine job as bean <UNK> loyal and loving wife who like her husband finds herself intrigued by this mysterious and dangerous figure from a world far different from the one she knows br br at times we find ourselves feeling that the <UNK> is holding something back from us not quite <UNK> the depths of its situation and premise at the end it feels a little too light a little too <UNK> to register the impact it should this could be because this is the feature film debut for writer director richard <UNK> and he hasn't quite gotten his movie pacing down yet still one <UNK> the fact that he doesn't always go for the obvious and that he keeps tightly focused on the two main figures in the piece rarely <UNK> for the trite setup or the easy laugh br br 'the <UNK> is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will hopefully <UNK> a new phase in <UNK> acting career
<START> deliverance is a stunning thriller every bit as exciting as any good thriller should <UNK> to be but also stomach <UNK> frightening though it is not a horror movie it is just as terrifying as any classic horror film the very thought of being a normal red blooded male enjoying an adventure weekend miles from any form of <UNK> only to be captured and <UNK> by a couple of violent <UNK> is surely the worst nightmare of 99 9 of the world's population it would have been easy for deliverance to slip into exploitation territory but john <UNK> has cleverly avoided the temptation to go down such a route and has made a film that explores questions and challenges the very meaning of <UNK> with so many films you come away wishing to heaven that you could step into the hero's shoes performing heroic deeds and saving the day and getting the girl but with deliverance you come away praying to god that you'll never have to experience what these four protagonists go through br br four city guys ed jon voight lewis burt reynolds drew <UNK> cox and bobby ned beatty head out into the wilderness to spend a few days <UNK> down a soon to be <UNK> river the guys are riding the <UNK> in <UNK> and ed and bobby inadvertently get a little too far ahead of the others so they pull in to the <UNK> and <UNK> their pals in the <UNK> <UNK> here they fall foul of two local <UNK> bill <UNK> and herbert coward who tie ed to a tree while one of them <UNK> and rapes bobby <UNK> him <UNK> to <UNK> like a pig lewis and drew arrive unseen and lewis being a fair archer kills the rapist while the other <UNK> beats a <UNK> <UNK> into the forest under great emotional stress the four <UNK> decide to <UNK> the event and get out of the area but they find the river increasingly dangerous to <UNK> as they journey <UNK> and the risk to their lives <UNK> when the surviving <UNK> returns to take shots at them with his rifle from some unseen <UNK> point in the rocky <UNK> beside the river br br deliverance is very powerful as a survival tale but even more powerful and disturbing as a study of macho attitudes being torn apart and left in <UNK> <UNK> though all the performances are remarkable one must take particular note of <UNK> efforts in a role that many actors would've turned down the film is very similar <UNK> to the 1971 film straw dogs both films deal with terrifying sexual violence in isolated locales and in both the eventual violent revenge <UNK> by the victim does not result in any sense of satisfaction the backdrop of the rugged countryside in deliverance is beautiful to look at but it also adds to the tension by placing the four <UNK> in a setting where they are at the mercy of the <UNK> and the landscape with nobody to rely on other than themselves this truly is suspenseful film making at its finest
<START> mr destiny 3 5 5 stars br br mr <UNK> theme is recycled from many films <UNK> many different years its theme <UNK> from recent spoofs on such plots see <UNK> to the same more serious and dramatic notion that worked in it's a wonderful life and a century earlier in the story of scrooge as told by charles dickens in a christmas carol it involves an <UNK> man being taken on a guided tour of his life and witnessing how his life could have been or would have been first hand br br in most of these types of movies the guardian angel <UNK> a man from <UNK> and shows him his life in retrospect or how it could have been should have been would have been in this case we are shown a businessman named larry james belushi he hates his life he lives with an <UNK> wife linda hamilton and <UNK> for a bigger life with bigger meaning if only he had hit the ball at the state championship in high school years ago he is convinced his life would have been better i guess he remembers this seemingly small moment of his life because it made a big impact on his <UNK> side but i doubt a grown man would <UNK> for one single act from high school still it works in the movie br br anyway larry is driving home from work one night where he is a <UNK> along with jon <UNK> when his car breaks down he wanders into a bar looking for a pay phone and reluctantly decides to tell the bartender michael caine about the way his life is turning out this is where we first see him remembering his childhood baseball strike out br br the bartender <UNK> and <UNK> apparently not worrying about any other customers this is probably due to the fact that the bar though old and <UNK> seems to have never been occupied by any living humans save these two men in fact larry even makes a comment about never seeing the bar before this is most likely for a certain reason that the audience is expecting before larry br br so the bartender who may as well be an angel of god <UNK> just like clarence <UNK> larry a special drink of his which ends up putting <UNK> life on reverse showing him what his life would have been like if he had hit the home run all those years before but larry has no idea of any change at first just like jimmy stewart didn't realize that clarence had <UNK> his life until he went into the bar and got kicked out larry continues to be oblivious to any change until he goes to his home to find the lawn different outside and a large wrestler type man <UNK> his home br br larry soon finds out his life would indeed have been very different had he hit the home run instead of marrying linda hamilton he married <UNK> russo and moved into a large mansion with children he finds out that jon <UNK> is no longer his friend but an employee of his and the most surprising fact of all is that with his new life that larry has always wanted he finds himself <UNK> after his old wife linda hamilton proof that sometimes money and a great looking yet shallow wife don't make up everything in a man's life like an intelligent wife and love and true happiness just like it's a wonderful life showed the audience a man's life is what he makes it and that every person has an impact on people mr destiny shows us that material wealth is not the same as spiritual wealth a lesson taught us over and over again but never quite so <UNK> forgettable and truly sweet as it is shown us in mr destiny br br mr destiny is never exceedingly hilarious but it is a sweet good natured comedy that never takes itself too seriously the problem with all the it's a wonderful life <UNK> out there like the family man is that they try to be as influential and memorable as it's a wonderful life was but there are only so many times you can single <UNK> rip off a famous film and mr destiny knows this and plays right to the fact it doesn't try to be anything it isn't rather it is something it didn't try to be and this is obvious to the audience br br
<START> follow up to <UNK> far better <UNK> jones has <UNK> black actress <UNK> <UNK> returning to her signature role as <UNK> super tough <UNK> agent here <UNK> a heroin ring in hong kong cross <UNK> of <UNK> action flick and kung fu b movie is fun at the outset but eventually <UNK> the shoot out finale is right off the <UNK> line and <UNK> herself seems less energetic than before she's still sexy and she puts a unique spin on her <UNK> stilted dialogue but these surroundings may have been too much of one thing for her she's jaded stella stevens plays the <UNK> this time she's good but can't match shelley winters in the predecessor from
<START> the worst movie i have seen in a while yeah its fun to <UNK> but if that is what you are looking for i suggest you see <UNK> millions this was just terrible and corny and terrible at being corny unless you are five or like terrible movies don't see this one
<START> hopefully the score has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which <UNK> all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of 8 s this movie's true score br br as mentioned before chris rock is the king previous to going to see this movie i wasn't that over the top about him but now i'm <UNK> on the doors of chris <UNK> website begging him to take me on as his <UNK> this film is truly funny if you don't find this movie funny you really need therapy and it's humour which targets all areas of society including race predictably class division love wealth <UNK> dreams stand up comedy the list goes on br br there was one slight disappointment for me however this was that in going into this film i didn't realise that it was actually a remake of heaven can wait another quite good movie made in 1971 with warren beatty as such i was quite surprised when i watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie i had watched on tv a few weeks ago regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that chris rock is funnier than warren beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any you get the picture br br well to the actual plot of the film br br don't spoil the experience for yourself don't read the plot just go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on imdb so far that have <UNK> mad about it go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in a long time go and see it because it's a cinema experience that doesn't leave you <UNK> ad <UNK> at the cost of cinema tickets go see it because it is a good movie
<START> one doesn't get to enjoy this gem the 1936 invisible ray often but no can forget it the story is elegant karloff <UNK> and <UNK> in his <UNK> mountain <UNK> is <UNK> rukh genius science who reads ancient <UNK> of light to <UNK> events in the great <UNK> <UNK> the crash of a potent <UNK> meteor in africa joining him is the ever elegant lugosi as a rare hero who studies <UNK> chemistry frances drake is the lovely underused young wife frank <UNK> the romantic temptation and the divine <UNK> <UNK> cooper is mother rukh in a performance worthy of maria <UNK> br br the story moves <UNK> in bold episodes with special effects that are still handsome it also contains some wonderful lines one rukh <UNK> his mother's sight he asks mother can you see can you see yes i can <UNK> clearly than ever and what i see <UNK> me even better when mother rukh says he broke the first law of science i am not alone among my <UNK> in having puzzled for many many years exactly what this first law of science is br br this movie is definitely desert island material
<START> mild spoilers contained <UNK> i'm spoiling this film to save you the trouble of having to watch it br br jet <UNK> movies fall into one of two categories shaolin period movies and movies set in modern day hong kong revolving around <UNK> or <UNK> like <UNK> each genre has its best and worst films twin <UNK> is jet <UNK> best shaolin era flick while the evil <UNK> is his worst fist of <UNK> while in the recent past is the best modern <UNK> jet li movie black <UNK> without a doubt is the worst br br jet li plays a self <UNK> <UNK> who received an <UNK> that gives him <UNK> ability but <UNK> his life span in his new <UNK> in <UNK> he plays a <UNK> <UNK> when his old <UNK> squad goes on a rampage jet li becomes a vigilante determined to stop them he <UNK> a very silly <UNK> cardboard mask so as to <UNK> his identity from the police and public as a <UNK> as well as to <UNK> his true identity to his ex <UNK> in arms br br the version i saw was dubbed and horribly at that why does jet li capture and hold hostage his library co worker if he's a <UNK> is there a love story between them why does the police chief not care when he learns of the black <UNK> true identity the plot is just plain bad bad by way of the superhero cheesiness bad in the sense that characters are never properly developed bad in its character interactions all topped off by a half explained story i quickly lost interest in br br the action and martial arts sequences are way over the top lots of blood gore severed body parts <UNK> explosions and matrix style <UNK> martial arts <UNK> are present in the film unfortunately this is the films best and only selling point if you want to see jet li playing a vigilante superhero in a mission impossible style movie black <UNK> delivers for the rest of us jet li fans it is a true disappointment this is one of those movies where jet li never gets to be jet li he gets neither the chance to charm us with his charisma nor a chance to impress us with his impressive yet realistic martial arts ability br br normally a chinese <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> would be enough to <UNK> me in a film sadly black <UNK> proved to be an exception to that rule indeed the antagonist of this movie by the way he dresses his long straight hair and trademark round <UNK> looks like the modern and aged <UNK> <UNK> however the villain isn't on screen long enough to make the gimmick worthwhile i am assuming the <UNK> to <UNK> was intentional in addition to the <UNK> look he also ran a satanic looking <UNK> so much more could have been made from the <UNK> <UNK> villain gimmick if only the writer director or anyone had bothered to give a background to and develop the character of the film's arch villain br br black <UNK> was the first jet li film released on video in the usa after lethal weapon 4 and i'm glad i stayed away from it until now it may well have ruined my whole perception of jet li as a martial artist and actor if you want to see jet li at his worst rent black <UNK> and the evil <UNK> and make it a double feature or horror both intentional and unintentional otherwise stick to moves that <UNK> the talents of jet li and have plots that are semi well thought out and plausible 3 9 stars
<START> contains spoilers br br i saw an <UNK> for this on a video then my sister discovered that we had the book so i read it i rented the video on the same day i finished the book i thought it was very memorable as was the book the cast was brilliant tara fitzgerald was excellent as helen and rupert graves was hateful as arthur the costumes music and settings are stunningly beautiful br br warning don t read any more if you <UNK> t watched this br br on the downside there are some sex scenes that have been added in and some violence this is why the video is rated 15 there are some other things that have been thrown in after the first part i felt that the accuracy went downhill while the book is better than this i am glad i have seen it and would <UNK> it to people who have read the book are fans of <UNK> or like costume dramas i am all 3 as long as you <UNK> through the sex scenes the book is rather <UNK> anne <UNK> books don t seem to be that widely read or well known as jane <UNK> or <UNK> heights which have made it into television and film several times another thing when i read the book i was surprised at how much religion <UNK> was in it but here they had <UNK> that all out br br 7 10
<START> br br in anticipation of ang lee's new movie <UNK> tiger hidden dragon i saw this at blockbuster and figured i'd give it a try a civil war movie is not the typical movie i watch luckily though i had a good feeling about this director this movie was wonderfully written the dialogue is in the old southern style yet doesn't sound <UNK> out of place and outdated the spectacular acting helped that aspect of the movie toby maguire was awesome i thought he was good but nothing special in <UNK> but here he shines i have always thought of <UNK> <UNK> as a good actor but nothing special but here he is excellent as well the big shocker for me was jewel she was amazingly good jeffrey wright who i had never heard of before is also excellent in this movie it seems to me that great acting and great writing and directing go hand in hand a movie with bad writing makes the actors look bad and <UNK> versa this movie had the perfect combination the actors look brilliant and the character development is spectacular this movie keeps you wishing and hoping good things for some and bad things for others it lets you really get to know the characters which are all very dynamic and interesting the plot is complex and keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing and ready for anything at any time literally dozens of times i was sure someone was going to get killed on silent parts in the movie that were too quiet brilliant directing this was also a beautifully shot movie the scenery was not breath taking it's in <UNK> and kansas for goodness <UNK> but there was clearly much attention put into picking great nature settings has that rough and rugged feel but keeps an <UNK> which is very pleasant on the eyes the movie was deep it told a story and in doing so made you think it had layers underneath that exterior civil war story specifically it focused on two characters that were not quite sure what they were fighting for there were many more deep issues dealt with in this movie too many to pick out it was like a beautifully written short story filled with symbolism and artistic extras that leaves you thinking during and after the story is done if you like great acting writing lots of action and some of the best directing ever see this movie take a chance on it
<START> let's start this review out on a positive note i am very glad they didn't decide to <UNK> out with tony being shot and do a <UNK> season like some people were <UNK> actually creator and writer of this episode david chase did quite the opposite we don't actually know if tony will live or die he's in a coma and his chances of recovering are very slim to none this episode seemed to move very slow and the coma induced dream tony was in involving mistaken identity and <UNK> asian monks <UNK> the sh t out of him was absolutely flat out weird after 45 minutes i got a little sick of everyone <UNK> but that <UNK> t be a reason to slam this episode it was a weird and unpredictable episode but it was still well written and intense edie <UNK> gave an astounding career defining performance in this episode as the conflicted wife having to face with her husband's could be demise i also found it interesting <UNK> dropped out of school and <UNK> a <UNK> against junior which <UNK> most likely won't have the balls to pull off <UNK> is now acting boss which opens numerous doors to problems in later episodes there were a lot of great <UNK> in this episode also and i think <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> may meet his demise if he keeps being a greedy s o b br br this wasn't a great episode and disappointed only because even though tony kills people we as an audience adore him and feel he is our hero of the show this was a necessary episode for the series even though it was a little <UNK> inducing towards the conclusion kudos to edie <UNK> performance and david chase and the writers for creating this wholly original and unpredictable plot twist this is the only season of 'the <UNK> where i haven't a f <UNK> clue where it is going to go i can't wait for next <UNK> episode my rating 7 5 10 br br best line of the episode paulie to <UNK> let's go van <UNK>
<START> i went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession i just wanted to check it out i was not expecting much of anything after all a musician an actor and a screenplay writer not possible for so much talent to <UNK> in one person right br br wrong obsession aside it quickly became one of my favorites the story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up hollywood special effects the story <UNK> at your emotions and pulls you along as the credits roll by you suddenly realize you were glued until the end br br at times the acting seems a little over the top i do however believe it's done with comedic intent and very fitting of the character otherwise i wouldn't have expected the level of acting witnessed br br it's worth seeing more than once i find myself laughing hysterically or <UNK> unexpectedly over something i either missed or forgot about the first time or two around br br i completely recommend this movie feel free to go in with your doubts but i'm sure it will find a place on your shelf
<START> guy is a loser can't get girls needs to build up is picked on by stronger more successful guys etc seen it saw it moved on i'd have to say that rob needs to move past the adam sandler part of his life and get out of the adam sandler plots there are two funny parts in the whole movie i couldn't even finish the last 5 minutes i was getting bored the animal is an alright film i do usually enjoy adam sandler films that have the same plot but this was trying too hard to impress the jokes are very old so trust me this is not a film that most people could really get into but some did so i'll be nice br br 3 10
<START> what an awful movie the idea of robots fighting each other is cool but the storyline is ridiculous real human action laughable acting non existent and special effects on which this type of movie must depend are <UNK> i thought it must have been made around <UNK> <UNK> and was amazed to see it was from 1990 that's 5 years after aliens ok lots of people said it was good considering the low budget but i just think <UNK> the point ' it looks totally unbelievable i wouldn't mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely re written story because i still like the idea of huge robots beating crap out of each other
<START> i was always curious about this film because it is so tough to find so when i stumbled upon it on ebay i <UNK> over the 10 and bought it now i understand why its so rare this film is so bad so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the ending credits which show all of the cut scenes where they <UNK> their lines are literally the movie's highlight the film is about a psychic <UNK> cast for one obvious reason her topless scene whom uses her powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality when she pulls in some kind of box like object the military <UNK> throws it into the open back of a truck with one soldier to guard it and gee what do you know surprise a kid in a <UNK> rubber monster costume pops out instantly kills the soldier with a scratch across his face then escapes to a nearby city but rather than <UNK> half the armed forces of the county to find it and protect the public those in charge just leave it up to <UNK> and ray to find it on their own but no matter this movie blows all its credibility long before then this barely escapes being voted a 1 by me only because of unintentional laughs somebody needs to alert the producers of mystery science theater 3000 if they don't know about it already 2 out 10 really really bad
<START> animation always seems to be <UNK> in japan this might not be the case but in europe and much more so in the usa animation has a big fat kids tag on it france is probably one of the more comic liberal countries home of classics as tin tin <UNK> lucky luke <UNK> and so on if you've never read these it's not too late there's no upper age limit on them and they don't carry the nerd <UNK> of <UNK> or marvel it seems natural a movie like this one pops up in france it suits my <UNK> image of the french as art loving anti usa oriented and talented movie makers luckily there's also a <UNK> darkly out there to <UNK> that view seems art is pretty much international br br anyway as you might have gathered renaissance is artsy and french if you're a normal person you will get scared by this there's no need for that however beneath it's cool <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> appearance there's a good thriller and a good movie overall br br that was one of my fears for this movie it's so easy turning the spectacular animation to a gimmick much like <UNK> c o are doing with their pixar rip offs i was expecting a confusing sometimes boring and not very engaging movie but luckily i was wrong br br i would have enjoyed it anyway for the neo noir stuff but it was good that it was worthwhile on that level as well note i've seen the french dub which was ok as far as i could see english might be more interesting what with craig and everything br br a final word of praise to the animation it was awesome futuristic well crafted nice camera work smart <UNK> eyes for example looked very good which is hard to do and so visually stunning i felt like <UNK> out this is so damn impressive then again i really like animation and i appreciate the effort the studio put down so my verdict is a bit biased br br good movie anyway definitely lives beyond it's gimmick
<START> no plot crappy acting and pointless gore br br this is supposed to be a horror movie there's no fear or suspense just boom bang gore then done some kinda marines are in the desert for some weird crappy reason and they get hunted down by those mutated <UNK> from the first movie which was good and should have been left it at that br br this is just another excuse for money and use of pointless violence just like the saw sequels they know no matter how pointless the plot is and the more gore they can add people will see it i miss good suspenseful horror movies come on hollywood you can do much much better
<START> the emotional powers and characters of dominick and eugene are the things that hollywood doesn't make anymore this is one of the most emotional sensitive and heart felt movies that i have ever seen roy liotta tom <UNK> and supporting actress jamie lee curtis deliver oscar winning caliber performances there are not enough words to express how great this movie is sure people who are not into sentimental movies may not care as much as the rest of us about dominick and eugene but for the rest of us this movie goes right to the heart and sole of compassion and humanity you will never forget this film ever br br spoilers below br br the simple yet <UNK> story is masterfully told eugene is a <UNK> school <UNK> who faces long hours and a demanding work load at the hospital his <UNK> twin brother dominick born 12 minutes earlier is a little slow and awkward because of brain damage due to a victim of abuse by their father a heartbreaking moment when this is found out in the film that will leave you in tears eugene a k a <UNK> faces a painful dilemma he must decide whether to finish medical school which would mean accepting his <UNK> in another city and leave dominick a k a <UNK> behind or <UNK> the rest of his education to take care of him <UNK> helps pay his brother's <UNK> school <UNK> by working as a trash collector br br the questions of <UNK> morals and <UNK> are masterfully <UNK> in this landmark movie just when gino thinks <UNK> might be making progress toward independence dominick turns around and winds up doing things like helping out a drug dealer or <UNK> to use a <UNK> <UNK> that he finds at the dump on an <UNK> <UNK> br br larry is the character and <UNK> partner on his garbage route who fills <UNK> <UNK> head with all kinds of stories like <UNK> and jennifer his girlfriend whom he is <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> going to atlantic city and gambling away all their money but deep down you can see that larry cares for him on their rounds <UNK> also befriends a little boy whom we find out has also been beaten by his father an end result is also tragic and the pain that you see on <UNK> face when it happens speaks volumes br br the sensitivity that the two brothers share for each other can not be <UNK> enough all <UNK> wants to do is be loved and look for acceptance in anyway he can i e he goes to church loves hulk hogan <UNK> loves <UNK> more than anything in the world but can his brother become independent enough so that <UNK> can pursue his dream of becoming a doctor a brilliant film that should have gotten tons more recognition than it deserved but unfortunately came out around the same time as rain man which dealt with a similar issue however i like dominick and eugene better because it has a far stronger emotional <UNK> be <UNK> that this movie is aimed right at the tear <UNK> so have <UNK> handy what a film
<START> i am a guy who loves guy movies i was looking forward to seeing a dragon fighting with the army with cool special effects all of this happened however this movie was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life br br the story was standard but the portrayal of the story was terrible the scene transitions were the worst i have ever seen why would you walk out to a beach to relax if your life was in danger the <UNK> <UNK> actions itself was very poorly written and the <UNK> <UNK> attack <UNK> varied widely throughout the movie several times the main characters should have died br br the director attempted to <UNK> a love story in the middle of the movie during the most <UNK> times this movie was obviously not watched after it was made i love movies but had to force myself to finish watching it thank god i did not buy this i borrowed it from a friend br br do not buy this do not rent it just watch discovery channel much more exciting
<START> though i never like to be the sort of person who <UNK> <UNK> personal taste if you like something that's fine but this movie was horrible and there is no way around it i don't like <UNK> <UNK> too much but she's a great <UNK> and <UNK> that i can admit but i can't admit to there being any redeeming qualities to this film many people way that it is an accurate portrayal of issues that high school students face maybe but everything is portrayed too far fetched there seems to be an attempt at a naked gun <UNK> kind of comedy but the timing is off there is too much space between each actors line as if they're holding for laughter there wasn't any whoever wrote the script was all over the place they tried to <UNK> as many controversial issues together in one film almost never fully developing any of them especially the girl getting <UNK> by a teacher i did not laugh once throughout this entire movie i was too insulted by this attempt at humor and satire to do anything but roll my eyes at the screen
<START> the goal of any james bond game is to make the player feel like he is fulfilling an ultimate fantasy step into the shoes of agent <UNK> <UNK> comes closer to this goal than any other game because this time you control the real james bond no offense to pierce brosnan who made a fantastic bond and <UNK> his voice and <UNK> to <UNK> but sean connery was the original james bond and there will never be anyone who comes close to his level of cool br br i must say at this point like many others who have reviewed this game that sean 70 year old voice doesn't fit his 30 year old image on screen and this takes some getting used to but it's certainly worth it he makes lines like <UNK> james bond and <UNK> not <UNK> into a big deal again but controlling sir sean as he takes on the evil organization known as <UNK> is as bond said in <UNK> only the tip of the <UNK> the <UNK> of the game begins with the opening gun barrel it's the original gun barrel from the movies then you take on first mission <UNK> the prime <UNK> <UNK> blonde daughter from terrorists at <UNK> and everything from the cars to the clothes is perfectly retro the world of the game is truly the world of the original james bond right down to the classic rock n roll rendition of the james bond theme that finally plays during a key moment late in the game as bond <UNK> a secret factory br br after the <UNK> opening the plot <UNK> follows the plot of the movie <UNK> james bond is sent to turkey to retrieve a <UNK> device from a russian <UNK> clerk who claims she has a crush on him in turkey bond teams up with lovable sidekick <UNK> <UNK> bond must retrieve the device protect the damsel in distress and get both safely back to london bond screenwriter bruce <UNK> worked on the script and he's done a good job of making the game the same but different to the movie the characters from the movie are all <UNK> well but some are better than others the <UNK> <UNK> villains <UNK> <UNK> and red grant are uncanny and there's a moment early on in the game where you interact with a miss <UNK> m and q who all look and behave as they did in the original sean connery <UNK> movies br br what puts this game miles ahead of the other bond games besides sir <UNK> voice and <UNK> is two notable features in the game play one is bond focus while you can <UNK> villains simply by <UNK> onto them with one button and killing them with the other an additional button push will allow you to zoom in closer on a target and choose between spots bond would shoot at such as a <UNK> attached to a belt that will <UNK> an enemy and a few of his friend or a <UNK> <UNK> that will cause a suspended enemy to <UNK> to his death the other notable feature is the stealth and <UNK> kills when you're in close enough range just hit a button to beat down an enemy with the raw brutality that only sean <UNK> james bond displayed br br sean <UNK> bond relied mostly on his raw wit and talent so you only have a few <UNK> but they're good ones the q <UNK> is a remote control helicopter that can self <UNK> and explore areas bond can't reach like the q spider in <UNK> only better the classic laser watch is useful not just for getting into sealed rooms but <UNK> enemies when you have no other weapon available <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a serum gun are the most fun to play around with but you must experience them for yourself besides the <UNK> you can go dress bond up in a number of retro costumes found during the game including the gray suit from the movie the standard black <UNK> a retro stealth suit and that classic white <UNK> all which look exactly like they did when sir sean wore them in the movies when you drive in the game you drive the <UNK> martin <UNK> straight out of <UNK> it can't turn invisible but it has a gadget for popping <UNK> like in the movie and when you're not flying down the streets of <UNK> in the <UNK> car you can fly through the air in the <UNK> jet pack br br then there's the multi player of course it has to be compared to the standard of the <UNK> game and it fails also you can only play bond villains rather than bond himself or the other heroes of the game but the multi player is amusing and a decent bonus since the <UNK> of the single player campaign alone makes the game worth playing the basic game does have other flaws some of the movie's most exciting moments particularly the gypsy camp shootout <UNK> <UNK> with red grant on the <UNK> express and a confrontation between bond and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shoe aren't done justice in game form and the game is a fast play even on the hardest difficulty but overall this game is the best james bond experience so far
<START> in all truth this really isn't a movie so much as an extended final episode by this i mean that had you not followed the tv series homicide life on the street i suspect that you would have a hard time following this made for tv movie having said that homicide the movie is still a great watch i think it says a lot about a television production that every single cast member would return many after years of absence to once again portray their characters and bring closure to an incredible program the movie brings out that sense of family not only amongst the characters but amongst the actors as well it's all very bitter sweet knowing that this will be the last time we will see them all together again under the title of homicide story wise i found this film somewhat lacking <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> seems particularly contrived and i felt his shooting could've been dealt with within the <UNK> of his regular position as <UNK> also <UNK> <UNK> extreme plot twist which was left hanging at series end is finally resolved but i for one never felt that it needed to be i enjoyed being left with a mystery let us recall that the very first <UNK> first case also went <UNK> for the entire series run as a devoted fan of the tv series i can love this movie and the fact that it even got made after h lots had been canceled but i would not recommend it to anyone who hasn't had the slightest exposure to the series now if they'd just release it on dvd
<START> hmmm where to start how does a serious actress like <UNK> moore got involved in such crap first blood might be rated as bull t but this type of nonsense is just rambo with tits point of course if you are interested in the <UNK> <UNK> moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the navy <UNK> that is the most stupid cliché one i can think of you'll say <UNK> jane is a great movie just the performance from viggo <UNK> made this movie bearable but hell i can't think of <UNK> moore being rambo especially not during the last useless 30 minutes <UNK> scott doesn't deserve the credits to make this movie one that comes up for women with equal rights it's just brainless propaganda for the american army and to make it more attractive they dropped moore in it awful movie
<START> another attempt by modern japanese directors to <UNK> the <UNK> genre successful and not in varying degrees br br <UNK> monk has a vision that he is to <UNK> a legendary and very active demon at the <UNK> bridge in order to <UNK> enlightenment while not at the <UNK> <UNK> thought is at the heart of this movie much like <UNK> ran it probably what made the movie the most interesting to me although it's <UNK> near <UNK> league br br stylish visual direction and excellent photography keep the movie mostly interesting throughout the two hour and <UNK> minute length the lead actors are uniformly excellent the music is really good the two weaknesses are the story and the fight scenes the movie drags in the middle which could have been fixed by some <UNK> editing and the fight scenes are mostly filmed in <UNK> close ups this works for most of the film but the finale feels like a cheat another recent film like this is tsui <UNK> seven swords great film but the promised fight scenes are disappointing <UNK> really doesn't move like a sword wielding demon his acting is great but he would be an extra in a traditional <UNK> fight scene br br good movie you'll probably find it interesting just don't expect traditional sword fights
<START> there are few movies that appear to provide <UNK> as well as realism if you've ever wondered about the role of <UNK> in modern war take a look at this one br br i just loved the scene where hundred soldiers get shooting at the jungle no one quite sure where that shot came br br and they <UNK> one scene to saving private ryan so it has to have some merit in the scene br br
<START> this had to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen and i'm 64 years old and a football fan i went expecting to see a football movie about 10 minutes into it i began to wonder exactly how such a bad movie particularly the acting could have gotten into a theater about half way through i <UNK> to my husband that it was awful and he explained to me the facts behind the movie although i was a little offended and can see how some could be very offended if they were not christian at being <UNK> to in a movie theater it wasn't that big a deal it was however a big deal to be subjected to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and above all the quality of the acting it is an appropriate movie for a church outing but to be shown in a church <UNK> and not in a theater do i go to church yes do i want to go to church when i attend a movie no would i recommend this movie absolutely not
<START> as a <UNK> in my mid 40s i am not even close to any of nancy drew 's key <UNK> but i was pleasantly surprised by the film this afternoon so i could tell were the pair of <UNK> silver haired ladies down the row from me the older man who left the theater just ahead of me specifically praised the film to the 20 ish female <UNK> who said she'd seen the film the previous evening and quite liked it br br more to the point however in the row just ahead of me there were nine count them nine ten year old girls <UNK> up next to each other passing popcorn and hot dogs and candy back and forth and <UNK> through the previews br br once the film began they promptly settled down to watch br br and didn't so much as <UNK> till the closing credits began to roll br br this is not a perfect film it doesn't quite pay off its high school subplots it's not quite confident enough of its own tone and its thugs are just a hair too far over toward <UNK> inept at times but the adaptation of the source material is essentially <UNK> the plot hangs together fairly well and it <UNK> <UNK> between the sins of excessive cheesiness and excessive <UNK> last but not least emma roberts carries the movie with startling grace josh <UNK> superb timing notwithstanding this is <UNK> movie and she pulls it off beautifully her nancy drew is very much the direct <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mars and the film is also a <UNK> <UNK> of jodie <UNK> early and underrated <UNK> br br in today's <UNK> it's a <UNK> a family movie that respects its <UNK> intelligence as such it won't be to everyone's taste but for what it is it is the best movie of its kind in decades
<START> ok after reading a couple of reviews on atlantis the lost empire i just want to clear up some <UNK> as to it being a direct rip off from <UNK> secret of the blue water the only part that was a ripoff from <UNK> is that the <UNK> from <UNK> and the <UNK> from atlantis bear so much <UNK> in terms of how it's used origins and how it's created from the source of life that there's no doubt about it being copied if you want to consider how <UNK> and <UNK> is dressed alike then you could put that against disney too it was kind of <UNK> for <UNK> and <UNK> to wear that bikini style clothing in an adventure sci fi not to mention they both move in a similar style too as an anime fan i have to agree there's some degree of <UNK> but it's only on the minor details and even though not many of the ideas are original like the <UNK> design on the wall in laputa the ancient mask from princess <UNK> the <UNK> of the vehicles to the <UNK> submarine in <UNK> etc the plot itself i believe it's highly original and it's quite amazing that disney can pull it off without the use of captain <UNK> the main character in jules <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> under the sea which is also the main character in <UNK> as for <UNK> and jean wearing similar style glasses as shown in the novel lord of the flies glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence i think <UNK> jean the main character from stargate and a dozen of other intelligent characters would look kind of <UNK> for the role if they went in without glasses as for the <UNK> and how the <UNK> fight with those wide blast <UNK> which really resembles what <UNK> does i want to state that it's a required element for either one if atlantis is involved in the plot after all it's a <UNK> city beneath the waters as for the crew having some <UNK> <UNK> with the crew from <UNK> in <UNK> it might be the artwork but i don't sense any <UNK> <UNK> there as the character's personalities were perfectly original to me as an anime fan that rated <UNK> as the 1 best anime i ever watched even now today i do have my doubts about atlantis when i first saw the preview but now that i watched the movie i once again <UNK> my confidence with disney and have high hopes for their future movies after atlantis overall the best disney movie yet without me <UNK> at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it's a plus that they <UNK> their cheesy scripts to make it even better also it's amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning i was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing
<START> first of all the reason i'm giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least peter falk gave his usual fantastic performance as lieutenant columbo he alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie br br i was initially all fired up at reading one <UNK> comment that andrew stevens in this movie gave the performance of his career to me it was the abysmal performance by stevens that absolutely ruined this movie and so i was all prepared to <UNK> all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment then i thought to myself what else has stevens done so i checked and you know that person was absolutely right in the 17 years since this columbo movie was made apparently every one of the 33 projects that stevens has been in since then has been utter crap so it is <UNK> that anybody has even seen the rest of his career br br if you like columbo see every other of the <UNK> titles before watching this one do yourself a favor and save the worst for last
<START> i've always been a great fan of woody allen and always will be for most of what he did in the past but only a blind lover could ignore how dull meaningless pretentious and most of all <UNK> acted this movie is a vacuous mental masturbation based on inconsistent grounds and what a disastrous idea to <UNK> recreate a presumed actor allen clone that is putting into will <UNK> mouth and gestures what allen would have done in <UNK> place had he been 30 years younger the outcome was obviously ludicrous and not to speak of the dialogues what was intended to be philosophical <UNK> turned into an <UNK> mockery of intellectual <UNK> unaware of its comic effect how sad
<START> i really wanted to like this film but so much of it is stolen borrowed from other work some of the <UNK> is painfully blatant the new york <UNK> review pointed out that their singing frog is awfully reminiscent of the one in the famous warner <UNK> cartoon <UNK> my baby hello my <UNK> hello my <UNK> gal ' but i challenge anyone to watch the fox blue sky animated feature robots 2005 and not find ridiculous similarities in storyline a young <UNK> growing up and a single innovative corporation <UNK> all great <UNK> br br <UNK> extremely similar camera angles capture extremely similar futuristic city <UNK> br br robots the servant robot in the robinson household has a very similar design to those in robots and both films use a sort of retro futuristic look br br all of this seems to be in sharp <UNK> to the obnoxious quote from disney at the end <UNK> that the company has been a steady <UNK> who never looks back which also <UNK> their entire <UNK> of films in the 90s that were pretty much <UNK> of each other with some minor <UNK> to storyline and <UNK> br br the filmmakers seem unable to let the story speak on its own and instead constantly send objects and noises flying in our direction as though we don't have the attention span for anything less br br the villain is really well designed and brilliantly animated and he's a pleasure to watch much of the rest of the film seems thrown together some of the landscapes look like cgi from the mid 90s br br the film actually opens with a classic mickey mouse short by the end of this cartoon we are reminded that disney never did have much interest in <UNK> or good storytelling they seem to think that simply getting something up on the big screen is proof enough of their virtue
<START> this is a long lost horror gem starring sydney <UNK> carrie and others and barbara bach it is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but it's worth it this film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time it seems that 3 young <UNK> karen <UNK> and jennifer travel to the small city of <UNK> california to cover a festival when a mix up occurs involving their hotel room and they seek <UNK> at the home of earnest <UNK> <UNK> and his strange wife virginia <UNK> stays behind feeling ill as the other 2 are off to film their story she is soon murdered at the house in a very cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the <UNK> system she is decapitated by the closing cover of the <UNK> as it comes crashing down on her while she is being <UNK> through and into the basement soon karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face <UNK> through the <UNK> cover jennifer is fighting with her ex lover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home her <UNK> whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son <UNK> a plot to try to murder her as well <UNK> does not totally agree with <UNK> plan to murder jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets junior here the film turns almost comic as junior portrayed hysterically by stephen <UNK> is a <UNK> mentally <UNK> <UNK> whose actions and motions will cause a few chuckles even though it's supposed to be scary this is where the pace of the film picks up and the ending is well done the actors actresses do a terrific job with the material especially <UNK> <UNK> and bach and although it's not the most horrifying film ever made it is highly entertaining
<START> i remember liking this more than <UNK> of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me laputa whose title seems to have affected its release in the u s to avoid confusion to its wide hispanic audiences has the cartoonish knack of the director's debut production conan in fact <UNK> has the thick bones and immortal <UNK> of conan who jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet then started running this makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch the <UNK> fans of <UNK> may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out laputa the only exception may be the robot unlike princess <UNK> and valley of the winds the theme in laputa is not directly connected to <UNK> if it has a theme at all it's anti <UNK> the importance of living naturally this is related with the flying castle is <UNK> shortly discussed and not really followed through overall i now regard the piece as being at an <UNK> between feel good and corny
<START> am i wrong or is the 2007 version just a rip off of the original i have to ask because the dvd i just bought is one of the worst films i have ever seen bad acting bad editing etc the only exploitation aspect here is how we were ripped off for our money buying this piece of crap it is nothing more than a light weight porn flick no real gore no scary images just a cheaply done bit of garbage if anyone wants to see an excellent film with no name actors some slimy gore and a decent storyline get baby blood also done on a cheap budget but well made and an actual story too i spit was a waste of money but i'll keep it just for a laugh it is pathetic new comment <UNK> 3 i'll keep this film forever just because it it <UNK> bad it's almost good in a really bad way the worst acting ever a real crap movie classic
<START> this movie was different in that it didn't show the typical gay stereotypes that i'm used to seeing but that doesn't change the fact that it totally lacks a storyline i'm sure that there are many gay men who are just happy to see themselves depicted on screen since black gay characters are seldom seen and when they are the characters are usually not fully developed but how hard would it have been for the writer to actually script a story with a beginning middle and end or how about a story that was focused there really doesn't seem to be a point to this film and even though it is a low budget film that is still no excuse for the lack of story or plot
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> mill <UNK> is a true masterpiece of the art of animation the <UNK> skill and artistry that <UNK> this <UNK> work is nowhere more in evidence than in this cartoon it is a shame that so many people can see only <UNK> in what is and was always intended to be a light hearted piece of entertainment that in no way sought to <UNK> black people if anything it is a tribute to the <UNK> humour and <UNK> of the black race i have not been able to view this <UNK> for many years as the <UNK> <UNK> in england have deemed it too offensive to be shown in multi racial britain if anyone knows where i can obtain a copy i would <UNK> love to view this masterpiece again i think those who <UNK> look for messages and intent that were never intended in these cartoons which are after all sixty years old should try to <UNK> up and remember that the world is a very different place today but that does not mean that anyone has the right to <UNK> what is <UNK> from the past
<START> the film is not visually stunning in the conventional sense it doesn't present a series of pretty pictures instead it is a visually interesting film it forces the viewer to constantly process or perhaps imagine the context of the various shots this sort of thing is easy to try but hard to succeed at the film refuses to use the <UNK> of a genre to help the less than fully engaged viewer get what's going on instead the film touches on and moves through a number of different genres the trick to loving the film is being able to enjoy this <UNK> i suspect 99 of north american viewers will just not get it if you try to pin down the narrative of this film or the philosophical message or the <UNK> structure etc you will waste your time there are none of these the film only <UNK> towards these genres and others at times the only <UNK> force in the film is claire <UNK> own sense of what fits together there are so few feature length films that come close to satisfying <UNK> description of what art is namely the enjoyment of the power of judgment itself instead of simply <UNK> experiences under concepts film usually takes the easy way out and <UNK> for the simpler pleasure of understanding what's happening most film is not art most film doesn't come close to art when a film does as this one does and is still enjoyable by a large range of viewers it's something of a miracle my on negative comment is that at times i find the film too <UNK> buying in to the various narrative threads that run through it the <UNK> father son narrative even though it's not exactly conventional ends up making things a little to clear and simple it <UNK> too much
<START> i loves this movie because it showed that they were not killing for fun but to save the ones they loved heath ledger and orlando bloom did a great job portraying ned and joe it has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that the language is very mild and sometimes don't even know it is there this movie shows that just because they are <UNK> does not mean that they are vicious killers i hope that people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one there is one thing that <UNK> me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book ned looked at also that that is how people remember them from their armor i hope that people will watch this movie and get interested as i have
<START> i really think that people are taking the wrong approach at this one first of all i find this short film very entertaining and interesting i just take it for what it is i think the suspense and mystery are ingenious in their <UNK> upon the watcher one other thing that caught my fancy was that it immediately gets the viewer involved even though there is no clear story just hints and pauses and emotions played out by the characters that kind of give you the impression that there is a story to all that is going on no one else could have done that better than lynch this is the essence of <UNK> at its best sure i will agree with anyone that people that start viewing this with the desire to be entertained without any really imaginative work from the viewer's side will find themselves disappointed and in good right lynch is not about that at least this side of lynch is not the one that helped make lost highway <UNK> dr is at full <UNK> here and people that just expect to be entertained like they would watching anything else will just not get what this is all about my opinion is that <UNK> room is all about messing with your animal core your <UNK> self by giving you the means image sound situation by which you <UNK> react it's not about pleasure of any kind it's about getting the desired reaction out of you and that my friend is pure art
<START> faithful adaptation of witty and interesting french novel about a cynical and depressed middle aged <UNK> engineer or something relying heavily on first person narration but none the worse for that downbeat in a <UNK> <UNK> sort of way philosophical and <UNK> humorous the best way i could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual charles <UNK> no <UNK> to <UNK> intended <UNK> funny but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations the film's great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a <UNK> way as to make you ask why aren't other films like this one of the rare examples of a good book making an equally good film
<START> the key to the joy and beauty the pain and sadness of life is our ability to accept that life basically is what it is so we don't constantly struggle against that single compelling truth in so doing we find peace elegant in its simplicity but so hard for most of us to grasp br br in this film the director shows us this truth but allows us to discover it in our own way this is a beautiful yet simple story more of a fable which is played very well watching the actors is more like being in a room with real people than it is just watching actors br br i <UNK> with how to write a review of this fine film so others would be motivated to see it i'm at a loss the story is about men in a bath house sounds like a real turn off right but nothing could be <UNK> from the truth the american title for this film is the shower but that is almost an <UNK> to a major <UNK> element in this film which is the bath i'm still at a loss talking about the story or the characters will not do them justice br br so i'll just tell you how much i enjoyed watching this movie and how touching and moving the experience was i was also quite entertained i cared deeply for the characters and i cared deeply about what happened to them for any story that is the highest form of praise br br if you were moved by movies like the king of masks or not one less then make sure you see the shower netflix has it and the dvd video and sound quality are excellent i watched it in the original <UNK> with well done and well placed english <UNK> br br
<START> i think if they made any money make a complete turd bomb like this one the i need to get into the movie industry i wiped my ass on a piece of toilet paper and made a better script once watch when the guy is running through the tunnel they used the same 30 feet of tunnel over and over and over again and never even changed the location of the stupid hanging light br br i think if i get the thrill of meeting the director of this gem of a movie i think i will pick a fight with him and start it by <UNK> on his <UNK> br br i think i need to <UNK> now
<START> from the awful death scenes to guns that fire without making sounds to a character called the fiend it's all tiresome slow moving unimaginative drivel it was ok seeing the guy with the cape and the <UNK> lurking around visually it was creepy and probably occupied the <UNK> of the time but even in 1936 one would think that there would have been a little more imagination and <UNK> to even a film like this i just kept waiting for something to happen of any importance as people stood around making speeches and acting like they were posing at an office <UNK> and then there are those bullets as a previous <UNK> mentioned perhaps the best clue would have been to search for a water spot on someone's pants pocket
<START> <UNK> <UNK> jack <UNK> is called that because he's a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience if they can last one round they win a prize a popular way to draw customers into traveling shows long ago jack is in love with the ticket girl mabel though her head is quickly turned when bob <UNK> enters the ring to try his chances with jack what no one at the fight knows is that bob is the <UNK> so he's able to beat jack though it takes him some work as a result bob asks jack to become his <UNK> partner and give up the carnival circuit later jack <UNK> so much that he too becomes a legitimate boxer slowly he works his way up the <UNK> until he's nearly ready to take on the <UNK> br br in the meantime the <UNK> and mabel start running around behind jack's back even though by now mabel has married jack so when the final fight occurs between jack and bob it's very personal and jack is ready to kill him is he good enough will rise <UNK> rage against bob help or <UNK> his performance tune in and see br br this film was directed by alfred hitchcock and while today this sort of film seems strange for a director known for mystery suspense films back in the 1920s hitchcock had no fixed genre which he directed or wrote he did both for this film in fact in many ways this film is more <UNK> of hitchcock's silent style as a somewhat similar plot came up in one of his next <UNK> the <UNK> also starring carl <UNK> as the <UNK> husband so while this seems a lot like a standard boxing film of the day it was not a radical departure for this great director even with its rather formulaic ending br br overall while a bit predictable and having ian hunter playing a boxing <UNK> seems silly the film works well while far from a perfect silent it's well worth seeing and packs a nice punch
<START> i really truly enjoyed this movie which is why it surprised me that it got such a low rating from so many users at this site i am not saying that it is a cinematic masterpiece but it was a great way to spend a cold snowy saturday night it is funny poignant and a great tales of the ups and downs of female friendships lasting through difficult times and the bad things that female friends tend to do to each others <UNK> up ladies we have all been there bill <UNK> shines as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> mcdowell proves that she can be a fine actress when the role is right and she puts her mind to it and truly there is the best wedding escape that i have ever seen or <UNK> up in this film more guts than anyone i have ever known you will laugh and you will cry ignore any marketing <UNK> and how this film is being marketing it is a hidden gem that should have done <UNK> of box office now i have to look around to purchase a copy
<START> family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about love can hold the members together through out the <UNK> and trials and that is what this movie is about one man daddy has the maturity and <UNK> to sustain the family in the face of <UNK> the kids grow up one all be it in the hard way to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a <UNK> when they fall all the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances yes i shed a tear along the way knowing i had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent this true to life is one which every young adult and parent would do well to see although some will not realize it until they too are parents a must see for those who care about their families
<START> although i rated this movie a 2 for showing a complete lack of effort in trying to create a quality horror film it was a 10 on the unintentional funny scale i couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were but i didn't care because i knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry with laughter dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie but i believe this is because they started filming without a script the fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile it doesn't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in <UNK> you will be confused with enjoyment i particularly like the scene in which the inmates are taking turns running around outside beating each other with sticks i believe the doctor refers to this as treatment genius
<START> br br ok the film wasn't going to win any awards and it is pure <UNK> and it is a modern update on it's a wonderful life but it's just come out as a cheap release on dvd and there are a lot worse ways of blowing 13 you get a film that has a surprisingly strong cast but for most they were still a year or two from becoming b list <UNK> however it's an enjoyable way of passing an hour and half just don't think too much in it
<START> 1 this movie was amazing i watched it while i was in the town next to the one where he grew up i went and saw the buildings that the story took place in overall i loved this movie one of jake <UNK> best also my favorite parts were the science fair and all the times with his father they were so sad it seemed homer wanted to follow his dream and his dad didn't seem to care one way or another that tag line is true sometimes one dream is bright enough to light up the sky 2 the way this movie was shot was impeccable it was all so believable that it could have been recorded during the 1950's dress was accurate and they had their <UNK> down too definitely recommend this movie
<START> this is film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist and am i glad he did the blend of british humor should i say humour and the reality of a lost middle aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a hoot add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot those plants under the <UNK> were not going to make it without the <UNK> they received and it is a truly hilarious yet touching film i laugh every time i <UNK> the vision of all the bar <UNK> sitting in their lawn <UNK> with <UNK> on counting down the lights maybe it's just my <UNK> county blood but the brits definitely got this one right 10 10
<START> <UNK> take on the <UNK> theme and set during the christmas season after the previous entry abandoned ties to christmas has <UNK> trapped toys sent to murder a child yet through this other victims are accidentally <UNK> in the process perhaps by a toy <UNK> son screaming mad george was responsible for the killer toys including a <UNK> which enters a <UNK> mouth and out his eye another where soldier toys actually shoot real bullets at a babysitter after her boyfriend was practically <UNK> by a severed hand toy operating from a remote control the little target is a mute child named derek william <UNK> whose <UNK> was murdered by a red ball with <UNK> arms that <UNK> his face causing him to land on a <UNK> poker mother sarah jane <UNK> <UNK> about her son's mental state <UNK> his <UNK> towards opening presents or more importantly talking <UNK> from watching her husband's horrific murder <UNK> real father <UNK> tracy <UNK> fears for his <UNK> safety and informs reluctantly his ex girlfriend sarah that the local <UNK> joe <UNK> mickey rooney once was arrested for setting traps in toys to harm kids due to the loss of an unborn child when his wife was killed in a car crash kind of a <UNK> in saying that if he couldn't have a son then others shouldn't either still quite a heavy <UNK> often seen <UNK> jack <UNK> seems to have set aside his feelings towards kids but his creepy son <UNK> brian <UNK> hasn't and derek he <UNK> angst towards why you'll soon understand br br pretty disappointing special effects and rather goofy premise <UNK> name adds an <UNK> to the film gaining it a <UNK> but his <UNK> can only help so much attractive lead actress <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> as the man who re enters her life aren't so bad but the lame plot that develops is hard to take seriously i'm guessing that's the point but rooney has no reason to be in such a film as this he has no room to bring any personality to his <UNK> other than rage and desperation quite <UNK> barely holding himself together as he explodes in anger towards <UNK> when not <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is appropriately weird and robotic as <UNK> longing to have sarah as his mama the practical effects used during the attacks on victims are rather unconvincing screaming mad <UNK> work with savage steve holland was far more effective than what we see in this film the sex everyone talks about isn't as gratuitous as many would have you believe i can't even recall any nudity probably the best of the numerous sequels <UNK> but that's not exactly an <UNK> i'm pretty sure written on paper this was an entertaining concept the idea of <UNK> <UNK> using horror elements but the result doesn't exactly blow you away
<START> blade runner <UNK> is a <UNK> br br city of lost children <UNK> senses or whatever used and abused and mostly well just giving us far less than what we might dream of and br br dark city br br these really ought to be added br br for a while now i've been waiting for an animated film that might affect me as much as miyazaki's stuff has this one is the 1st br br hmm scratch the animated part of that br br i have an intense love hate relationship with film noir and hey if you don't leave it must be mostly love right but there are so many sci fi and noir themes totally <UNK> in this film that it's just a wonder to watch br br these people did an incredible job
<START> yet another early film from alfred hitchcock which seems to have been done out of <UNK> <UNK> as with <UNK> and the <UNK> you can tell that hitchcock had little interest in this movie there is almost no style or craft to it at all the story revolves around fred and emily a young married couple who come into some money and go on a cruise which proves to be a test of their marriage emily is given a chance at a new life with a good hearted wealthy man who falls in love with her but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband this might seem more believable if fred weren't made out to be a completely <UNK> pompous ass who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman the couple ends up staying together but the movie lacks any real <UNK> scene the third act goes in a completely different direction with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an asian fishing boat joan barry does give a very stirring performance as the faithful wife of an <UNK> husband that's about all you can say for this one
<START> another day stuck <UNK> another film to watch having finally completed my christmas shopping yesterday on a cold and <UNK> afternoon i had nowhere else to go to escape the land that time forgot or rather i had nothing else to watch br br doug <UNK> that <UNK> of leading man actors leads a handful of allied sailors sunk by a u boat somewhere in the atlantic in <UNK> capturing the u boat in a scene that defies logic and reason they eventually find themselves on a strange island apparently <UNK> by human hands together they explore the land and discover dinosaurs and <UNK> can they escape before becoming a permanent resident of the land that time forgot br br despite being made few years before star wars these films are light years apart in terms of special effects the model shots are little better than anything you would expect to see in an episode of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the creatures aren't much better either when the t rex i'm assuming that's what it was was killed it fell in the same way that zombies do when you kill them frozen in mid walk and <UNK> arms and legs held out like a sleeping cow that's been pushed over granted the sets aren't too bad but the lousy acting and endless explosion noises which all sound the same do their best to ruin credibility and your enjoyment of the picture as a whole characters are neither believable or worthy of your sympathy as they fire their guns at seemingly anything that moves in the end i just didn't care if they got off the island or not and by the time the end came i was more <UNK> than entertained br br costumes are authentic enough until the <UNK> arrive and it is bear skin <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> all round and although it was fairly obvious from their actions you wouldn't have known that some characters were german from their accents the whole thing just lacked some polish and <UNK> leaving the viewer confused in places and <UNK> in others overall this film barely <UNK> a <UNK> of excitement these days although you can find some small amusement in trying to work out where colin farrell is i spotted his name in the credits and half expected a baby to appear with an irish accent and suspect facial hair oh well nothing particularly great here to see then but just about ok if you're eating your lunch and the weather is <UNK> further activity
<START> final score 0 out of 10 br br possible scene specific spoilers but who the hell cares br br yes that's right zero and i rarely give <UNK> even for the <UNK> of movies i look for things like music cinematography imagination it's humor even a good pace to be as objective about the score as possible looking at it within it's own <UNK> or <UNK> but there is absolutely nothing redeeming here i can't remember another time a movie actually sent me pacing up and down the room when it was over the only reason i made it to the end was because i couldn't seem to change the channel i sat there simply <UNK> watching to see what <UNK> stupid bit it would come up with next it was like watching a snake <UNK> a rat br br but let's have some fun and pull this baby apart shall we first of all there is nothing technical about whipped that works the visuals are all sitcom style the cut scenes all just pictures of the street traffic going by at night over and over the music and score not only doesn't contribute anything to the movie it's obnoxious not to mention it doesn't have anything to contribute to anyway the acting is as cardboard as it comes all around and that goes for amanda <UNK> clearly the star that got this train wreck green <UNK> too these guys supposedly good friends have no more chemistry or sense of purpose then if director peter m cohen had rounded them up at a bus station minutes before shooting br br on the creative side there isn't an original bone in it's body it has no imagination it shows us nothing we haven't seen a thousand times before the whole premise or twist of this movie is based on male bashing and the idea that an <UNK> women can play men just as they get played anybody that thinks this is somehow a twist or is in any way original has obviously never turned on a tv before twisted shallow women are common male bashing is the norm it's not stealing from anything specifically it's worse it's stealing from clichés i can't imagine a women making a movie that depicted other women based so much on stereotypes and with this sense of contempt makes me want to go rent in the company of men or better yet there's something about mary this movie wants to be a <UNK> version of there's something about mary so bad you can see the sweat br br the movie has no insights into women men dating sex or really anything cohen is simply content to <UNK> <UNK> he has been <UNK> with from other sexist movies on the other end the movie doesn't work as a satire either because even though it is <UNK> with <UNK> one could view as satirical it doesn't have that <UNK> in reality that <UNK> need it doesn't even know what it's <UNK> then there's the dialogue which is little more then the characters screaming <UNK> at each other example character 1 f k you character 2 oh yeah well f k you repeat br br and the bottom line the thing that could excuse all the other <UNK> there are a lot of movies without plots without good acting with morally repulsive characters and <UNK> laced dialogue that have been funny and thus been good whipped ain't funny not for a second it has no comic skills or timing the situations are all completely phony not based in any shred of truth especially enough to <UNK> laughs out of us the characters all <UNK> drawn so they will seem <UNK> to the lowest of the lowest common <UNK> just look at the <UNK> scene cult classic hair <UNK> scene one of our bumbling anti heroes opens the medicine <UNK> and sees <UNK> <UNK> 's <UNK> for some reason light shines down on it as if he's found the holy grail why cohen thinks men react this way to <UNK> i do not know while he <UNK> it on himself he drops it in the toilet and then attempts to fish it out with his bare hands when oh my <UNK> walks in on him oh my sides br br but strangely enough people actually like this movie of course people also like friends and reality dating shows so i shouldn't be surprised all of this has a common thread however whipped is big evidence to me that there is just a huge pocket of people in america that will laugh at any joke just because it is about sex they will like any show or movie or think they like it just because it is about dating or relationships it's lack of any quality has no <UNK> on these people just as people are <UNK> to want <UNK> teeth and thinner bodies to sell <UNK> and weight loss programs they are also <UNK> to <UNK> lap up anything dating relationship related to sell them cheap empty <UNK> tv movies and any number of products br br the only <UNK> will be that when i die because i saw this movie i've got a credit to get 80 minutes of my life back br br
<START> wow the sort of movie you could watch ten times and still delight in its nuances absolutely incredible if this was <UNK> debut film i <UNK> to think what would happen if he got any better from film to film the only other one of his i've seen at time of writing is death in <UNK> which was absolutely incredible more dazzling visually than ossessione obsession one of the most beautiful films i've ever seen but its story was not as involving as ossessione if you click on <UNK> on this <UNK> <UNK> there are stills from the movie on those <UNK> they won't really do justice to the experience of the movie such <UNK> camera movements such beautiful composition such wonderful faces such terrific characters such a great story development the first movie adapted from james m <UNK> the <UNK> always rings twice br br i can't believe this was made in <UNK> eight years before brando was supposed to have introduced realistic acting to the world with <UNK> named desire 1951 the actors in this may not have used the method technique ie they may not have truly felt everything themselves i don't know anything about it but they're some of the best most genuine and realistic performances up to this date in cinema also eight years before <UNK> named desire brought a new <UNK> to the screen ossessione was <UNK> sensual the most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema yes i'm being <UNK> but ossessione was just that terrific br br the reason ossessione didn't cause the impact <UNK> did was that it was made in fascist italy and banned by <UNK> and re cut in america american audiences didn't see its full glory till <UNK> eight years after <UNK> br br i won't say any more about it just writing to tell you its one of the best most beautiful and exciting movies i've ever seen and tell you to go out and see it like another reviewer i'm going to buy it as soon as i can find it
<START> i have to say despite it's reviews angels in the <UNK> was a pretty good movie i like the fact how it teaches kids to always have faith and never give up because yes <UNK> can happen unlike the other baseball movies this one particular movie stood out because of hits amazing special effects and well <UNK> soundtrack which was very interesting though i liked this movie it did have some flaws such as some <UNK> i e towards the end when ray mitchell hits a homer he doesn't step on the plate and therefore that wouldn't be a score but that's just <UNK> i have to say i was really impressed with this movie's presence and moral just have faith don't give up
<START> guys and dolls is a movie <UNK> for a remake it was made forty eight years ago its two main stars are either dead or <UNK> pounds although a remake with big stars now would be box office success it would not be able to capture the magic that went into this version its <UNK> energy can't be <UNK> nor can the pure joy you get when watching something like this a huge widescreen big entertainment movie br br marlon brando who last <UNK> in at <UNK> <UNK> last time i heard plays sky masterson one of the biggest <UNK> in new york frank sinatra is nathan detroit whose as often as he can find a <UNK> for it crap game is city wide famous however when the one place he has left to hold it is <UNK> 1 000 detroit needs the money fast he <UNK> masterson 1 000 that he can't take <UNK> sarah brown jean simmons to <UNK> with him the next day br br guys and dolls is basically nothing more than <UNK> types singing and dancing which usually as it does here add up to fun it's obvious to see how this was a broadway musical there weren't that many sets and the scenes were long if i was to complain about one thing it's how uneven the songs were at times there were two songs in a scene other times thirty minutes went by without one guys and dolls is never boring just a great time br br my rating 8 10 br br not rated
<START> this is the <UNK> that <UNK> never was as much as i wanted to love <UNK> it always seemed too <UNK> for me to feel for it its soundtrack is one of my favorite albums though stella on the other hand moves at a slower and occasionally too slow pace and though it's somewhat manipulative in its tears inducing tale about a self <UNK> mother it works because bette and the rest of the cast turn in great performances 10 10
<START> i thought this movie would be dumb but i really liked it people i know hate it because spirit was the only horse that talked well so what the songs were good and the horses didn't need to talk to seem human i wouldn't care to own the movie and i would love to see it again 8 10
<START> what can i say this is a piece of brilliant film making that should have won an oscar a copy should be kept safe in a secure vault for <UNK> it should be required viewing for all high school students across the world sam <UNK> is a genius perhaps the most genius writer director producer chef babysitter <UNK> <UNK> to ever grace the cinema world with his art br br where do i begin with this one every <UNK> of ben and arthur was so completely breathtaking and <UNK> as arthur wow he is so attractive i'm surprised he didn't go for mr universe i couldn't contain myself during the nude scene i <UNK> this movie to my brother and he called me on the phone saying how <UNK> nude scene turned him gay i am totally supportive of course because of this film and it's beautifully crafted lessons in tolerance why just yesterday i burned down a church and i wrote for sam and arthur in its <UNK> <UNK> br br the cinematography was the best thing about this film when that fed ex plane took to the <UNK> amid the palm trees of <UNK> i <UNK> why i never even knew they had palm trees in <UNK> or that people could travel on fed ex planes before this film it opened my eyes to a new realm of possibilities this film inspired me to <UNK> in sam <UNK> school of screen writing acting directing <UNK> casting producing production design and real estate i just want to say thank you mr <UNK> thank you for bringing this creation into the world we can never re pay you enough
<START> why is it that everyone who has seen this movie feels it is their responsibility to tell us whether or not they are <UNK> that point is completely <UNK> to any argument to be made against this total dog of a movie br br i think sports movies fall into two categories well made movies about the human spirit and <UNK> and by the <UNK> br br honestly this movie never could decide what it wanted to be a touching drama for trying to be your best in life an <UNK> of <UNK> motivation or a martial arts flick in the end it didn't do any of those convincingly or completely enough to make me give one ounce of care of any of it br br for the record i also am a <UNK> <UNK> and now i am officially as bad as the rest but putting bad <UNK> in a movie doesn't make it bad automatically i mean look at star wars episodes 4 6 good movies bad <UNK> i liked those movies but when you put bad sports into a bad movie for some reason people think that it is only the <UNK> that think it a lame effort br br don't be fooled by any comments on the smaller issue of <UNK> this is just a bad movie in the end this movie has nothing for the <UNK> <UNK> or the movie buff or simply anyone with a pulse and three brain cells br br when i see a movie and am forced to think man i wish i was watching the mighty <UNK> ' i know that it is time to <UNK> the argument with the theater manager to get my money back and see if there is anyone in the <UNK> that will somehow give me two hours of my life back
<START> the reason why people say that this movie scared them is because it did that means the movie purpose was felt by a few who did see it when i first saw this movie it scared me and made me think about life and religion this is not a blood and gore scary type movie but the kind that you would think that it may be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written of course non <UNK> will say its only a sci fi movie truth is this movie is a must have for your thriller collection even if it does have a religious view if you are a fan of classic thrillers omen etc this is one of them and its a must have i never saw the sequel distant thunder but i believe it picks up where this movie ends
<START> where to begin the special effects should be named special <UNK> when the director <UNK> action i guess he also <UNK> to the actors to carry out the worst performance they could think of maybe he was annoyed with the producers and wanted to make sure that they would not recover a single <UNK> out of their investment and that the work would be a case study of how not to make movie or maybe he hated art school and wanted to be an <UNK> but his family did not let him br br the only thing that is sure that whoever employs him in the future is because its in love with him so its <UNK> jumped through the window or because he changed its name and deleted all past previous references
<START> firstly let me say that i didn't like the fact that the rock won the title that is so gay next i feel regal should have got back his european title jeff hardy is a crappy <UNK> rob van <UNK> had the <UNK> title too long already <UNK> should have won it i am pleased with storm and christian being tag <UNK> best match was the booker t and big show match in my opinion
<START> haunted by a secret ben thomas will smith looks for redemption by <UNK> <UNK> the lives of seven people he doesn't know once his plan is set nothing will be able to stop him at least that's what he thinks but ben hadn't planned on falling in love with one of these people and she's the one who will end up <UNK> him will smith is back again with director <UNK> <UNK> after the life inspiring movie the pursuit of happiness seven pounds is yet another life changing movie experience which not only does reminds you of their previous collaboration <UNK> but <UNK> you <UNK> in the end will smith also is the producer again with some of the others these movies are very realistic which depicts a common man's life his struggles through life seven pounds might have took some time to gain it's actual momentum but just after half an hour of the movie the movie is all set to rule your heart also this movie has some twists revolving around which lets the viewers keep guessing director <UNK> <UNK> once again is the winner all the way with his emotional yet inspiring message he makes all the characters of the movie very real that the people would actually find themselves in somewhere of the movie along with the director will smith is yet another winner with his superb acting skills once again the duo of the director the actor works as a charm also there are other talented actors in the movie who did their part pretty well rosario dawson beauty with brains that's what she can be called she looks beautiful does her part extremely well barry pepper gives a great support to the movie woody <UNK> does the same although woody did not had much screen timing would have been good if he had more you won't forget this movie easily watch this movie change your life top class cinema
<START> unfortunately this film <UNK> was a pathetic attempt of the true story of <UNK> <UNK> ' the only thing that was good about the picture was <UNK> <UNK> who was a joy to watch <UNK> <UNK> ' although her role was little was unfortunately bad the bottom line is that this film lacked a good performance from the actors except one and that the <UNK> of the true story was a desperate attempt for a good screenplay
<START> this movie was okay but it certainly <UNK> the claim that <UNK> are born that way especially when a woman can exit out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into the arms of another woman it almost seems as if <UNK> gender <UNK> turned on and off like a switch making this film seem a little simplistic br br also as is common with films that are trying to push an agenda it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or <UNK> over the gay lifestyle were labeled as <UNK> and there was no happy medium it was either <UNK> friends and relatives totally <UNK> her or they totally <UNK> her this is not typical of interactions between gay and non gay relatives and friends it is usually a mixture of emotions and values that come into play it is possible to love people and treat them with respect while not necessarily <UNK> the choices they make sadly the movie showed none of these types of interactions for a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance it struck me as very <UNK> movie then at the end kate apparently decides after all these years she wants to be with mac and everything is hunky <UNK> is that what being gay is really all about come on
<START> anthony <UNK> westerns with jimmy stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with john ford and howard <UNK> as the best film director in that genre he certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy stewart in <UNK> films there is an edge to jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience in winchester '73 it was the relationship of stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance here it is a i trust only myself attitude which leads to one <UNK> after another even before the film properly begins he as jeff <UNK> kills two of his hired <UNK> who were helping on a cattle drive to seattle because of some <UNK> we never are clear about it either they wanted to leave the cattle drive or they tried to steal the cattle br br he meets his match in <UNK> the <UNK> he has to get to in order to take his herd to dawson <UNK> boss is a so called law man named gannon john <UNK> who reminds one of the real boss of <UNK> in the gold rush <UNK> <UNK> smith and judge roy bean the problem is that neither smith nor bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money stewart's herd interrupted a public hanging so as a penalty fine the herd is <UNK> to be sold later for <UNK> profit br br stewart is partner with ben walter brennan who oddly enough won his last oscar playing judge roy bean they are also joined by <UNK> morris jay c <UNK> and also meet two women the sophisticated <UNK> castle ruth roman and the friendly and helpful <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> works closely with gannon but had helped jeff earlier in fleeing the authorities in seattle however she has a similar i only trust myself attitude to jeff she does offer him <UNK> to get supplies for herself to dawson he ben and <UNK> go but at night while the others are asleep they go back and steal back their cattle <UNK> follows and warns them that gannon and his associates are following jeff holds off gannon long enough for the cattle herd to be brought over the canadian border although gannon points out that since jeff has to return by way of <UNK> gannon can wait until he does to hang him br br the reunited party of <UNK> and jeff split over the trail to take to dawson jeff <UNK> for a longer and <UNK> route after he is proved right they go by his route and reach dawson only to find there is a <UNK> element threatening the community due to the gold fields the herd is sold to <UNK> and jeff ben <UNK> and <UNK> start <UNK> there is soon two groups in the town of dawson one led by connie <UNK> and <UNK> johnson want to build a decent town but the <UNK> won't be setting up a station in dawson for months the other <UNK> around the <UNK> run by <UNK> are in <UNK> with gannon who has a vast claim jumping scheme using his gang of <UNK> robert j <UNK> really scary in one sequence with <UNK> johnson and jay c <UNK> jack <UNK> and harry morgan jeff wishes to steer clear of both and head with his new wealth and ben for a ranch they want in <UNK> but will they get there and will jeff remain neutral br br the performances are dandy here including stewart as a man who is willing to face all <UNK> but would otherwise be peaceful enough brennan is playing one of his <UNK> old <UNK> whose love of good coffee has unexpectedly bad results <UNK> is a drunk at first but tragedy and responsibility shake him into a better frame of mind and one who has a chance to <UNK> stab stewart in the heart using stewart's own words against him <UNK> would achieve stardom on television in <UNK> train replacing ward bond but his work in <UNK> films show his abilities as a villain such as his trade post <UNK> who <UNK> himself in winchester '73 he is as is said elsewhere on this thread really sleazy but he has a sense of humor roman is an interesting blend of <UNK> and human being whose fate is determined by her better feelings and <UNK> is both a voice of conscience and a frontier <UNK> aware that she is more than a young girl but a budding woman br br best of all is the canadian <UNK> background as wonderful in its way as the use of <UNK> valley by john ford mann certainly did a first rate job directing this film and the viewer will appreciate the results
<START> i didn't know it was possible to release a movie this bad the <UNK> sounded so promising but you would think that with a cast of 20 at least one of them would be able to act my wife left me and went to bed after the first 20 minutes she made a wise decision
<START> this film had a great cast going for it christopher lee dean jagger macdonald carey <UNK> <UNK> solid b movie actors all but this <UNK> of a movie didn't use any of them to any sort of advantage with none of their characters even meeting on screen though christopher lee does get to play opposite himself in several scenes br br the motivations for the aliens in this movie seem to change at the drop of a hat first they just want to <UNK> their ship and leave then they turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after he gets them the crucial part they need then out of nowhere this peaceful race decides they have to destroy the planet because it causes too many <UNK> though they do offer the main character and his wife a spot in their society br br most of the film is spent watching the man and wife drive or walk or stand around or sit at <UNK> doing nothing you almost wish they had gotten taken out with the rest of the planet at the end just in vengeance for boring us to death br br unless you really like chris lee or seventies low budget sci fi i'd give this one a miss it falls into that narrow range of wasted celluloid between star odyssey and <UNK> target earth
<START> this film is about a group of extra <UNK> gay black men <UNK> females on earth in order to create a gay universe br br i watched it with the intent of seeing how bad it was still i was shocked at how bad it was it looked more like a film made 50 years ago the acting if any is ultra bad the sets and props are so ridiculously fake making any college film look mega budget and the special effects are laughably simple indeed jaw dropping as others have commented but jaw <UNK> embarrassing br br one has to be severely <UNK> or in an altered state of consciousness in order to appreciate this film if i was from <UNK> i would be severely embarrassed and <UNK> that my <UNK> produced such a <UNK> bad film
<START> as perhaps one of the few <UNK> who did not read the book in high school i thought i would add my comments seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way <UNK> from the film the characters have so many <UNK> everyone can relate to them in their own way the brilliance of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own <UNK> onto the lives of the characters rather than being <UNK> fed an opinion you can love them or dislike them and still feel the emotional impact of the movie wonderful performances by ellen <UNK> and christine <UNK> really bring the characters to life i'd highly recommend it
<START> it seems that <UNK> couldn't decide what to do with this movie some of it is a very weak thriller and i say very very weak some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters both things have been tried in psychological thrillers but in this case the movie cannot hold things together due to poor superficial scripting bad acting and a too dark too dull cinematography i'd say that <UNK> gave his best in other genres and in other settings where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot on the whole a b movie hardly worth your money vote 4 10
<START> <UNK> i think it's hard to say it's hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion this movie is as <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> for a setting it has a few stone <UNK> some stone seats a couple stone crosses and some stone actors they have no emotion the only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is hamlet and hamlet is a <UNK> written piece of literature the dubbing really wasn't all that bad though the voices stuck true to the dull gloomy dreary life sucking atmosphere the movie gave forth i have seen this version of hamlet on the fabulous mystery science theater 3000 three times and each of the three times i was on the brink of turning off the tv despite it being <UNK> <UNK> br br not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better
<START> this movie is terrible the suspense is spent waiting for a point there isn't much of one br br aside from a few great lines i found a tooth in my apartment and the main characters dedication to killing himself it's a collection of supposedly eerie sounds br br
<START> i am going to keep this short this adaption of the wonderful king book is a bad joke and nothing more of course there are many kubrick and <UNK> fans in this site and as a result this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top 250 br br jack nicholson is laughable as <UNK> and so is shelley duvall the story that has nothing to do with the book is an incoherent mess and the characters of jack and wendy <UNK> are complete jokes br br my advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story stick to the tv series br br oh and the people who are saying that kubrick had every right to destroy the king story cause king is not a good writer should stick to reviewing masterpieces like eyes wide shut
<START> i absolutely adore the <UNK> <UNK> series but this weak offering by the troma people didn't make any sense and it had me <UNK> all the time br br a <UNK> nuclear plant and the growing <UNK> next to it makes the youngsters of <UNK> high go nuts which causes them to join a gang have sex explode and whatever also there's some sort of monster <UNK> in the high school my god this movie's a mess br br the actors pretty much stopped their efforts after this one and they should the intended overacting started to get on my nerves in about 5 minutes br br disappointing 2 10
<START> this was excellent touching action packed and perfect for kurt <UNK> i loved this movie it deserves more than 5 3 or so stars this movie is the story of an <UNK> soldier who learns there is more to life than <UNK> and people who learn that there is a time for fighting a need to defend i cried laughed and mostly sat in awe of this story good writing job for an action flick and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid the ending wasn't <UNK> but it was still excellent if you like escape from new york or rooting for the underdog this movie is for you not an <UNK> amount of gore or violence it was not difficult to watch in that respect something for everyone
<START> despite much style flash and <UNK> this french musical fails to speak the tunes are repetitive predictable and tedious the story is uninteresting as are the many characters br br people break into song and dance without motivation or reason most of the cast wears phony looking <UNK> and <UNK> and the sets look hopelessly studio bound br br to be honest this video of the restored version was stopped before the end so negative an effect it had on me certainly a shame to have such a multi talented cast in so feeble a final effort br br goes to show i guess where <UNK> in this case to the great classic <UNK> often do go awry one cannot <UNK> only recreate
<START> a lot of the comments people have made strike me as sorry missing the point <UNK> wants to present life simply ordinary life the <UNK> structured story where characters have insights that change their lives and then fade out music up and the film is over is absorbed into this much larger <UNK> several characters in this movie have just such <UNK> and then they move on sometimes they can hold onto their insights sometimes they can't and that's the way life really is in other words <UNK> <UNK> conventional dramatic structure in favor of an exploration of the the <UNK> of life  there is no happy ending only an eventual ending and everything before that is still in process still always up for grabs  and if you absolutely insist on a theme an exploration of the role of the <UNK> in our lives what is a miracle well life itself for a start then add in all the random incidents and cross connections that make up a life or several <UNK> lives and you have <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this theme lightly rather than <UNK> on it and <UNK> it in various ways most <UNK> by the device right in the center of the film of having mac and his wife lying in bed each dreaming their own dreams but as well showing later on in the film how those dreams have the power within the film to shape reality this is not a film with an easy or obvious message you just have to let it play out in front of you and then let it sit in your mind for a few days a month a few years and see what it has <UNK> there this is without a doubt <UNK> best film his most mature his most <UNK> a major <UNK> on life from one of our most gifted writers and directors the tragedy is of course that he has not been allowed to work for a number of years now mostly due to studio constraints around <UNK> hopefully we haven't heard the last from larry <UNK> a great film from a great artist keep in mind that art does not have to <UNK> itself completely in order to succeed
<START> <UNK> is no ordinary action flick it's much to bad to be ordinary one man walks toward another with a machine gun blazing the other man fires one round and <UNK> the man with the greater fire power without so much as a nick from the <UNK> of lead <UNK> down on him guess which one is the good guy duh such is <UNK> through and through not a good action flick not a good drama not a good movie <UNK> fails on all levels with it's cast of b movie veterans <UNK> going through the motions almost as though they know they're making a real loser not recommended for anyone br br
<START> i picked up <UNK> <UNK> from the library and brought it home we have considered taking a trip out east and thought it would give us a feel of what it was like the film was a total waste of time if i went out to buy it i would call it <UNK> <UNK> when i saw that it costs <UNK> br br the dvd ran for 8 minutes and showed a roller coaster ride across canada with my stomach feeling ill as they went up and down and around <UNK> with the film at high speed br br there was a lot of footage they probably shot on this and you would think that they could have made a better product if i would of done this project i would of provided more footage <UNK> on road signs to let people know where they were and <UNK> in places to view the scenery to make a film like this it should of been 60 to <UNK> oh yes the case said it was in <UNK> the whole film was a <UNK> sound from <UNK> up car sound <UNK> could of at least put some music to it br br if you want a good cross canada film watch the <UNK> national film board of canada starring buster keaton the one of the last film he made in this comical film buster keaton gets on to a <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> and travels to british columbia
<START> i saw this with few expectations and absolutely loved it bend it like beckham is a fairly typical coming of age movie about a fairly <UNK> girl this is <UNK> <UNK> er 's <UNK> role playing jess a teenager in england who is caught between her traditional indian family and her love of football that's soccer to us north americans and even though she's actually much older than her character she plays the role pitch perfect br br this is a movie about friendship specifically <UNK> friendship with jules <UNK> knightley her <UNK> who is also going through family issues especially with her mom who wears purple nail polish and little <UNK> on her shoes and who wants jules to be more feminine wear <UNK> underwear and <UNK> with boys and is terrified that playing sports means her daughter is a lesbian jules and jess both love playing the game and have issues trying to convince their families to let them go after their dreams they also unfortunately both love the same man joe their coach played by jonathan rhys meyers the love triangle causes some strain in their friendship br br in some spots bend it like beckham falls into clichés in others scenes drag on far too long and this movie probably could have <UNK> from overall <UNK> editing br br but this was a <UNK> fun film about growing up culture clash and the love of football it's about female <UNK> chasing your dreams and supporting your friends funny charming and fun bend it like beckham is the little film that could and did br br excellent 8 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> 1980 film 'the <UNK> man' is no classic but it's an above average low budget <UNK> that's worth a look the sequel <UNK> <UNK> man <UNK> is ultimately a waste of time but at the very least it's an entertaining one if not taken the least bit seriously now ii left the door open for another sequel and i for one wouldn't have minded seeing at least one more one day while i was <UNK> though the videos at a store in the mall i came across a film entitled <UNK> of the <UNK> man ' when i found out it was a sequel to the earlier films i was happy to shell out a few bucks for it i should have known better though the opening title is <UNK> man 3 ' this is no sequel to those two far superior films i named above well not totally anyway br br pros ha that's a laugh is there anything good about this hunk of cow dung let's see it has footage from 'the <UNK> man' and um it's mercifully short yeah that's about it br br cons where to start decisions decisions first of all this movie is a total bore it goes from one scene to the next without anything remotely interesting or scary happening the acting is stiff at best the actors are most likely friends of the director who had no acting experience whatsoever before and probably none since the plot is nonexistent and script <UNK> written the direction is just plain awful the director tries to make the film look all artsy <UNK> by making the camera move around lights <UNK> and with <UNK> but it adds nothing the music is dull and hard to hear in parts ties to the original are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> character was named <UNK> not natalie and the events depicted in the beginning of the original did not take place in 1978 also if this has a 3 in the title why is there no mention of what happened in ii finally this adds nothing new or interesting to either the series or the genre br br final thoughts the people behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of themselves it's one thing if that had been an original film that was the director's first and sucked but instead it's supposed to be a sequel to film that is no masterpiece but is damn sure far more interesting and entertaining than this if there ever is another sequel which i doubt it then it needs to forget this one ever happened and be handled either by <UNK> himself or someone who has at least some idea of how to make a decent horror film br br my rating 1 5
<START> a young cat tries to steal back his brothers soul from death but only gets half of it and then has to go <UNK> to get the other half or maybe not br br frankly i'm not sure what happens in this film which is full of very strange very surreal images some of which parents might find disturbing ie the cats <UNK> off part of a pig who is traveling with them and the <UNK> it like bacon which all three eat br br this is a very strange film that some have <UNK> to hello kitty on acid i think its more like hello kitty as done by <UNK> certainly this is more alive than <UNK> which was directly based on his work br br if your up for a very off beat film that will challenge your <UNK> of things then see this movie just be ready for some very strange images that will be burned into your memory forever br br
<START> after <UNK> 2 which i am still in denial about i thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad i was wrong i loved the original <UNK> however this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie the original <UNK> at least had some <UNK> that worked whoever wrote this movie knew nothing about computers except how to use a word <UNK> i doubt he or she even watched the original movie the acting isn't even convincing please save yourselves under no circumstances watch this movie i don't care if the channel is stuck on the tv and you can't turn the tv off this movie will ruin your life
<START> i had to do a search on the actresses to find the board of this film because the title is now an unexpected love it's not really worth looking for but i was unfamiliar with both leads and wondered why they were <UNK> a lesbian flick on lifetime <UNK> pretty restrained and you don't really get an idea of who these characters are so as a viewer i wasn't able to become emotionally invested in the storyline i guess i'm not the target audience for this but i'm not sure who is <UNK> muted and soft focus and earth tones <UNK> very interesting i had a <UNK> interest in seeing two women make out but it's handled so <UNK> that i was disappointed rent personal best instead
<START> the night <UNK> 2006 1 2 robin williams toni collette bobby <UNK> <UNK> culkin joe <UNK> sandra oh john <UNK> lisa <UNK> <UNK> ann baker <UNK> patrick <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> gives williams a stand out low key performance br br what is it about celebrities and fans what is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm br br in the latest <UNK> fan scenario based on true events no less williams stars as a talk radio personality named gabriel no one who reads stories he's penned over the <UNK> and has <UNK> an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named pete <UNK> culkin who has <UNK> a <UNK> about the <UNK> of his troubled youth to no one's editor <UNK> <UNK> who gives it to no one to read for himself br br no one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of pete being <UNK> and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named donna collette giving an excellent performance who has adopted the boy but her <UNK> with no one reveals that pete is dying from aids naturally no one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly <UNK> <UNK> motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess <UNK> whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in an emotional <UNK> that has only now grown into a <UNK> in a <UNK> when he decides to do some investigating into donna and <UNK> backgrounds discovering some truths that he didn't <UNK> br br written by <UNK> <UNK> who co wrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the film's <UNK> director <UNK> and based on a true story about a <UNK> <UNK> found out has some <UNK> moments that run on full <UNK> like any good old fashioned pot <UNK> does it helps that williams gives a stand out low key performance as the conflicted good hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him the one thing that has escaped his own reality and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical <UNK> i will leave <UNK> but <UNK> the desperation of her character that can <UNK> you to the core br br however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of <UNK> and mystery by <UNK> it pays to listen to your own inner voice be careful of what you hope for
<START> a cheap exploitation film about a mothers search for her daughter who has been kidnapped by people who make snuff porno films the trail leads the mother all over europe as she <UNK> for her child and we in the audience struggle to stay asleep br br this is one of the countless soft core sleaze films that are made for people who want the excitement of porno with out the <UNK> or danger of it showing up on their credit card bill personally i'd rather have the <UNK> since those films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we're seeing this is suppose to be a sexy thriller but its not mostly its people talking about things followed by lots of walking from place to place and lead to lead <UNK> through out the film various people get <UNK> and everything has more than a touch of s m to the proceedings the violence and fetish material is of the sort to <UNK> laughter rather than horror or even excitement its all so incredibly fake worse there is not even enough nudity to keep it interesting basically par for the course for many of these films br br you'll forgive my lack of details but it simply is a dull boring film that i stayed with to the end hoping for something remotely <UNK> to occur but there was nothing the most interesting thing was the blonde haired <UNK> with the huge over bite and nose the size of a <UNK> i watched her with morbid fascination wondering what she had looked like as a young girl and wondering whether she had had plastic surgery not the type of things you should be thinking about in a gripping thriller br br avoid
<START> i was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating when i checked it on imdb after seeing it this really is one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i have seen many bad movies it looks like a good movie in the beginning but when he comes into surgery i couldn't believe how bad it got this voice over destroys everything just imagine you are being cut open like that and then listen to what he says i saw the movie in german so i don't really know what he said in english but ironic stuff like yeah right it doesn't hurt what is this telling yourself think about something else and then forgetting your pain by just thinking about your girlfriend is just stupid and his mother how the hell does she figure something like that out someone comes to tell her her son died in surgery what she kind of had to expect plus she found some letters in jessica <UNK> bag plus that she knows the hospital stuff and then it takes her one second to figure it out what the hell and the ending why does the police bust them the patient died in surgery thats all that happened that drunk doctor doesn't know anything else either and then they bust them all even the girlfriend why despite all that i think christensen did a bad job but that doesn't really count for me those mistakes and stupid things i wrote about above are the problem i watched this movie with some friends and we all were very disappointed as i said one of the worst movies i have ever seen just don't watch it
<START> this is not one of those films it is one of the biggest pieces of tripe i have ever scene the camera work is trying to be flashy but it really just crap the whole thing looks like the red shoe <UNK> but without the sex the only reason i bought this was i wanted to try out dvd and this was the <UNK> one i could find possibly the worst buy of my life and could have put you off dvd forever the soundtrack is really tacky and most of the movie is made up of endless repeats of clips from the first two films why anyone would want to make a movie as awful as this is beyond me if they had really attempted to make an original movie and failed i would be <UNK> in this review but they don't they just got the rights to <UNK> stuff from the first two and then edit it and repeat it into this film with about maybe under 1 3rd original footage which is about up to the standards of film school students do not buy this movie the only entertainment this dvd can offer is if you were to stick it in the <UNK> and watch the flashing lights utter utter utter <UNK> unbelievable garbage 0 10 if only the voting system would allow that
<START> about a year ago i finally gave up on american television i thought of giving up television completely until a friend who had lived in england showed me some programs that included the office extras <UNK> and the league of gentlemen it was then that i decided to switch to british television among all the shows listed above the league of gentlemen is easily the most dark and twisted of them all providing guilty laughs and material not found in any other comedy i've seen yet characters included are the most <UNK> married couple a butcher that puts ingredients in the meat that go <UNK> probably for the best a deranged couple that look over a local shop that only <UNK> to local people and the worst <UNK> ever this program is one of the best i've seen
<START> comedy central has had success with original programming using professional comics the <UNK> show mind of <UNK> the daily show and the hugely popular <UNK> report all star professional comics and all are or in the case of <UNK> show were solid shows given that sarah silverman is one of the best female comics in the business i was expecting good stuff when i tuned in br br i was so disappointed br br there were some mildly funny sequences but given that the star is the caliber of silverman the show could have been much better it was just the pilot and hopefully next <UNK> show will be better if not get her some help in the form of better writers for the show
<START> i voted this a 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story i have been able to see in quite some time the animation is stunning the artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful from the colors to the lighting to the not standard fare of artistry i was amazed moving beyond the beauty on the screen you are immersed in a storyline that is at once timeless and at the same turn fresh character development is brief yet these <UNK> moments are exactly what is needed to clue the viewer in to what and why and how the character has come to where they stand i'm impressed with the entire affair and think this is a must see for the entire family
<START> you know you're in trouble when the opening narration basically tells you who survives it all goes downhill from there unnecessary matrix influenced bullet time camera work pointless cuts to video game footage <UNK> old sea <UNK> and wacky <UNK> <UNK> who become skilled <UNK> in the blink of an eye even the zombies are boring br br i was hoping for at least a so bad it's good zombie movie but this one is so bad those involved with its creation should be <UNK> from ever making a movie again br br
<START> this movie was made for fans of dani and cradle of filth i am not one of them i think he's just an <UNK> riding the black metal <UNK> still i'm generally not a fan of black metal but as i was carrying this dvd case to pay for it i convinced myself that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing thus i assumed i'm in for a roller coaster ride of rubber gore and do it yourself splatter with a sinister background now that is what i do like br br i got home and popped it in my patience lasted 15 minutes awful camera work and disgusting quality and that was then 2002 that it looked like it was shot using a <UNK> camcorder i left it on the shelf maybe a nice evening with beer and <UNK> would create a nice setting for this picture br br after a couple of months i got back to it in mentioned surroundings and saw half then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me my <UNK> evolved i noticed how funny dani 1 <UNK> <UNK> height looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a <UNK> apart yes ripping his head apparently had no skull i also found that this movie may have no sense still i haven't finished it yet so i wasn't positive br br after a couple more tries i finally managed to finish this flick a couple of months back yes it took me 5 5 years so dani in fact was funny as satan <UNK> super evil man's <UNK> and the movie did not make sense see our bad person employs dani to do bad things he delivers why well i guess he's just very very bad as a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much it br br we have a couple of short stories joined by <UNK> character my favourite was about a guy who steals someone's leg because he wants to use it as his own yeah exactly br br the <UNK> rock bottom the cgi is the worst ever i mean <UNK> beats it and boy is <UNK> cgi <UNK> the story has no sense and the quality is let's just say it is not satisfying the only thing that might keep you watching is the <UNK> violence and gore blood and guts are made pretty well why you can actually see that the movie <UNK> there and then moved on example dani 'the man' filth takes a stuffed cat fake as can be and guts it and then eats what fell out why we never know we do know however that this cat must have been on illegal <UNK> as his heart is almost half his size br br you might think after my comment that this movie is so bad it's good but it's just bad cradle of filth fans can add 3 points i added one for gore
<START> when i ordered this from <UNK> website i had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was who knows maybe i'd forgotten to take my add <UNK> that day i do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station <UNK> <UNK> in their late 70's style wide <UNK> bell <UNK> and <UNK> hair i knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the <UNK> br br the first <UNK> of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning trying to explain what <UNK> forces were at play to <UNK> havoc upon the universe forcing <UNK> and porno quality music on the would be viewer from the opening scene with the poorly done effects to the monsters from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as <UNK> painful as watching an <UNK> school production of 'the <UNK> <UNK> br br throughout the film the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear the ship was comprised <UNK> of what looked like old vcr and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path of course if moved slower than bob <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but it had menacing <UNK> thin <UNK> and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and <UNK> with a laser capable of cutting through mere <UNK> wood in an hour or two with some assistance br br moving on as the weirdness and bell <UNK> continue we found out that they're caught in a space time <UNK> how do we garner this little <UNK> of scientific information because the oldest male lead tells his son that in a more or less off the <UNK> fashion like <UNK> about <UNK> you won the big <UNK> over a cup of joe or an ice cold bottle of refreshing <UNK> <UNK> was pops a scientist nope but he knew about horses and has apparently <UNK> as an amateur in string theory and <UNK> theories br br the recording i watched on dvd was almost <UNK> quality the sound was <UNK> and the transfer looked like it had been shot off a theater screen with the video <UNK> on a cell phone other than that it was really really really bad there's not enough <UNK> to describe it really br br i know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics i never saw this film on its original release but even back then i think i would've come to the same conclusion bury this one quick
<START> i watched this movie after seeing it on broadway i love the broadway musical and i love the movie i watched the movie like it was not related to the broadway show i am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies so i developed a philosophy really early assume that the movie is going to be based on the book or musical in this case but that while the story line may be similar it will not be the same it will be different so watch it for what it is br br i <UNK> for 12 years before i had to make a choice i was a good dancer picking up chorus work in local productions as a child etc but i wasn't super talented i was however super talented as a show rider i was told by my dance <UNK> and my <UNK> who i spent several months a year at his farm out of state that i had to make a choice when i turned 14 that i needed to move up from dancing two hours four five days a week and riding 3 hours a day 7 days a week and <UNK> to one or the other so i <UNK> love dancing and i love this movie and a lot of the other ballet and dance movies i just chose to watch this movie for what it is it is a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction it is about the power of anticipation and <UNK> when you work really hard to get something you want and you just do not get it i love the movie i love the broadway musical
<START> well here's another terrific example of awkward 70's film making the <UNK> premise of what's the matter with helen is quite shocking and disturbing but it's presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion in the hands of any other movie crew this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale but with director curtis <UNK> whoever slew <UNK> <UNK> and scriptwriter henry farrell <UNK> charlotte in charge it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres the basic plot of the film is definitely horrific but there's a lot more to experience like love stories a swinging 1930's atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap dancing the setting is <UNK> what makes this movie so unique we're literally <UNK> back to the 1930's with a sublime depiction of that <UNK> music religion theatrical business and <UNK> following the long and <UNK> trial that sentenced their sons to life <UNK> for murder <UNK> debbie reynolds and helen shelley winters flee to california and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls particularly <UNK> <UNK> herself perfectly to the new environment as she falls in love with a local millionaire but poor old helen continues to sink in a <UNK> spiral of insanity and paranoia she only <UNK> to the <UNK> of a radio <UNK> fears that she will be <UNK> for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent <UNK> the script although not entirely without flaws is well written and the film is adequately paced there's never a dull moment in what's the matter with helen although the singing tap dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot but the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely <UNK> from the terrific acting performance of shelley winters she's downright scary as the unpredictable and <UNK> lady who's about to snap any second and especially during the last ten minutes or so she looks more <UNK> than all the freddy <UNK> jason <UNK> and michael <UNK> combined there are several terrific supportive characters who are sadly a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential like <UNK> <UNK> as the cocky <UNK> teacher <UNK> <UNK> as the creepy <UNK> and timothy carey as the <UNK> visitor to the <UNK> house there are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the grand <UNK> fanatics among us but particularly the set pieces and costume designs even nominated for an oscar are breathtaking
<START> this bomb is just one <UNK> after another with no humor and only absurd situations really <UNK> to the extreme reality is not one of its strong points i give it a 1 out of 10 i would have made it a zero but that option wasn't <UNK> sorry but <UNK> and sutherland deserve better roles but then at times we all need to have money and i still <UNK> at that tim burton farce about mars nicholson was brave enough to admit that was a turkey but if that was a turkey this movie then is not even a <UNK> i wish i could say give me back my money you can bet i would if i could but that is the trouble with <UNK> services the <UNK> variety
<START> everyone should totally see this movie it's freaking scary but doesn't resort to lame jump out at you just to surprise you and pass it off as scary things it really is great see this freaking awesome movie the director is stanley kubrick easily the greatest director who ever lived every single one of his movies are masterpieces including this one the shining is about this family that goes to a hotel in the <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> for the winters and get <UNK> in well the house is haunted the kid is psychic the husband is easily <UNK> by evil haunted <UNK> and well hilarity ensues not really it becomes this gripping thriller where stuff gets thrown at the viewer from all different directions and it gets scary not just the classic here's johnny scene it's memorable but can't speak for the whole movies it's one of those things where words don't explain it adequately and you just gotta see it so go on netflix and get it <UNK> <UNK>
<START> well then thank you so much disney for destroying the fond memories i used to have of my former favorite movie i was about 5 when the original movie came out and it was one of the first movies i remember seeing so now that i'm 16 and feeling <UNK> enough i decided to rent this movie thus i managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with this sorry excuse for a movie this movie takes everything that made the original endearing and <UNK> it right down to the last detail br br in this movie ariel and eric celebrate the birth of their daughter melody and go to show her to everyone in the ocean broadway style after the musical number ends within minutes the sea witch morgana shows up and threatens to kill melody if <UNK> doesn't give up the <UNK> thus he gives it up without even a fight eric stands there <UNK> though ariel figures out how to use a sword and save melody morgana escapes so ariel and eric decide that melody should never go near the sea until morgana is caught br br well uh nothing of note really happens eric is a total <UNK> he never really manages to do anything ariel sort of does something melody manages to screw things up plus the animation is a new low point for disney the computer graphics wind up <UNK> with the backgrounds ever single opportunity for character development is wasted the songs bite br br look don't waste your time i'm pretty sure even the little kids are going to be bored out of their <UNK> with this since nothing even remotely exciting ever happens they won't want to sing the songs if you manage to grab a copy of this throw it out into the ocean and hope that nobody ever finds it ever
<START> i would have liked to write about the story but there wasn't any i would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but <UNK> is only funny for like 5 minutes after that its <UNK> i would have liked to <UNK> over the <UNK> u guessing <UNK> but it was as predictable as um <UNK> a <UNK> raj movie i would have liked to talk of the edge of the seat action but i don't like cartoons much br br sigh br br all in all this movie is perfect for 1 people attempting suicide i promise it'll push you over the edge 2 <UNK> <UNK> this movie is way more effective than the <UNK> wire that <UNK> guy in the da <UNK> code wore 3 people <UNK> alternative ways to spread terrorism i swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone 4 movie <UNK> more power to them if any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch this is it 5 <UNK> most types of <UNK> green <UNK> because almost all other living things would require an iq factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers <UNK> the director of the movie obviously is a species of his own and i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind one is enough br br things that could have made this a better movie 1 a story 2 a choreographer 3 a screenplay writer 4 a stunt <UNK> 5 a story did i already say that 6 a director preferably one who is not mentally challenged although even one who was challenged could have done a better job 7 anil kapoor <UNK> plague avoid at all costs 8 a <UNK> warning watching <UNK> raj movies is <UNK> to your mental health br br things i liked about the movie 1 kareena kapoor for obvious reasons 2 the english sub titles <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> becomes my heart is in a void <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> turns into im a <UNK> im a lover im a <UNK> priceless br br in short tashan to me is like the opposite of a <UNK> cube the cube is supposed to increase the iq of the player tashan promises to lower your iq and that in a mere 2 5 hours <UNK> br br sigh but thats just me i could be wrong you've been warned anyways
<START> this is a very beautiful and almost <UNK> film there is hardly any dialogue in it apart from the narration and the scenery and music compliment each other perfectly i didn't at first connect the red hair of the girl and the fox until it was pointed out to me by a friend who also has red hair it is almost an old fashioned type of children's films saying that children nowadays prefer animations like shrek or toy story etc but i feel that young people should be introduced more to the beauty and wonder of nature which this film certainly does maybe not the best ever film of its type but certainly an excellent and relaxing view for all ages not just children
<START> i fell in love with emily watson in breaking the waves then grew even more fascinated by her range and <UNK> in <UNK> and jackie now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who <UNK> <UNK> and convention in favor of <UNK> the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of <UNK> her eyes are the mirror to his soul and what gentle and beautiful eyes they are br br those who take things literally will find <UNK> <UNK> poetic and <UNK> direction quite frustrating <UNK> who are willing to go with the amazing <UNK> energy is this filmed <UNK> poem will be well rewarded
<START> i actually saw china o'brien ii before i ever saw the original china o'brien and i have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse but worse funnier and funnier better if you're a bad movie fan like i am this is great material if however you are looking for any sort of meaningful plot acting ability or movie making skill this is best avoided the best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequences in <UNK> fast forward hilariously bad see it for a laugh see it for mindless entertainment but whatever you do see it for free on tv
<START> yes <UNK> is a light hearted and enjoyable movie comedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music it's not my favorite movie but it is a movie i have enjoyed seeing more than once some reviewers suggested if one wished to enjoy pavarotti they would likely be better served by picking up an opera dvd although a full opera might be a better representation of <UNK> operatic talents <UNK> an opera requires costumes and has story lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person yes <UNK> <UNK> pavarotti to use his speaking voice and to exhibit a personality and character in ways an opera would not br br many reviewers seemed to find the story unbelievable i don't agree enormously talented people can be both self centered and charming charming enough to <UNK> intelligent and beautiful people additionally people who are very different from one other often gain insights about themselves and grow in positive ways from <UNK> with people who stretch them or take them in directions they might not have chosen on their own both <UNK> and pamela become more open to <UNK> parts of themselves in relationship with the other br br relax and let yourself go into a visually and <UNK> rewarding film with pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities the ending scenes from <UNK> <UNK> alone are worth the time to get there
<START> this film is fantastic as it explores storytelling and fantasy in the way a child would for adults the idea of a child's drawings becoming a place she can physically visit and have influence over is wonderful at the same time you could get all child psychologist about it and say she's really exploring her <UNK> just as we all do in our dreams when we sleep the bit that gives me <UNK> <UNK> is when her dad is in the paper house and chases her the only thing i can't stand is that it was <UNK> as a horror film it really isn't if you want to see something british with plenty of storyline which keeps you guessing without the usual cheap thrills most films have to use then watch paperhouse
<START> broadway and film actor turned director john cassavetes from rosemary's baby creates a masterpiece with this 1977 film it stars gena rowlands john cassavetes himself ben <UNK> joan blondell paul stewart <UNK> <UNK> laura johnson and there is a cameo by peter falk the premise of the film an aging stage and film actress gena rowlands re <UNK> her life after an <UNK> fan dies in a car accident trying to get her <UNK> the movie has a slow pace and a dark moody frightening quality it has a 60's cinematic look and it even reminded me of <UNK> rosemary's baby without the supernatural horror the fears here are the ones every successful actress has she is getting old and she will become useless in her career furthermore she feels she has lived a life that lacks any true <UNK> humanity and merit she has lived only for her career she has no children doesn't do <UNK> deeds etc the <UNK> <UNK> of her personality is the meat of this film she is falling apart she's in a crisis gena rowlands really gets into the character's tormented psyche and acts the part quite well she is a terrific actress and this 70's film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the period and or the disaster movies or adventure thrillers it's a movie with lots of deep <UNK> emotion but has a cold cynical feeling as if cassavetes is <UNK> the mainstream movies and actors of the 70's generation either that or this movie is a product of the 70's which was itself cynical in many aspects <UNK> deception <UNK> vietnam etc although the production values are not great and this film is not well known it's a very haunting film with haunting <UNK> kudos to the underrated and late director cassavetes who died in the late 80's
<START> the character acting is a little stiff as if it is the first time man of the actors have appeared on screen unfortunately one of the better actresses jean simmons played many bit roles on tv like in star trek <UNK> and in the heat of the night dies quickly and thereafter her acting can be <UNK> missed br br the lead role is mr <UNK> as portrayed by cliff robertson cliff is forced to carry this movie with his body language for most of the time he doesn't do a poor job but it is a little <UNK> to ask of an actor to plug the <UNK> of blank screen time during which the characters spend their time not talking and also not acting <UNK> most memorable role may have been ben parker in the last 3 spider man movies starring <UNK> maguire br br the plot is predictable a husband murders his rich wife for her money thereafter the wife seems to comeback and haunt the husband driving him insane until he leaps from a high window <UNK> the <UNK> of his dead wife approaching him on the day he is predicted to die no less br br the second <UNK> mr <UNK> hires looks a lot like an english mark <UNK> uncanny really the only thing that stands out is the utter disregard for dialogue many minutes pass in <UNK> no one speaks and few act it is a shame the mst3k guys never got hold of this movie it could have been much better if not just as predictable with more dialogue or shorter scenes of <UNK> br br i kept expecting <UNK> red eyes to appear from the shadows and <UNK> that he works for the nothing that <UNK> this film
<START> part of what was so great about the classic looney tunes cartoons was their <UNK> and how they weren't afraid to do anything that they wanted in this case marvin the martian has an assignment to bring back an <UNK> sure enough he comes across bugs bunny who warns of a <UNK> on the part of <UNK> dog after marvin finally traps bugs by means of an <UNK> <UNK> jacket <UNK> <UNK> bugs has more stuff planned for the voyage back to mars what i mean is if you thought that it was a major change in the <UNK> system when they stripped <UNK> of its planet status then you ain't seen nothing yet yes the <UNK> <UNK> goes all out how they buy <UNK> products in outer space is probably beyond most people but the point here i mean <UNK> is to have fun and believe me you definitely will after all a little space out never hurt anyone
<START> this movie should not <UNK> as cinema although it is over 10 years old now it should never ever have gotten funding and is a <UNK> on the australian film industry which is now producing such brilliant films as the dish br br the actors cannot act the music is to be blunt not music the storyline is completely nonexistent and is a struggle to sit through br br do not watch this film it is a complete waste of your time
<START> the directors cut version which was the one i saw was very long for this type of movie almost two hours is way too long if you have the choice definitely go for the non directors cut br br the main plot is almost not taken up at all the movie consists to the main part of several murder scenes which are connected but the feeling is that they're only shown in order to fill the movie with <UNK> violence the connection is not revealed until the latter part and the lack of context bored me out long before i was there br br as a horror movie it doesn't work you never get the required feel for the characters due to mediocre acting and the general <UNK> character is presented 15 minutes later character is dead this pictures strong side lies in the splatter part
<START> easily one of the ten best movies of the 20th century in cold blood is brilliant in the simplicity and realism of its storytelling and absolutely riveting br br robert blake walks away with the film the story seems to be presented almost entirely from <UNK> viewpoint despite dick being the leader and <UNK> of the pair the viewer will <UNK> perceive dick as being more unstable immature and generally feel like perry would not have been pulled into this nightmare but for dick and his need to be somebody and pull off a big score br br based on a true story with particular attention to accuracy in cold blood depicts the story behind the brutal and senseless murder of a rural kansas family one cold <UNK> night because dick has bought into an age old rural myth about <UNK> <UNK> having a safe full of cash in their home as <UNK> a character that isn't given a name in the script played by will <UNK> so <UNK> points out their lives are bought for only 10 a head director richard brooks wisely chooses not to share with us the gruesome details of the murders until the end of the film prior to this we only know it has happened and watch the lives of dick and perry slowly unravel as they attempt to escape not only being <UNK> by law <UNK> but also <UNK> own ever <UNK> sense of impending doom he repeatedly makes remarks no one ever gets away with a thing like that and i can't help thinking we left something behind that belongs to us dick is neither mature nor moral enough to feel any compelling sense of guilt over their crime only <UNK> at <UNK> indeed after they are caught it is dick who breaks first and suddenly <UNK> when finally confronted with <UNK> proof that places the two men at the scene of the crime i felt somewhat sorry for perry from the very beginning of the film and more so as events progressed but i only <UNK> dick br br the genius of the film is the engaging manner in which the story is played we do not for a moment think we are watching actors portray characters but that we are watching the actual participants and events as they occurred the story is <UNK> <UNK> the run time slightly in excess of two hours feels more like just a few minutes br br for those of you who are interested in such things i noticed a couple of the goofs listed here on the imdb page for in cold blood are incorrect or exaggerated such as the <UNK> process shot at the beginning of the film as dick and perry are driving across the bridge into kansas to begin with this isn't even a process shot the camera is actually <UNK> in the <UNK> and the image you see beyond the <UNK> of the car is real a large <UNK> truck located to the left front of <UNK> <UNK> creates the <UNK> illusion that they are going <UNK> because it is traveling at a greater rate of speed but closer examination will reveal that they are indeed going forward and it is an actual shot filmed from a moving vehicle br br as i previously stated this is one of the ten best works of 20th century cinema not recommended for the very young due to some course language and implied and <UNK> violence no actual in your face gore as a modern film would resort to but a thoroughly excellent film
<START> just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water br br another computer generated mutant croc on the <UNK> for human <UNK> let loose by another one of those <UNK> <UNK> mad science <UNK> <UNK> company is <UNK> around with growth <UNK> research accidentally releasing a baby crocodile which is <UNK> at an <UNK> rate br br b movie cast add a deal of fun to this run of the mill genetic mistake monster movie <UNK> <UNK> evokes mick <UNK> aussie accent hat big ass knife the works as a croc <UNK> hired by <UNK> executive joanna <UNK> wasted in the stereotypical role of corrupt <UNK> executive who <UNK> any involvement with the gigantic beast her facility let free on innocent people charles <UNK> is the local sheriff whose town is in danger and jane <UNK> is his hot daughter who works at the animal shelter soap opera star matthew <UNK> is <UNK> love interest a local artist who <UNK> <UNK> his brother is a victim of the croc of course this skill will come in mighty handy when our heroes set up a created trap for the croc hoping to poison it with <UNK> <UNK> br br the croc itself is never the least bit convincing as it <UNK> through a <UNK> looking for food the special effects of a low grade variety in regards to roger corman productions dealing with <UNK> <UNK> monsters i stick with <UNK> the monster here is essentially a crocodile standing on it's <UNK> legs often <UNK> as it <UNK> potential victims i felt <UNK> and the filmmakers were <UNK> crocodile <UNK> with his croc hunter and this imitation might <UNK> where the monster itself fails <UNK> and <UNK> actually have pretty good chemistry together on screen as expected <UNK> gets her <UNK> in hilarious fashion <UNK>
<START> every child experiences trauma growing up and every child's active imagination has gotten the best of them but for jake anthony de <UNK>  of the <UNK> clint eastwood film <UNK> who resembles henry thomas circa 1982 the combination may prove deadly br br a lonely six year old whose imagination kicks into high gear when he is <UNK> to learn his <UNK> parents peter sean <UNK> late of <UNK> and jules brooke bloom cbs miami suddenly decide to divorce leaving him to his own devices and <UNK> a new tenant  a zombie in his closet br br jake actually gets this seed planted while playing with neighborhood friend dillon matthew <UNK> who provides him with a print out off the internet of <UNK> re zombies jake is so convinced that one is out to get him  and his family  he begins to <UNK> a plan of action to protect them before it's too late br br indie newcomer <UNK> ryan  who wrote and directed  <UNK> domestic drama with <UNK> of horror but the former <UNK> <UNK> the latter with a decent story <UNK> by fine acting de <UNK> is the rare breed of child actor where he is a child and not <UNK> all his nuances are very evident of the awkward shy <UNK> child that many can relate too i certainly can <UNK> makes his cheating husband <UNK> in the realization he really loves his son while bloom has the more difficult job of building sympathy as the somewhat <UNK> mother who is quick to emotions over <UNK>  it doesn't help when <UNK> mother ruth <UNK> <UNK> who resembles laura dern is constantly feeding her implied information driving a <UNK> between jake and his dad <UNK> also has a tough task to make her manipulative character relatively likable but she proves to in a revealing scene that i won't go into detail but shows why she is the way she is and more importantly how she has also affected her own child br br the <UNK> <UNK> camera is also well employed many angles shown form <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> level or somewhat <UNK> i e the upside down shot of peter carrying his son in the same position while having some fun in the backyard and the editing is relatively flawless br br ryan based the screenplay on personal experiences growing up and also witnessing first hand account of a friend going through the same situation and how the affects of adult relationships can be <UNK> if <UNK> their fears anger and stress onto their children here the film is very successful in getting its theme across br br however the horror <UNK> are a little disjointed to say the least but the homage to george a romero's zombie films are shown lovingly by ryan <UNK> mom is asleep in front of the tv as night of the living dead <UNK> causing his own belief of the undead to be in their home the metaphor of a monster acting as surrogate to domestic abuse may be a bit heavy handed but again the child's fear of a thing under his bed is universal
<START> this is an attempt by both author edgar rice <UNK> and filmmakers at an <UNK> tarzan of the apes but this desert set film shows none of the <UNK> present in <UNK> more successful jungle adventure the focus is on the love between handsome english noble jon hall as el <UNK> <UNK> and exotic arab beauty kathleen burke as princess <UNK> with revenge happening to <UNK> with their urge to <UNK> the opening states that although guilty of conduct <UNK> the <UNK> mother is living but she never re enters the picture unfortunately the lion man has <UNK> and is looks like it's missing footage br br the lion man 1936 john p mccarthy jon hall kathleen burke ted adams
<START> whoever gave this movie rave reviews needs to see more movies br br a loser takes his camera and photographs his mental family the movie is filled with idiots and includes live <UNK> that should sum it all up for you br br do not waste your time you may want to watch the entire movie in the hopes that it gets better as it goes on it doesn't
<START> what an incredible fall for sean <UNK> br br you gather a bunch of your friends at home all hyped about the follow up work of sean <UNK> you have an vague idea of the plot no spoilers that could kill the fun very high expectations br br it is late at night perfect atmosphere for a movie of this type br br <UNK> passes and you start telling yourself it is bound to pick up at <UNK> you start wondering if you should just go to sleep and save this for another time when you can fully appreciate the expected not existent subtle touches over the half hour mark you realize half of your your hyped up audience is already asleep and call it a day br br a few days later when you <UNK> all other material to watch you go back to this in the middle of the day this time hoping your mood will keep you awake this time 10 minutes later you find yourself <UNK> the unbelievably and needlessly long <UNK> transitions and images any other stuff i would have given up already but there is <UNK> and its legacy but that legacy can only carry you so long this is a new level of boring movie making imagine a short story extended to a novel with just <UNK> this is what it is br br decent cast is wasted there is no cinematography that leaves you in awe like <UNK> either there are films that annoy you there are films that lack certain aspects or just cheesy unfortunately this is just a waste of time br br final words stay away
<START> <UNK> i was quite surprised that someone actually gave this film high marks br br lets face it <UNK> spelling is not a great actress and this movie just proves the extent of her talent the movie's plot was weak i bet the <UNK> that came up with this concept was some perverted <UNK> tom if there is a good thing about this movie i would say it's that tommy <UNK> daughter just for the fact that she's his daughter and then there is that soap opera ish male lead who's decent good looks somewhat make him attractive but <UNK> to help his dramatic abilities why does imdb require at least 10 lines how many more ways can you simply say this movie sucks
<START> this movie is an idiotic attempt at some kind of action thriller a tour bus on its way to las vegas is attacked by a group of white trash <UNK> driving <UNK> <UNK> they drive them out into the desert and then steal all of their <UNK> the plot changes constantly one minute they are looking to kidnap a rich <UNK> daughter the next they are looking for a <UNK> <UNK> worth 90 000 dollars the dialogue is horrible br br please don't watch this movie
<START> there are a lot of pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is <UNK> with some kind of beautiful meaning and that ignorant fools like me don't <UNK> it obviously this means that we should stick to hollywood <UNK> br br it has every a <UNK> artistic cliché in the book i guess it is good that the director is one of the chosen few almost a self parody drowning in its own <UNK> br br the director of the almost equally embarrassing movie <UNK> returns with another piece <UNK> in artistic nonsense it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation the best way to describe this film is <UNK> for its viewers
<START> <UNK> yes it is heartwarming and all that some unlucky family gets adopted by abc <UNK> and has their home <UNK> that's where the <UNK> appeal ends i liked it early in its run but now this show has become <UNK> excessive br br ten <UNK> families could be given relatively <UNK> homes with lots of <UNK> for every one family that each episode of this show <UNK> on the people at <UNK> for humanity must be shaking their heads in disbelief for example is it necessary for a healthy sixteen year old boy to have a <UNK> in his bedroom or have his bed tricked out with low rider <UNK> does the mom really need her <UNK> non running and <UNK> out old pick up truck restored and <UNK> by some of the best <UNK> in california a new one would have done the job quite nicely and probably for a third of the price do people really need a sixty five inch <UNK> screen in every room of the house and then there's the issue of who pays the <UNK> property <UNK> and <UNK> bills even after the <UNK> at <UNK> leave somebody still has earn a living i doubt the friendly folks down at social services will see the humor in all of this <UNK> br br this show is nothing more than a ratings <UNK> for abc and a <UNK> commercial for its <UNK>
<START> i'm 14 so you probably would think i have never heard of george burns or walter matthau or anyone like that boy are you wrong i had heard that george burns was in this movie and that he won an academy award for it i have been a fan of george burns since i was ten i saw the movie oh god recently and loved it this one was also very awesome george burns did a great job so did walter matthau this is the first time i've ever seen him perform and even though they had really small roles <UNK> <UNK> and steve allen did a good job that special they were filming would have been awesome if it was really done let me say this if you are a fan of george burns or walter matthau you should see this movie right away
<START> how can you resist watching a film with some swing it's a delightful little film full of wonderful actors and a wonderful story line too bad they don't tour out here i'd go see them see it if for no other reason than to hear some good music
<START> hobgoblins what a concept rick <UNK> was a master with this film he had the brilliance to produce a film with actors that couldn't act on top of that he chose to write a script based on some sort of bad acid trip gone <UNK> wrong put it together you end up with a film that sucks more than a warehouse filled with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> this movie was very painful the pain it caused is about equal to the pain caused by having your <UNK> <UNK> out with a <UNK> and then having the entire wound covered with salt and <UNK> acid
<START> gino <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a young and handsome drifter who arrives in a road bar he meets the young beautiful and <UNK> wife giovanna <UNK> clara <UNK> and her old and fat husband <UNK> <UNK> juan de <UNK> owners of the bar he <UNK> his mechanical skills by some food and <UNK> and has an affair with giovanna they both decide to kill <UNK> <UNK> a car accident the relationship of them become affect by the feeling of guilty and the investigation of the police this masterpiece ends in a tragic way the noir and neo realistic movie of <UNK> visconti is outstanding this is the first time that i watch this version of the <UNK> always rings <UNK> i loved the 1946 version with <UNK> turner and the 1981 version where jack nicholson and jessica lange have one of the <UNK> sex scene in the history of the cinema but this one is certainly the best my vote is ten
<START> i have walked out of very few movies before they end but i couldn't finish this piece of garbage this was the biggest load of racism trying to pass as legitimate film since birth of a nation the characters were little more than cardboard <UNK> i don't see how any actor would want their name associated with this film lee must have better things to do that put out garbage like this i know that i and anyone with a brain have better things to do like watching paint dry i wish that someone would make a film about <UNK> relationships that dealt with the topic realistically there is a lot more depth to this subject the shallow <UNK> of a bitter director like lee
<START> <UNK> <UNK> gained tons of fame playing the wonderful character zatoichi the zatoichi films had a weird and unbelievable concept a blind guy is the greatest <UNK> in japan and spends each movie <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> on evil <UNK> he's a heck of a nice guy and the films are exciting and <UNK> i've actually seen every movie it is because of this i saw this final installment of the hanzo the razor series as i assumed it would be very similar and boy was i wrong it turns out that the hanzo films are extremely sexual in nature and they also promote the rape of women who deserve it you see hanzo is a policeman from the <UNK> period and he regularly takes evil women into custody and <UNK> them by violently <UNK> them with his penis of steel how he made his member so strong is something you have to see to believe but it certainly is not for the <UNK> br br overall i just can't recommend anyone sees these violent and misogynistic films however from looking at the other reviews i can see that they are still very popular and that is pretty scary despite some decent acting and amazing fight scenes the films just are like brain <UNK> and i'd hate to imagine how the films might have contributed to violence towards women
<START> just saw this exquisite 1982 movie return of the soldier based on rebecca <UNK> novel its about a shell shocked <UNK> captain who doesn't even tell his wife he has returned to british <UNK> but remains in a hospital in london he's lost his memory and is a boy again with a lingering <UNK> for the lower class sweetheart he pursued 25 years earlier its a delicate story he is lingering in his <UNK> while the reader discovers his wife is an unbearable aspiring <UNK> who wants him to resume his place in society living with them is his cousin jenny who loved chris <UNK> the soldier when they were growing up as <UNK> but has settled into <UNK> the lower class woman played by glenda jackson is margaret gray it is she who is <UNK> that chris is back in england <UNK> wife kitty is shocked when mrs gray comes to tell her that chris is in a hospital in london kitty julie christie is vacuous and <UNK> why she asks herself was this other woman sent a <UNK> about chris rather than her chris has forgotten totally about kitty he wants to <UNK> his relationship with margaret the now married margaret is reluctant to meet him but then does and continues to meet with him there is a psychiatrist ian <UNK> who warns kitty and jenny that <UNK> temporary happiness with margaret will disappear if he <UNK> him jenny realizes how empty kitty is for chris and forms a secret loving alliance through margaret they both are in love with him jenny wants to help late in the film kitty reveals that chris and she had a boy who died five years ago telling chris this <UNK> the shrink will certainly <UNK> him to <UNK> ' but is this a good idea chris barely aware that he and kitty were ever married is unaware of his child and the child's death the psychiatrist just learning of the child believes such knowledge will <UNK> chris jenny and margaret have chris all to themselves because kitty believes he is <UNK> and refuses to accept <UNK> illness in <UNK> to his youth in his forties the film leaves her mostly out of consideration concerning whats to be done with chris br br but jenny and margaret in the child's perfectly <UNK> bedroom with kitty too in the novel but not in the screenplay discuss what they believe should be done about chris from their separate perspectives margaret is the critical one here because though married she has half fallen in love with chris again <UNK> social stature jenny believes will be threatened if chris does not right himself she does not reveal this to margaret however margaret decides looking ahead that chris cannot maintain his fantasy over time but must return to something like a real life while kitty and jenny look on from the window of the house margaret approaches chris outside and tells him of his lost son the <UNK> war <UNK> head sinks his shoulders <UNK> he looks away he walks <UNK> toward the house <UNK> br br i read some criticism of this first novel of rebecca west the novel was written something after the first war the movie is never quite clear who jenny is his cousin or his sister it would be more rousing if she were his sister of course the criticism doesn't make it clear either i'm sure west in her novel makes sure jenny is her cousin not her sister west is no henry miller nor an <UNK> <UNK> whose book incest about her relationship with her father as an adult to get even with him for <UNK> her as a child i considered reading but then decided against rebecca the author has a need to <UNK> chris too she too has <UNK> in her head for the society her novel <UNK> first but finally <UNK> once more
<START> creep is a new horror film that without a doubt will please many genre fans simply because it's so down to the point and <UNK> it has many genuine shock moments a whole lot of repulsive gore sequences and a rare claustrophobic tension what it hasn't got is logic and a solid plot but to tell you the truth that didn't bother me for one second when the end credits start to roll there are still many unanswered questions to <UNK> on but director writer christopher smith in his debut <UNK> preferred to fully focus on tension and <UNK> <UNK> action instead of long <UNK> speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the creep in the london subway the story revolves on the young and <UNK> kate who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous actor george clooney who's in town to present his new film she falls asleep in the subway misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network things really get terrifying when she encounters a mad raving lunatic who lives in the old <UNK> and kills kidnaps people to experiment upon even experienced homeless people security guards or <UNK> workers can't rescue her from this <UNK> monster i really <UNK> the creep character he's nauseating hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating christopher smith only leaves us clues and hints and it's merely up to the viewer to guess this vile <UNK> origin and background i <UNK> this isn't very original and i'm sure many people won't appreciate the lack of content but i forgive smith and i think it's better this way than going over the top completely <UNK> <UNK> style that particular film started out great as well but as soon as the <UNK> identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort the obvious aspect to love is the outrageous gore there's some severe <UNK> going on in this film and the make up as well as the sound effects are very convincing the ominous setting of the abandoned london subway during night is effectively used there also is some acting talent present in this film with <UNK> <UNK> run lola run returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool german film <UNK> creep is terrific entertainment when you're in an <UNK> mood and christopher smith definitely is a director i'll keep an eye on make sure you don't have to take the subway right after watching this film
<START> the symbolic use of objects form editing the position of characters in the scene these were all used with such <UNK> abandon by hitchcock that you can really see what a <UNK> genius he had the way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken even the title has a least four meanings that i can see the boxing ring the wedding ring the <UNK> the lover buys and the love triangle at the heart of the story
<START> sorry my fellow <UNK> city neighbors but this one is bad br br brian must have had too much <UNK> because he had very little facial expressions through out the entire movie br br alice looked like she had a board <UNK> to her <UNK> she was stiff throughout the movie br br i looked up both alice and brian and was surprised to see the extensive bio of work i would have guessed that they were first year students br br ed <UNK> and peter jason carried the movie frankly with their banter and ease with every line ed certainly has not lost his charisma i wish i'd taken the time to meet him while he was here br br i love the snow scenes and scenes of stores and the church because i've been there i make <UNK> city my home and was <UNK> awaiting the premiere i was sadly disappointed br br sorry
<START> with this movie it's all about style atmosphere and acting true i didn't believe all of the plot developments but it didn't matter the terrific acting the unexpected plot twists and the wonderful atmosphere sucked me right in and carried me along for the ride and i had a great time kenneth branagh is not only a great actor but a master of accents and he proves it once again with a flawless georgia accent he's surrounded by so much talent in supporting roles robert downey jr <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> list and fallen tom berenger <UNK> hannah and robert duvall that i was simply blown away i recently bought a copy of this movie and i never tire of watching it simply one of the best thrillers of the year if you've ignored this movie and chances are you have then i suggest you check it out
<START> the 1998 michael keaton kiddie comedy of the same title was <UNK> condemned for it's um shoddy special effects but compared to what screaming mad george <UNK> up for this horror comedy they're positively mind <UNK> the killer snowman seems to be made out of <UNK> and his arms look like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which they probably were the cast lays it on thick in this parody of dozens of other much worse movies and paul keith as the town doctor is particularly memorable in a small but hilarious role
<START> the only reason i even watched this was because i found it at my local library and will <UNK> them mercilessly for having wasted public <UNK> on it and despite the <UNK> of tits and ass it didn't take long to realize that the fast forward button was my friend terrible direction pedestrian camera work <UNK> bad to nearly passable acting <UNK> effects and one of the worst screenplays i've had the <UNK> of seeing brought to life such as it was horribly crippled and <UNK> in a long long time best laughs actually come from the making of <UNK> in which the poor <UNK> involved with this <UNK> mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special instead of something that won't be utterly forgotten next week wait except for the fact that somehow someone <UNK> <UNK> the birds <UNK> of all people into doing a bit part along with kane friday the 13th <UNK> how this came to pass i'll never know and to be honest i don't really care watch at your own risk and don't say you haven't been warned this is film making at its pretentious craven worst it only gets a 2 from me for having some good looking naked women and even then just barely
<START> i am from sweden and i have just seen this movie and the thing is that i thought it was okay i have seen many bad comments about it but you must remember that a lot of people that watch this two parts miniseries are located all over the world and not just in usa also remember that not everyone has ever heard of the film made in the 60 s and maybe not in the events murders and even more that it can be hard to find the original movie and if so there always be people around that doesn't like black white films this one feels fresh and in color and will find its public its 12 years old now but i just saw it for the first time i will try to find the first one if i can to compare them but i haven't seen it anywhere in sweden <UNK> there is internet but not for anyone in the world the thing here is that this is mostly part of an american crime history and was big in the 50 60 s in just usa but in rest of the world it just past by i guess well it was told about for some time but 40 years later it will fade away in for example europa cause time goes by we had our own problems and crimes so if someone will do a remake of the film and put it back in some light again its not a bad idea at all a new generation can take part of this horrible story and even the film about capote that was released just a few years ago witch was a pretty good film too i think it will boost interest to the events that took place some 50 years ago and maybe stop it to fall in sleep it started me up and now i am looking for the robert blake version so it wasn't that bad huh this are my opinions some people will of course disagree but hey its okay sometimes there will be okay with remakes on old films its not every time the old ones are that good the film making techniques has developed a lot and scenes can be made more realistic if they want today its always a question of money of course there has been so many movies that were made in the good old days but there were also money missing bad directors etc and they remakes them today 50 years later and suddenly they are okay to watch my friend got this box of old classic horror movies and s f and i cant say i was impressed of the so called good old days most of them you cold put in the <UNK> directly they were so bad that we just sat there like zombies could not move like brain dead i cant recommend them to anyone some of them i have seen remakes of and i remember liking them but not the originals they were just painful awful this is like the old story of who was the best bond moore or connery i think if you see roger moore first you maybe find him the one to trust or like thanks for me and i am sorry for my english thats not so good lars from sweden
<START> this film seems to be completely pointless there is no reason why anything that happens in it happens as if it was written by a small child who got bored halfway through and thought how can i wrap this up and what were jared harris and christopher walken thinking did they do it for a bet i couldn't tell you the plot i'm not entirely sure there is one to be quite frank but if there is it didn't register jared and his bird go to ireland after she falls down the stairs while <UNK> up as you do they go to a house with a very annoying small girl in it meet christopher walken who has <UNK> up some ancient woman <UNK> in <UNK> he brings her back to life for no other reason than it continues the story and she shows her <UNK> by immediately <UNK> him from then on it all gets a bit silly a couple of hours of my life that i'd like back
<START> i'm not aware of <UNK> <UNK> as a comic book or is it graphic novel i actually don't know but i have to admit hearing about an agent hero movie i did expect quite something different than what i actually got br br while it was startling to watch this at first it was nice watching this move along you could never really tell where it would go some twists are <UNK> but in general you can never really say were it will end up going a more than stellar performance from the lead actor and a really good support cast make this an enjoyable watch not as action packed as some might hope or expect for a movie like that but a really good mixture
<START> this and hidden <UNK> are the <UNK> that are most dear to me i don't hand out <UNK> like candy but this certainly deserved it if anything even though it's quite long like all <UNK> pretty much are it <UNK> the problem which bugs me with most of his films the storyline is often too loose and slowly <UNK> containing scenes that are unnecessary or just <UNK> too much without any real purpose to the storyline or the character description <UNK> delivered to me the same experience that for example hidden <UNK> did despite its <UNK> there wasn't a single minute i would cut out br br this is also a very unusual kurosawa film in a way it has no storyline but many little independent stories which are based more to the character description than storyline unlike any other kurosawa film i have seen so far it also <UNK> much on the dialogue which he uses brilliantly especially in the story between the father and the son planning their new house br br still the thing that makes this one a masterpiece is how the subject being so tragic as it is is managed to be described so <UNK> and <UNK> without pointing fingers at anybody at any point from the beginning to the end it delivers the whole emotional scale from laughter to tears in perfect balance
<START> this is hands down the worst movie i can ever remember watching everything was unbelievably cliché and retarded the acting was horrible too the camera work wasn't bad but that still couldn't redeem it the writer director of this film must suffer from <UNK> syndrome if he believed this movie would help his career i want the hour and a half of my life back that i wasted watching this crap i would rather watch a video of the grass growing than this i cant believe imdb is making me write 10 lines in order to post this but i feel that this movie is so bad that i must continue to warn others about it the reason i came about this movie is that my girlfriend <UNK> it from the local library thinking that it was the kris <UNK> movie which ended up being entitled <UNK> i don't know whose fault it was for this garbage ending up in my dvd player but i feel that someone owes me at least 20 for my time pain and suffering in conclusion the director writer of this movie better hope i ever recognize him on the street
<START> to grasp where this 1976 version of a star is born is coming from consider this its final number is sung by barbra streisand in a seven minute and forty second close up followed by another two and half minute freeze frame of ms streisand striking a christ like pose behind the closing credits over ten <UNK> minutes of <UNK> distinctive <UNK> dead center filling the big screen with <UNK> ego that just might be some sort of cinematic record br br or think about this the plot of this musical revolves around a love affair between two musical <UNK> yet while <UNK> songs are performed in their entirety including the interminable finale her <UNK> kris kristofferson isn't allowed to complete even one single song he performs nor though she does allow him to contribute a little back up to a couple of her <UNK> do they actually sing a <UNK> br br or consider this <UNK> name appears in the credits at least six times including taking credit for musical concepts and her wardrobe from her closet and she also allegedly wanted but failed to get co directing credit as well one of her credits was as executive producer with a producer credit going to her then boyfriend and former <UNK> jon peters as such streisand controlled the final cut of the film which explains why it is so obsessed with <UNK> the film in her direction what it doesn't explain is how come given every opportunity to make the great <UNK> look good their efforts only make streisand look bad even though this was one of <UNK> greatest box office hits it is arguably her worst film and contains her worst performance br br anyway moving the melodrama from hollywood to the world of sex drugs and <UNK> streisand plays esther hoffman a pop singer on the road to stardom who shares the fast lane for a while with <UNK> john norman howard a hard rocker heading for the off <UNK> to has <UNK> in the previous <UNK> of the story norman <UNK> sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer <UNK> lester achieve her success in the feminist seventies streisand co want to make it clear that their heroine owes nothing to a man so the <UNK> is <UNK> she'll succeed with or without him and he is pretty much near bottom from scene one he's a burden she must endure in the name of love as such there is an obvious effort to make the leading lady not just <UNK> but almost ruthless while her <UNK> comes off as a <UNK> <UNK> br br kristofferson <UNK> through the film with a credible indifference to the material making little attempt to give much of a performance and oddly it serves his <UNK> <UNK> character well streisand on the other hand <UNK> not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen everything she does seems if not too <UNK> at least too controlled even her apparent ad <UNK> seem <UNK> <UNK> and her moments of supposed <UNK> <UNK> mechanical the two have no chemistry making the central love affair totally unbelievable you might presume that his character sees in her a symbol of his <UNK> youth and innocence though at age <UNK> streisand doesn't seem particularly young or naive the only <UNK> attraction he might offer to her is that she can exploit him as a faster route to stardom and indeed had the film had the guts to actually play the material that way to make <UNK> character openly play an <UNK> villain the film might have had a spark and maybe a reason to exist br br but i guess the filmmakers actually see esther as a sympathetic victim they don't seem to be aware just how cold blooded and self absorbed she is but sensitivity is not one of the film's strong points note the petty joke of giving barbra two african american back up singers just so the film can <UNK> in the lame racism of calling the trio the <UNK> and the film makes a big deal of pointing out that esther <UNK> her ethnic identity by using her given name of hoffman yet the filmmakers have changed the character's name of the previous films from esther <UNK> so that streisand won't be <UNK> with a name that is too jewish or too unattractive so much for ethnic pride br br the <UNK> back stabbing and <UNK> that <UNK> the film's release is near legendary so the fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable <UNK> director frank <UNK> seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie with considerable help from ace cinematographer robert <UNK> and the film did serve its purpose producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes including the oscar winning <UNK> by paul williams and streisand but overall the film turned out to be the one thing streisand reportedly claimed she didn't want it to be a vanity project
<START> let me give a quick <UNK> of the film a rotten rude kid named max stumbles upon a radio that contains <UNK> a <UNK> genie like all <UNK> he <UNK> 3 wishes but being good natured also helps max with his personal life as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime during all this <UNK> <UNK> from time to time also <UNK> <UNK> dismal rap skills br br this movie proves what we all know <UNK> need to stick to sports i admit that it never looked like an oscar worthy movie but everything about this waste of film is horrible the characters are either unlikable or stupid the plot is not even worth mentioning the dialog is a joke and <UNK> is only a quarter of the problem hell even if denzel washington played <UNK> this movie would still be a joke i know that the movie only drew anybody was because <UNK> was so big no pun intended at the time i honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time <UNK> should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws
<START> so don't even think about renting this from the <UNK> because this is one hell of a bad movie you'd think that <UNK> <UNK> had written this movie basically a rat is <UNK> down the toilet and somehow has to get back out fans of the completely terrible shrek might enjoy but wallace <UNK> fans will probably turn away in disgust also why didn't they do it in <UNK> or clay i mean cgi animation for an <UNK> movie obviously <UNK> <UNK> around while they let <UNK> do the whole thing wrong wrong wrong nearly every single character is awful apart from that freaky frog guy who is just right for a movie villain but everything else about the movie is dull dull dull i almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie no wait actually i did fall asleep with boredom watching this movie it's just terrible but thankfully it's not as bad as shrek
<START> john <UNK> opening night is fantastic and fascinating fantastic because it plays with the deepest fears we have inside our imagination fascinating because it never <UNK> surprising us with its very long duration of two hours and twenty minutes anyone who <UNK> characters won't be able to take their eyes off the screen br br the story of an unstable actress myrtle gordon gena rowlands trying to put herself together for a play fighting her demons opening night is not only about a woman on the verge of a breakdown but also about the <UNK> of the lives of theater actors and the theatrical world all of <UNK> characters here are experienced people that know about the world of theater so half of the film takes place on a stage either where the performers do their job or at <UNK> where producers and writers and directors do their job br br cassavetes is so harsh with his characters that this <UNK> turns towards the audience but the audience in the cinema because there is another audience in the theater of the film that doesn't know what is really happening and laugh because they think everything is performance and that's essentially what it is it's just that the audience in the theater doesn't get to see <UNK> the way we do they don't experience gena <UNK> <UNK> before she goes out to that stage but most importantly they don't know the reasons why she acts the way she does br br i always thought that it would be difficult to be friends with an actor myrtle <UNK> says she's an actress and that's the only thing she knows how to do and i imagine that if i had a friend who was a professional performer it would be really difficult to tell when he's saying the truth because i would know he's an actor and he can fake anything at any time a lot of the things that myrtle does during the awful experiences the film puts her <UNK> suspect if she's being real the rest of the characters suspect too br br there is the writer sarah joan blondell who can't understand why myrtle doesn't understand the character she's written for her there's the director <UNK> ben <UNK> who can't accept the fact that his best actress might be losing it the producer david paul stewart who doesn't know where to stand and <UNK> co star maurice cassavetes himself who can't deal with the love they have for each other br br when she witnesses the death of a teenager a fan all of this comes together and affects myrtle but no one knows if her <UNK> are for real they don't say anything because they don't want to upset her but the movie enters in a state of <UNK> that only myrtle accepts at times we can tell that everyone has had it during these moments <UNK> brilliant script depicts a scary brutal honesty in the words the characters say in a discussion <UNK> and not only what everyone tells myrtle but also what she says to them br br here are people who are not afraid to speak their mind and constantly change what they are thinking just like <UNK> way of making cinema and in this aspect the performances are more important here than in shadows because the characters are involved in a bigger picture a bigger story that steps out of the trivial br br but in another aspect the actual way of making cinema this movie is no different from shadows there's a beautiful thing in the way al <UNK> camera shoots the characters when someone's talking the camera doesn't focus on him it shoots the person who is listening so we can see how he or she <UNK> to the things the other one's saying sometimes they don't care sometimes they are happy sometimes <UNK> br br <UNK> might still be there though among all these wonderful performances near the end there's an unexpected scene where cassavetes and rowlands start talking non stop whether this was improvised or not is not something we have to wonder we have just got to watch and watching both of them <UNK> life experiences and seeing words come truly alive in a conversation that means a lot more than what it <UNK> doesn't get more natural than that
<START> i should qualify that title now that i think about it <UNK> is not entirely worthless i've had the opportunity to see it twice and on the second time i did get a great laugh at the movie's expense so i guess it's worth something for that and also it's worthwhile for the excruciating pain it caused me on my first viewing as another reviewer pointed out this film is hackneyed in every sense of the word not a single original thought went into this movie which makes the comment below about the originality of the premise entirely <UNK> to me the film is nothing but a long line of cliches which are strung together and <UNK> around as a movie it is definitely not the next <UNK> it is definitely not original and it is absolutely not good clean fun the film is absolute agony to the <UNK> after seeing it a first time the second time can be quite funny in an insulting sort of way as i looked around the theater it was obvious that nearly everyone <UNK> perhaps the elderly were completely bored or <UNK> by this movie during some of the particularly emotional scenes like where nick <UNK> out his mother the audience was actually cringing because it was so poorly done i even heard someone <UNK> in the theater something i had <UNK> never witnessed i don't care where you have the chance to see this movie be it at a film festival or in a indie theater or wherever do yourself a favor skip this movie with a vengeance unless you're like me and just can't resist the opportunity to see what may truly be the worst movie ever made
<START> if you are looking for eye candy you may enjoy sky captain sky captain is just a video game <UNK> with live performers the <UNK> are nice and interesting to look at during the entire movie now saying that the visuals are the only thing good in sky captain br br after ten minutes i knew i was watching one of the worse movies of all time i was hoping this movie would get better but it never achieved any degree of interest after thirty minutes the urge to walk out kept growing and growing now i own over 2000 movies and have seen probably five times that number yet this is only the second movie i felt like walking out of my entire life br br acting there is none the three main performers are pitiful jude law also in the other movie i wanted to walk out on is just awful in the title role i would rather sit through ben affleck in <UNK> than watch law again br br paltrow tries so hard to be campy that it <UNK> in her face the last article i had read said that paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting after this performance i would applaud that decision br br story soap operas are better written the story behind sky captain starts out bad and gets continually worse as it progresses br br directing none everything was put into the special effects that story acting and directing suffer greatly even the phantom menace had better acting and that is not saying a great deal br br i would have to give this movie a 0 out of 10 avoid paying theatre <UNK> and wait until video release
<START> i saw this movie with some indian friends on christmas day the quick summary of this movie is must avoid <UNK> <UNK> wrote directed produced and edited this movie and did none of these jobs well br br the movie tells the story of the attempt by <UNK> in 1999 to capture part of the <UNK> region of <UNK> from india supposedly based on fact you get a hint from this movie of the difficulty the indian army had in <UNK> the area from the <UNK> troops who occupied the high ground but instead of telling what must have been a compelling and heroic story all this movie does is make the indian military look laughable and stupid which i know is not true br br i watched this movie with an almost completely indian audience who were very patriotic and clearly wanted to like this movie but also found themselves laughing at scenes that weren't meant to be funny br br the script was absolutely abysmal it gave the impression that mr <UNK> knows nothing about how an army <UNK> and was using bad war movies for reference the result is a script that is brainless and repetitive br br the acting from most of the principals was not stellar but considering the script they were given i find it hard to <UNK> them too much as for the supporting cast all i can say is that i hope they were amateurs br br the editing was also pretty bad it was pretty hard to follow what was going on for a lot of the time and music would abruptly end at scene changes br br good things the cinematography was pretty good although it was hurt a little by the fact that the movie didn't appear to be colour <UNK> the colour balance often varied significantly within scenes also the few songs that were in the movie were quite enjoyable for the first half a dozen or so <UNK> at least unfortunately they went on a lot longer than they should have br br and the worst crime of all this mess is four hours long there is enough here that a good editor could almost squeeze a good 1 5 2 hour movie out of what was shot sadly a good editor was not working on this movie
<START> the <UNK> is one of <UNK> <UNK> most <UNK> books but in this animated adaptation the magic just isn't there this version remains pretty faithful to <UNK> original story so one can't lay the blame on john <UNK> script if anything the fault lies with the <UNK> animation the <UNK> pace and the generally <UNK> voice overs one would be right to expect this story to make for a happy vibrant fun filled movie instead the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first all the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a <UNK> classic br br young orphan sophie voice of amanda root lives in a none too friendly <UNK> under the cruel <UNK> of mrs <UNK> one evening she is <UNK> through the window when she spots a massive figure walking <UNK> down the village street the figure realises it has been seen so it reaches in through the window and <UNK> sophie from her bed placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from giant country and fears that he will eat her but to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the <UNK> voice of david jason the <UNK> refuses to eat people instead <UNK> himself to foul <UNK> <UNK> known as <UNK> however giant country is populated by numerous other giants who do feast every night as it happens on poor unsuspecting humans sophie and the <UNK> become great friends and soon they come up with a plan to <UNK> the other giants together they go to the queen of england voice of angela <UNK> with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the man eating giants the queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone else br br jason voices the <UNK> quite well one of the few <UNK> in the film but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality the rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired with very little to bring the characters to life similarly the <UNK> is the only character that is <UNK> animated sophie lacks appeal and the giants are <UNK> designed and look almost <UNK> from each other even the places are <UNK> giant country especially comes up short being nothing more than a <UNK> <UNK> with occasional rocks and <UNK> at <UNK> minutes the film is not exactly lengthy yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the <UNK> handling of several sequences little of <UNK> mischievous humour is conveyed <UNK> one chapter in the book deals with the <UNK> love of <UNK> <UNK> and is laugh out loud hilarious in the film the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling i came to the the <UNK> expecting lots of <UNK> fun and enjoyment but what i got was pretty much the opposite this one is a failed misfire that simply doesn't match the <UNK> of the book in any department unfortunately therefore it must go down as one to skip
<START> the sentinel i was hoping would be a good film and boy i was right a great story first of all from a novel and i thought this was an original story but i guess it wasn't and it was a very smart story michael douglas in this film is very good and <UNK> sutherland is too but however it is very hard to <UNK> him off his role as jack bauer in 24 but eventually you do and he is very different in the sentinel than he is in 24 also another person trying to <UNK> off their tv role but failed eva <UNK> she wasn't that good in the film and had a back seat in the entire thing after i saw the film i had constant dreams about the sentinel and couldn't sleep overall sentinel is a good film and i would recommend it
<START> one of the most appealing elements of a gilliam film is that the well <UNK> visuals the unsettling backdrops and the <UNK> frustrated characters are evidence of the <UNK> involvement instead of most movies where the filmmaker is some director for hire that is paid to feature a star or two you can feel terry <UNK> presence through the experience 12 monkeys is evidence of <UNK> own vision and style as opposed to making offbeat movies for their own sake 12 monkeys is a variation on similar themes of <UNK> <UNK> oppressive <UNK> societies the <UNK> of the protagonist the frustration associated with disbelief and parallel <UNK> in this film gilliam does a fine job of <UNK> lines between the two <UNK> using <UNK> to force the audience to believe rather than know this tendency for gilliam to neglect to fill in certain gaps leads to criticisms of art house <UNK> the difference between gilliam and artsy <UNK> is that <UNK> choices clearly have a purpose and all of his images have meaning the two nearly identical bathing scenes of cole in the beginning are meant to draw comparisons which leave the audience <UNK> his bald head is a mark of <UNK> in the disease ridden future world yet makes him recognizable in the 1996 world the title itself is a mark of <UNK> creativity as it requires the majority of the story to flesh out for its meaning to be fully understood all in all <UNK> dedication to making creative films that are interesting to watch yet also require thought and interpretation from the audience the film has immense re watch value since there are subtle details and hints that can be missed upon the first viewing definitely one of my favorites
<START> james stewart plays an fbi agent who began working with the agency before it was called the fbi and the story involves dealing with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> era gangsters world war ii german and japanese spies etc a continuously interesting picture covering 40 years of history far superior to any films being made these days br br of special interest to older viewers familiar with washington <UNK> in a scene about 20 minutes into the movie where james stewart finds out from vera miles that she's expecting their first child the scene was filmed in <UNK> <UNK> restaurant on the former washington <UNK> the only movie in which this historic location appears shortly after taking office president kennedy decided that <UNK> washington a 99 black neighborhood was an <UNK> and ought to be torn down by <UNK> <UNK> his position of <UNK> <UNK> the entire area including the popular <UNK> restaurant district but <UNK> 3 historic <UNK> was reduced to <UNK> black residents <UNK> from their homes <UNK> as best they could and without federal assistance likewise <UNK> were simply put out of business few re <UNK> restaurant row was converted into a sidewalk and washington had no <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stands <UNK> etc for about 10 years as a lifetime resident the <UNK> restaurant scene was our 1 reason to see this fine movie again
<START> hearing such praise about this play i decided to watch it when i stumbled across it on cable i don't see how this <UNK> women and their struggles by focusing on the topic at hand i guess if you have an interest in stories about women's private parts and how it affects their lives then this is for you otherwise it's rather dull and boring if anything i found it a bit <UNK> br br i <UNK> with a female friend who also watched this and she thought it was horrible as well so it's not just a guy not getting it
<START> once again jet li brings his charismatic presence to the movie screen in the film black mask in this film li plays tsui an <UNK> from a super soldier program who seeks to regain the humanity that the program had taken away from him to do this tsui decides to become a <UNK> in order to live a normal and peaceful life but fate demands that he clean up problems from his past before he can continue to seek peace other members of the super soldier program had escaped at the same time as tsui but they want to get even with the world rather than find inner peace thus tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former team mates from releasing information that could cost many innocent people their lives this film screams across the screen at a frantic pace and never lets its audience go the martial arts is amazing but because it uses <UNK> it may not be appreciated as much as it deserves by american audiences if you like action movies that have an interesting story and demand good acting performances because they deal with psychological as well as physical conflicts then black mask is for you i am glad to see that some of jet <UNK> movies are finally getting main stream release in the united states and look forward to seeing how the changes that that release will require things like dubbing and soundtrack will affect the film this is one of <UNK> best films go out and see it on may 14 when it is released in america
<START> although dig was being <UNK> as being closest to what the music industry is like it is highly <UNK> the director has <UNK> the audience into believing the brian <UNK> massacre disappeared off the face of the earth post <UNK> and the rivalry between the dandy warhols and <UNK> has been <UNK> the truth of the matter is not really exposed in this film br br that said this film is endlessly <UNK> and is an interesting watch as we get a look at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art one of the best things this film has going for it is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene br br recommended mostly for the music and the two fantastic bands
<START> let's face it some lame kid who dies and has his soul <UNK> into a scarecrow <UNK> no gonna happen <UNK> <UNK> this stupid loser kid who can't stand up for himself gets his ass handed to him by some drunk bastard <UNK> his mom right as he dies he looks up at the scarecrow and he let's his spirit go into the scarecrow the drunk guy covered up his death by making it seem <UNK> and thought he had gotten away with it we later see he is tossed out of the trailer and later earns another encounter with the scarecrow they had a brief encounter which includes the drunk calling him a loser and the scarecrow <UNK> with takes one to know one loser the scarecrow <UNK> off the building calls him daddy o and then <UNK> the poor man we can see how this awesome movie unfolds from that he goes on to kill many people afterward he mainly kills the people who gave him a hard time in <UNK> and goes off to kill some random ass people just for some laughs no laughing here he adds a punchline to every kill too every time he killed someone he would do some karate <UNK> and finish it all off with one of his signature <UNK> in the case of someone who was hard of hearing he would say here have an ear of corn then <UNK> it up their ass or we can actually take an example from the movie he just got done killing a cop and was on his way to killing the only person who ever stood up for him her father the sheriff <UNK> to the madman to stop and he said hey stay awhile and threw a <UNK> threw his chest and stuck him onto some tree in the end of the movie he killed two guys and threw in the punchline gotta split and killed two guys by <UNK> a <UNK> into their heads <UNK> this movie made me want to cream my pants so bad maybe next time this guy makes a movie it won't be gay
<START> i thought the film could be a bit more complex in a psychological sense perhaps but the action and voice acting were top notch the animation was heavy cg in many scenes but very good ones at that this is one of the batman returns forever type films which include romances and the conflicts of wayne and motives for dating <UNK> fans would love this and so would the females great theme song wayne was portrayed very well in this film and the <UNK> was back to his true form no mutant <UNK> in him this time i liked the fact robin wasn't used too much tim drake was just a good computer nerd somewhat of an <UNK> child or mind of the future br br the supporting cast was made up of some soap opera stars decent talents and the characters were drawn to look like the voice actors too kelly <UNK> was hilarious in this film br br i rate this below phantasm return of the joker and batman vs dracula but liked the smarter script better than i enjoyed <UNK> 7 10
<START> i wish i could give this movie a zero or even lower because sadly that's what it deserves i honestly never walk out of a movie but this one was so dreadfully awful that i couldn't stand another minute of it please please please for the sake of mankind skip this movie if you want a hot lesbian movie that you can really delve into this isn't it br br it has unattractive unappealing leads choppy structure ridiculous dialog and it is absolutely unconvincing in every imaginable way on an absolutely basic level it fails to entertain everything about <UNK> kiss is so <UNK> it is worse than any student film i have seen br br as if that weren't enough the entire movie relies on constant and i mean constant voice over narration the script writer may as well have written a novel because they insisted on telling everything instead of showing it we are just supposed to assume that lou and <UNK> are the best of friends and have a special connection even though there is no character development to illustrate this also this film continues to introduce to new characters after the first five minutes and not in a natural way but in a freeze frame of the characters with their name written over the screen there is no introduction no development of any of the characters we don't really get to know any of them br br this is the most amateur movie i have ever seen br br i am a gay woman who watched this film with my roommate another gay woman and we both found this movie to be a depressing representation of <UNK> cinema i am beginning to think that lesbian and gay movies are a lot like christian rock it doesn't matter how atrocious it is people will still flock to it and champion it no matter how poor the quality is please don't rent this instead let's encourage the production of quality gay and lesbian movies by renting but i'm a <UNK> or fire or heavenly creatures instead of <UNK> whatever mindless tripe they aim at the gay community i e <UNK> as folk
<START> first of all i am a butch straight white male but even with that <UNK> i love this movie it's about real people a real time and place and of course new york city in the 80's i had many gay friends growing up in new york in the eighties and the one thing about them i always admired was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live them no matter what the consequences that's courageous you have to admire that this is a great film watch it and take in what it was like to be a flamboyant african american or hispanic gay man in the new york of the eighties it's real life bottom line it's real life
<START> i had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance screening for this movie after all this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind and it was one of the first epic tales i read as a kid even before <UNK> i must say that it was a huge disappointment they completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera the elements that were faithful to the plot were <UNK> throughout in such a <UNK> manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles it was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like <UNK> who has a strange combination of nearly matrix like powers utter <UNK> and male lovers in the original poem turn to <UNK> on the beach in the <UNK> of pitt who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure hollywood has ever produced the actors were actually decent trying to make the best of a ridiculous script it was actually a waste of so much talent peter o'toole stole the show and orlando bloom and sean bean were pathetic compare it to lotr or gladiator and it doesn't even hold a candle to them plenty of <UNK> for the ladies to <UNK> over but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege i wouldn't recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragged through the dirt like one of the characters was at least they got that part right
<START> this movie no <UNK> this thing this abysmal abomination from the burning <UNK> of hell should have been killed before it even left the writer's head i could not possibly come up with enough <UNK> to describe this movie but let's try anyway horrible bad nauseating tasteless crap vomit inducing gut <UNK> bad hideous nasty <UNK> there just aren't enough words in the english language the plot involves a serial killer who becomes a snow man don't ask how not important the killer snowman runs about killing people how you may ask can a snowman kill someone in tasteless ways that make you want to remove your eyes if only so you don't have to endure that <UNK> snowman anymore in ways that make you want to fill your ears with hot wax so you do not have to endure his snow <UNK> anymore don't watch this movie destroy it on sight for the sake of your very soul don't watch it
<START> <UNK> movies have aged not well what always surprised me about them is that besides an <UNK> plastic beauty there is a dull and <UNK> psychology of the characters and situations remember for instance the conversations between mastroianni and the wicked <UNK> that wants sing up him in la <UNK> or monica <UNK> laughing at the <UNK> <UNK> in the train in la <UNK> or <UNK> dropping the glass of <UNK> at the end of the same film br br i have reviewed yesterday zabriskie point in this film there are a lot of nice and elaborate shots of the rod taylor office the streets and <UNK> of l a the publicity <UNK> the <UNK> etc that show the fascination of the author in his american journey in the same way than <UNK> <UNK> years later unfortunately there are too a lot of hippie <UNK> clichés that spoil the movie the boy leaves the meeting steals an <UNK> and flies over the desert in order to <UNK> himself and find something different the executives in grey <UNK> speak all the time about <UNK> the girl looks at the object women in the swimming pool and leaves because she wants not to be like them the couple of fat middle class in the <UNK> speak in front of the beauty of the nature of building a hotel and <UNK> a lot of money last but not the least a lot of couples making love in the desert what a hippie <UNK> br br sorry today half a century after the revolution of la <UNK> we can see that the king is naked and his films except le <UNK> and perhaps <UNK> <UNK> are only a handful of <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> split second might have been a good movie a story about a road rage homicide has a very young clive owen giving a pretty good performance but but br br unfortunately the filmmakers <UNK> their own movie with idiotic camera work and truly awful editing the camera jumps all over creation in an <UNK> attempt i suppose to reflect <UNK> stress from business family and traffic what this actually does is to give the viewer a headache br br since the filmmakers cared nothing about making a good movie but only to impress each other with their idiotic photography one ought not waste time on this travesty
<START> well there's no real plot to speak of it's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex which can sometimes be fun too but it's not in this case what else can i say about this the action when happening is inventive and there's a cool scene where two characters are falling from a <UNK> one that has to be several miles high but overall there's not much to recommend <UNK> watch it if you want but you're not missing much if you skip this one
<START> there is a remark that one of <UNK> was raped on drunken rampage by russian soldiers which is completely untrue this movie should not be shown only because of this br br also there is a statement by someone that <UNK> <UNK> jews <UNK> etc which is worse than nazis <UNK> was looking for so called <UNK> agents who were <UNK> believed <UNK> agents this is totally different from <UNK> <UNK> as a whole nation as nazis did <UNK> were never <UNK> <UNK> was political tool and used politically but from <UNK> standpoint <UNK> really did not <UNK> between <UNK> br br whole movie stinks like fake main hero does not speak russian signs in berlin contains <UNK> errors <UNK> general looks totally phony some so called russian <UNK> are totally made up and list goes on and on br br not recommended to watch this movie is full of lies and phony stuff go to good shepherd instead
<START> in hollywood in the 1930's and 1940's i think that every studio can make a western except warner bros the few times they try it always ridiculous except perhaps for they died with their boots on which is a <UNK> western i have read that <UNK> bogart <UNK> james cagney with this big cowboy hat on his head said that he looks like a <UNK> true cagney and bogart are too urban too <UNK> century to be credible in a western movie the story here had no <UNK> and it <UNK> help every 10 minutes i figure i can see bogart and cagney drops their little guns and put hands in a machine gun to get away from the set in a 1930's black car
<START> this is one of the most amazing stories i have ever seen br br if this film had been directed by larry clark then this story about a school shooting probably would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and whatever led that person to go insane in the first place br br instead the plot focuses mainly on the aftermath of a school shooting and how it <UNK> the victims who survived br br i had seen busy phillips in other films before but her performance in this movie is by far her best the only other movie that i've seen with erika christensen is swim fan which made me almost not want to watch this film but she turned in a very good performance herself br br this is one of the few movies i have seen that was actually able to make me cry trust me when i tell you that doesn't happen very often br br home room is a beautiful film and that's all there is too it
<START> how many minutes does it take to paint a poem in this film much too long br br it tells the story about the impact of a first love between two <UNK> br br the boys can't <UNK> touching each other and making love after a while one gets distracted by a brief encounter with a sensual guy in the disco and that raises doubt exploration fantasy longing lust and feelings of <UNK> grip on your love are themes that are all <UNK> painted with music close ups and silent scenes like telling a poem but it really takes too long annoying long shame the effort was promising
<START> probably the two main <UNK> of <UNK> pet rabbit are that the wacky <UNK> featured in a wild <UNK> now has a name and that he <UNK> his famous of course you realize this means war for the first time mostly the <UNK> <UNK> crowd was still trying to figure out what exactly to do with this long <UNK> <UNK> it's certainly a must see for hard core fans of this genre but others will probably have little reason to take interest br br but make no mistake it's quite hilarious what bugs bunny does to the <UNK> <UNK> elmer <UNK> clear shades of things to come abound throughout the cartoon i recommend it
<START> this supernatural peter <UNK> thriller is truly one of the most haunting and fascinating movies ever seen richard chamberlain does his best performance here as the australian lawyer who <UNK> a group of young <UNK> accused of murder as he gets closer on the case he discovers more about the main <UNK> chris and not least about himself chris tells him that he is a <UNK> which appear to be a race of supernatural beings that lived in australia thousands of years ago at the same time extraordinary high <UNK> seems to confirm the <UNK> prophecy of the coming of the last wave the one that will <UNK> the world br br the dream sequences and the supernatural effects enhance this movie and make it a spectacular experience olivia <UNK> and david <UNK> are solid in the supporting roles as well as the <UNK> with the difficult name who plays charlie the old <UNK> who can turn into an owl the climax and the ending don't disappoint in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who fall flat after a promising hour or so however this can not be called a pure thriller it is a drama as well and talks about <UNK> and spiritual identity in the modern world a masterful work by peter <UNK> the master of visually stunning dramas
<START> this was the second entry in the regular columbo series and it holds up well today as i am able to look at it closely now on dvd and see how it is constructed i am very impressed with the direction of bernard l <UNK> who directed the fine macho callahan as well as countless tv episodes watch how the post murder actions of the killer are shown on a split screen effect on his two <UNK> watch how the murder itself is shown in montage fashion watch the point of view shot from the perspective of the corpse also the wild but impressive avant garde musical score from noted <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was incredible and helped so much to create atmosphere and the supporting performance of brett <UNK> as the golf pro was wonderful such subtlety and complexity in a role that nine out of ten times would be a one dimensional <UNK> the formula had not yet been set when this episode was filmed so there are still some surprises in <UNK> methods of course falk robert <UNK> and ray <UNK> are the highest quality actors and it's a pleasure to see them work all men are familiar from many other roles yet lose themselves in their characters here in all this entry in the columbo series and many of the others are as well crafted as a very good feature film
<START> as many people know mexican cinema was very poor after the so called golden age of the mexican cinema fortunately during the late 90's and early 21st century great movies like la <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> california <UNK> <UNK> y <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and of course el <UNK> no <UNK> <UNK> le <UNK> appeared el <UNK> is a wonderful movie that <UNK> the classic story by gabriel <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> the magic realism elements and replacing them with the crude reality lived in mexico not only by people like the colonel who wait for their <UNK> but by more than the half of the mexican population who live in complete poverty the film's characters <UNK> represent classic characters found in mexican society such as the <UNK> colonel the cold and even ambitious priest the <UNK> but at the same time loyal <UNK> the <UNK> and patient wife the hidden homosexual etc this movie is a must see if you want to know more about mexican society and specially if you want to watch a gorgeous movie by one of <UNK> finest directors
<START> <UNK> as a film should in no way be compared with the novel for they are two entirely different <UNK> however that being said the film still manages to maintain many of the elements that made the book work but since it is a visual medium it is more difficult to pull of stream of consciousness i think this is the best film they could have made with the material and this is from someone that <UNK> <UNK> about films not being like their literary counterparts i recommend the book but the movie is still entertaining
<START> ugh another one of those fooled by the cover dvds i expected some kind of action at least with bears cats such on the cover i got nothing bad movie br br i forced myself to watch this all the way through thinking that eventually something would happen no luck br br now the reason i gave this a 2 is because of the scenery otherwise it sucked br br the kid was terrible talking to himself although i suppose they couldn't just run a movie with dumb music and no dialogue at all doing his lame karate <UNK> to a tree <UNK> threatening a <UNK> <UNK> on worms and what a <UNK> kicking a <UNK> and he wouldn't be pulling those <UNK> out that easily either they stick like <UNK> at least he fought the bear <UNK> a couple of times br br what was up with the flashback thing it made a bad movie even worse i wanted to see a survival movie not some dramatic <UNK> about a kid suffering thru divorce br br what else can i say well maybe they should have had the bear eat the kid or something at least that would have been more exciting br br people don't waste your time on this one
<START> the way this story played out and the interaction between the 2 lead characters may lead me to believe that if the x files continues without <UNK> and <UNK> these would be a pretty good replacement duo
<START> i would <UNK> this film to everyone not only to the fans of the rocker <UNK> <UNK> but to all film buffs because it's sincere moving funny and true because <UNK> is a born <UNK> and a film lover and every frame of his film is made with love and care because his characters are loved and ask to be loved because most of the italian debut films are lousy and this one done by an <UNK> is a real joy to watch and to listen at because <UNK> <UNK> is gorgeous and reminds me of <UNK> <UNK> who was like <UNK> beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin that <UNK> shows as it is <UNK> and ugly without <UNK> in easy <UNK> because it's a film that speaks to our heart our ears our souls and because i lived the experience of the <UNK> <UNK> and it was exactly like that thanks <UNK>
<START> <UNK> has some issues <UNK> under her attractive exterior she starts to lose her mind when she finds out about a distant relative who she resembles that was burned for being a werewolf she goes a bit <UNK> when she <UNK> horny men and <UNK> out their throats she does eventually find a man that helps contain her inner beast but when others ruin their bliss she <UNK> her violent and <UNK> revenge br br <UNK> <UNK> isn't a very goof film but it does pose as a good crowd film a fun time could be had by <UNK> the bad acting dubbing translation and the just plain cheesiness of the production but on it's own it moves slowly but does have ample nudity to keep you <UNK>
<START> with a tendency to repeat himself <UNK> has been a consistent disappointment ever since he hit it big with <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> of <UNK> is no exception taking into the fact that i anticipated an average mediocre film even before i went in <UNK> ambitions seem to always get the better of him it's taken for <UNK> now his films are heavy handed and <UNK> br br i weren't sure if i was watching a comedy that <UNK> middle america or some thriller the outcome of <UNK> character is wholly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> many many scenes with some rock song is also intensely annoying he was covering up the holes in his script and direction by <UNK> up the scenes br br i am certain that many people will find this film important and <UNK> but in all honestly this clumsy and <UNK> effort only speaks of poor direction br br interesting that <UNK> <UNK> that while making <UNK> <UNK> he had great help from sam <UNK> with the script yes that was <UNK> best and he should understand now he needs a good scriptwriter his films from the past 15 years were a total mess
<START> watching this film for the action is rather a waste of time because the <UNK> on the ships act better than the humans it's a mercy that anthony quinn couldn't <UNK> anyone else to let him direct any other films after this turkey br br but it is filled with amusement value since <UNK> <UNK> has hair <UNK> greene displays an unconvincing french accent and the rest of the big names <UNK> about in comic book fashion
<START> if you want to see a movie about two utterly unsympathetic characters this is the one the acting is superb both from john cassavetes as the insane paranoid whom as the saying goes they really are out to get and from peter falk as his <UNK> best friend to whom he turns for rescue big mistake but since they're both amoral <UNK> and misogynistic <UNK> to boot it's hard to decide whom to root for less only writer director <UNK> may could have gotten away with this one i thought it interesting that in a lengthy interview with producer michael <UNK> included on the dvd he <UNK> that the two stars had very different ideas about the script that the director was nearly impossible to work with that the director of photography had impossible demands made of him that the crew was constantly angry about being made to sit around waiting and so on this mood of one big very dysfunctional family comes across clearly on the screen
<START> sports movies have never been my thing but a small handful of them work for me the best are the those which focus less on the sport and more on the character such as raging bull the wrestler and <UNK> this is a great directorial debut for <UNK> <UNK> and an outstanding first performance for michelle rodriguez <UNK> feels is both realistic and involving that is enough so to make it a memorable film br br the plot is <UNK> forward enough diana <UNK> is in her fourth year of high school but due to her picking fights in the <UNK> she is close to <UNK> as a possible means of <UNK> her anger she signs up for boxing lessons at the club where her brother is training at the wishes of there father br br in the course of ninety minutes we the viewers see something extraordinary diana almost literally changes from a girl to a woman we see it in her body as well as her behaviour especially when one of the boys at the club finds himself drawn to her and she gets into it there is not a bad scene or a lame contrived moment in the film the only error that i would say could be <UNK> is that one of the subplots ends on what feels like an unfinished note aside from that <UNK> is a great movie
<START> the only word that sums up this movie is quirky it's a light hearted romp through an existential concept <UNK> in more way than one and a bit nutty i wouldn't exactly call it grand and unforgettable cinema and it doesn't seem quite as memorable as the director's first movie cube but it's a good pit of fluff to watch on a sunday morning the acting <UNK> from respectable to annoying at times but i believe that's how it was to be written done as a serious movie it could perhaps have been great or may very well have stepped into a state of <UNK> a little like the matrix meets head meets human nature br br 6 8 out of ten
<START> loved part one the impossible planet but <UNK> what a disappointment part two 'the satan <UNK> is the cliffhanger of something apparently rising out of the pit was nothing coming out of the pit then ages spent <UNK> round air <UNK> to pad out the story the beast a roaring thing empty of intelligence so no doctor villain confrontation i'd been <UNK> the <UNK> is somehow inside the pit despite the pit not being open till long after the <UNK> fell through the planet <UNK> and finally another ready made solution which existed for no logical reason i mean why not <UNK> the beast into the hole as soon as the pit opened why not <UNK> him in all those years ago instead of <UNK> him anyway why not i could go on but i've lost interest
<START> the good earth is perhaps the most boring film i've seen in my life the plot is slow and lacking the acting is borderline comical while i love paul muni i can now say i have seen a film that does not do his true ability justice the only saving grace i found with this film is it's production value the use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment also the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of <UNK> sells easily and was revolutionary at the time other than the production value i can say little else that is good or entertaining about this film
<START> a movie about dealing with the problems with growing up and being true to yourself blue juice is mind candy for those who like surfing and <UNK> sean pertwee is the real star of this film while the more famous catherine zeta jones plays his girlfriend and ewan <UNK> plays his drug addicted pal br br for those who don't like surfing or <UNK> in the slightest you'll find that it takes a long time before the movie even hints at being interesting the beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes plus too many main characters leads to most of them being one dimensional the plot is an interesting idea but because of the shallow characters you have no idea why they act in the situations they're put in br br only ewan sean and <UNK> characters make this a film worth being on <UNK> which is why it was only released on <UNK> in the us after ewan and catherine reached mainstream fame
<START> when i started watching the show i said oh no it's as corny as <UNK> <UNK> and not even that bloody and indeed the setup is almost identical with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him br br but this is where the resemblance stops the love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in <UNK> while the childish remarks and <UNK> are very few the magical setup is a bit corny because it's about seven people with seven servants fighting for the holy grail all servants being someone famous half of all masters being from the same school rules of engagement etc however this soon <UNK> and fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the script br br i actually watched all 24 episodes in one day and without comparing it with <UNK> that i liked more but were from other genres i have to say that i was very pleased
<START> i went into this hoping it would be the thought provoking little gem people have reviewed this as i love <UNK> films and expected to dig this too knowing what a hot button this topics is i expected to be really entertained maybe even see an <UNK> perspective br br all i can say is wow if your into self torture or <UNK> then maybe you'll like this personally i don't like the idea of being <UNK> on or cutting myself so i thought it was garbage bad script bad acting bad story bad directing bad editing i could go on i have no clue why a reviewer claimed he or she was making a political point by giving this movie a 10 that's misleading and ignorant voting for a movie on imdb isn't setting a <UNK> it just lets other people think that a garbage bomb like this is ok to watch as long as it's controversial this film is not it tries very hard to be but fails br br you know the movie is bad when 15 minutes into it your praying that all main characters die <UNK> unfortunately they do die but not in the painful manners that would have given the viewer some justice or <UNK> for having watched the 2 hours of crap they just endured br br do yourself a favor just don't even bother i got this movie in a bargain bin at my local video store for 50 and feel ripped off
<START> this is a gory mess and pretty convincing corbin <UNK> is very much in command of this movie with his slick portrayal of the loony control freak eponymous <UNK> linda hoffman plays his cheating wife and she is very easy on the eye unfortunately for her the little <UNK> with the pool guy brings severe punishment in a way the good doctor knows best shame about that pretty smile the last half hour of the movie is devoted to <UNK> character losing it completely and the spotlight falls on a young actress called <UNK> <UNK> an extremely talented performer she <UNK> the <UNK> from the moment the <UNK> come off nice legs too
<START> of all the <UNK> hip hop films released between 1983 and 1986 the 1984 film beat street is <UNK> the best one the story follows a dj his younger <UNK> brother a <UNK> artist and a wanna be <UNK> <UNK> through one winter in which they try to break out of the ghetto using their street talent the acting isn't always up to par and the characters aren't fully drawn out but they are more than <UNK> for by down to earth dialogue a plausible story fantastic dancing sequences and a timeless hip hop sound track it should be noted this film was shot in the <UNK> of <UNK> this ain't new york this is the <UNK> and features appearances by the fathers of <UNK> dance <UNK> rock steady crew and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rock steady crew provide the best scene in the film when they dominate a dance battle at the premiere <UNK> club of the early 80's the <UNK> a must see for hip hop lovers
<START> slasher films are often seen as the derivative repetitive and frankly unoriginal i happen to to be a horror movie fan but this film was just so poor words fail me the script is severely lacking the plot is ridiculous the acting <UNK> bad just an all round stinker that i wasted time of my life on this had all the entertainment value of a <UNK> sequel to a film that was dire in the first place br br who <UNK> this mess br br i only liked two things in this movie the first was the killer's mask which was nice the second was the <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> profanity br br save yourself and avoid this hideous mess
<START> bend it like beckham is packed with intriguing scenes yet has an overall predictable <UNK> line it is about a girl called jess who is trying to achieve her life long dream to become a famous soccer player and finally gets the chance when offered a position on a local team there are so many boundaries and limits that she faces which hold her back yet she is still determined and <UNK> i would recommend it for anyone who likes a nice light movie and wants to get inspired by what people can achieve the song choices are really good <UNK> my child just move on up to your destination and you make boundaries and complications ' anyway hope that was at help to your needs in a review bend it like beckham great flick
<START> the only reason i'm giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played <UNK> <UNK> were not up to the job i presume they were just kids who happened to be the right age and handy but they were not well <UNK> and their scenes were a minor annoyance br br i say not to judge this by u s standards because it's full of <UNK> and the kinds of <UNK> that japanese culture readily <UNK> and is not <UNK> to the black hat white hat moral constraints u s kids' films are <UNK> subjected to for example there is a <UNK> funny moment when <UNK> small band of yokai companions finds themselves let down and abandoned by the other yokai and <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> does what many a <UNK> out japanese adult would do hint this would not happen in a disney film this picture also has the best product placement for beer you will ever see in a kids' movie br br early on there's a moment where a school teacher <UNK> a couple of bullies on the head with her <UNK> book there was a tv commercial in japan a couple years before this movie came out it was a stop motion clay animation about a kid who's depressed and playing guitar and singing the blues in his room his mother yells at him from <UNK> to shut up then someone gives him a candy bar and he cheers up and sings a happy tune but his mother comes in and tells him to shut up again and gives him a <UNK> slap that leaves a <UNK> in his <UNK> i mention this commercial because it was considered funny and i didn't hear any <UNK> to it while i was there there is a lot more bloodshed and physical cruelty on screen in the great yokai war than one would find in a disney movie as a parent if this were a u s film i would be up in arms about such things although not necessarily the moral lessons drawn at the end of the picture which of course are also not black and white since it's a japanese movie i accept that those cultural <UNK> allow for imagery that would not get past the standards and practices cops in a u s production however i'd probably be a little uneasy taking young kids to see it without giving them some sort of pre show <UNK> and or post show <UNK> about the violence and other off color stuff or i'd wait till they're older to show it to them
<START> in terms of visual beauty this movie is outstanding i had no idea that technicolor came out so early although i didn't like the ending the entire movie is fantastic and makes me wish that i was in north africa the cast is excellent and marlene <UNK> is a big plus and of course she is so <UNK> and i just loved her in this flick basil <UNK> is also perfect in this movie i couldn't get over the scenery and the sets the hotel the palm trees the desert it's all there the <UNK> also bring a beau <UNK> feeling to the film they certainly don't make movies like these anymore don't fail to watch this classic
<START> i heard this film was much more <UNK> than the films director guy ritchie lock stock and two smoking <UNK> snatch had directed before the problem is it is possibly too <UNK> basically jake green jason <UNK> is released from prison after seven years in <UNK> and within two years he <UNK> loads of his money he is ready to seek revenge against the violence prone casino owner who got jake sent to prison dorothy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ray liotta in the process doctors tell jake that he has three days left to live as he is dying from a rare blood disease oh and <UNK> puts hit men on him <UNK> sharks <UNK> vincent <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> benjamin are demanding jake pays their cash back and do some odd jobs for them the film is filled with jake <UNK> through some flashbacks and through his last three days before coming to the big revelation about <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> well i assume that's what it was also starring <UNK> <UNK> as french paul andrew howard as billy mark strong as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as lily walker <UNK> lauren smith as <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as rachel the are sequences involving a little bit of animation repeating lines twice in different perspectives and changing <UNK> for moments and all of these are irritating to the point of confusion and boredom making it a silly crime drama pretty poor
<START> 1 is being pretty generous here i really enjoyed boogeyman even though it is not really the boogeyman promoted on the dvd cover and we all know it it <UNK> me out but this film it is something else for being directed by a guy who has been around a long time and directed a lot of movies it looks like it was shot on a vhs camcorder by a 10 year old the story and acting are atrocious david <UNK> you have let me down too after playing one of the most menacing villains in film history you have <UNK> to this the story and acting may have been able to be forgiven however if anyone had taken the time to make the video look somewhat professional there are a lot of shot on video films out there that don't look like it or at least aren't so obvious that it <UNK> your attention from the film i can't say it is the worst movie ever because i couldn't make it through the entire film but it is certainly close
<START> i've barely just made it through one episode <UNK> end the dialog was stilted and down right cringe worthy the acting was tragic <UNK> <UNK> despite his best attempts to be dramatic remains mostly <UNK> his <UNK> hint at a recent <UNK> treatment claire <UNK> could have just as easily been playing the damsel in distress in a silent movie the characters were cartoons each playing their stereotypical <UNK> in the plot mostly random meandering plot cheesy special effects can be <UNK> given the tv miniseries budget but attempts to create suspense and surprise through distracting cinematography added to the <UNK> i get the feeling that the ending was supposed to be witty and surprising but it was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story if i had to compare it's overall quality to something else i'd put this episode of nightmares and <UNK> on par with the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> horrible i see many user comments on how great this show is it truly is a wanna be friends made in <UNK> <UNK> the jokes are lame as and the plot is ridiculous the actors are obviously struggling to be funny and are probably cringing when they hit those awful <UNK> if you can call them that the bulk of the other users who have commented are obviously from another planet or at least another continent there are obviously reasons that tv companies <UNK> shows and none of then are when shows are doing well make sense anyway steer clear even if it is <UNK> and there is absolutely nothing else on this planet to do go stand in the rain instead more fun
<START> i noticed at once that this movie really wasn't based on <UNK> smith's novel in any case it was a nice idea that <UNK> and <UNK> son now had his own <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> was of course little <UNK> who was completely <UNK> till the very end of the film br br to be honest i didn't know what to think when cruella de <UNK> seemed to have changed completely kind in fact i have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly but now that she so quickly changed into herself again and announced that she was cruella once more i almost began to be really worried about <UNK> <UNK> br br actually the scene in which the <UNK> watched lady and the tramp while chloe and kevin had their dinner was much better than i had expected i also was fond of the parrot who played to be a dog and it was incredible that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie br br of course i was content that at the end the <UNK> were saved again but i would have liked to know what was going to happen to cruella after she had lost her whole property and what on earth could the <UNK> home do with such a huge sum of money br br finally it was quite touching that <UNK> also had spots at the very end of the film
<START> i'm a huge randolph scott fan but this film is a dud the whole thing has a <UNK> fake <UNK> feel to it with truly awful rear screen projection it has a good plot idea that the screenwriter has successfully buried in a <UNK> script which makes it impossible for the audience to become immersed in the action and truly care about any of the characters the directing is pedestrian and only <UNK> how bad the script is instead of helping to improve it i've seen plenty of thoroughly enjoyable <UNK> productions before but this is not one of them all it does is make you appreciate the gritty scott <UNK> films all the more br br randolph scott is <UNK> <UNK> and shines that million dollar smile throughout he's always a pleasure even in the worst of his films aside from scott the other main reason i wanted to see this movie was due to how much i enjoyed ms <UNK> in errol <UNK> movie rocky <UNK> in man behind the gun she is just as beautiful and you can tell she's a good actress but she was forced to say some pretty dumb lines and the <UNK> she was given by the director was truly awful i've only seen phil carey in operation pacific and he plays the exact same character here an arrogant pain in the butt you want to beat into <UNK> i guess it proves he's a good actor he made me hate him there are some lame attempts at comic relief that only detract from the film in my opinion although there are many elements to knock i must say that i found myself truly enjoying the two spanish songs sung in the musical numbers but that's not why we go to see randolph scott movies right br br there are definitely worse scott films out there and this one certainly isn't unbearable but it also certainly couldn't be deemed anything beyond mediocre
<START> i have to say that i used to be a huge fan of the series the first 3 were great and the others had their moments but this new <UNK> house is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it is a shame since this was a great series and it just keeps getting worse i know they are made for dvd films but some effort would be nice br br there are no laughs just a couple of good one liners that will bring a smile if that there is pretty of nudity and very hot chicks but neither the sexy stuff nor the jokes really work br br to add to all that this is a racist film too or as racist of a film one can make without asking to be called racist i am not one of those people who think everything should be politically correct but the portrayal of <UNK> is very offensive br br i wouldn't waste any time on this garbage see the previous versions they will make you laugh not sick
<START> tales from the crypt and all through the house starts on christmas eve as elizabeth mary ellen <UNK> kills her husband joseph marshall bell she drags his body outside ready to throw it down a well but while doing so misses an important news <UNK> on the radio that says a homicidal maniac larry drake dressed as santa <UNK> has escaped from a local mental asylum has already killed several women with elizabeth next on his list but she has other ideas tries to turn the seemingly dangerous situation to her advantage br br this tales from the crypt story was episode 2 from season 1 directed by the one of the show's regular executive producers robert <UNK> and all through the house is a decent enough watch the script by fred <UNK> was actually based on a story appearing in the comic 'the vault of <UNK> was originally adapted to film as one episode from the <UNK> horror anthology film tales from the crypt 1972 which starred joan collins as the murderous wife character here played by ellen <UNK> this particular version is good enough but doesn't do anything different or special is a bit too linear predictable to be considered a classic at only 25 minutes in length it certainly moves along at a good pace the story is just about macabre enough it generally provides decent entertainment i quite liked the downbeat ending this time there are christmas themed opening closing crypt keeper john <UNK> segments complete with the usual <UNK> br br director <UNK> does a good job there's a nice <UNK> atmosphere with a hint of christmas influence as well there's not much gore here someone has a poker stuck in their head someone's face is cut with an <UNK> someone's arm is cut with an axe there's some blood splatter but generally speaking it's not that graphic the acting by a small cast is pretty good br br and all through the house isn't the best tale from the crypt but it's a decent one all the same worth a watch but after the comic book story original 1972 film version did we really need or even want this
<START> make a 0 you <UNK> of german <UNK> well when i started to watch this sack of <UNK> it was a sunday afternoon and i was just looking for stuff on show time i was introduced to a hot naked babe and like any guy im a guy the e mail is my sisters i was happy but then they threw it all to the dogs spit on it lit it on fire and <UNK> it out you wanna know how the dumb chick talked the dialog throughout the film was just horrible sounded like something my 2nd grade <UNK> could wright the violence was nice for some scenes but some was just totally moronic the scene in the pit were he gives the guy the knife dumb moron to sum it up this is pure cinema <UNK> <UNK> in the chocolate <UNK> known as nudity and topped with the <UNK> of horrible acting as only a porn star could deliver
<START> <UNK> best out and out action film it is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters solid performances and <UNK> <UNK> direction is <UNK> assured stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes this was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the 90's a definite genre classic as a stallone fan this is one i look back on with fond memories plenty of superb action and sly in prime action man form action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the <UNK> that make a good <UNK> film the film looks great and there is great support from <UNK> turner michael <UNK> and john <UNK>
<START> if you played spider man on the ps version then you've seen it all to truly experience it you should get the <UNK> version simply put it's a much <UNK> superior game the <UNK> are sharp levels are easy to <UNK> and it has much better sound then it's ps cousin i bought this game back in late <UNK> and it still holds up even till this day well marvel ultimate alliance is a much superior and <UNK> game but if you're a fan of <UNK> web head then you owe it yourself to pick this up for your <UNK> library swinging around the city as <UNK> has never looked this good and dead on in a video game if you have a <UNK> <UNK> this up for cheap the <UNK> version is simply incredible

<START> i saw this when it premiered and just re watched it on <UNK> again this is a great telling of the many possible stories about the immigrant <UNK> population that came to <UNK> to work the sugar <UNK> in the early <UNK> my grandparents were part of that <UNK> my parents were born on a <UNK> plantation big island at the time setting of the movie i moved to the big island over a year ago after living in california for over 30 years i was surprised to see that many of the former <UNK> growing lands are still undeveloped with wild <UNK> still growing years after the <UNK> closed i've heard many stories from my aunts and <UNK> who were kids growing up on the plantation this movie helps to image those kinds of stories and memories this story is more of an historical document than a romantic plot driven movie it leaves me shaking my head to read a review like <UNK> some people just don't get it br br i didn't recall that <UNK> <UNK> had the starring role with which she did an incredible job i recall her great performances in jim <UNK> mystery train and in an australian film co starring with russell <UNK> <UNK> burning <UNK> <UNK> did a great job with her <UNK> english especially for someone who didn't grow up in the islands i had forgotten that <UNK> <UNK> had a cameo role as the moving picture show narrator and i missed the fact that jason scott lee had an uncredited non speaking part as one of the plantation workers during the <UNK> scene br br i was <UNK> to find out that the director and co writer <UNK> <UNK> died in an accidental drowning in 2005 br br there are two other excellent foreign films that mirror this <UNK> plantation experience <UNK> about the immigrant <UNK> workers in brazil many of them japanese in the same time period and sugar <UNK> alley about the <UNK> plantation experience in africa the latter is still available but <UNK> sadly doesn't appear to have been shown in quite a while another great film about the early asian in america experience when immigrants were more like slaves is a thousand pieces of gold this was set over the chinese <UNK> involvement in the building of the <UNK> starred <UNK> <UNK> chris cooper michael paul chan and dennis <UNK>
<START> warning spoilers a really stupid movie about a group of young <UNK> in italy that find an armor of mythical warrior with a demonic souls one of them wears it and becomes possessed by the spirit of a demon it's killing time and several of his friends die under his blade to revive the demon corpse br br a waste of time for the viewers as the fine young ladies in the movie leave their clothes on the gore is ludicrous at best and the acting is terrible perfect pairing for such a bad script br br
<START> pecker is a hilariously funny yet twisted film about a small town in <UNK> whose daily <UNK> routine is broken by pecker a young photographer who takes pictures of real things no pretty models no gorgeous men just hard living this wonderful film <UNK> fun at the <UNK> of the urban art chain there is one particular scene when a homeless woman who <UNK> at <UNK> mom's <UNK> shop buys the same exact coat as one of the <UNK> art <UNK> for only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars this just goes to show you that no matter what kind of money you have you might not always have taste yet again john waters sends you into a never ending spiral of laughter and raw reality you can have your mainstream hollywood movies with special affects and mountains of celebrities but give me a pecker or a <UNK> another excellent john waters film over a titanic or a godzilla <UNK>
<START> ok i watch a lot of bad movies i pride myself on that fact many times there are some gems in the b rated bombs but this movie is one of the worst i have watched i like a good horror movie but one with a plot of and sense of movement the opening scenes seemed pretty good decent music and imagery then it goes down hill from there one of the main characters has a <UNK> <UNK> in the ears called <UNK> now this will in turn <UNK> to reveal his secret they made that too much of a focus of the movie so what he has <UNK> in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where that he shouldn't have been no need to keep bringing it up so this guy is having an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the end table so instead of letting everyone know of his affair he decides to dump the body now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her well after seeing her sister over and over again as a zombie like ghost and even pointing directly to the location of the body she finally finds her now the body is <UNK> and she is set out to deal with the one and only suspect that killed her bad thing is that she didn't have much of a plan only to pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the body was dumped the idiot didn't even believe he killed her so all is revealed there and even though she had a gun somehow she manages to get herself <UNK> so the last scenes of the movie are of the spirits of her and her twin walking out of the water so you mean to tell me in this movie the bad guy wins and not one but two innocent people die br br good things about the movie imagery br br bad things about the movie music sound effects long and drawn out <UNK> of plot low grade acting from some not all actors
<START> as of this writing john carpenter's <UNK> is <UNK> it's <UNK> <UNK> it has since <UNK> 7 sequels a remake a whole mess of <UNK> and every year around halloween when they do those <UNK> 10 scariest <UNK> lists it's always on there that's quite amazing for a film that was made on a budget of around 300 000 and featured a then almost completely unknown cast of up and coming young talent i could go on and on but the big question here is how does the film hold up today and all i can say to that is fantastically br br pros a simple but spooky opening credits sequence that really sets the mood an unforgettable and <UNK> inducing score by director co writer john carpenter and alan <UNK> great cinematography stellar direction by carpenter who keeps the suspense high gets some great shots and is careful not to show too much of his villain good performances from the then mostly unknown cast a good sense of humor michael myers is one scary evil guy a lot of eerie moments that'll stay with you the pace is slow but steady and never drags unlike most other slasher films this one is more about suspense and terror than blood and a big body count br br cons probably not nearly as scary now as it was then many of the goofs really stand out br br final thoughts i want to start out this section by saying this is not my favorite film in the series i know that's not a popular opinion but it's really how i feel despite that it truly is an important film that keeps reaching new generations of film buffs and just because it's been remade for a new generation doesn't mean it'll be forgotten no way no how br br my rating 5 5
<START> this film was a critical and box office fiasco back in 1957 it was based on a novel which was later turned into a play which <UNK> on broadway the story is about some navy officers on leave in san francisco during wwii they have 4 day's leave which they spend at the mark hopkins hotel the film <UNK> a lot and none of the characters seem very real cary grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama but here he plays a sort of <UNK> dealer and he doesn't really pull it off tony curtis or james garner would have been better choices audrey hepburn was initially set to play opposite grant but had other <UNK> so <UNK> parker stepped in she had never acted before but was america's top <UNK> model at the time i think that she did a good job considering all the pressure that she was under <UNK> pairing with <UNK> <UNK> in a few brief scenes did not really work the studio was trying to give her some class by acting with grant but the character had no substance at all
<START> i think that most everyone wants to believe that extraordinary things exist and this film shows no restraint in trying to exploit that to the <UNK> the presentation is very interesting well presented and the graphics are state of the art but from a scientific point of view it just doesn't work <UNK> filled flying <UNK> they would need to be the size of a mack truck to be useful and then there's the ever present possibility of a <UNK> explosion i have no problem with fantasy just don't try to pass it off as fact some folks will always <UNK> all in all the film is entertaining but i constantly found myself saying oh brother what a load of if you want a fake documentary watch this is spinal tap instead or at the very least turn the sound off
<START> i have been watching this show since i was 14 and i've loved it ever since i love this show because it's just plain funny you will enjoy this show a lot because it shows something new and funnier everyday and my favorite part is when benny always has her last comments on george after every punchline about his fat giant head laughs i would laugh and i'd watch it with my friends at home it'd be like we were watching a funny movie but short love george lopez funny talented funny spectacular this is a cool funny family comedy series enjoyable to everyone and you will definitely enjoy it i did and if you haven't watched it yet i suggest that you start watching because you wouldn't want to stop watching it even though there aren't anymore brand new episodes i still enjoy the re runs still funny never wears off br br 9 10
<START> another spanish movie about the 1936 civil war this time we're told about the story of carol lovely played by <UNK> clara <UNK> a little girl which comes to live to a little spanish village from new york it is such an <UNK> trip and soon she'll find about the <UNK> of the human race their stupid fights and conflicts their <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> makes his best film since <UNK> <UNK> 1994 with such a sober pulse a beautiful photography and a nice script he tries not to take part in the conflict he just shows us some facts and let us decide ok the facts are explicit enough to make us decide in which band are we in and he takes a huge advantage of the presence and the <UNK> of the young starring couple clara <UNK> and juan <UNK> <UNK> br br a well cared production br br my rate 7 10
<START> i felt <UNK> <UNK> was a complete waste of two hours the plot line was thin and confusing the <UNK> line up of players had some terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents the camera work was somewhat experimental in places and although it could be seen what the director was trying to convey it just made it even more difficult to watch one of the most annoying aspects of <UNK> <UNK> is the over use of narration throughout the film almost like the entire plot is being <UNK> to the audience the best performances weren't anything to do with acting in fact probably the most convincing performance came from dani <UNK> of all people although admittedly does play the stereotypical office secretary do not under any <UNK> go and see this movie unless you need a reason to catch up on some lost sleep there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned cash
<START> it seems a lot of imdb comments on this film are biased in the sense that they try to compare it to an older version true hollow man is a remake of sorts of the invisible man but that's where the similarities end hollow man is an entertaining movie period if you watch a movie with the intention of finding as many flaws as possible then you shouldn't watch movies in the first place true some movies are plain horrendous and unbearable but hollow man manages to entertain and make you think what you would do if you were invisible and if you had your ex getting laid with one of your friends kevin bacon stars as a eccentric scientist who along with a team of <UNK> discover the way to make animals invisible now his mission is to make them visible again when this team of young scientists working as you might guess for the <UNK> think they have the formula for making animals visible again kevin bacon <UNK> to be the first to try the new experimental drug after that of course things go wrong as kevin bacon remains invisible for the rest of the movie and is <UNK> to wear a <UNK> mask so his <UNK> know where he is feelings of paranoia and desperation begin to take over <UNK> character and when he finds out that his ex girlfriend and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is having a <UNK> affair with another of the young scientists in the team he finally <UNK> the movie then turns into a hybrid of alien and a slasher flick but that's not saying it's a bad turn there are scares and chills and the movie moves at a nice pace the special effects are top notch a quality always prevalent in all of paul verhoeven's films as we get to see some body <UNK> sequences never seen on a movie before if there's anything to complain about perhaps is the predictability of the situations <UNK> by the first hour of the movie you know kevin bacon will make the jump from being weird and eccentric to being a homicidal lunatic in the end and the ending is a bit abrupt but despite this hollow man is still worth watching if you want to know what a truly bad movie is then waste your money on fear <UNK> com with stephen <UNK> or the even worse the <UNK> or <UNK> with land <UNK> now that is hollow 8 out of 10
<START> dull <UNK> directed comedy has zero laughs and wastes a great cast alan <UNK> wore too many hats on this one and it shows newcomer anthony <UNK> provides the only spark of life in this tedium but it's not enough br br one of those scripts that if you were a <UNK> and <UNK> it to an agent or producer would be ripped to <UNK> and rejected without discussion
<START> the only good thing about this movie was the shot of goldie hawn standing in her little french cut bikini <UNK> and struggling to keep a dozen other <UNK> women from <UNK> her skimpy little <UNK> top while she <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> her <UNK> rival those of nina hartley this movie came out when i was <UNK> and that shot nearly killed me i'd forgotten about it all <UNK> away in the naughty <UNK> of my mind until seeing it the other day on tv where they actually <UNK> her <UNK> in that scene good grief reminding me what a <UNK> <UNK> of a woman goldie hawn was in the '80s kurt russell must have had a fun life
<START> although in many ways i agree with the other reviewers comments i find that the plot and idea are very good many of the supporting actors were very good the fatal problem with this film is ellen <UNK> i am sure i have never seen a less talented actor how this person has ever been in a film or on television i cannot imagine in my opinion she would be better as a greater at a wal mart to see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles does beg the question who does she know i would very much like to see this film re made with some talent i do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it
<START> a <UNK> sub culture of los angeles serves as backdrop for this low budget and <UNK> constructed mess <UNK> a vanity piece for its top billed player <UNK> <UNK> who also produces and scripts while performing a <UNK> role as twin sisters vanessa and <UNK> a question soon develops as to whether or not some rather <UNK> camera lighting and editing <UNK> can ever reach a point of connection to a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a <UNK> viewer <UNK> is employed as a highly motivated <UNK> officer for the county of los angeles while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure within her <UNK> world largely because of erotic performances upon cd <UNK> but when disaster <UNK> mistress vanessa <UNK> <UNK> determined to <UNK> her sister's vicious <UNK> begins a new job as a sex slave at the private castle club where the <UNK> of the house is a <UNK> party two fbi field agents whose <UNK> to the vanessa case is ostensibly required due to her involvement with internet <UNK> sites in addition to a los angeles police department homicide detective are assigned to investigate the crime while <UNK> to provide security for <UNK> whose enthusiastic performance in her new <UNK> is <UNK> enough regarded by her customers as to have created conditions of personal danger for her flaws in logic and continuity abound such as a homicide being <UNK> to l a p d 's <UNK> south <UNK> a region of the metropolis that is far removed from the setting of the film direction is <UNK> and not aided by <UNK> post production editing and sound <UNK> the mentioned <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> montage near the movie's end of prior footage that is but <UNK> <UNK> to the scenario one solid acting turn appears among this <UNK> stan <UNK> as a <UNK> fbi agent
<START> this is one of the worst films i've seen the only positive thing i can say is it was so bad that is seemed comical first off there's no plot the actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the dumbest things such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends also the zombies were terrible no where near as fun as any of romero's work who gets s plug in the movie and the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences like we don't get the video game is about shooting zombies also all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun and the way the people die is so stupid it's like they run out of <UNK> so stand around waiting to be jumped on and when <UNK> in front of the house they run out of <UNK> instead of shooting the door open so dumb br br final verdict if any of these actors appear in another film then they've been blessed with a second chance definitely the worst film i've seen in years a b movie on <UNK> is better
<START> i had no expectations other than to be entertained for 90 minutes and that is exactly what i was br br of course it is campy of course some of the dialog wasn't perfect of course the special effects were a bit hokey that is exactly why i enjoyed the movie so much it is a perfect fit for this genre of a 70's horror classic br br the talent needs to start some where that goes for the actors and the crew and what better piece of material to <UNK> your skills on than this br br i for one look forward to another film from these producers and directors
<START> <UNK> comedy drama an unhappy seemingly rushed affair featuring cher as a <UNK> housewife who slowly makes friends with the hit man who's been hired to kill her by her husband <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> hired gun adapted the screenplay from his own play with <UNK> set ups and back and forth dialogue that quickly <UNK> the eye and ear an air of <UNK> hangs over the entire project and director paul <UNK> can't get cher out of her <UNK> <UNK> she's <UNK> despite all the top talent including robert de niro as one of the producers faithful is <UNK> with no substance to the story and characters who rarely come to life 1 2 from
<START> this movie was nominated for best picture but lost out to casablanca but paul lukas beat out <UNK> bogart for best actor i don't see why <UNK> watson was nominated for best supporting actor i just don't think she did a very good job bette davis and paul lukas and their three kids are leaving mexico and coming into the united states in the first scene of the movie they are going by train to <UNK> relatives house davis and lukas were in the underground to stop the nazis so they are very tired and need rest but when they arrive home their is a nazi living there and <UNK> not much either can do about it it turns out the nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with lukas their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself
<START> i can honestly say i never expected this movie to be good i do not like family films i am far from a fan of shahid kapoor the director's last movie <UNK> was complete stupidity and the music was very boring and bland but there was amrita <UNK> who has become my favorite after main <UNK> <UNK> there was also <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who are very talented so a few plus points br br i finally saw the movie and i was very impressed he brings us the young lovers of <UNK> with a <UNK> of the <UNK> wedding and we have a winner the story outline is similar to <UNK> light hearted in the beginning to serious mode at the end the director also made character that you could relate to the thing i did not like about <UNK> was that the characters were too eccentric the casting adds to its perfection shahid kapoor surprised me with a good performance this is a major improvement and most importantly he suits the role the best is easily amrita <UNK> in fact this is her best performance her screen presence is so <UNK> you are bound to love her performance <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> cast not one actor feels out of place br br the songs were quite disappointing but they will sound better after watching them <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and do <UNK> <UNK> are nice <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is also nice in watching the songs aren't colorful and <UNK> and they are more like <UNK> the exception is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which is bound to remind you of <UNK> and <UNK> so what was the flaw in the movie the movie gets quite slow and the ending is quite stretched but the movie is still goes at a good pace making it a perfect family film
<START> i know that there are some <UNK> out there who poo poo anything that is not exactly like the original however sometimes spin offs can stand on their own merits i like the new iron chef because it is similar enough to the japanese version but at the same time <UNK> to american spirit i love <UNK> brown as <UNK> because he explains things with flair the iron <UNK> themselves are very interesting i know the originals were probably the best <UNK> on the planet at the time but bobby <UNK> is the only american iron chef to beat them mario <UNK> seems to have the most fun when cooking making comments and being flashy while creating i have watched the series and find all the players work together well the judges are not always the best choices however there are a few exceptions like the lawyer turned <UNK> but most of the judges are questionable in being able to handle what is served i enjoy watching the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> are surprising the food at the end always looks amazing and sometimes it <UNK> me in the kitchen perhaps that is all anyone can ask to want to really eat what is served the only thing i would really change about the series is to ask folks on the show to <UNK> up a little sometimes the mood becomes a bit too tense and that isn't always fun to watch when you are expecting more amusement i liked the version with william shatner iron chef usa because it was so over the top like the original but i can tell it was a pretty expensive <UNK> i wish he had stayed with this version and been the host between bill shatner and <UNK> brown that would have me <UNK> for an hour as long as you don't expect the original japanese version and can accept this series on its own merits you may find it to be an enjoyable hour
<START> within the first few minutes of this dutch thriller we learn that <UNK> is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps sans underwear <UNK> about murdering his roommate tries to steal a magazine from a news stand and <UNK> after a <UNK> young man he meets at the train station and he's the hero of this nonsensical movie that is all dressed up except for <UNK> in at least one scene too many but has nowhere to go the basic plot is very simple but is dragged out to nearly two hours before reaching a pointless conclusion verhoeven has a nice visual flair but <UNK> to scenes of wild hallucinations overt symbolism and gratuitous gore when he runs out of ideas
<START> one of those el <UNK> action adventures of the early 1980s that used to fill video rental stores solely to be taken out by adolescent boys in the hope of a cheap thrill br br <UNK> down market attempt to cash in on the death wish phenomenon by <UNK> a moderately attractive woman for the visually challenging bronson acting is terrible sets are cheap the baddies are well bad <UNK> with any of the characters is unlikely br br only redeeming feature is modest amount of gratuitous female nudity a <UNK> of which is full frontal other than that you can leave it
<START> i think lion king 1 1 2 is one of the best sequels ever as if not the best out of the three lion king movies in the movie timon and pumbaa tell us where they came from and having trouble fitting in with others such as timon having trouble digging <UNK> with other <UNK> timon and pumbaa journey off into finding their dream place and find it and soon find it and also <UNK> who they raise but soon they must choose between their dream place or helping <UNK> face his evil uncle <UNK> and <UNK> his right as the lion king of pride rock filled with wonderful new characters like <UNK> ma julie <UNK> and uncle max jerry stiller i think my favorite character was uncle max because he was very <UNK> and was voiced by a <UNK> comedian jerry stiller the father of ben stiller disney was smart to cast stiller in that role filled with wonderful characters animation and story and music lion king 1 1 2 is in my opinion the best of any sequel and better than <UNK> pride even though i will admit i really did like that one too lion king 1 1 2 is a great disney sequel the whole family can enjoy it's got a good story and is very <UNK> 10 out of 10
<START> as has been well documented by previous posters the real stars of <UNK> <UNK> and indeed it's sequel <UNK> <UNK> are paul <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jim <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> don't know who they are they are the awesome tight <UNK> house band whose music <UNK> and talent made this show something more than a sad american idol clone br br remember the strings night that was musical <UNK> and perfection if ever i've seen it <UNK> <UNK> epic rendition of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> memorable cover of the <UNK> <UNK> can't always get ' <UNK> fortune singing suspicious minds the common <UNK> here is the awesome house band br br as good as <UNK> were in their prime they are sadly a shadow of their former <UNK> though <UNK> live performance has somewhat <UNK> new life into their music this show is all about the <UNK> br br <UNK> to producers season three if we're blessed enough to have it happen should be <UNK> house band get those boys a good lead singer and they are going places
<START> i didn't expect much from this film but oh brother what a stinker br br i found this gem in a giant <UNK> of awful 5 dvd's at <UNK> where else as cheap as this disc was i feel ripped off the special effects had a high school look to them the camera work marred by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> lighting and the acting was a perfect example of the <UNK> <UNK> one can imagine the long and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by the production company after seeing the rushes come back the people who <UNK> this thing must have had seriously anti biblical feelings towards the inept production company that <UNK> this thing out think of their anguish as they saw their <UNK> <UNK> investment go up in smoke br br someone asked why christian movies are so bad perhaps the <UNK> film makers need to look at good movies and attempt to copy some of the things that make them so good believable stories and characters less hysterical arm waving and <UNK> oh and a story that appeals to everyone not just true <UNK> i e stop the <UNK> save it for church take the omen or <UNK> series for example excellent films with compelling story lines great cinematography and intense music no hysterical arm waving no preaching br br if this film had a laugh track it would have been much better
<START> truly a disgusting vile film with only a small amount of real humour br br the character of the father in particular is vulgar in the extreme intentionally so obviously and portrayed in the most pathetic seedy manner br br my wife and i found this film horribly <UNK> with absolutely no redeeming features at all frankly i wish i had never seen it br br i consider this british effort to be a sick and gross embarrassment br br those who enjoyed this film have an ability i totally lack that of <UNK> in a display of deep <UNK> and <UNK> br br the producers should be ashamed of themselves
<START> it is wonderful to watch <UNK> seth the strict father in 1992 <UNK> <UNK> who once again takes on the role of a father and head of the family and more in such a long journey set in 1971 <UNK> india besides the closely <UNK> family settings subject matters include the lost and found of a friendship the unexpected death of a friend somehow the calm smiling face of a friend in death in the presence of <UNK> felt peaceful so <UNK> noble <UNK> character similarly noted a sidewalk <UNK> chain of events the wall as a <UNK> turned into a <UNK> into <UNK> and <UNK> was at once <UNK> and philosophical it's packed full of life lessons in different aspects of varying relationships between father and son mother and son father and little daughter little daughter and father and mother longtime colleagues long lost dear friends even that of a man to man one whose an innocent slow witted fool br br in spite of the tone of the film's era it's a colorful film rich in substance and the strength of the story in <UNK> layers with humor and suspense for a director who is not indian <UNK> <UNK> being <UNK> he's made a political indian <UNK> film he gets into the bone <UNK> of the life of this <UNK> portrayed by <UNK> seth whose performance has such nuances subtlety and joy there is singing too the rest of the cast is equally strong from <UNK> <UNK> the mysterious friend of a friend <UNK> <UNK> the enduring wife <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> son sam <UNK> the longtime office mate <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> artist to a <UNK> witch woman of a neighbor an <UNK> fool of a man and a long lost <UNK> friend it's a world of many faces and perspectives director <UNK> has demonstrated sensitivity in the treatment of that time period and subject was well <UNK> with attention to details he has the good fortune to have <UNK> <UNK> 1992 <UNK> <UNK> 1988 <UNK> <UNK> wrote the script this is truly a worthwhile journey of a film to <UNK> br br along the lines of cultural exploration road movie style <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1994 cold fever is an <UNK> <UNK> about a japanese young man who went across the globe in search of the specific spot to pay his last respects to his parents <UNK> following <UNK> <UNK> for the dead such demonstrated <UNK> and cross cultural attention to family ties are heart warming in this day and <UNK> age
<START> i agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film i found it incredibly silly at best and downright misleading <UNK> and <UNK> at worst like others i found this film to be an awful mix of real science and <UNK> new age propaganda br br as a psychologist i was especially offended by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> true i was not a fan of hers before this film but her <UNK> on the consciousness of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term consciousness that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than <UNK> it is an old <UNK> mind f k that the master himself described so well in his superb <UNK> politics and the english language to refer to consciousness in this manner indeed to refer to this film as based in science in general which is its clear intent is to use language in the same manner employed by <UNK> when he labeled his slave states <UNK> <UNK> and hitler when he called his party a <UNK> workers movement br br i don't claim to really understand quantum physics i know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study ah but we americans do love instant enlightenment and that's what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish if it asked questions that would be one thing but it clearly attempts to ask and answer them which no film could possibly do simply because we are far far away from the answers if they indeed exist br br by the way <UNK> this film needed a <UNK> about the association of several expert <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> not to mention j z knight who often speaks in her <UNK> voice i'm always amazed at this <UNK> 10 000 year old <UNK> <UNK> grasp of 21st century concepts and <UNK> but then again this film <UNK> that the past present and future are all one and the same so if <UNK> existed in atlantis 10 000 years ago i suppose he could exist now and tomorrow only then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers oh i forgot i'm the creator of good and bad advice so it's all my fault not <UNK> br br what a mess
<START> this is a bit of a puzzle for a lot of the artsy lynch crowd they tend to try to write this off as some kind of meaningless crude side project of lynch's like this is lynch passing gas between his real pieces of film art well it may be a fart but its one of those intriguing <UNK> that you catch of a <UNK> of and are embarrassed to admit you enjoy br br <UNK> <UNK> down beyond this is art what can you do with aspects of modern life but laugh at it if you took it seriously you would go nuts you hook into it smell it taste it feel its <UNK> its <UNK> <UNK> and then express it in any medium you choose thats called art and art isn't dumb but it is <UNK>
<START> <UNK> by critics at the time but loved by the fans this film has now become a classic mixing supposedly <UNK> footage shot at john <UNK> home among other places with live footage of marc <UNK> t rex at their very best this film is not just a must for everyone who's liked marc <UNK> but gives a fascinating insight into the era br br these were the times when marc was <UNK> with the likes of <UNK> <UNK> of the beatles who directed it and you can even find a brief spot from one <UNK> dwight <UNK> john to you bashing the <UNK> in an amazing and never officially released version of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> versions of children of the revolution br br there's also wonderful scenes featuring <UNK> <UNK> said to have <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with her use of <UNK> etc mickey <UNK> and even the actor from <UNK> br br the best scene for me is in the garden when marc leaves the <UNK> table sits down cross <UNK> in front of a string section and knocks out <UNK> versions of classics such as get it on and the <UNK> br br highly highly recommended five stars out of five br br <UNK>
<START> i'm surprised at the comments from posters stating that jane powell made the same type of films deanna durbin did although they were both young sopranos whose film images were crafted by joe <UNK> if this film is any indication they were almost polar <UNK> br br while in three smart girls durbin plays an <UNK> little miss <UNK> who after some <UNK> manages to reunite her divorced parents in its' semi remake three daring daughters jane powell almost destroys the marriage between her screen mom <UNK> macdonald and new <UNK> jose iturbi when she refuses to accept him and strong arms her younger siblings into <UNK> him too from the durbin and powell films i've seen i'd say these <UNK> qualities <UNK> the early films of both of these talented young performers br br as for <UNK> performance in three smart girls i find it completely winning and most impressive although it's clear from her occasionally shrill and over <UNK> line <UNK> in some of the more energetic scenes that this is an early film for deanna watching the self confident knowing and naturally <UNK> manner in which she delivers her lines and performs overall and the subdued and tender manner she projects the more serious scenes you'd never guess that this was the first film role of a 14 year old girl whose prior professional experience consisted almost exclusively of two years of vocal <UNK> br br given that this film and durbin herself were much <UNK> at the time as <UNK> last chance the production must have been an <UNK> <UNK> situation for a film <UNK> of any age but you'd never know it from the ease and <UNK> durbin displays on screen although she's clearly still developing her acting style and demeanor before the camera this was equally true of the early performances of much more experienced <UNK> like garland rooney <UNK> and jane powell durbin projects an extraordinary presence and warmth on camera that is absolutely unique to her and even here in her first film she manages to remain immensely likable despite the often quick <UNK> <UNK> of her character and though she's occasionally shrill she never for a second projects the <UNK> and arch qualities that <UNK> many child stars including jane powell and some of the other young sopranos who followed in the wake of her success br br in short like all great singing stars durbin was much more than just a beautiful voice on the other hand while <UNK> pure <UNK> soprano is a truly remarkable and glorious <UNK> the most remarkable thing about it to me was the way she is able to project her songs without the slightest bit of <UNK> or <UNK> that <UNK> the singing of adult opera singers like lily <UNK> grace moore and <UNK> macdonald in films of the period br br the film is also delightful heavily influenced by screwball comedy it backs durbin up with a <UNK> de la <UNK> of first class screwball pros such as charles <UNK> <UNK> barnes alice brady ray <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the story is light and entertaining true it's hardly realistic but why would anyone expect it to be if you want realistic rent the <UNK> of wrath or triumph of the will on the other hand if you're looking for a genuine sweet funny and entertaining family comedy with a wonderfully charismatic and gifted adolescent lead and terrific supporting players this film won't let you down
<START> i'm glad that this is available on dvd now this film is an excellent example of the triumph of content style over empty headed flashing lights constant loud noises br br essentially if you have a short attention span or lack the wit imagination to engage with literary narrative you won't like this film the reasons for this are quite simple but unfortunately rarely achieved matthew <UNK> has done a fantastic job of <UNK> the story of catherine <UNK> novel <UNK> <UNK> successfully to a screenplay an <UNK> task as anyone who has seen a film of a book will undoubtedly know br br the casting is excellent allowing director bernard rose to use the actors in a way that is rarely seen now they <UNK> in the craft of acting i know i know actors doing their job acting instead of <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> at the camera lens <UNK> a <UNK> of car chases explosions fire fights break out around them is a genuinely rare treat but it does actually happen in this film br br this brings me to the final reason that this is a film for the imaginative <UNK> not the <UNK> fed <UNK> reader apart from a solid script direction acting it relies on atmosphere suspense implied horror if it is to be <UNK> as horror then the presentation of <UNK> <UNK> is more in the vein of <UNK> than tobe hooper br br in conclusion then if you like lots of loud noises explosions constant cuts bright flashing colours you'd be better off watching <UNK> but if you like a suspenseful story which unfolds through a <UNK> <UNK> use of narrative without insulting your intelligence by force feeding you <UNK> nonsense then this might just be your thing
<START> pickup on south street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made an example of the directing when candy jean peters starts going through her purse and notices her <UNK> is missing an alarm goes off in the background in the building she's in as if it's an alarm going off in her head it's not cartoon like it's subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a <UNK> level until you've seen the film a few times and it just <UNK> that there's an alarm bell going off when she starts <UNK> going through her bag br br richard widmark is way on top of his game as a smart alec he's really great but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for moe the street <UNK> informer played by thelma ritter later in her apartment you are not seeing a movie you're seeing a real person i've never seen anyone act so real i felt like i was looking into a real room until <UNK> performance right down to the way her hair stuck out a bit when she removed her hat br br about a million other things just worked from the way lightning <UNK> picks up money with his <UNK> to the way <UNK> jewelry <UNK> when she flicks <UNK> hand away from her <UNK> to the way moe gets the dollars and change from the police captain across the fbi guy's chest and even the way the captain opens his <UNK> <UNK> like he's been doing it in that way in that room for many years pickup on south street is detailed moves directing with <UNK> performances acting and superb now nostalgic visuals of the day such as the <UNK> truck the boards leading to the shack out on the water the <UNK> and the unforgettable place skip <UNK> his pocket <UNK> wonderful stuff br br pickup on south street is also one of the few movies where even though the characters aren't perfect you do care about them perhaps because they have been somewhat <UNK> by their <UNK> in ways that are hard to escape skip as a three time loser and candy as a <UNK> woman who has knocked around a lot when these people behave a little more badly than you'd expect it's in sort of novel ways that make it seem you're looking in at people you'd never otherwise imagine and yet you know that they are possible because the actors make them so <UNK> human
<START> i am really surprised that this movie get a <UNK> like this i haven't seen such a bad movie for years <UNK> this was a really bad movie splatter is not enough to describe the unnecessary nearly funny blood scenes if you didn't like <UNK> or wolf creek or halloween 2007 well this is 10 time worse the story remind me <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br i can't tell about the acting since the script was so terrible cliché all the time why i must write <UNK> i never understood this br br here comes spoilers br br the story is about a butcher killing people all the time in <UNK> we are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice actually those people are just missing and there is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy and as usual no one believes him what a surprise in the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher
<START> <UNK> 2000 1 2 out of four br br by blake french br br throughout the years audiences have seen and understood war films with every point of view possible and somehow producers and writers always come up with new and innovative methods of portraying various soldiers on the battlefield joel <UNK> <UNK> a time to kill easily one of the <UNK> directors currently working has found resemblance with the thin red line in the way his new drama <UNK> steps in an individual <UNK> shoes this movie written by ross <UNK> and michael <UNK> has more guts and irony than the thin red line or even saving private ryan although the movie's dramatic impact is somewhat <UNK> due to the <UNK> of the material present it certainly <UNK> us on a new perspective of young men training for war br br i would want to know joel <UNK> experiences with the army are the men really this <UNK> and brutal i am sure some of them are but the movie views its <UNK> world through the eyes of a young man named <UNK> <UNK> colin farrell who is rebellious against the ideas of war his personality instantly <UNK> with several other characters one who becomes his best friend paxton matthew davis and another wilson russell richardson whose <UNK> temper often <UNK> <UNK> tension with the idea of going to war the war depicted in this production is not found on a battlefield but on training grounds of a <UNK> based <UNK> camp between <UNK> and fears of the soldiers in training this film is specifically about the <UNK> for war nothing more nothing less it ends when the soldiers finally go to war kind of disappointing since witnessing the characters in action would have served as a <UNK> payoff br br shot on location in about 28 days using <UNK> stock and a <UNK> budget joel <UNK> accurately displays a gritty perverse cruel and <UNK> atmosphere using hand held cinematography unique lighting techniques and direct sound <UNK> grainy and blown out images make the movie feel like a documentary feature this unusual style of filmmaking only contributes to the hard core realism of the movie quite graphic in its use of coarse language perhaps a little too disturbing waves of four letter words pound the audience some in shock of what they are hearing even the extreme amount of <UNK> does not keep the dialogue from <UNK> as heartbreaking true and emotional br br if anything <UNK> provides us with a minor appreciation of how much our soldiers go through for our country in the beginning stages of combat such bravery must it take to <UNK> in the army during times of war knowing the <UNK> and risks that are being taken such thought provoking ideas are made possible through the heartbreaking performances by the young aspiring actors who portray the various <UNK> this movie is not for all audiences but one that young men should take a look at before <UNK> themselves in the army and adult audiences should watch to appreciate the courage needed to do such br br
<START> gone in 60 <UNK> where do i began it keeps you in the movie with some good action and some cool cars people say its not a good movie i disagree sure it has some cheesy parts but what action movie doesn't i gave it an 8 out of 10 cause of the action and the comic relief if you like the rock or face off than this movie is right up your alley cage dose a good job along with one of the most under rated actors in my mind del roy <UNK> i think sometimes people look to far into movies some times you need to sit back enjoy the movie and after words ask yourself did they achieve what they where showing meaning if they where going for action was it action <UNK> if they where trying to make a movie to change how movies are made and trying to win every award out their well did they i think they made the action movie they set out to make give it a chance and you wont be sorry
<START> ok i really don't have too much to say about this film other than this i have seen over 4 000 films in my life and more than 2 300 of those were horror films while i have some difficulty deciding which is the best as opposed to my favourite which i can tell you is george a romero's dawn of the dead i can tell you without the slightest <UNK> that todd <UNK> zombie bloodbath is the absolute worst horror film i have ever seen br br there is simply nothing positive i can say about this film the acting the dialogue the directing the make up the music every aspect of this film is simply so far below what is acceptable that it <UNK> my mind that this was ever even released br br even if you are a horror or zombie movie <UNK> please <UNK> my warning and do not waste your time on this garbage there is no pleasure to be gotten from viewing this you won't even get any laughs out of the utter <UNK> on display trust me please
<START> i didn't know much about this movie before i watched it but i heard it had something to do with quantum physics so i was interested what i didn't know is that this is not actually a story but a bunch of new age <UNK> who love the sound of their own voice talking about how little they know about basic quantum <UNK> i say it belongs more in the documentary category than comedy or drama br br <UNK> <UNK> is in the movie in order to give this new age <UNK> some sort of a storyline her portions of the film feel horribly tacked on and are meant to display the <UNK> thoughts so we won't die of boredom <UNK> has a real job as a photographer unlike the new age hippie that crashes on her couch we get to listen to <UNK> people <UNK> on about what quantum physics all means to them the one bright spot in this movie was the <UNK> from india i assume but i think he showed up for the wrong film br br it looks like barbara <UNK> really let herself go and she goes on and on about how quantum science has something to do with her crazy new age beliefs it looks like <UNK> from <UNK> was running low on cash and he also makes a brief appearance in the film there is a lot of <UNK> cgi we're supposed to be impressed with cells in the body are shown as dancing <UNK> <UNK> because the filmmakers have apparently seen <UNK> one too many times br br people in the movie say that the <UNK> people on san <UNK> thought <UNK> ship the <UNK> was invisible because natives had never seen <UNK> ships before as if people today had any way possible way of knowing of course they leave out all of that information and just say <UNK> ships were invisible to the indians in america the film takes many such arrogant leaps thomas young did a double <UNK> experiment around <UNK> and found that light can look like a <UNK> some of the time and a wave some of the time of course you'd never know this from watching this stupid film because the only reference to it is that <UNK> can be <UNK> and waves and that must mean that people can pass through walls walk on water and never grow old if they just wish upon a star then i'm sure <UNK> <UNK> could stop being deaf if she just believed hard enough i'm being sarcastic but this film is chock full of false hope and beliefs that the people <UNK> them don't really hold br br these are new age <UNK> who have grabbed onto quantum theory as if it <UNK> everything they believe about <UNK> zero point energy crystal healing etc if these snake oil <UNK> truly believed the crap they were selling couldn't they just wish their <UNK> into existence instead of appearing in this joke of a film we get to listen to another <UNK> man with no <UNK> that we know of talk on his couch in front of a <UNK> or tv screen about how he creates his own life every time he was on the screen i wanted someone to rush in and throw a pie in his face these people take themselves way too seriously some other <UNK> guy in a suit says that nobody ever really touches anything because there's a <UNK> force <UNK> it at the quantum level if only someone had walked onto the screen and kept <UNK> him in the stomach screaming i'm not touching you i'm not touching you a moral <UNK> in the movie claims that there's really no such thing as good or bad so apparently it's ok that hitler <UNK> millions of jews to death another person says that there is no such thing as love it's just a chemical and that we really don't love people we're just addicted to the chemical rush we have when we're around them i suspect this guy is doing this film as community service for being addicted to heroin for so many years br br we are witness to a truly pathetic sequence where two young adults walk around a wedding reception seeing everything like <UNK> they <UNK> if women are <UNK> dogs or <UNK> and a sexual position pops onto the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gets drunk at the wedding she's supposed to photograph and the next day decides to love herself and take a bath because she's a beautiful and unique <UNK> br br i liked when the film said people often find evidence for their pre conceived notions perhaps in this review i'm only seeing what i want to see but i truly wanted to see these people get <UNK> to the face and it never happened br br if you've never heard of any of the ideas presented in the film before you may find them interesting but there are better sources for all of the ideas here if you want to watch a good movie that talks about the <UNK> <UNK> principle go see the man who wasn't there if you want to read a good book about quantum field theory read <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> if you want to see a film that talks about different <UNK> with imaginative visuals see waking life although it can feel boring self important and pretentious at times all in all you should go and read quantum psychology or <UNK> rising by robert anton wilson instead of wasting your time on this movie br br i normally have a very hard time giving movies a score from 1 to 10 but this one was a very easy for me 1 10 stars br br the movie's title is true the people in this film don't know hands down the worst movie i've ever seen
<START> overall performance at last the long waiting <UNK> hits the screens unfortunately it couldn't set <UNK> fire in the audience the first best thing to talk about the movie is the idea of <UNK> the mighty sholay and <UNK> made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie if he repeated the same <UNK> backdrop people will again say there is nothing new in this different background is <UNK> but the way he presented it is not worthy right from the start of his career with <UNK> in <UNK> he had been using the same lighting and kind of background i seriously <UNK> this guy <UNK> considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis godfather it's all dutch dutch dutch dutch why would some body use so many dutch angles and extreme <UNK> shots the shot division is lame characters couldn't carry an emotion performances are not to their mark storytelling is worse background is really really terrible br br <UNK> <UNK> been over <UNK> to his job <UNK> produced great villains like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but this time he failed in <UNK> the all time best characters of hindi cinema there's no comparison of <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> is a more psycho rather than a villain still he has a soft corner for his brother it's a gift in this movie <UNK> performance is not to his mark his appearance itself is pathetic the <UNK> on his nose <UNK> forgotten villains of black and white cinema what ever they worked on <UNK> is not successful <UNK> is no comparison with <UNK> br br <UNK> the first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands if <UNK> did that it would be like teaching <UNK> to a bachelor degree <UNK> <UNK> good he opened the secret early but the flashback is pathetic <UNK> couldn't use a great actor like <UNK> to his mark br br <UNK> the only character with <UNK> this character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story br br <UNK> raj <UNK> no body bothers or at least considers these character the utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our <UNK> these characters carry nothing to this movie br br <UNK> his quality is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> totally can be treated as a c grade movie sholay is a fire of revenge problem of a town meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated <UNK> and fun by <UNK> <UNK> never carried an emotion with its characters storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters don't compare <UNK> with sholay still u will not like it br br if you dare watch this movie you will be burnt alive in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i'm sorry to say this but the acting in this film is horrible the dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever perhaps i got the dress rehearsal version by mistake the director over uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves the story is pretty well written and the fight sequences are actually better than i have seen in many action films the fights seem pretty real but all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point blank automatic weapon fire <UNK> <UNK> rounds and <UNK> the enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots i have ever seen especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about 30 <UNK> and every <UNK> shot is wide by at least 50 feet those <UNK> need serious site <UNK>
<START> the main reason for writing this review is i found this <UNK> of a great play and worthy 1972 film a horrible movie experience if i can save someone from watching it i will have done a good thing br br this new version is loaded with talent and it all goes wrong kenneth branagh <UNK> an ugly <UNK> one note set he proceeds to film the movie from every arty distracting self centered angle possible we see <UNK> of the actors in <UNK> steel on security <UNK> shots of their heads from 200 <UNK> above close ups of eyes <UNK> and on and on the screenplay by a <UNK> <UNK> introduces long <UNK> of unpleasant homosexual banter that is being <UNK> by both parties i think given the character twists how would i know the characters themselves so richly drawn in the original are crass and unsympathetic the running time has been cut by an hour which is either the real problem or the <UNK> thing the director did for us the actors perform their lines effectively but nothing they say or do is remotely believable jude law is over the top more than caine but as the credited producer must have had branagh's <UNK> br br all in all i found this to be an ugly to look at unconvincing shell of a former classic why was it even made the paying public spent less that <UNK> worldwide to see it a vanity piece of work that fails at every turn
<START> a friend told me of john <UNK> last summer after we got into a conversation about charles <UNK> i did not know that <UNK> was a favorite writer of <UNK> an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier <UNK> the <UNK> was the first <UNK> book i read and it remains one of my favorite novels the novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an <UNK> masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of in the novel the protagonist is a virgin with no idea how to win the <UNK> of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines the story of his bizarre relationship with <UNK> how he <UNK> for his first sexual experience with a <UNK> admirer and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real with no touching hollywood ending the film adaptation stays true to the book for a while but <UNK> into the cinematic trap of love <UNK> through racism sickness and death the heart of this story lies in the fact that <UNK> is a jerk and <UNK> is f ing crazy and their love never was and never would be the real thing no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other this movie <UNK> out the real meaning of the story out and replaced it with schlock i can't believe the man who wrote <UNK> could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so wrong
<START> it is true that some fans of peter sellers work may be disappointed with this his last venture but surely any fan of sellers will find delight in all of his films simply because of the man's huge talent and the <UNK> plot of dr fu <UNK> is certainly no exception unfortunately this would prove to be sellers last film it was even released after his death but it's still nice to see how the man had managed to keep his <UNK> talent right until his <UNK> demise and not only do we get one sellers but we get to for sellers plays not only the title role but also his nemesis the equally bizarre <UNK> smith the detective on the hunt for the crazed <UNK> year old fu the story is equally outlandish as we follow <UNK> outrageous antics to make his age <UNK> <UNK> and also <UNK> and his group of associates trying to prevent him just like any of sellers greater films the film comes with a guaranteed impeccable performance from him as well as many of his familiar faced co stars david <UNK> sid <UNK> john le <UNK> clive <UNK> and helen <UNK> to name a few it's also nice to see pink <UNK> <UNK> burt <UNK> <UNK> enjoying a cameo with sellers albeit playing the same role but still nice the story is indeed pretty ridiculous as are many of the characters involved which classes this as a film strongly under the <UNK> influence and although it never reaches the heights of <UNK> comedy there are plenty of amusing jokes that seem to point in the right direction the film failed <UNK> on it's initial release due to the entire world mourning after <UNK> death the film was released less than 3 weeks after and there is always that <UNK> thought lurking in the back of your mind when viewing it that this was sellers last film it's far from a great film it's often slow too ridiculous and sometimes the jokes simply aren't there but it is nevertheless enjoyable if only for another top rate performance from peter sellers
<START> this movie was terrible at first i just read the plot summary and it looked ok so i watched it the acting was terrible it was like the actor were almost camera shy everything seemed fake i feel bad for edward <UNK> terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago i've watched it at least 20 times br br the plot was also crap the writers were probably sleep <UNK> when they came up with the lines br br on the plus side it's the good kind of bad movie the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get so that later you can tell other people how you couldn't believe how terrible the movie was br br i think everybody should watch this so that then we could appreciate better other real movies
<START> it's a while ago that i have seen sleuth 1972 with two great actors michael caine and laurence olivier michael caine is back but he is now the husband and jude law the lover of his wife the story is still the same and it's a fantastic play br br during the movie i always had the feeling to watch a play that's one of the reasons i dislike this remake of a classic when i watch a movie adapted a play i still must feel to see a movie and not just a play director kenneth <UNK> did some marvelous movies in the past but this time he missed another reason was the look of the movie the design was modern stylish clean uncomfortable and cold i never got the feeling that somebody ever lived in that house the photography wasn't bad but the <UNK> was awful sometimes there was blue light dark green light to round it up not friendly for eyes br br the acting was really good michael <UNK> and jude <UNK> perform at their best i really would like to see these 2 guys playing together on stage but i have to confess i never was a fan of jude law the weakest part was the mid part i remember that in the original that this part was still very mysterious and just marvelous directed i tried to watch it twice and always in the mid part i felt asleep the end part is better and more interesting sleuth 2007 isn't awful but it seems to be more a movie for critics than for the audience sleuth 1972 is still a masterpiece and much more entertaining than sleuth 2007
<START> only after some <UNK> did i decide i liked this movie and after reading comments from all the other posters here and thinking about it some more i decided that i liked it tremendously i love american films probably because they are so narrative they usually have a well defined beginning middle and end <UNK> <UNK> on the other hand makes no such attempt i disagree with other posters that say it's <UNK> artsy ' in every way this film is meant to evoke your sense memories so often throughout the film you feel like you're there you feel the summer sun the <UNK> the heat the winter chill the <UNK> the loneliness etc etc br br in every way the director pulls you into the lives of the characters which is why so many people feel so strongly that the movie disappointed them after i finished watching it i felt the same but upon some reflection i recognized that this is how the movie had to be the <UNK> isn't the narrative it's the emotions you the viewer feel br br the lighting scenery and camera angles <UNK> you in the scenes they're rich exquisite and alive with detail and nuance although i normally cannot <UNK> films without a fully developed plot after all isn't a movie <UNK> to tell a story this film is definitely one of my new favorites
<START> some spoilers if you are a big horror movie fan then you will know that halloween <UNK> the way for many slasher films often <UNK> never <UNK> this movie is a true horror classic and is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made if not the scariest br br i actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series don't ask me why i honestly saw the other 7 movies before seeing this one that's just how it worked out but i would have to say this one blows all the others away it is genuinely frightening and seeing michael pop out from behind a bush or walk around in the dark sends a chill down your spine my favorite part of the movie was when michael stabs a guy and <UNK> his head to one side it is one of the <UNK> images in movie history br br later slashers such as the friday the 13th films were more fun and less intense than this movie i do like the <UNK> series better than the halloween series but this movie alone is better than all the <UNK> movies michael myers is such a scary villain because he is realistic you could imagine a crazed guy like him going around killing people i admit this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights br br what's great about this movie is that it doesn't rely on gore or humor to entertain the audience it is just pure terror it's too bad the later films of the series <UNK> from this one because this is as good of an example of a spectacular slasher movie as they come
<START> just the kind of movie i love some very good british actors as well as the one and only sharon stone catherine <UNK> stone masterfully <UNK> a well educated group of people's lives playing on their <UNK> to collect experiences to write a murder mystery book she plays the female psychopath quite well while using her ample sex appeal to convincingly portray what could be considered one of the ultimate black <UNK> <UNK> is use to dark places within society and <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> visit after <UNK> side of town from the beginning there is nothing short of an r rating here from the dialog alone stone could also be described as a sort of female <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> femme fatal without the meal plan
<START> i should have never watched this movie the style of filming may be considered artsy to some but it is considered <UNK> inducing to me i think it may have had an interesting plot but since i couldn't watch it for long stretches at a time i missed a lot the <UNK> pictures and stop motion filming <UNK> my brain i stopped watching mid way through and won't be back for a second try i suppose if i were home alone in my own <UNK> some dark and <UNK> evening this might be just the ticket ps not sure if the <UNK> film style thing can be considered a spoiler but i don't want to be <UNK> on my first review
<START> again <UNK> <UNK> is true first to the people who lived the story by letting those involved in the <UNK> of big wave surfing tell us their stories how it felt and what they thought you get the feeling of having been there the film carries you from the fifties to the near present by focusing on three primary <UNK> <UNK> to the evolution and development of the sport <UNK> home movie like videos of themselves and their <UNK> take you further into their world the layers of music culture technical information a pure view of the <UNK> <UNK> and fabulous big wave images you get a full scope perspective of this aspect of surfing br br thoroughly worth watching
<START> some of those guys that watch films and complain about them for a living are forgetting something dvd menu system i tell you the people i watched the main screen repeat in this one about 35 times it was awesome a cinematic <UNK> of <UNK> brilliance that had me from where it was which was the very beginning many times the sum and <UNK> i was hooked over and over and over and over br br <UNK> de <UNK> de doo de <UNK> and that's just the soundtrack br br i is laid aside in the bed <UNK> up with my <UNK> the rain is in the flat roof and tonight soft is again soft the cat is comfortable and my <UNK> which crosses in me is already <UNK> i popped in the dvd i was <UNK> through the night <UNK> de <UNK> de doo de <UNK> br br the blob see it steve queen two cops and one girl in a dress two thumbs way up
<START> well i was going to wait till this came out on video to see it and i wish i had i actually caught scary movie 2 on cable the other day and it made me <UNK> for more of the same what i got was airplane on crack i mean if you like airplane or any other leslie <UNK> vehicles then you'll probably be in heaven but if your used to the usually wayans comedy then you will be <UNK> there was alot more eye candy in this one which will keep young <UNK> <UNK> teenage boys happy which is probably why it was a box office hit the first week it came out i enjoyed scary movie 2 ten times more then this fodder and part one 5 times as much odd that the better of the 3 is part 2 but then again i always liked halloween 2 better then the original as well maybe its just me the funniest part of the movie has to be the way the aliens say goodbye but that <UNK> worth the 11 dollars i spent to catch a <UNK> of this with my <UNK> save yourself cash and catch part 2 again on cable till this is released on video tape and then rent it dont buy it
<START> thanks to a dull <UNK> screenplay by neil simon and lackluster direction from robert moore chapter two becomes a shrill showcase for <UNK> mason who received her third of four oscar <UNK> for chapter two giving the same performance here that she gave in <UNK> liberty 73 the goodbye girl <UNK> audrey rose <UNK> and only when i laugh <UNK> only this time she doesn't have a child to drag around chapter two is the third and last feature film for moore having previously directed neil simon's the cheap detective <UNK> and murder by death <UNK> <UNK> is miscast the characters are <UNK> dimensional the dialog is overly <UNK> and there's virtually no establishing detail the first half is a less than captivating meet cute <UNK> romance between a <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> mason and the dreary second half makes you long for the first half the nyc locations as well as joe <UNK> and a painfully thin valerie <UNK> are irrelevant but at least they provide some welcome distraction and last and least there's an awful song played during the credits
<START> as a fan of the <UNK> <UNK> books i find this series to be a totally crass representation of them vampire bill is not very good looking and looks much older than described in the book i found that they have made already wonderfully colourful characters seem very course and vulgar one of the things i loved about the books is that despite all the crap that she is going through <UNK> is always a lady and yet in the tv series she doesn't seem like that at all not only that but the prejudices displayed in the tv series are not nearly as wide spread in the books i didn't expect an exact <UNK> of the books but i at least expected the feel of them to be used for the series
<START> this movie is s l o w spent most of the movie actually waiting for it to <UNK> br br the setting was bleak the script was bleak the cinematography was bleak the plot was bleak the budget was low not that all low budget movies are bad but this one had no redeeming features br br the plot was more consumed with a vengeful slightly deranged hunter than the actual wendigo which made a very brief appearance toward the end of the movie this in itself was disappointing as this <UNK> was just a bizarre mix of a tree and a <UNK> everything about the movie was uninspiring br br the parents of the little boy appeared to be rather <UNK> and at times seemed completely detached from their son whether this was down to bad acting or a bad script i'm not sure but it only <UNK> my disappointment and boredom levels br br there was no food for thought nothing to <UNK> an interest with no real intrigue or chill factor this movie <UNK> along so painfully you just couldn't care less what happened by the end br br <UNK> ambiance reminds me of the dull movie shown at the awards ceremony toward the end of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a movie which is artistic and nonsensical trying too hard to to be deep and meaningful but coming across as pretentious and boring br br i would never want to watch this again i only watched it to the end in the vain hope that something interesting might happen but it didn't
<START> i totally agree with the review by a reviewer of variety that the film is never quite as funny lively or insightful about the creative process as its premise would seem to warrant <UNK> it is messy and the lighting is really <UNK> if the film is supposed to be character driven the poor lighting doesn't enhance the acting and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors many non south <UNK> will have difficulty in following the spoken english in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process i watched the film at the cape town world cinema festival last year comments and reactions to the film <UNK> from unwatchable and sloppy to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past unfortunately bunny <UNK> won't be remembered as one of the bright lights of the south african new wave but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid history will indeed be rated among our best in our <UNK> year old film history not surprisingly the film disappeared from cinemas in cape town only two weeks after its release and from most of the cinemas in <UNK> and <UNK> it has clearly limited appeal among south african audiences
<START> purple rain has never been a <UNK> darling but it is a cult classic and deserves to be if you are a prince fan this is for you br br the main plot is prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and him falling in love with a girl believe it or not this movie isn't just singing and dancing there are many intense scenes and it is heartwarming sometimes it comes off has funny but when it works it really works very hit and miss br br no one can really act in the film everyone is from one of <UNK> side acts like the time and vanity 6 still it adds charm to the movie when ever prince is on screen he lights it up and it fun to see him at his commercial peak br br in conclusion go and see this if you love prince like me if you aren't a fan it'll make you one
<START> and maybe as fred <UNK> used to say one across the lips that to those who released this film on an unsuspecting public and perhaps to the person in <UNK> <UNK> who called this a <UNK> <UNK> and said it was good br br five young girls apparently taking a short cut home from a high school football game become lost and stop to ask directions at some small store in the middle of nowhere while there the driver accidentally hits a <UNK> <UNK> knocks out a <UNK> but the girls all decide to just leave not go find the driver but the driver does come to find them and it's not just that the <UNK> on her vehicle got <UNK> it's for another reason that the girls do not yet understand when the driver does first catch them she yes it's a she <UNK> a shot gun makes them strip down and keeps screaming at them how much did you see of course the girls are scared to death don't know what she's talking about br br as the night rolls on the girls end up in a cat and mouse game with the driver of the <UNK> who manages to <UNK> all manner of <UNK> on the girls who are remarkably <UNK> to shot gun <UNK> and <UNK> where they didn't want them eventually they come to find that something happened back at that store after they left that is the reason for this woman's psychotic rage and eventually they have a chance at revenge and take it about as far as they can go br br there are elements of this film that are rather disturbing and scary but unfortunately those moments are <UNK> by bad acting bad dialog and huge <UNK> of credibility one girl is hit by a shot gun blast and appears to be <UNK> wounded and she's feeling cold her life is passing before her eyes but she got better and how far can a mini van run on an almost empty gas tank at <UNK> of 80 miles per hour i need one of those things it apparently gets great <UNK> br br there should have been an ending when the girls got their revenge but the film goes on for a bit after that which is an anti climax but they at least learn some of what set the woman off and the driver is still worried about messing up her mom's van which is obviously the least of anyone's <UNK> br br so this isn't the worst film i've seen but it's too amateur to be good and yet a bit too scary and gruesome at times to be completely terrible but it does take the cake for plenty of shrill <UNK> and you'll want to put two across your ears if you watch this which by the way i don't necessarily recommend 4 out of 10
<START> i thought that <UNK> has been wonderfully written its not just about entertainment there's <UNK> of subtle messages that i think <UNK> was trying to bring across and yes it might be confusing to some of you especially if you didn't watch <UNK> and or <UNK> for <UNK> times br br i bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right its really ironic how the characters relate like the <UNK> <UNK> is that prostitute from <UNK> and the chick at the <UNK> pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the <UNK> man in the future br br and i absolutely love the voice overs its crude yet <UNK> fresh like when they took a shot of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> then there was suddenly <UNK> voice saying <UNK> ' the scene when he <UNK> the tree br br it captured <UNK> attitude and in some mild way <UNK> at how pathetic it is portrayed in the character for example even the kids can be really sharp <UNK> complete with the shrill annoying voice and simply bad mouth <UNK> all movie long and how you can be such a <UNK> and talk about <UNK> when <UNK> own life isn't <UNK> out br br all i can say is this movie totally reached my expectation if not <UNK> it br br it kept me glued to the screen i couldn't even take my eyes off it not even to make out in the cinema ha ha
<START> it is not the same as the other films about dancing a few normal people found themselves from dancing unlike the dancing films in hollywood the characters in this film are not handsome or hot young people they are someone that you may see everyday in your <UNK> they are some depressed about their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams from dancing this touches me very deeply
<START> yes i did as i sit here red faced remembering having felt almost guilty as i watched it a couple of weeks back while my wife chose to watch something as <UNK> in comparison as <UNK> <UNK> br br how does one explain the appeal of batman and robin i mean the only ones who ever really counted adam west and burt ward it was a terrible show with terrible plots and terrible acting and oh yes it was terribly funny and the same applies to this reunion and flashback movie adam and burt are invited to an <UNK> where the old <UNK> is going to be sold off for charity but it gets stolen and our pals as themselves jump into their old characters' <UNK> if not their costumes and head off to find out what's happened along the way they <UNK> about the series and we see how it all came together in flashbacks with jack <UNK> and jason <UNK> playing the young adam and burt of the tv series it really was quite interesting to get some behind the scenes looks at the old series and adam and burt just stepped perfectly back into character even though they weren't really in character well you'd have to watch it to see what i mean it was also great to see julie <UNK> and frank <UNK> br br if you're not a fan of the old series you'll hate this if heaven <UNK> you actually thought michael keaton and george clooney made acceptable <UNK> then you'll hate this even more but if you grew up with adam and burt and are still willing to admit that you never missed an episode well this one's for you br br yes it's true 9 10
<START> i rated this a ten just because i find it so impressive what a single <UNK> year old can do with a video camera it's no epic but it's plenty engaging and i was never bored if <UNK> of millions of dollars can go into the countless bad films that are <UNK> out en <UNK> then give this director the same amount of money and see what happens i know i'll be <UNK> up at the local cinema for her first major release damn good job and well worth the money what a script it might be low budget but it beats the hell out of half the major pictures i've seen lately <UNK> knows how to tell a story both in writing and on screen serious kudos to her can't wait to see more
<START> <UNK> is the game being played in this drama and the revenge plot is <UNK> by the absurd story line that sets the stage for the fireworks that come later why would a man become involved with the <UNK> wife of a ruthless mob boss in the <UNK> own mansion with suspicious henchmen all around why would an unhappy wife encourage the <UNK> of a complete stranger and expect him to carry her away with him and leave her husband and boredom behind to live happily ever after with her new love surely the hero here kevin <UNK> must have expected a reaction from the <UNK> husband that gives the movie an excuse to <UNK> in senseless gore and violence anthony quinn great actor that he was surely deserved better and madeleine <UNK> is the tragic figure who suffers greatly as she <UNK> on to her prince charming <UNK> is okay but her spanish accent doesn't work the cameos of the lesser players are good especially <UNK> <UNK> and john <UNK> and sally <UNK> is interesting as a <UNK> rock star
<START> violence whether real or not always has an impact in this film the violence is about as crass as you could ask for in the great <UNK> the director has successfully demonstrated what extremes of violence people are capable of but what was the point the violence looks like a mix of <UNK> <UNK> and ' kubrick's <UNK> <UNK> both of which are remarkable films don't get me wrong i'm not opposed to screen violence at all and i've seen some nasty stuff in my film going years but this film as a whole is totally juvenile the story is never developed enough to offer any reason for the extreme violence the <UNK> paper thin reason we are give for <UNK> demise is his introduction to drugs danny <UNK> plays the character who is partly responsible for <UNK> drug <UNK> demise however he is on screen for less than 5 minutes <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> unable to cope mum i am not sure what either of these actors is doing in a film of this low caliber the acting is wooden the scene in the kitchen with the tv cook and his wife for instance is as painful to watch if not more so than the shocking finale who wrote those dialogues some of the comments the boys make <UNK> like she's enjoying <UNK> are so trite as to <UNK> one to laugh if it were not for <UNK> <UNK> desire to <UNK> us with harrowing images of <UNK> female <UNK> why we need to be shown such detail possibly down to the director's adolescent obsession with sadistic pornographic imagery one can only wonder at this young man's psychology br br the <UNK> <UNK> of the film was repeatedly brought to our attention due to the amount of scenes in the bar outside the tv <UNK> house war in iraq reports was perhaps too obvious in my opinion yes war is violent social <UNK> causes frustration we're all prone to <UNK> violent acts whether you're in politics or on the street popping e <UNK> all these things as part of the same underlying issue is <UNK> the actual issue which is the meaning of violence in man this issue is one that we still haven't managed to grasp and certainly not in this film br br my opinion derivative badly made and pointless
<START> okay i've tried and i've tried but i still don't get this guy <UNK> thing tales from the <UNK> hospital left me cold that movie about the <UNK> villagers and the one about the ice <UNK> were pretty to look but lacking in the story department and this <UNK> movie about abortion and hockey is just boring i'm glad <UNK> has an appreciation for silent film but i dislike his films for the same reason i dislike the films of quentin tarantino they're empty <UNK> to better more imaginative films films that advanced the art form or broke new ground and are all style and no substance no amount of jump cuts and odd camera angles can disguise the fact that <UNK> is an unoriginal david lynch wannabe though he does have one advantage over tarantino he generally doesn't write embarrassing dialogue because most of his films rely on <UNK> the bottom line is <UNK> <UNK> is clever clever film making for aspiring film <UNK>
<START> i saw this film first in the soviet union and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship <UNK> but then in <UNK> in 2000 i watched it in a complete form and so what the plot is incredibly <UNK> 2 men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong straight and <UNK> severe ladies the men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clichés follow sex drive constant <UNK> desire for sex <UNK> who are shown like complete idiots you may agree with them or not but idiots certainly they are not and so on the performance even of the stellar <UNK> <UNK> is here wooden and strangely bad he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats on saying phrases like i am in the elevator with a nude chick and i haven't done anything to her this was intended to be a comedy instead it turned out to be a vapid farce full of predictable jokes and below the <UNK> <UNK> do not waste your time on it this is just bad
<START> i just saw this movie on a local tv station <UNK> big chuck and little john in cleveland <UNK> i had never heard of this movie and decided to watch it br br i know of no <UNK> that can even come close to <UNK> me in describing how bad this movie really is the script is awful the acting well other than one of two exceptions is pointless since there is nothing in this material that merits any real effort br br it looks like a bunch of little ideas <UNK> from various writing sessions that where thrown into a <UNK> it's not just funny the parody aspect is strained at best some references where almost out of date even for the time of it's release no wonder i had never heard of it it's really bad worse than anything saturday night live mad tv or even in living color put out in their worst days br br if you see it on tv it is a great example of how not to make a movie whatever you do don't waste a <UNK> br br adam
<START> this program didn't do it for me although i'm a fan of the genre the major factor that disappointed me was that there was not a single scene which was not dominated by the main character this made it a bit two dimensional and i gave up before the program was over br br i was hoping to leave my critique there as i'm no movie critic however the <UNK> on imdb state that you must put in 10 lines of commentary it did remind me of hudson <UNK> in the way the main character is in every single scene and i would hope that the writers of this program could employ some more diversity to engage with the viewers i don't doubt the talent of any of the cast and crew it's just that after watching things like the wire i've come to expect great things from cop drama
<START> this one stood out for it's originality i'm seriously tired of seeing hindi movies that are a <UNK> <UNK> of a whole bunch of hollywood and brit movies some flaws were inevitable nonetheless this movie is a must see <UNK> portrayal of the clean cut <UNK> cop as opposed to the pot <UNK> money hungry ones that we normally see was awesome he's come a long way from his work in <UNK> <UNK> i liked the movie so much that i had to own it i'm not usually into the mindless violence type of movies somehow i actually felt for each character and therefore can't really bring myself to call it <UNK> violence i do not appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most hindi and <UNK> movies i absolutely loved this movie for it's lack of the same <UNK> <UNK> reaction to <UNK> his wife is not overdone is heart wrenching and makes me want to <UNK> my eyes out there are certain times when i'm watching a movie when i want to hit the <UNK> button plenty of times i've wanted to do that at a cinema hall never wanted to do so when watching this movie i'm really hoping that <UNK> releases soon
<START> not sure if this counts as a spoiler or not so beware br br just a small but crucial thing to watch for an intriguing possibility the boys steal a green <UNK> at one point for a joy ride and return it to the owner having done <UNK> and vengeful hidden damage to the car hoping that the owner will crash is it the very same car they steal much later from the <UNK> family we know the original owner sold it they drive off at the end on a dangerous road one which i understand has been closed to all but <UNK> for the last ten years a whole new <UNK> to the end of the film br br on another matter this film could have been called <UNK> of a woman i don't recall another film certainly not american that treats the <UNK> of a woman in such a frank and open manner much like the nose of a fine <UNK>
<START> though this may not necessarily be a so called classic film by today's standards it's still worth seeing the main reason why is because after experiencing this film you get the feeling that you've also experienced the counter cultural <UNK> of the 60's no matter however good or bad br br i happened to see this film in an english literature class at <UNK> <UNK> and though at first it appears to be just a meaningless composition of 60's icons the film is far from being simply thrown together br br my point is that if you leave the film feeling <UNK> and confused the film has done it's job it's conveyed a desolate view of the future that leaves you feeling unsure and angry it was perhaps this same feeling that the film sought to explore in the youth it <UNK> br br as such zabriskie point may not tell a very good or interesting story and at the same time its characters may be one sided and predictable however it also conveys so well this sort of clichéd rebellious desire to get out of the existence which both mark and daria must share even the anti establishment students are as <UNK> as the <UNK> they rebel against
<START> but if you like the muppets i defy you to dislike this one basically the same plot <UNK> this time new york not la it features a lot of fun cameos and muppet hi <UNK> a lot of the muppets leave the film pretty early on as it centers around <UNK> and miss <UNK> i happened to have enjoyed it greatly fun to watch with your kids
<START> i never thought i see a movie worse than lisa <UNK> is famous but this came pretty close as repeated often throughout the comments it was predictable five minutes into the movie you know it will be a stranded at the alter outcome this movie painfully references rips off everything from something about mary to revenge of the pink <UNK> writer greg <UNK> meet the parents needs some new material br br the only twist is the deranged boyfriend police officer pursued by internal affairs but even that opportunity is wasted lots of setting shots of the seattle space <UNK> necessary to disguise the obvious canadian shooting locale some of the worst driving in the car scenes with almost no effort to disguise the fact that the car is being pulled through town on a trailer <UNK> at least turn the wheel or put the <UNK> on once in a while <UNK> blair is <UNK> and the short <UNK> a crime <UNK> to jason lee for what guess it beats <UNK> br br so here's who should see this movie <UNK> <UNK> fans who want to hear two actors sing <UNK> in the <UNK> badly people who can't get enough of julia stiles 1 10
<START> life hits us in the face we must try to stay beautiful br br debut movie from one of <UNK> best artists he sings songs tom <UNK> a long <UNK> movie and happy happy joy joy for <UNK> filmmaking really worth watching and a promising piece of work it takes us into the <UNK> of 8 main characters that live through a friday and night the title says a lot about the way we spend time with them we <UNK> as they do into friday <UNK> party where they <UNK> meet br br it's <UNK> style is very <UNK> <UNK> superb use of music it sometimes takes the <UNK> to the images and then you feel its power <UNK> <UNK> the party scene <UNK> is a thrilling visual experience cause of the way that it's shot it keeps you really with it while it's set in a small place with a lot of people having a big party so hard to shoot br br thank you <UNK> <UNK> for making this daring movie in these already some years going poor times of <UNK> filmmaking you made my day
<START> well i had seen they all laughed when it came out in br br europe around 1982 and had kept a vague but dear <UNK> of it i <UNK> just seen it again on tape almost twenty years after bogdanovich has a true heartfelt <UNK> over his characters and a kind sympathy which is difficult not to feel also excellent comedians and actors good lines all over and for everyone and pretty good editing too i laughed and <UNK> all the time just as we all do at times go get it
<START> <UNK> <UNK> hybrid of cruel intentions and wild things but it isn't nearly as good as either of those trash min classics it's about the acting sheriff <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> being called in to investigate a near fatal drug <UNK> at a posh upper class <UNK> but to keep it on the down low as he <UNK> deeper he thinks it's much more than it at first glance seems to be we follow alicia the girl who <UNK> in flashbacks as well at about 90 minutes if this film was welcomed to begin with it would have worn it out this film brings absolutely nothing new to the table but it is the only movie thus far that has miss <UNK> topless so the grade is higher just for that br br my grade d br br eye candy <UNK> <UNK> gets topless <UNK> a mistake of happy <UNK> another girl is topless br br anti eye candy more men ass than girl <UNK>
<START> this movie is the biggest steaming pile of you know what being from and growing up in <UNK> kansas i know for a fact 90 of the movie was bogus aside from the names of some of the victims nothing else much was correct the movie looks like it was made with <UNK> handy <UNK> it had footage that i believe came from another film along with stock footage from a slaughter house i usually enjoy watching bad films for the fun of it but due to the bad acting poorly prepared or non existent sets and a very dull and short ending it was a struggle to watch it through to the ending i recommend that you not waste your money on this film or you will be sorry <UNK>
<START> i happened upon this movie as an 8 10 year old on a cold dark november afternoon i was outside playing all day <UNK> and when i came in around <UNK> i had a cup of hot <UNK> and sat down in front of the tv with a <UNK> i was surprised to be watching a cartoon that wasn't all happy and silly and was in fact dark and <UNK> it captured my imagination i'm sure it misses the text and is <UNK> in all the wrong places for the <UNK> <UNK> but it still captures the spirit of the story the choice to carry a burden for the good of others the consequences of selfish <UNK> decisions etc the quality of animation leaves room for complaint but the one place where this movie clearly rises above the new films is the voice characterizations john hurt is great in this if you don't like how the character is drawn look away and just listen to him his voice is extraordinary i've seen it again many many times and it always brings me back to that time as a kid <UNK> for some magical adventure it's for this reason i say <UNK> the film is nostalgic for me so i overlook its shortcomings but between john hurt and <UNK> fantasy it still reached me and still does
<START> going into see seven pounds i wasn't clearly sure what to think because the previews left to much open to grasp what the movie was really about so within the first 20 min or so you are completely lost in the plot have no idea what is going on and you think tim who claims to be ben is just a big <UNK> all of this comes to an end when the twist so to speak is <UNK> at the very last minute of the movie basically tim will smith was troubled and haunted by a big accident he made causing the end of seven peoples lives by this he decides to scope out seven new people who are in need of help badly who he in turns gives his life to br br the acting of this film is great as i feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress rosario dawson to me this is one of her better movies aside from eagle eye which i think is up there to she has been in some bad some good but she does deliver in this film other actors such as woody <UNK> have very small roles and not a big enough role to grasp the character although the casting of the film was still good br br this movie was definitely not what i expected and certainly a lot slower pace in which i hoped the movie however was still pretty good nothing is revealed until the last 5 min of the movie and everything falls into place up until then it just seems like a pointless love story final thought seven pounds seven stars
<START> the genre of suspense films really takes a dive in this one the big problem is <UNK> i realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause suspense and the tense feeling of whats going to happen next but this movie was so predictable and is just not believable i find that the more i watch this kind of movie the more i am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid if they took the time to make it more realistic i might have enjoyed it a little having said that you might be better off staying away from this one
<START> i've read some of the other comments and i do have to agree with the ones that didn't get the ending i thought it was going rather well until the end it kept your mind running and then <UNK> i have not clue what went on the last couple minutes of the movie except a complete mess it's like they ran out of money to come up with a good ending so they improvised first they had a mysterious thing making people disappear then they had a guy talking about area <UNK> which makes you think about aliens then after they it went to crap i thought the actors and actresses did fine it's just the script went sour anyways if you do watch this movie be prepared to be disappointed at the end
<START> marlene <UNK> and charles boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film the irony is that <UNK> plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life truly gorgeous cinematography and sets and yes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of clothes are also fabulous she look great boyer looks young and <UNK> br br story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex priest seeking life seems pretty stale but set against such unreal sets and <UNK> it somehow works given the two stars the terrific score by max <UNK> and a good supporting cast the film runs like <UNK> minutes and seems badly edited plus certain characters just appear or disappear br br joseph <UNK> is funny as the arab guide c <UNK> smith is the old priest <UNK> watson the mother superior <UNK> <UNK> the dancer john carradine the <UNK> and basil <UNK> plays well i'm not sure he just rides in from the desert and <UNK> everything as others have noted john gilbert was <UNK> to star with <UNK> i can't help but think he would have been wonderful the role of world weary boris would have suited the great gilbert quite well and after the success of queen christina with garbo his career might have gotten back on track br br i can't think of any other 30s film <UNK> did in color she looks great and wears some terrific clothes my favorite is the <UNK> as the <UNK> like outfit she wears by the pool br br certainly worth a look for the lush sets and color and the two great stars
<START> this is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art not an entertainment business lars von trier creates a noir atmosphere of post war germany utterly captivating you get absorbed into the dream and you're let go only at the end credits the plot necessarily comes second but it still is a thrilling story with tough issues being raised just wonderful
<START> after <UNK> a halloween re broadcast of orson welles' classic radio adaptation of war of the worlds for a real martian invasion a group of moronic martians shows up on earth looking to <UNK> only their plans go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in reality all alone br br this really is often quite good and funny with some decent lines just check the memorable quotes to boot it will most likely appeal to sci fi fans this has passed the test of time for me as seeing it again recently it proved much better than i expected it to be despite a cast made up of no name stars this may just be the funniest martian invasion ever put to film interestingly enough the martians themselves seem to represent almost every classic action hero sci fi hero stereotype there is cool 50s teen fighter pilot <UNK> astronaut brave soldier and <UNK> scientist fun for the whole family br br prepare to die earth <UNK>
<START> this was the second of the series of 6 classic tarzan movies featuring johnny <UNK> in the title role and maureen <UNK> as jane br br as usual this was a wonderful film in this series and perhaps stands out as an in between film in a progression that could almost <UNK> the development of cinema from the early 1930s into the 1940s as such it displayed good pace though not as good as subsequent films likewise the cinematography is less accomplished than later tarzan films in this series the stock i saw was of uneven quality containing some grainy scenery and some under exposed and over exposed scenes the crisp display of later tarzan films is lacking here on the other hand there is one scene very early on in which the jerky movements of a camera with <UNK> <UNK> in front of it as the camera backs up showing <UNK> men <UNK> ahead into the jungle was really almost modern in its style and stands in strong contrast to the <UNK> shots that make up the rest of the movie br br regarding plot one interesting feature here was jane's near <UNK> and <UNK> when she was being subject to <UNK> <UNK> the kiss  and jane's stunned and partly guilty reaction  <UNK> something of the jane we see in the future as well in these films compare for example in tarzan finds a son jane's <UNK> actions <UNK> tarzan and delivering boy to his family later she admits to tarzan that she was wrong here nothing quite so explicit but we have jane returning to the jane parker of <UNK> and in an almost <UNK> series of actions <UNK> herself of the evening <UNK> brought by martin and harry to <UNK> her away from tarzan br br there were a whole series of depictions and sequences that especially struck me in this viewing br br for one thing the picture we get of the domestic life of tarzan is here as later a combination of sensual <UNK> with always the nearby possibility of violent death this to me is very much at the core of the tarzan experience br br i was really surprised by some quite violent scenes even by today's standards br br there were a whole series of scenes that gave me special pleasure tarzan leading the elephants into the valley of the <UNK> graveyard tarzan being rescued from <UNK> death by the <UNK> and then <UNK> to health by the apes <UNK> going to find tarzan when jane and the other men are trapped at the foot of the <UNK> <UNK> in particular crossing the river on the <UNK> the final battle scenes of <UNK> lions on the ground and <UNK> apes in the trees jane showing us that she is truly of <UNK> world now quickly displaying her <UNK> <UNK> to work up a line of fire to keep the lions away br br the final series of scenes is splendid suddenly tarzan is on the scene <UNK> <UNK> from the trees and taking charge of the lions and <UNK> the elephants to the rescue that final cry of tarzan in triumph holding a happy jane in his arms with a dancing and delighted <UNK> beside them is a <UNK> picture and really a fine <UNK> of the story of tarzan and jane br br all in all this is another wonderful classic tarzan movie i would recommend this movie strongly to anyone
<START> the idea is nice bringing so many stars in one movie is great but too many stories too short and lacking really any sense no connection between the scenes there were some 3 4 brilliant stories but these were out of 18 the frame reminded me of all the invisible children a movie which i liked a lot compared to it however paris je t'aime lacks the intriguing short story which develops starts and has its end and it lacks the topic connecting all those children i do not find paris enough of a topic to connect 18 short sketches together perhaps for people who know paris it is interesting otherwise i wouldn't recommend it
<START> i <UNK> all the way through this movie first of all the idiotic plot has little to do with <UNK> own story hollywood has attempted to create a kind of comedy car chase movie imagine <UNK> sings <UNK> br br do not take anything about this movie to be accurate the name parsons in the title and stealing of his body is just used as <UNK> for a low budget chase movie a blatant attempt to grab a few bucks from the parsons legacy and his fan base <UNK> father had long since been dead in 1973 the other global characters are fictional none of this has anything to do with <UNK> life or death br br if you are a <UNK> fan i advise you to not see this movie i wish i hadn't it's <UNK> to see something special be treated as such <UNK> fodder i'd swear i could hear <UNK> turning in his grave while the movie was playing if you are not familiar with <UNK> life and legacy do not take anything in this movie as being representative of <UNK> br br i cannot say enough bad things about this movie if <UNK> were alive and saw this movie he would kill himself then again maybe he'd be afraid to if he knew this movie were to result
<START> unwatchable you can't even make it past the first three minutes and this is coming from a huge adam sandler fan 1
<START> i've recently went back and watched this movie again from not seeing it in years when i first seen the movie i was too young to understand what the movie was about now that i've seen it again i couldn't believe what i've missed all these years for me being able to see movies for what they are i think that this movie was great most people feel as though the music are the best part but i don't think that's true most people don't realize how good the story is because it's judge by the acting the truth of the matter is that no one in the movie were really trying to act rather they were just being themselves the entire main cast were just playing themselves they weren't trying to be anyone else but themselves br br i've actually watched and <UNK> the work and effort put into the movie now from my perspective the situations shown in the movie are pretty much based on what actually went on <UNK> in <UNK> at the time and it's most of the things that happen are actually true events that happened in <UNK> career and who can tell it better than him the music that was coming from the city at the time was starting to be recognized and be revolutionary it was interesting to see how the music was very influential mainly at the club first <UNK> <UNK> st entry where in fact prince among other musicians got their career started it's also a known fact that prince and morris day always had a competition with each other in real life but it was a friendly competition they were always friends so the story basically plays off of that competition aspect of their rivalry rather than their friendship which shows the true <UNK> side of what occurred at club first <UNK> for it's time br br another reason why this movie is good is due to the fact that some of the situations that occur in the movie are actually based on events that prince has gone through in his life with the music aspect and the personal to me this made the movie more realistic as far as the emotion because he's telling his trials and <UNK> pre <UNK> plus his dedication he puts into his performances is phenomenal prince made sure that every moment in the movie was done perfectly anytime you hear a song play in the movie it's in perfect sync with the situation at hand br br prince is in all a musical genius and he has proved it on many occasions this movie is what really put prince on the map officially and he hasn't <UNK> down since anyone who has watched this movie or still <UNK> hasn't watched it yet when you sit down and view this film you have have to watch it with intellect or you will miss the whole aspect of the movie if you really love music this is definitely the movie to watch above what anyone else says i think it's a great movie to watch and own
<START> i had first watched this several years ago on a now <UNK> <UNK> tv channel amazingly the film emerged as a <UNK> <UNK> dvd from <UNK> not being sure what i had made of it initially despite having <UNK> cult status over the years the achievement proper is clearly viewed with modesty even by genre buffs i <UNK> not to make the purchase  as i did with the similar and to me unfamiliar fiend without a face 1958 recently however i managed to <UNK> the blob via a copy of the spanish dvd which interestingly <UNK> over the two audio commentary tracks from the <UNK> special edition <UNK> <UNK> i could not switch off the spanish subtitles during <UNK> of the main feature anyway looking at the film <UNK> i was surprised by how much i enjoyed it despite many a narrative flaw which i will get to later  as a pure example of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shot in pleasant color and a time capsule <UNK> late 1950s social attitudes the male lead was an early role for steve n mcqueen and though the actor may have subsequently looked at it with disdain his sole contribution to the genre proves fairly engaging not <UNK> to juvenile kicks but still essentially a decent and more importantly <UNK> kid the special effects depicting the slimy and <UNK> creature are not too bad of its kind and period the film itself rises to a good climax  beginning with the <UNK> invasion of a cinema showing daughter of horror 1953 7 as i mentioned recently in that film's review but being curiously screened <UNK> and which sequence incidentally would be featured at the opening of a satirical italian program actually called blob as to the admittedly minor <UNK> i have with the film the monster is not shown traveling  it just turns up at a variety of places never being seen by anyone there is a <UNK> over emphasis <UNK> to padding on the kids' <UNK> with police it is silly to have the town doctor shoot at the blob  as if fluid whatever its <UNK> can be destroyed by bullets equally nonsensical is having the teenagers alert the <UNK> of the danger by making door to door visits especially when considering that at that stage only mcqueen had actually seen the monster in action an inferior sequel emerged in 1972 called beware the blob the original was then remade in 1988  i watched this not too long ago but it seems not to have made a lasting impression on me though i know micheal elliott loves it for the record i will be following this viewing with two more <UNK> between director <UNK> and producer jack h harris namely <UNK> man 1959 and <UNK> 1960
<START> the only reason that this movie is rated a 1 is that zero is not one of the selection <UNK> with a plot thinner than depression era <UNK> soup horrific acting and special effects that look like they came out of the thunderbirds tv series it is amazing that widmark didn't kill the director for putting this black mark on his resume even by 1950's standards the special effects are atrocious except for a couple of underwater submarine sequences i can only assume that it was nominated for best special effects because except for 20 000 <UNK> under the sea and them there wasn't anybody else doing effects it was certainly no contest for disney that year if this was their only competition i wouldn't recommend the film even for hard core submarine movie buffs as the most realistic scene on the submarine was limited to one shot where <UNK> can be seen <UNK> down the up raised <UNK> there are other much better sub films that you can enjoy from this era like the aforementioned 20 000 <UNK> or <UNK> run
<START> this is an intimate movie of a sincere girl in the real world out of hollywood's cheap fantasy is a very good piece of its class and ashley judd fills the role <UNK> it may appear slow for thrill <UNK> though cool movie for a calm night br br
<START> fly me to the moon has to be the worst animated film i've seen in a long time that's saying something since i have taken my son to see every animated release for the last 4 years now the story is to be generous trite the voice acting is atrocious too cute sounding the humor is of the <UNK> room variety the animation is passable for a <UNK> type of cartoon but this is being released on the big screen not cable television br br it gets a 2 only because of it's ok 3 d visuals some of the scenes had a mildly stimulating image but we've seen much better in the past i also question the <UNK> of the filmmakers to have characters fly away from the screen rather than into it in most of the scenes while that is interesting at first it became tiresome after the 3rd or 4th time it seemed to <UNK> of indifference to me on the part of the creators br br i will say this though it had a pretty cool soundtrack and for the record my son wasn't too crazy about it either bad movie
<START> a classy film pulled in 2 directions to its advantage it is directed by wes craven on the downside the tv film budget shows what could have been so much more with a larger budget it moves along as susan <UNK> draws robert <UNK> into her <UNK> and trying to <UNK> him into the secret of her health club his latest invention a <UNK> which can <UNK> people or things becomes unexpectedly useful in his new <UNK> anyone seeing this should pay attention to susan <UNK> her looks and performance had an unexpected <UNK> a few years later the actor scientist and <UNK> stephen <UNK> is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this film <UNK> became subject of a portrait by him followed as the basis for works of a <UNK> called catherine <UNK> and barbara <UNK> portrait in <UNK> <UNK> were used as references for the catherine <UNK> which were immediately <UNK> by <UNK> probably due to a personal nature between the artist and catherine so by seeing both films we can get an insight into another story and the appearance of unknown woman that would make an interesting film
<START> this is a made for tv and rather needless sci fi channel retelling of the beowulf story especially after the recent 2005 film beowulf and grendel this movie doesn't really get into <UNK> story but just takes us through his battle against the <UNK> beast known as grendel as it leaves a kingdom in absolute fear and turmoil while the powerful <UNK> warrior beowulf is called upon to rid them of the <UNK> rampage if this is successfully accomplished the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep it at bay after a few failed attempts the creature is <UNK> but it's angry and vengeful mother soon attacks leaving it up to beowulf to again lend his mighty acts of bravery and strength to defeat it grendel looks like it was shot on a tiny budget and the cg effects are terrible like i said this movie is absolutely needless
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is my favorite anime by <UNK> <UNK> the woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story that is not only a comedy but also an action anime the main character of the story is <UNK> <UNK> a teenager boy who is also an expert in martial arts <UNK> is engaged to <UNK> because of an <UNK> of both fathers who are great friends and trained together during many years br br <UNK> is the younger and most violent sister of the <UNK> <UNK> is the oldest and is very sweet and <UNK> is the middle and loves to win money no matter what br br <UNK> and <UNK> fight all the time specially because both have a very bad temper and when they discover that <UNK> becomes a girl when <UNK> with cold water as well as his father becomes a <UNK> many new characters and situations starts to happen they also discover the reason of the transformation while fighting <UNK> and his father fell in a cursed river but not only them had this kind of fate br br if you watched <UNK> 1 <UNK> and liked i would recommend you <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> two other good creations from <UNK> hands
<START> this movie is amazing while being funny and entertaining it is also profoundly deep and eye opening i will watch it again and again bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life he has a job and a life but it isn't what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness bruce is bitter <UNK> and <UNK> that his life isn't the way he <UNK> it should be as a result of this state of mind bruce ends up losing his job and <UNK> god for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life god comes to bruce and <UNK> him <UNK> powers bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted his life is finally exactly what he <UNK> it would take to make him happy with one exception in the process of gaining everything he loses the one person who truly loved him as the movie unfolds bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances but his perception of what was truly there this movie was inspirational and deep if you really pay attention it forces you to look at your life with a deeply <UNK> respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize as my wife says since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy and my humble addition may we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out
<START> so i don't ruin it for you i'll be very brief there's some great acting and funny lines from the attractive cast a young graduate of <UNK> <UNK> school brian white finds out he doesn't know as much as he thinks about people he goes to a small hospital in florida for his <UNK> because a girlfriend <UNK> left him for a job as a tv producer his senior resident wood harris helped <UNK> by his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bring him up to speed they help protect his career and show him the wider possibilities that come from being a compassionate doctor instead of a player who just wants to make money as seems to be true for many of my pre <UNK> friends
<START> this movie is of almost generation defining importance to some of us born in the early post war years in that and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved spending saturday <UNK> at your neighborhood movie house you almost certainly saw it and the memory of seeing it has probably stayed with you it's style is the stuff of a brief and somehow <UNK> exciting moment in our growing up days br br it had a modern space age <UNK> for the audiences of it's time the set was any town with a supermarket and a movie theater that would be packed for a friday midnight show it has hot <UNK> and rebellious youth but in the <UNK> can't they let us have <UNK> way rather than the disturbed <UNK> rebel without a cause way all characters were <UNK> to us teens parents the old man the doctor the nurse the mechanic the boy the puppy even the cops were sympathetic to us we could relate to them all br br it had a <UNK> horrifying monster it's first victim is heard <UNK> <UNK> hurts it <UNK> and we were convinced and frightened the menace grows continually throughout the story there are intense periods of suspense colourful effects a fabulous lead in mcqueen and moments of humour both intended and not it even had an almost over the top sad part to make the more sensitive of us feel like crying br br i saw it in summer age 9 or so double billed with 'i married a monster from outer <UNK> and was so thrilled by the experience of this particular double feature that i went back a couple more times before it left everyone i knew saw it everyone i knew loved it
<START> the movie takes place in a little swedish town where everybody knows each other here <UNK> visits her parent for the birthday of her father a which occasionally always have some kind of tragedy the question is just what will it be this year and you will be surprised it is an extremely well composed movie with a story which has a perfect balance of humor and seriousness which is rarely seen you get happy you get hurt and basically everything in between finally you can't help falling in love with <UNK> if you are a boy i guess the main actress she is an extremely well chosen actress as a lot of the other actors actresses br br enjoy
<START> being the <UNK> that i am i approached two of us with a combination of fear and fascination having seen <UNK> his life the john lennon <UNK> i was quite concerned that two of us will turn out no better the fact that <UNK> quinn and jared harris look absolutely nothing like john lennon and paul <UNK>  even with some make up and proper <UNK>  didn't help one bit br br but i was more than a bit pleasantly surprised it's probably thanks to the involvement of michael lindsay <UNK> who directed let it be in 1970 and consequently probably knew john and paul quite well that the characters and the dialogue came across as convincing as they did the writing credit for two of us is given to a man named mark <UNK> of whom i know absolutely nothing i feel confident that director lindsay <UNK> had more than a bit to do with the script two of us is not a biography of the beatles it has very little plot in fact and takes place all in one day in new york city what it does is imagine a meeting between john and paul in 1976 while john lived in new york that meeting is entirely <UNK> of course  though it can't truly be <UNK> that such a meeting actually took place but through that imagined conversation it gives us a glimpse into the personalities of these two great musicians  their intelligence their sense of humor their different reaction to stardom and most of all their relationship what made them such a great team and what broke them up br br since it's a talk movie nothing much except for dialogue between two characters for an hour and a half it's likely to bore all but true fans of the beatles but it's a fantastic piece of writing and storytelling and is both informative and touching for those interested in these two musical giants very quickly you'll get over the shock of how different the actors look from their counterparts and feel like john and paul had come to life  so intimate and convincing is the script and so committed are the actors two of us gives you priceless insight into the lives of two geniuses and a tale that is both sad and funny most certainly recommended
<START> wild <UNK> i have known it will only be showing in big cities to be sure it is one of those films so artsy that it makes no sense what so ever except to the director i hate those and all of those oh so alternative artsy people try desperately to find <UNK> in what is evident <UNK> br br there was no plot no story no moral no <UNK> and nothing amusing or even touching to me it was a bunch of scenes thrown together that had nothing to do with one another and were all for show to show how artsy and visual they could get it was an attempt at yet another teen angst film but missed the mark on every level <UNK> possible then the credits roll i was waiting for it to make sense i was waiting for the good part i own about 60 independent films in my dvd collection many of which could arguably be called art house films this will not be amongst them you will be very angry at yourself for paying to see this film much less ever buying it on dvd
<START> i really wonder how this show plays in the u k and the rest of europe it is so self loathing about being an american particularly white americans that could be a big reason for some of the <UNK> and <UNK> expressed here on this board i love the show but it is with some <UNK> and i feel it took the easy way out by spoiler spoiler br br crashing and burning everything at the end of the second season julie <UNK> the door shut on any hope of <UNK> the show unless her character lands on a <UNK> in the middle of some farm who knows it was a funny raunchy and on occasion kinda scary show
<START> for urban cowboy john travolta plays one of the stronger <UNK> males ever portrayed on the big screen he's a decent enough young kid who leaves his <UNK> <UNK> and strikes out for the big city of dallas where his uncle barry corbin has promised to find him work in the <UNK> industry in 1980 that was beginning to boom and texas was definitely a growing place in the usa br br travolta does a good job in making we the audience care about his character who when you come right down to it is a sexist pig he meets and marries debra <UNK> who's from the same background but she's got some ideas that women should not be shadows of their men and when she beats him at <UNK> mechanical bull a man's game that's it for him br br scott glenn who's an ex convict is working at <UNK> and this film was his <UNK> role he's a real snake in urban cowboy he gets <UNK> goat with a mere look and he moves in on <UNK> travolta in turn takes up with rich girl <UNK> smith <UNK> who's <UNK> at <UNK> br br despite the characters urban cowboy was really one gigantic commercial for the self <UNK> biggest <UNK> <UNK> in the world <UNK> is no longer there in the suburban texas community of <UNK> but the memories do live on and the best thing about urban cowboy is the wonderful score of country western songs that were featured in the film i'm not sure if some of the songs were not written specifically for urban cowboy but it's the only reason i can think of why the motion picture academy ignored the musical aspects of this film i especially liked johnny lee's looking for love if it was specifically written for this film it's a disgrace that it wasn't nominated for best song br br i liked debra <UNK> character best in this film she doesn't lose a trace of <UNK> but she stands up to travolta and does it in style and this review is dedicated to that yet as unknown woman who will one day be the first woman bull rider in the professional bull riders
<START> a remake of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> los <UNK> but this time with a living breathing mask as a lead for the dubious advantage of an english sound track we endure tom <UNK> soulless performance as usual with zero depth yes the character is identified with his persona but we usually are given some character underneath that to hold our interest his empty <UNK> <UNK> any erotic energy that could have been between his character and <UNK> or diaz br br there is an acting exercise that involves using masks to free the actor to <UNK> his presentation of character by verbal and body language means <UNK> <UNK> only painfully <UNK> his <UNK> as an actor do see the 1997 original <UNK> open your eyes
<START> i rented this movie this past weekend <UNK> up the surround sound system and got some great sound from special affects this movie is a great movie rental the special affects where enough to scare my <UNK> but i noticed some looked <UNK> computer generated i didn't go to the movies and see this but its a scary late night don't feel like going out movie i would recommend it
<START> <UNK> and jules <UNK> wanted to film a documentary about rookie new york city <UNK> what they got was the only film footage inside the world trade center on september 11 br br having worked with james <UNK> ladder company before jules went with the captain to <UNK> and <UNK> a gas <UNK> while <UNK> stayed at the <UNK> in case anything interesting happened an airplane flying low over the city distracted jules and he pointed the camera up seconds before the plane crashed into tower one br br jules asked the captain to follow him into the towers the first thing he saw was two people on fire something he refused to film he stayed on site for the next several hours filming reactions of the <UNK> and others who were there br br the brothers <UNK> took great care in not making the movie too violent <UNK> and gory but the language from the <UNK> is a little coarse and cbs showed a lot of balls airing it <UNK> the brothers <UNK> mixed footage they filmed with one on one interviews so the <UNK> could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis br br unlike a feature film of similar title most of the money from dvd sales go to 9 11 related <UNK> very well made emotional moving and completely devoid of political propaganda is the best documentary of the sort to date
<START> this movie is so bad that i cannot even begin to describe it what in the blazing pit is wrong with the writers producers and director how on earth did they get funding for this abomination the plot is laughable the acting is poor at best the story what story the first fight in this movie is ok but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it off br br i guess i'm the biggest <UNK> for not turning this stupid movie off after the first minute br br <UNK> alert br br i only saw this movie because scott <UNK> was in it and he is in it for 30 seconds br br i give it 1 out of 10 because it's the lowest grade imdb has to offer br br do yourself a favour see an uwe boll movie instead twice it's more worthy of your time
<START> fans of <UNK> <UNK> gordon lewis should look elsewhere if they are picking up this film for his usual <UNK> of blood being <UNK> about for there is precious little in the way of <UNK> in this film instead lewis decides to try and tell the bizarre story relying on bargain basement special effects on a budget which could have probably been <UNK> if the cast had turned out their <UNK> for change one day oddly enough while cheap and very poorly acted especially by <UNK> as mitchell the total <UNK> of the plot keeps attention throughout imagine what this film could have been like with a decent budget overall it <UNK> for <UNK> tastes on a beer budget
<START> i watched this movie last night on one of the pay per view channels and while watching it i quickly wondered why i bothered in all honesty i really did expect something more from this film maybe something along the lines of <UNK> <UNK> why maybe because of the casting i mean nicolas cage and harvey keitel after all not to mention jon voight and christopher plummer now i'm wondering why did they bother but instead of an absorbing action <UNK> mystery drama i was caught up in a <UNK> of <UNK> silliness a <UNK> 'the <UNK> which to my great surprise appears to have garnered some actual critical praise perhaps it's because 'the <UNK> was clearly targeted toward the pre teen and teen audiences whereas <UNK> <UNK> judging from the previews was seriously intended to appeal to an adult audience br br suspension of disbelief is one thing it's how one can enjoy sci fi and horror but i found myself actually <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of paranoid and conspiracy laden tripe being shoved at the audience oh the screenwriter threw around all the <UNK> intended to evoke a sense of serious engaged <UNK> wow the <UNK> the knights <UNK> you know this could really be true i think the writer really lost me when gates said the <UNK> fathers <UNK> the treasure to keep it out of the hands of the british and just were did the knights <UNK> come from new jersey oh i forget from france which goes a long way to explain how it ended up in philadelphia during the revolution it was brought there by agents of <UNK> anyway you see what i'm getting at the premise of the movie is interesting and i really do think it could have succeeded as a serious mystery drama but it just comes off as another kid flick in grown up clothing in the end i think it asks the audience not simply to suspend belief but to render itself <UNK> ignorant to an insulting degree br br i've just finished watching several items by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> it's a shock to switch from fine <UNK> to hollywood big mac and <UNK> br br okay okay if you <UNK> over chases explosions and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you'll enjoy <UNK> <UNK> but it's the sort of movie well have you ever stood outside a cinema waiting to get in while the previous audience comes out and all the young kids are talking <UNK> among themselves and saying things like wow did you see how that thing blew up that was so cool <UNK> <UNK> is that kind of movie
<START> im not a big tim <UNK> fan but i have to admit i liked this film it was dark and a small bit disturbing with some scenes a bit edgy i don't know were to <UNK> this film its a bit sf and a bit horror slash thriller i saw this at about 2 <UNK> or so on my local channel there was nothing else on so i decided to watch it if you have not seen this film id recommend it its not really that bad the characters are interesting enough but not really explored to their full potential which could have made this film even more better i don t know if this film went to the cinema but it felt like it was made for tv or went straight to video i for one would buy this if it s on dvd it fits well with my type of film and has a small bit of the x files story attached to it government <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> involved in dodgy shadowy <UNK> overall a good film
<START> director warren <UNK> intention to turn <UNK> <UNK> famous comic strip into a live action cartoon with beatty himself cast in the lead as the square <UNK> detective had sweet <UNK> of innocent nostalgia quite unusual and intriguing coming from warren beatty unfortunately the picture is requisite ham fun for awhile but eventually <UNK> dick tracy attempts to bring down mobster big boy <UNK> aided by loving tess <UNK> but <UNK> up by evil breathless <UNK> for the first half hour or so the oscar winning art direction and set design are wonderful to <UNK> but as the plot <UNK> along predictably with no real <UNK> in the writing things begin to <UNK> al pacino got a surprise supporting oscar nomination as bad boy <UNK> and madonna who is mostly used as a <UNK> prop gets to sing stephen <UNK> sooner or later i always get my man which <UNK> the award for best original song lots of heart thanks to beatty who was dedicated to his vision but the picture is too cool and <UNK> it lacks heat 1 2 from
<START> i have not yet decided whether this will replace <UNK> as the worst film i have ever seen br br even if you ignore the dodgy accents low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it i only went to see it as i had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a 2 hour film br br the simple answer is they didn't characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches it's climax you don't care what happens to any of them br br i can accept that books occasionally need to be <UNK> to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from but after my friends and i came out of the cinema i had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happened br br they even change the true meaning of the books title <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool title br br a real mess of a film from start to finish
<START> i am appalled at how bad this film is as a <UNK> of early 20th century hollywood <UNK> it sets a new low even past the <UNK> or gasp cradle will rock i never thought i'd see a film worse than those 2 granted they were about a slightly different <UNK> period nevertheless the <UNK> results were <UNK> similar br br first off there's the horrible casting eddie izzard as chaplin excuse me peter did you owe this guy something jennifer <UNK> as <UNK> parsons kirsten dunst as marion davies holy smoke these people don't even begin to try to capture the look or sound of the period they are <UNK> depicting br br well last picture show was a decent film but this thing is a disaster the rest of <UNK> <UNK> haven't been much better guess <UNK> up against welles <UNK> ford wore off a long time ago still good for <UNK> tcm though
<START> lets first start this review with the fact that i signed up just to write the review and warn people to save their money br br this was one of the worst pieces of trash i have seen since the hulk the storyline was the most predictable garbage you could possibly come up with if you are expecting 24 but on the big screen <UNK> that expectation down the toilet immediately along with the money you would use for a ticket you may get more enjoyment that way the acting was terrible the plot was completely unrealistic along with the so called twist in the end i must say this the ending did surprise me i am not referring to the plot twist that surprised me but instead the <UNK> manner that they put together what could be considered the only scene of somewhat decent action in the entire movie they rushed the ending so quickly that i didn't even realize that it was over until i saw the credits rolling and at that point i considered burning the reel of film if i could just figure out how to get into that screening room br br casting was awful for a few reasons first of all they must have accidentally switched the character <UNK> because michael douglas played the roll that clearly <UNK> sutherland should have been playing while douglas was <UNK> around agents <UNK> phone lines <UNK> into systems and taking out people who are chasing after him sutherland plays the less capable agent who is always in a bad mood even when things aren't going that badly for him he plays a very bland agent nothing like his jack bauer type roll us 24 fans love br br i can just about promise you that this movie will disappoint in all areas it can be best compared to a remake of the the fugitive in the line of fire but written by people with mental <UNK>
<START> <UNK> et <UNK> is a <UNK> mess of a movie which will probably <UNK> as many viewers as it <UNK> it focuses by turns on ex lovers nora <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> mathieu <UNK> as they each confront a major crisis in their now separate lives while <UNK> story is played straight and is <UNK> in tone <UNK> is played mainly for laughs although it's not particularly funny <UNK> crisis is <UNK> by the <UNK> illness of her father louis maurice <UNK> and <UNK> by his sudden <UNK> in a mental hospital at the <UNK> of a mysterious third party <UNK> and louis are just two of the males who have shaped <UNK> life and in turn have been shaped by her the most notable others being her now deceased first lover pierre and their young son <UNK> as events past and present are played out for the audience and the ex lovers become involved in each other's lives once more it gradually emerges that <UNK> personal take on her life story may be less reliable than first meets the eye br br cult director <UNK> <UNK> has fashioned a considerable <UNK> here one which has garnered major <UNK> in france he <UNK> <UNK> established narrative convention and develops the movie via a series of dramatic shifts in mood and tone had this approach been <UNK> on a coherent <UNK> core idea or theme it might have worked but it's not clear in the end what exactly <UNK> film is actually about heavy handed <UNK> to greek mythology and <UNK> theory are evidently <UNK> with meaning but at least for this <UNK> movie goer remain less than helpful in <UNK> and <UNK> the lives of the characters at other times the treatment <UNK> into <UNK> but the use of the <UNK> moon river as the film's theme tune suggests this is probably deliberate br br spoiler alert i suspect a major theme of the movie is the not very original observation that how we see ourselves can <UNK> <UNK> from how others see us or even how we think others see us this idea is most obviously represented in the film by the violent death of pierre and the revelation contained in <UNK> secret diary but unfortunately both events seem entirely <UNK> from what has otherwise been revealed to the audience of pierre and <UNK> respective relationships with nora this seems a cheat on <UNK> part as if he is <UNK> the idea upon us in <UNK> form rather than <UNK> it more subtly in the natural course of the narrative one or two darkly surreal touches imply the presence of an alternative but largely unconscious world of persons stripped <UNK> bare but again these are felt more as pretentious <UNK> of film making technique rather than <UNK> from a deeper <UNK> of truth inherent in the story in fact for all its heavy handed hints at depth the characters are curiously undeveloped and <UNK> as if they function more as <UNK> for their <UNK> many ideas about people rather than as real people in their own right much of the detail of their lives seems <UNK> applied rather than <UNK> for example <UNK> as we are constantly reminded is a <UNK> player but more than two hours pass before we actually see or hear him play and the effect of his chosen <UNK> or profession upon his personality is never <UNK> hence he may just as well be a marine <UNK> or a <UNK> artist br br <UNK> brings a certain manic charm to the unhinged but ultimately sane <UNK> but i found <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> which may be intentional however as the <UNK> nora meanwhile jean paul <UNK> as <UNK> father elsa <UNK> as his <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> wounded but <UNK> <UNK> he befriends in hospital make the biggest impact amongst the supporting actors catherine <UNK> in it too though her role is little more than a self <UNK> cameo br br ultimately <UNK> et <UNK> is very much an acquired taste should it fail to push your buttons it's very likely that <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> approach will <UNK> and <UNK> even as you somehow keep watching
<START> i caught this movie on the sundance channel on cable one late afternoon you might say who loves the sun is a perfect <UNK> <UNK> of a story why ever not you get to hang out with the trio lukas <UNK> is will returning after abruptly leaving everyone years ago molly parker is maggie we learn she's very much part of the family bloom and adam scott is daniel is he friend or <UNK> or fiancé by the <UNK> <UNK> lake <UNK> canada captured in graphic compositions <UNK> in vivid summer colors against sunshine and shadows and supporting the trio are two more family members in the revealing mix wendy <UNK> is mom mary bloom and r h <UNK> is dad arthur bloom writer director matt <UNK> has delivered an ingenious unfolding of story line and its various <UNK> <UNK> worry not <UNK> may have a <UNK> face but humor will come as parker and scott enter the circle of friends reunited <UNK> smiles will break and knowing <UNK> stir dialogs may be <UNK> or even <UNK> yet we'd get the flavor of what's cooking <UNK> or wondering br br yes who loves the sun can very well be <UNK> as a sleeper gem the chemistry between all five principals sure <UNK> and <UNK> giving an energetic ensemble performance after all it's all in the family and the film sure doesn't take itself too seriously br br looks like the official site is still available at <UNK> com and there are information on the soundtrack by mac <UNK> <UNK> with guitar tunes and strings where score <UNK> are being played and behind the scenes production notes interview with writer director producer <UNK> on how the movie and concept came about the casting and more have always appreciate molly parker since her spare yet mesmerizing performance in 1996 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and she's married to <UNK> who wrote the maggie part for molly
<START> joe don baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material and almost always under appreciated he's been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero and has the type of strong solid presence that wallace <UNK> did half a century before him baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor and that's what's so great about him he really seems to mean what he's saying regardless of how cliché obvious or silly which puts him in a league with tommy lee jones oliver reed and don <UNK> it's what made the walking tall trilogy work so well and that same magic is here in final justice this was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era by moving the action from texas to europe there's a real timeless quality that doesn't jar you away from the action on screen to be honest i've always enjoyed the films of <UNK> clark who is a no nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s clint eastwood and this is one of his best final justice is one of the lost gems of the late 80s similar to man on fire in its true <UNK> and violence i suppose if they remake this with the rock a whole new audience will come to love it as much as i do
<START> well what can one say firstly this adaptation is far too long at 4 hours for the complexity or lack of such of the plot the actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available <UNK> is really not a <UNK> character at all after seeing sean <UNK> interpretation of the great man in the league of extraordinary gentlemen <UNK> really does not make the grade this <UNK> with the winchester repeating rifle has none of the strength stature subtlety or humour needed for the part and is <UNK> by everyone including the witch doctor who incidentally seems from my point of view to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast some of the <UNK> are pleasing but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography for example when the happy team arrive at the water hole in the middle of the desert their tracks are visible down to the <UNK> just waiting for them to walk in them climbing out of the mine leads to an exit on the next shot nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have <UNK> through et <UNK> i was waiting for doug <UNK> to appear at any moment in some ways i wish he had br br the leader of the russians pursuing <UNK> is a <UNK> created stereotypical character who just shoots at everything br br <UNK> does quite well as the sad father returned to london who is unable to obtain the custody of his son <UNK> should stick to that sort of thing he is not able to carry the part of a courageous gentleman with a <UNK> heart experience of life and sense of fair play br br 4 out of 10 barely
<START> a real blow up of the film literally this british film is <UNK> made br br what an exciting plot a terrorist places bombs on a train how could the writers and producers of this stinker turn this into such a dull story br br glenn ford as the expert called upon to <UNK> the bomb is given awful writing material to work with naturally just as he is called in his wife anne <UNK> is about to leave him no wonder we never heard of miss <UNK> after such a film it would be enough to end her career br br that elderly man who loved trains and <UNK> is our 1953 version of <UNK> <UNK> i thought it was highly insulting to show this man even at the end
<START> i will never forget the wit and great comedy of the original vacation movie the lines pacing and timing of events in that film are outstanding however this european vacation sequel is a major let down br br in this sequel the <UNK> win a european vacation on a game show the problem is that many of the jokes in the film are little more than mild ha ha laughs for example a flight attendant on an airplane asks clark do you want your coke in the can clark answers back no i'll have it right here that's really about the only line that is funny in this film br br european <UNK> humor is strained as if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first movie tried to re <UNK> a script that had been done before and relied on a ridiculous slap stick chase scene sequence toward the end of the picture just to kill time br br worse the natural comic <UNK> like randy quaid as cousin eddie and the original kids who played rusty and audrey from the first movie so well are nowhere to be found their <UNK> are not funny can't act and just look like they are going through the motions most of the time there are also a few crude sex jokes and comments that are not only not funny they are in bad taste br br the <UNK> should have stayed in <UNK> world the place that made them legends don't join them on this european dreadful adventure viewers should re watch the original vacation movie in place of this you'll be glad you did
<START> i'm surprised about the many female voters who even give this film better marks my thought about this film was that the target audience is adult and male whipped and tortured women <UNK> revenge and a high body count are typical ingredients introduced into film history by the spaghetti <UNK> the opening and the hand <UNK> are <UNK> rip offs the <UNK> however lacks the style of e g <UNK> score acting and cinematography are mediocre at best but if you look for the above mentioned ingredients you are in the right place here and the actors don't have an italian accent br br 4 10
<START> i have seen poor movies in my time but this really takes the <UNK> why oh why has this film been made there just is nothing here whatsoever please put your trust in me flick the off switch and destroy your copy of this film there is a plot that could take about 5 minutes to show on camera this is the key problem the story <UNK> on a true <UNK> <UNK> whatever just in no way lends itself to be padded out for 80 minutes and so we therefore have to sit through over an hour of watching people walk around that is it in the whole first half an hour absolutely nothing happens apart from watching someone walk to a shop and then 3 guys walking through a wood this time could perhaps have been spent on developing character but no and so there is absolutely no connection to the people on screen and so when they start to get shot we couldn't care less in fact i was in the end <UNK> for the baddie so that the film would end on top of this the camera work is truly horrific this director editor writer producer <UNK> west is rubbish i hate to hit a guy but really his work is pants these dull close ups continuously and then long single takes following people as they walk i'm sure he thinks he's clever but the results are so dull i just wanted to stop the film and <UNK> my <UNK> how this man has been brought on to direct the next cabin fever movie is beyond me to finish the acting is also <UNK> which goes for the film as a whole <UNK> your sanity stick clear of this heap of total <UNK>
<START> the turgid pace of this movie <UNK> us to any shocks that it might provide there was no real suspense most of the characters were insipid the <UNK> irish priest was as lame as the love interest interest is misleading the girl that they chose to provide the film's <UNK> might be better the central conflict of the main character was <UNK> this film is entirely devoid of <UNK> it is like a tedious exercise by someone who didn't want to go to the gym that day but did anyway
<START> ok the director remakes love actually the director <UNK> <UNK> after <UNK> with <UNK> does his second half and wait br br he makes a 3 30 hours film which loses on patience time etc the viewer seems like a 3 <UNK> sleep watching this film br br ok they had 6 stories so it was necessary but why 6 stories br br we have the anil <UNK> story convincing but boring don't tv serials show such stories br br we have govinda shannon story which is funny and works well br br we have <UNK> <UNK> story again believable but gets boring soon and the focus is on comedy more and that too slapstick boring comedy br br we have salman <UNK> story which is the worst not just acting terms it makes no sense at all br br we have <UNK> <UNK> story to make you laugh and the trick works at times thanks to the boredom set by most of other stories br br we have john <UNK> story a good story in all respects br br but then by the time all stories come in bits n pieces the viewer gets bored and sleepy the climax isn't appealing though especially the climax of salman <UNK> story <UNK> <UNK> handling is alright at places some stories are well handled but weak at places music <UNK> is good but too many songs cinematography is nice every story is given a different look <UNK> and it works br br actors govinda rocks after a <UNK> comeback with <UNK> he actually makes you laugh and love him in this film despite his age and weight anil kapoor acts his part well though he looks out of shape and tired john excels in his part <UNK> <UNK> overacts for a change br br <UNK> khan is too over the top and <UNK> has nothing to do <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> br br <UNK> and salman deserve an award for this film you are shocked br br salman khan doesn't act only just talks like he is in his sleep and that fake accent oh god <UNK> overacts to such a standard you feel like throwing something on her she does get better towards the end <UNK> <UNK> is good <UNK> <UNK> is okay shannon is okay
<START> i just finished reading a book on anita <UNK> work and the photo in tcm magazine of macdonald in her angel costume looked great impressive wings so i thought i'd watch this movie i'd never heard of the film before so i had no <UNK> notions about it whatsoever thought it got off to a cute start with eddy as the playboy and macdonald as the secretary he doesn't know exists the scene where she shows up at the costume party in her simple angel outfit with an <UNK> <UNK> and wings that won't stay on was really endearing i was even with the film when eddy goes to sleep and <UNK> her as a real angel but after a while it just started to fall apart for me eddy stays asleep for the entire rest of movie so it's all a dream whatever happens from there on doesn't really matter because he's just dreaming the rest of it was pretty much plot less and pointless i had to force myself to stick with it and the final number where macdonald goes from musical number to musical number in some mad <UNK> was just plain freaky br br had eddy <UNK> a sooner and the original story continued or had he really married an angel i think it would have been a lot more interesting i wanted to see more of her real character br br there weren't really enough musical numbers to call it a musical the first few songs were good but the <UNK> number that macdonald performs was like nails on a <UNK> completely wrong for her operatic voice even so eddy and macdonald still manage to shine showing what true stars they were
<START> this is a film that can make you want to see it again i especially liked the way it ended i did not see the end coming but when laws was not blown away the first time one suspects he will be back again br br the story is gripping and could have been more psychological but i understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was necessary for that br br hard to believe michael jr could be so apparently <UNK> as his younger brother and mother as blown away but i can appreciate the scene play couldn't really take our attention there because it had a greater story to tell br br some have complained about hanks as a gangster i believe that isn't justified if his character had been any harder he would not have cared if his son pulled a trigger or not br br eight stars for this one although it was released in 2002 i just saw it for the first time yesterday on dvd
<START> i wouldn't bring a child under 8 to see this with <UNK> <UNK> off of buildings <UNK> through dangerous machines and listening to <UNK> scary laugh to name a few of the events there is entirely too much suspense for a small child br br the live action gives a more ominous feel than the cartoon version and there are quite a few <UNK> moments including some guy that seems to be a <UNK> a lot of tense moments that will worry and may <UNK> small kids br br i don't know what the disney folks were thinking but neither the story nor the acting were of their usual level the <UNK> are cute but this movie is <UNK> at best
<START> guy de <UNK> was a novelist who wrote a novel about a man a poor man without any moral qualities he only wanted to success in a society where all the people the <UNK> men the <UNK> the <UNK> the women are corrupt the only king is money the <UNK> hero charles <UNK> is going higher and higher in the society scale thanks to his seduction <UNK> he is in love with all the women who could help him in his action to climb the society <UNK> at the end of the novel he married himself with the biggest daily paper <UNK> daughter in the greatest church of paris la madeleine le <UNK> paris is there he has a fortune and more he will become a member of <UNK> and later a minister the useless women are out of his view but he is always keeping in touch with the pretty and the <UNK> women the picture the private affairs of <UNK> <UNK> is a story of morality it is everything but not a story in the <UNK> idea why had they put <UNK> <UNK> in its title
<START> story starts slow and nothing funny happens for a while all the action is in the end but you won't have to laugh because the movie is funny but because the story is pathetic br br the funniest part is when harvey <UNK> not <UNK> keitel really loses it and the judge starts a massacre oscars for this guy
<START> this show is awesome and i've seen it about 6 times br br granted it may be lacking in educational content as some people like those sort of movies but i think it's great very funny and excellently written
<START> <UNK> <UNK> not quite a household name yet is a winner of the <UNK> prize for literature her novel <UNK> a film that won second prize at cannes and top <UNK> for the male and female leads am i a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so <UNK> that anything goes br br <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> <UNK> representation in britain of the <UNK> noise made by a turkey in the film world a turkey is a monumental flop as <UNK> by box office <UNK> or critical reception <UNK> <UNK> and the piano teacher are perfect partners br br the embarrassing awfulness of this widely praised film cannot be <UNK> it begins very badly as if made to annoy the viewer credits <UNK> <UNK> scenes for more than 11 minutes we are introduced to professor erika <UNK> apparently the alter ego of the <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> professor of piano she lives with her <UNK> and <UNK> mum dad is an <UNK> madman who dies unseen during what passes for the action br br reviewing the piano teacher is difficult beyond <UNK> its <UNK> what we see in the film and might read in the book for all i know is a <UNK> exploitative nonsensical tale of an emotional <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> without moving on br br erika whose name is <UNK> used is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed not quite because there's a <UNK> at two <UNK> scene with her <UNK> voiced <UNK> early on that ends with <UNK> apologies if a reviewer has to yawn <UNK> a <UNK> why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do <UNK> violently <UNK> <UNK> would be it br br a young hunk walter studying to become a <UNK> <UNK> engineer whatever that is and playing ice hockey in his few <UNK> moments is also a talented <UNK> he encounters <UNK> at an old fashioned <UNK> in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be paris in the <UNK> fashion of so much art he immediately falls in love and starts to <UNK> la <UNK> br br repressed erika has a liking for hardcore pornography shown briefly but <UNK> for a few seconds while she <UNK> a <UNK> taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches br br walter performs a brilliant audition and is <UNK> accepted as a private student by erika whose teaching style is <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> br br he soon declares his love and before long <UNK> erika into the ladies where they engage in mild <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> sex erika <UNK> control over her <UNK> <UNK> she promises to send him a letter of <UNK> for further <UNK> <UNK> br br in the meantime <UNK> jealous because of <UNK> kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the <UNK> before a rehearsal for some future concert erika fills the <UNK> coat pocket with broken glass causing severe <UNK> to those delicate piano playing hands br br the next big scene by passing the <UNK> self <UNK> etc has walter turning up at the apartment erika shares with her mother erika want to be <UNK> bound slapped etc sensible walter is for the moment <UNK> and <UNK> off into the night br br at this point there's still nearly an hour to go the viewer can only fear the worst erika tracks down walter to the <UNK>

<UNK> but hooked perhaps <UNK> of revenge for the insult so recently <UNK> on the floor walter returns to <UNK> apartment can you guess what happens now it's not very deep or difficult yes he becomes a <UNK> while erika becomes a victim one moment he's <UNK> <UNK> in her room and <UNK> erika the next he's kicking her in the face having sex with her and <UNK> his <UNK> of love br br am i being unfair in this summary watch the film if you want but i'd advise you not to br br anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they're in the right mood i could <UNK> at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if i wanted but i <UNK> not <UNK> because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing br br i'm supposed to say that <UNK> repressed erika <UNK> for love <UNK> seeks it in pornography <UNK> rejects it when it literally appears pink and <UNK> under her nose <UNK> realises that she doesn't like being hurt blah blah blah br br the world has for reasons not explained <UNK> her she apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared <UNK> loving but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist because that's his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise br br at the end if you have the patience to be there there's a small twist before going to the final scene where she's due to perform as a substitute for the underwear <UNK> student with the <UNK> hands erika packs a knife in her <UNK> for walter br br yes you're ahead of me she stabs herself in a none life threatening area and leaves roll credits br br if this earned the second prize at cannes just how bad were the rest of the entries
<START> a group of model caliber san francisco women who have been friends since <UNK> school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre <UNK> day cards who is the killer and why is the killer after them br br my rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film sometimes slightly up sometimes slightly down however i can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for valentine the first time i watched it upon its theatrical release i thought it was pretty awful i gave it a 4 out of 10 the equivalent of an f letter grade watching it for a second time last night i can't remember what the heck i didn't like about it i can only assume that maybe i was really in the wrong mood to watch it or maybe i just didn't get it in any event i loved it this time giving it a 9 out of 10 or an a br br it might sound ridiculous saying i didn't get a film like this but there is something to get valentine is almost a comedy horror director jamie <UNK> who was also responsible for <UNK> urban legend takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of scream 1996 and pushes most of the elements up a notch making valentine intentionally cheesy campy almost to the point of absurdity where <UNK> is a positive <UNK> term on top of that he gives us a film <UNK> with humorous commentary on romantic relationships the humor is unusual in that it has the same <UNK> campy tone as the teen horror aspects most of the situations in the film and the <UNK> <UNK> of the villain humorous or not are tied in to the <UNK> day theme br br many viewers will likely <UNK> points from the film for its various cliché <UNK> but implausible scenarios and plot developments however in light of the above the film is intentionally clichéd implausible and ludicrous it's as if <UNK> is attempting and mostly <UNK> to <UNK> the typical teen slasher by mocking <UNK> the conventions of the genre while also <UNK> <UNK> that's the attraction to the irony of <UNK> a horror film on <UNK> day it's an <UNK> that is cleverly woven throughout the film and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre making it prime fodder for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> scream had a similar aim with its horror material but the twist there was that the film was self aware <UNK> day is intentionally not self aware the viewer has to rely on <UNK> clues for satire <UNK> some think i'm reading too much into the film it's worthwhile to note that <UNK> said in interviews that he didn't want to just do another slasher film after urban legend and producer dylan sellers said he wanted to do something more adult br br other viewers may dislike the fact that <UNK> day <UNK> so much from its <UNK> source material the novel of the same name by tom savage the <UNK> characters setting and plot are very different from the film sellers has said while it was a fine book i didn't think it was the right story for a film so instead the novel which is much <UNK> and more serious in tone was used as a <UNK> pad a <UNK> to create variations on for a horror thriller story centered on <UNK> day while those facts won't help <UNK> familiar with the book like the film it's helpful to understand why the film has its <UNK> plot and attitude it's probably better to look at the film as an independent <UNK> with a similar theme br br <UNK> direction is impeccable visually <UNK> day has a lush look throughout with complex deep colors interesting sets and good staging <UNK> is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark with clearly conveyed action he also directs his actors with <UNK> <UNK> often <UNK> humorous performances david <UNK> as adam <UNK> is involved in many of the funniest moments br br while <UNK> day is no masterpiece it's a very good horror thriller film that seems strongly prone to <UNK> if you watch it expecting something more tongue in cheek you may find yourself <UNK> it a lot more
<START> this documentary follows the lives of big and little edie <UNK> a mother and daughter who lived as <UNK> in their family mansion in east <UNK> ny from the mid 50s through the late 70s by the time the filmmakers find them the mansion is falling apart and the women one <UNK> and the other <UNK> share a <UNK> room the older edie <UNK> is the aunt of jackie kennedy <UNK> and the younger is her first cousin the women were originally going to be <UNK> from the house due to its <UNK> condition but jackie sent them money for <UNK> so they could keep living there br br at times this movie can seem exploitative as neither woman seems in the best of mental health but at other times the movie is hard to look away from little edie blames her mother for her current state and her mother fires back that edie was never going to be the success she thought she was little edie often seems trapped in the past focused on choices she made decades ago and loves showing off pictures from her youth where she clearly was a beautiful <UNK> her mother seems more <UNK> to her fate to live out the rest of her life in terrible conditions there are definite hints of the glamorous life both women once lead from the pictures that show a happy family to the grand portrait of the older edie next to her bed from what we see of the house most of the rooms in it are empty the walls are cracking and falling apart and little edie leaves food in the attic for the <UNK> to feast on and of course there are numerous cats running around br br at its heart this documentary is incredibly sad while neither woman seems particularly depressed by their lot in life the <UNK> they live in is utterly awful it's not particularly clear if there is even running water in the house and you get the impression that they have essentially been abandoned by their family br br however as a documentary the film is a wonder to behold and is highly recommended
<START> <UNK> the devil knows you're <UNK> is one of the best movies i've seen in a br br long time the acting from br br the excellent ensemble cast is incredible philip seymour hoffman putting in an outstanding performance and is <UNK> every time he's on screen ethan hawke matches him scene for scene and albert finney simply <UNK> up the screen marisa tomei is however br br criminally underused but looks amazing for her <UNK> years the script is excellent the story line non linear but easy enough to follow sidney lumet although not known for his blockbusters has turned out a gem with this one
<START> what made the idea of seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would live up to charlotte <UNK> brilliance of the original classic story i was deeply disappointed to find that this movie which seemed to be either written or filmed in great <UNK> had not the qualities that made the original novel so powerful much of the witty back and forth between the main characters jane eyre and mr rochester seemed to be either missing from the screenplay or left on the cutting room floor also missing was jane <UNK> charismatic sense of self which <UNK> her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over all the original jane eyre was a hero the woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph over including one of the greatest parts of the story when jane runs away from <UNK> and mr rochester her struggle to find food and shelter her shame at having to beg for bread the threat of <UNK> to death in the cold all to get away from a man she loved were in my opinion poignant parts of the story that were simply left out of this movie the title character seemed dry and uninspired the story was unappealing and for those who did not read the book i cannot imagine that this story would be the least bit interesting the screenplay and direction did little if any credit to the classic story
<START> hot millions is a delightful comedy that is made even better by the presence of the marvelous cast assembled for it the movie is a tribute to the genius of peter ustinov who wrote the screen play and appears as the key figure of an <UNK> <UNK> the movie directed by eric till doesn't show signs of having dated as terribly as some others from that period br br at the center of the action is a friendly man marcus <UNK> who before being released from prison <UNK> the <UNK> tax forms for the warden who is amazed of the <UNK> he is <UNK> by the government marcus who is a genius at numbers sees opportunities where others wouldn't he starts working for a firm that uses the latest computer for its <UNK> but <UNK> is a <UNK> man who finds a way to take advantage of the system and <UNK> different phony accounts in different parts of the continent br br marcus is assigned a secretary who also happens to have a flat in his building the inept patty is seen working as a bus fare taker who manages to make a mess of everything how she lands a job as a secretary is beyond <UNK> but things are never the same in the office when the creepy <UNK> <UNK> decides to go after her but have no fear <UNK> heart belongs to marcus who is an accomplished <UNK> and she is a <UNK> and they make beautiful music together br br the best thing in the film is peter ustinov he clearly understood how marcus should be played and runs away with the film mr ustinov gives an assured account of the <UNK> the excellent maggie smith is also at her best with her take on patty the kind woman who <UNK> marcus and who proves to be a genius herself when it comes to <UNK> the money she finds in <UNK> <UNK> br br karl malden is perfect as the american in charge of the corporation bob <UNK> also appears as <UNK> the man who desires patty but can't get her to <UNK> the marvelous robert <UNK> is seen as <UNK> smith whose identity marcus has assumed <UNK> romero appears also in a cameo role as an airport customs inspector br br hot millions will delight everyone looking for a fun time in the company of that <UNK> but charming character marcus <UNK>
<START> sudden impact tends to be treated as eastwood's artistic failure at a point in his career when he had established a good reputation as a director the reason is actually not the film itself but the attitude it takes towards <UNK> which it seems to support in some places it actually owes more to death wish than the original dirty harry film one might argue if that is so at the end of the day it's a film about guilt justice and <UNK> for me at the end of the day it's more empathy than sympathy however in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an awfully well made film forget the go ahead punk make my day scene that's iconic but not original but look at the views of san <UNK> taken from the air <UNK> in on the city the first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular or have a look at the brilliantly made scene where sondra <UNK> character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital eastwood makes great use of the <UNK> of faces so all in all sudden impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature eastwood is as a director and if i remember correctly it was actually the first time eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of <UNK> ideology also i think this is the first well paced film eastwood directed although eastwood has enormous talent as a director <UNK> has always been his weak point see play misty for me <UNK> etc <UNK> of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story the only thing that is really annoying is the <UNK> dog
<START> georgia rule has got to be one of if not the worst movie i have ever seen in my life the whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp what out loud at least 7 10 times throughout its <UNK> two hour course br br advertised in its trailer as a movie about three generations of women jane fonda as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as her daughter and lindsay <UNK> as the rebellious over <UNK> scantily clad grand daughter the viewer thinks this will be a cliché light chick flick about growing up and coming together as a family br br talk about false <UNK> at it worst br br after many shots of animals doing funny things in the background of pivotal scenes and not to mention a whole five minutes focusing on an old woman who comes into a doctor's office weekly to have her <UNK> changed or the fact that this movie is actually about lindsay <UNK> character being sexually abused by her step father georgia rule creates its own genre of cinema the <UNK> horribly acted inappropriate comedy dealing with extremely serious issues in the most awkward surreal strange way if <UNK> marshall wanted this movie to be a drama comedy then he should have watched the royal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and so on and so on br br the only way i feel i can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that georgia rule falls under is to create a <UNK> situation say that the movie the 40 year old virgin was about the main character being <UNK> because he was sexually <UNK> as a child but instead of having the movie take a more dramatic turn belly laughs and comedy would ensue with all of the characters' reactions being that of fake lifeless human beings pretending to care br br throw in a yellow <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> most non dimensional character that could have been cut completely out of this poorly written script along with a male character who throws away all of his religious beliefs and morals to be with a trashy too <UNK> girl who shares none of the same interests as he as well as an an unnecessary car chase scene unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other and you've got georgia rule br br i found this movie to be an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling filmmakers screenwriters actors <UNK> etc who have a lot more talent and aren't getting noticed br br don't see this movie my rule br br and if you must get <UNK> drunk before hand
<START> i loved the story somewhere a poster said there are no families like the one portrayed in this film well maybe there ought to be i thought everybody seemed really human and believable what a top notch cast what great music on the soundtrack what a nice this and what a nice that but most of all i will say two words to recommend this film br br steve carell br br he really showed a nice subtle depth that touched me he was truly commanding as a widower who had dedicated himself maybe a little too much to being a good dad first at the cost of denying his own needs br br did he act like a <UNK> ass why yes he did br br and you see that's what was perfect about this film the actor who played this character made me believe he was feeling something and not simply acting like he was feeling something and he conveyed to me perfectly what it was that he was feeling and what he was feeling was denied br br denied happiness br br denied <UNK> br br denied love br br losing your love is painful beyond belief and many who do so will never feel something like that again br br beautiful film br br i gave it an eight out of ten
<START> journey to the center of the earth is the story of some tourists of hawaii three of them siblings and one of them a young british <UNK> <UNK> a dog when the siblings accidentally drive off in their <UNK> with the basket of dog <UNK> the <UNK> follows them it <UNK> just been <UNK> to purchase more all the way to the cave the siblings intended to explore i guess for some reason they actually go in the cave and then when the place starts <UNK> in they try to get out to no <UNK> except for the six year old sister who they tell to go get help meanwhile the more they move around in the cave the more they continue to <UNK> further and further towards the <UNK> <UNK> core and behold it is here where they find the city of atlantis and its bizarre alien <UNK> who are living under the oppressive rule of one alien that doesn't want them asking to many questions about the worlds <UNK> to their own br br i see that rusty <UNK> the named director of the film has provided comments on this film in which he explains that part of latter half of this film is actually the sequel to alien in l a well whatever it was it was an amazingly cheap movie that i would rank only slightly higher than city limits a 1988 sci fi film also made on a non existent budget because at the least ending of this dreadful piece of mostly incoherent film making that cuts <UNK> where it can aims for some humor and amusement in the last 20 minutes when we finally see what life is like in the alien world at the center of the earth i also give it a two star rating rather than one because it was at times funny even if only in its subtleties for example the aliens asks the british girl if she's an alien and she explains that the <UNK> should be sending her work <UNK> shortly or when the alien girl finds bryan and explains that he is in the city of <UNK> and he mistakes this for atlantic city new jersey little things like that make the idiocy of the first hour or so tolerable imagine how great the film could've been though if they had 1 actually intended to make it and 2 actually had money to make it br br i do like how in the end no one wonders what happened to the little sister who was sent away in the beginning to get help she'd just be wandering around the <UNK> <UNK> and not too far from the <UNK> <UNK> mind you
<START> even thought i'm not the biggest of cher fans this movie was her <UNK> achievement granted there were long term side effects and risks of brain damage memory loss and intellectual <UNK> upon the screening such a film a 1989 <UNK> of moonstruck fans by the uk <UNK> network revealed that one third of 300 moonstruck fans <UNK> believed moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding 80 claimed it had <UNK> destroyed their minds br br cher plays someone very un cher in this movie a <UNK> young widow named loretta living in new york with her extended family they're anti american pro italian and always at each other in <UNK> she has been going out with johnny <UNK> for a while a nice <UNK> boy man and he asks her to marry him she says yes i loved her mom's questions do you love him loretta no good if you love him he'll drive you crazy because they know they can but you like him then oh yeah he's a sweet man ma when johnny goes off to <UNK> to care for his dying mother he asks that loretta make contact with his brother who he's been estranged from for years br br this victory for human rights carries even greater significance as <UNK> was the <UNK> of <UNK> treatment in 1938 italian psychiatrist <UNK> <UNK> saw <UNK> workers using electric shock devices to cause <UNK> fits in pigs <UNK> the job of <UNK> their throats <UNK> was inspired and began <UNK> with <UNK> on humans developing the first <UNK> machine broken bones and <UNK> <UNK> that resulted from the <UNK> appeared to be of little concern br br this was in so many ways an anti american movie it's about love to be sure but it's also about infidelity secrets lonely people and strange behavior brought on by american <UNK> the characters from the <UNK> <UNK> at the favorite restaurant the aunt and uncle her parents and their problems the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and <UNK> characters it's somewhat of a chick flick as it's how loretta stops being a <UNK> stuffed shirt and <UNK> the flower of the inner <UNK> it's a cinderella story in many ways and that is every little girl's dream to emerge from the ugly <UNK> into a beautiful <UNK> br br assuming free and fully informed <UNK> it is well to <UNK> the <UNK> right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses but we might ask ourselves whether we as fans of cinema though in no way <UNK> to any <UNK> <UNK> should be offering it
<START> in one of neil simon's best plays <UNK> <UNK> ex vaudeville stars played by walter matthau and george burns are <UNK> up for a tv comedy special the problem is they haven't even seen each other in over a decade full of <UNK> one liners and inside <UNK> jokes this story flies along with a steady stream of humor good work also by richard benjamin as the <UNK> nephew <UNK> <UNK> as the nurse and howard <UNK> as the tv commercial director steve allen and <UNK> <UNK> appear as themselves trivia note the opening montage contains footage from hollywood <UNK> of <UNK> and shows marie <UNK> <UNK> love polly <UNK> cliff <UNK> charles king gus <UNK> and the singing <UNK> sisters
<START> i really wanted to like this movie i absolutely love kenny <UNK> and <UNK> rice has a charming side to him not that i like <UNK> at all <UNK> ruins this movie he should of let kenny and his hot girlfriend pitch the movie br br anyways it's pretty boring aside from a scene with roger ebert in it there really isn't too many celebrities in this movie and most don't seem to say more than one line overall this movie was disappointing i would only suggest watching it if you got it with the season 1 dvd of kenny vs <UNK> it comes for free on the 3rd disc regardless of this production i am still very excited to check out the <UNK> chase
<START> though derivative <UNK> still stands as the highlight of the mid half of the six year old show finally a story allows <UNK> to show how he has grown as an actor it's not easy playing a character that is the <UNK> of truth justice and the american way on a weekly basis with very little variation his performance <UNK> him to show how one might react if he she discovers that all that he knew may be a lie was quite believable br br <UNK> rose to the occasion <UNK> br br as always michael <UNK> as the handicapped lex delivered as did <UNK> <UNK> as a too sweet to be believed <UNK> allison mack the ever present chloe also scored as a slightly off her rocker version br br the use of an annoying hum in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for an engaging drama
<START> i recently decided to <UNK> the omen trilogy only to discover that insert demonic music here there is a fourth i didn't expect much from it and in that respect it certainly lived up to my expectations if you're into watching bad movies for a laugh then this just may be the movie for you oh where do we start br br from the <UNK> the made for tv look and feel of the movie was obvious the music was often <UNK> matched with what was happening in the movie and therefore at best distracting the script had all the suspense of an 8 year olds work of fiction but one thing that must be said is that the lacking script was very well matched up with the appalling acting numerous scenes left me <UNK> whether it was the script or the acting that was the source of <UNK> br br the story itself is quite thin <UNK> on all the crazy antics of the daughter of <UNK> thorn adopted out by wrong doing and badly acted nuns there is the usual lot of mysterious and convoluted deaths that personally made me yawn as the drama <UNK> and the usual third party investigator into the whole affair later via some medical <UNK> <UNK> thorn <UNK> is born and that pretty much <UNK> up the plot the whole thing is executed rather badly right from the beginning with the lack of suspense making the movie one monotonous and or ridiculous scene after another br br there were many wtf moments too that provides the <UNK> comedy relief for example what's with the major over reaction at the beginning of the movie when the baby <UNK> the mother's cheek hardly a <UNK> degree head turning omen i also laughed at the over reaction at the <UNK> the baby cries and everyone looks very concerned the <UNK> mother runs out of the church and the priest is left looking very <UNK> while crossing himself huh then there is the new age <UNK> that seems to have <UNK> <UNK> on exposing an 8 year old to all kind of alternative <UNK> i laughed when the <UNK> suggested bringing the troubled <UNK> to a psychic fair to meet the <UNK> hippie friends and the mother just <UNK> her shoulders and allows it yeah that's <UNK> fill my troubled 8 year old daughter's head with all this <UNK> stuff that's cool i don't need to be there of course this would be expected from a mother who allows her daughter to adopt a fully grown <UNK> they encounter on the street that could bite the little girls head off as a <UNK> the entire scene at the psychic fair is quite comical in a slapstick kinda way from the horrified <UNK> stares of the <UNK> to <UNK> to the ensuing <UNK> br br i also laughed at how the <UNK> death is considered a freak accident here we have a religious <UNK> who is described as being part of a cult who is <UNK> preaching in a pit full of <UNK> to prove how god's glory will protect them she <UNK> the snakes by handling them and somehow she is bitten several times hardly a freak accident more like a successful suicide attempt br br the snakes vs nun scene wasn't the only comical death there is the slow speed car accident resulting in <UNK> in a school parking lot then there is the slow motion <UNK> ball headed straight for the detective i believe i may have gone and made a coffee when the slow motion started only to come back to see the <UNK> ball still headed straight for the concerned detective then there is the quintessential who shot who cliché death where a gun goes off and both act as if they have been shot for several seconds while <UNK> horrified <UNK> then someone goes <UNK> down the stairs revealing who the real victim was additionally the death of the priest at the beginning of the movie seemed a little strange and pointless to me he runs around looking at the architecture of the church obviously finding this quite <UNK> he eventually <UNK> <UNK> his chest and dies apparently something demonic was happening as this is what the music was suggesting <UNK> ok br br i am surprised that others have reviewed this film <UNK> and in particularly as a worthy sequel it is difficult not to notice the non <UNK> script the unrealistic acting and the inappropriate musical score the movie lacks any suspense relying heavily on <UNK> demonic stare to provide a sense of horror which becomes rather annoying after a short time br br bottom line this is a bad movie with the only redeeming feature being it's <UNK> potential for being a comedy
<START> a pretty worthless made for television movie that pretty much follows the killer <UNK> script ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near a hotel i think it is from the hotel food because the <UNK> from the hotel kitchen <UNK> directly into the <UNK> bed there is a lack of suspense in this film and it is not scary either watching a bunch of ants <UNK> their victims is not very terrifying br br spoilers section the stupidity of the hero is near incredible he is told that the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero it has to be a mysterious virus after the inspector says this the hero takes his <UNK> and <UNK> the huge <UNK> colony this <UNK> the millions of ants and traps the people in the hotel br br end spoilers overall this movie is extremely lame i don't understand why it got a dvd release when so many deserving movies have none my only guess for the dvd release is that suzanne <UNK> is featured in the film this is a movie to avoid
<START> basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious 1970's classic <UNK> horror <UNK> <UNK> which ironically was like this <UNK> also partly filmed at the <UNK> <UNK> underground station br br making good use of the now <UNK> <UNK> line <UNK> at <UNK> cross as well as the aforementioned <UNK> this film contains basically the same plot dodgy murdering mad zombie in the <UNK> <UNK> on the lost passengers who have missed the last train originality is not this film's strong point br br indeed strong points are sadly lacking the gore <UNK> from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the sub <UNK> <UNK> is never really fully explained as seems little more than an under developed plot device br br <UNK> <UNK> has little to do with a thin script than run down a lot of <UNK> and scream every so often indeed she was like pretty much everyone else in this film out acted by a small dog and a pack of tame rats br br if creepy films set on the london underground are your bag or you just want to play <UNK> the tube <UNK> them pick this up on dvd when it hits a bargain bin if you are looking for classic horror go and dig up a copy of death line aka raw meat br br if you are looking for a quality well written and acted film you will need to change trains
<START> well in contrast to other comments previously written i have to say that the only good thing about this film is the fact that one guy in it looked a bit like jason <UNK> which reminded me of my youth i have no idea how it won any awards and although i'm sure a great deal of effort went into making it it was all <UNK> as the final outcome is one which screams of early 90's foreign soap operas the plot was non existent the cinematography was hopeless and the acting was on par with an a level performance it was unfortunately long and the sub plots were incredibly unrealistic for example if your best friend slept with your ex boyfriend of 6 years after only 2 weeks of being broken up you would not all remain the best of friends it was all fantasy that's all oh yeah and the weird 90's house soft core indie was mind numbing
<START> buster keaton was finding his feature length voice in three ages there are some fine sequences but it doesn't quite hang together the <UNK> race in three ages is hilarious included are 2 shorts one of which the goat is excellent
<START> i like the cast pretty much however the story sort of unfolds rather slowly danny glover does a good job making you wonder if he's the bad guy meanwhile the other characters are just part of the story dennis quaid didn't have as much room in the story as he could have had i thought the first scene was a bit over the top grim compared to how the story <UNK> i'd watch it again though i rated it a 5 wish i could rate it a 5 5
<START> this video contains an <UNK> way to confuse and manipulate americans about islam it's a pity that the people who did it really believe that american people is so dumb to believe in it perhaps as an american citizen every person must protest against this kind of crap if you want to know the truth about islam don't let nobody tell you the <UNK> is public you can read it by yourself and decide if what they say it's true or false br br the video uses a lot of <UNK> <UNK> directed to manipulate and associate things that are not even related the music used at some points prepare the public to hate what they see even if they don't really understand what's going on in there they use images that are misplaced from their original content br br to end the comment i would like to make a <UNK> don't you think you can do the same exact movie with every religion in the world
<START> there are so many comments on this film yet i found them to be misleading this a corner cutting over used scenario where a normal human being becomes a partner in crime to someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason boy meets girl girl holds boy up at <UNK> for something ridiculous boy is intrigued br br you know the <UNK> the antagonist turns out to be a wild free spirit instead of a <UNK> toss in a few words of wisdom from alice <UNK> and you have a recipe for love <UNK> <UNK> she crazy or does she just need a hug ' role from the breakfast club simply <UNK> as a lead character and all that is left is a truly ghastly turkey of a movie
<START> this movie leaves the intellectual mind thinking and trying to analyze the story i too cannot understand why people would trash this movie br br if you are a jerry bruckheimer fan this movie may not suitable for u br br this movie presents high degree of realism the actors and <UNK> performance is <UNK> not fake just natural br br no special sound effects so special side effects br br the camera work is excellent the music is oh so good i can't wait to get the soundtrack br br it leaves your body <UNK> like constant <UNK> the directly has raw talent certainly not a <UNK>
<START> it's been 19 years since gordon <UNK> used wall street to let us know that greed is good now michael douglas takes the <UNK> persona and <UNK> it into a secret service agent pete <UNK> guess what it works this is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing the detail work in showing the security <UNK> taken by the ss on behalf of the president and first lady was likewise intriguing all the leads were pretty good but try as i might i could not accept eva longoria as a secret service agent whereas jodie foster just made you suspend belief and really think she was fbi agent <UNK> in silence of the <UNK> you do not get the same feeling with longoria nevertheless this is a fun film <UNK> entertainment with the <UNK> as the backdrop
<START> i enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was intrigued about this female painter i had never heard of before so i set out exploring her life and work afterwards as could be expected i found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate i was a little <UNK> however by the very negative comments on the film because of this <UNK> come on guys a film isn't and shouldn't be a biography nor a novel any historical film <UNK> reality because it should be a work of art in its own right a film director is fully entitled to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own artemisia is a wonderful film and i think it brought many people including some that now give negative comments to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist
<START> this movie is very funny amitabh <UNK> and govinda are absolutely hilarious acting is good comedy is great they are up to their usual thing it would be good to see a sequel to this br br watch it good time pass movie
<START> handsome and dashing british <UNK> pilot george taylor a solid portrayal by <UNK> <UNK> gets beat up by thugs after a wild night in hong kong george meets and falls in love with the sweet and <UNK> dr <UNK> wong a fine and charming performance by the lovely <UNK> lee george <UNK> his health and goes back to work when <UNK> fails to hear from george for a lengthy amount of time she <UNK> to despair and becomes a prostitute while director co writer <UNK> <UNK> does indeed deliver a satisfying amount of the expected tasty nudity and steamy soft core sex this film is anything but your routine <UNK> in <UNK> sleaze instead it's a surprisingly thoughtful touching and tragic love story between two well drawn and highly appealing characters <UNK> as <UNK> wong is especially <UNK> and endearing the picture starts out <UNK> and cheerful but the tone <UNK> shifts into a more grim and harsh mood about two thirds of the way through <UNK> descent into vice after she <UNK> assumes that george has abandoned her is bleak and <UNK> <UNK> the remarkably sad and heartbreaking surprise <UNK> ending granted the narrative is certainly melodramatic but never too silly or trashy moreover the sex scenes are quite <UNK> and even genuinely erotic notorious italian porn star <UNK> <UNK> has a nice <UNK> supporting part as <UNK> jealous and <UNK> secretary helen miller <UNK> <UNK> polished cinematography offers many strikingly gorgeous shots of the exotic locations <UNK> <UNK> funky <UNK> score hits the <UNK> spot worth a look for those seeking something different
<START> the good thing about this film is that it stands alone you don't have to have seen the original unfortunately this is also it's biggest <UNK> it would have been nice to have included a few of the original characters in the new story and seen how their lives had developed <UNK> as in the original is excellent and provides the films best comic moments as he attempts to deal with awkward and embarrassing situations but the supporting cast is not as strong as in the original movie <UNK> is to be <UNK> on a brave attempt to move the character on and create an original sequel but the film is ultimately flawed and lacks the warmth of the original
<START> i am sick and tired of all these little <UNK> going on about how this movie <UNK> it is pure cg over acted crap don't send an assassin it's much more sensible to <UNK> hundreds of <UNK> colored aggressive <UNK> snakes on a plane the only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to it is not so bad it's good it's so bad i'd rather be <UNK> in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again i honestly thought was going to be a comedy like airplane a spoof was i wrong it's that whole it sucks get it or samuel a jackson yells snakes on the plane thing well i'm sorry i don't get it it looks like a bunch of <UNK> gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like triple x and die hard if you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought william <UNK> cd still live in their <UNK> basement and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn then rush to the theater and ask for one since i doubt you have a girlfriend ticket for snakes on a stupid butt plane to hell with movies like full metal jacket pulp fiction true romance 12 monkeys <UNK> etc there's no irony in watching good movies the true decline of the western civilization calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classics like <UNK> man or even <UNK> i've said enough here
<START> someone some day should do a study of architecture as it figures in horror films of all those <UNK> of <UNK> laid out <UNK> <UNK> for secret <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of monsters through air <UNK> and so forth <UNK> i can recall only a few films in which architecture played a major role throughout demon seed cube the remake of thirteen ghosts but it's at the heart of every story about a spooky house or church or crypt it's all about the character and the affect of spaces <UNK> and walls so i was looking forward to this thriller where it promised to be central the idea is this an architect has built actually <UNK> for himself a huge and rambling house his wife has just left him mainly because of his own self <UNK> but also it is <UNK> because she can't get used to the place since he <UNK> it living in <UNK> <UNK> real this time rather than virtual he comes to suspect that somebody else a stranger who had come to the door one evening asking to use the phone and then suddenly disappeared is living into the house with him only the place is big enough so that he never sees him br br this is a good start for a melodrama whose development one would expect to follow some such lines as these after searching the house for the intruder a few times without success the architect <UNK> to his <UNK> to <UNK> more <UNK> <UNK> trying in various ways to surprise <UNK> or <UNK> the intruder maybe by means of some special features he built into the structure meanwhile the intruder has discovered hiding places and back ways between places that the architect didn't <UNK> or doesn't remember the movie would turn into a cat and mouse game a hunt a battle and finally in trying to trap the intruder the architect himself would end up trapped in his own creation in some way he didn't expect then he would be forced to think himself out of it and maybe at the same time out of his own self <UNK> isolation and in a final twist would nail and maybe even kill the er br br nothing like this happens in this movie the house is just a house the architect is just a guy and his nemesis is of an unknown character if he exists at all here is what does happen in the movie once the intruder is <UNK> in the house if he is the architect begins hearing noises but when he goes to investigate finds nothing he calls the police they think he's slightly nuts he <UNK> his estranged wife to spend the night she thinks he's more nuts at last more or less accidentally he runs into the intruder doesn't get a good look but figures who else could it be not a hard question in a story with to that point fewer than three principal characters <UNK> he locks the doors <UNK> the <UNK> on the windows throws away the key i don't know why he thought this necessary and leaves his victim to <UNK> i missed why this was a given the doors and walls are made of steel in any event the architect takes to sleeping in his car and since the idea of the movie has <UNK> undeveloped and cannot now be developed further something else must be <UNK> to take its place and this is it the architect are you ready moves into the house of the man who presumably moved into his and lives there in the same way how is this possible it is not but the movie takes this route to try and make it seem so the architect has drawn a picture of the man who came to his door and when he leaves the house he takes the picture with him and while sitting in his car he throws the picture into the street and two kids pick it up and observe that it looks like martin their neighbor <UNK> the architect asks where his house is and the kids point the way br br if this sequence seems to verge on the implausible what ensues <UNK> right in the architect takes up <UNK> with <UNK> wheelchair ridden wife <UNK> to her so <UNK> in his moves and so cunning in his reading of his <UNK> that he's able always to leave a room just as she enters or to duck out of sight just as she turns around throughout this section the movie is clever in one way making or leaving it to the viewer to make the point that his life with this stranger who doesn't know he's there is in essence the same life he lived with his wife as a virtual <UNK> with her as a convenient <UNK> but at the same time his inability to live in the world makes his transformation into <UNK> the cat <UNK> entirely incredible not to go into the series of twists at the end including another murder achieved by <UNK> someone in behind another <UNK> door this one in front of a landing so flimsy that it <UNK> under the weight of a wheelchair two nice people who take murder in <UNK> and before the story started the <UNK> construction of a tunnel under several houses to the final long anticipated twist the movie adds another to make it even more offensive and then ends br br here is a story that depends on the development of two things the idea of the stranger in the house and the character of the man whose house it is and <UNK> both the first <UNK> makes it boring the second made me angry as it pushed its main character <UNK> and <UNK> along a more and more <UNK> path and never offered any explanation for the character who most required one martin the tunnel <UNK> and sneak tenant the story should be <UNK> by someone some day
<START> <UNK> the <UNK> is one bad and unfunny silent comedy the timing of the slapstick is completely off this is the kind of humor with certain sequences that make you wonder if they're supposed to be funny or not however the actual quality of the film is irrelevant this is mandatory viewing for film buffs mainly because its one of the earliest examples of gay cinema the main character of <UNK> is an <UNK> guy acting much like the stereotypical <UNK> common in many early films the film has the <UNK> attitude common of the time <UNK> the <UNK> is pretty awful but fascinating from a historical viewpoint 3 10
<START> i am completely shocked that this show had been cancelled <UNK> only lasted one year i just recently started watching it and i love it its a show that could of gone as far as friends went it had the humour and was extremely enjoyable br br it is about 2 brothers and 2 sisters living under one roof without their parents kurt joey lawrence plays the part of the oldest sibling and takes on the more <UNK> role br br this should of lasted much more than year as it was fantastic amazing show with all the best actors br br 10 10
<START> this movie is flawed on many <UNK> like many before it it portrays more of the mythology of the <UNK> than the history the production is poor overall giving the impression of a <UNK> project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on hollywood <UNK> this to me was the greatest flaw i know the ages and general personalities of the real <UNK> protagonists and the <UNK> ensemble of tv actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability <UNK> br br as a native <UNK> i grew up with the mythology i later learned more about the history i can accept a decent production from either perspective although i prefer more historical accuracy but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it even john wayne's or <UNK> <UNK> versions had more life than this <UNK> mess while being only slightly less accurate br br very disappointing avoid it
<START> admittedly i first picked up <UNK> 1 2 when i was around twelve i was in the library and searched desperately for something good to read then i went to the comic manga section and spotted this book at my first few reads through the chapters i didn't really know what was going on but i knew that i loved it i even took it home for a few more reads over frankly i wasn't getting anywhere and then about five months i'm 16 now ago my friend was watching some anime series and i remembered about this manga i couldn't remember what it was called but <UNK> that the author was <UNK> <UNK> creator of <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> it and then made a <UNK> decision to watch all <UNK> episodes at first i was a little thrown off by the 1990 graphics but it didn't really matter in the end no anime has ever made me laugh so hard and <UNK> watch again i once watched 45 <UNK> episodes within a day i don't know how i did it but i couldn't stop eventually after about two days i grew obsessed i even <UNK> as crazy as this sounds about watching <UNK> never have i found a series so enjoyable so funny and so heartwarming to watch to this day <UNK> episodes are not enough to keep me satisfied of course the cliffhanger ending was enough to make me go <UNK> but the series alone was enough to make me continue reading br br <UNK> 1 2 is about a boy named <UNK> <UNK> and his dad <UNK> <UNK> intense martial artists they are so intense that they went to the ancient training grounds in china and became <UNK> the grounds were full of different <UNK> of springs and if you land in one you take the shape of whatever drowned there when <UNK> in cold water for <UNK> that was a <UNK> and for <UNK> that was a girl it's a very <UNK> fun loving story on top of that <UNK> promises his friend that <UNK> will marry one of his daughters to keep the <UNK> <UNK> alive <UNK> the one he gets matched up with hates his guts and the feelings mutual obviously they start to like one another but both way to stubborn to admit it but <UNK> has a history of doing this he promised <UNK> to many girls br br trust me it's worth watching it's humorous heartwarming and all around amazing
<START> i saw this jolly little film at age 10 11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on cbs i didn't know it had been in a theater at all to rate it from a kids point of view i'd give it 4 out of 5 stars because being a young boy at the time it seemed a little <UNK> br br the climactic scene where <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the time but you <UNK> that sort of thing br br when i re discovered it a blockbuster video in 1995 i had to <UNK> it i still liked it despite the fact that it looked a bit old i don't know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it wasn't on vhs br br it's out there might even be on dvd by now at least i hope it is i want to share it with my kids someday 10 stars on here it's still a great kids film end br br <UNK> <UNK> 2009 finally found a vhs copy woo <UNK>
<START> in brave new girl holly comes from a small town in texas sings the yellow rose of texas at a local competition and gets admitted to a <UNK> arts college in philadelphia from there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty i loved this movie it was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at a very nice pace the acting was of course wonderful virginia madsen and lindsey <UNK> were outstanding as well as nick roth the camera work was really done well and i was very pleased with the end it seems a sequel could be in the making kudos to the director and all others that <UNK> on this production quite a gem in the film <UNK>
<START> <UNK> was an immensely popular sixties show that has <UNK> the years and generations to the point it is still as popular now with both adults and children alike as it was in its <UNK> so one would <UNK> the chance to produce a live action feature film with a million pound hollywood budget was an excellent opportunity to revive the series as has been done with <UNK> man' and 'the x <UNK> but a terrible storyline and bland acting <UNK> this opportunity and it was soon apparent all that was destined for this film was a trip to the bargain bin of the <UNK> section br br instead of a film focusing on the five <UNK> sons their father and <UNK> geek brain <UNK> to rescue people and protect the world from villains our hero in this <UNK> is a <UNK> and <UNK> thirteen year old alan <UNK> <UNK> year old tin tin and ten year old brain box <UNK> son of brains yes <UNK> son despite this being a man who could surely never score a woman if he tried maybe he grew the kid in a <UNK> dish as one can tell from a run through of our three lead characters this 2004 remake <UNK> was clearly aimed at entertaining only children under twelve instead of trying to appeal to a broad age range as those involved in the much superior revival of <UNK> man' did the plot itself was so bland with clunky awkward dialogue and weak jokes that probably wouldn't <UNK> <UNK> pre teens the scriptwriter seemed more interested in ripping off <UNK> kids' which was at least quirky and original instead of <UNK> the show people know and love br br although sophia <UNK> and ron cook were excellent as miss penelope and parker they only had about three lines between them so their presence was barely felt bill <UNK> jeff <UNK> was just boring and there was only the slightest of mention of the other four <UNK> boys while anthony <UNK> and ben kingsley as brains and the hood respectively were just embarrassing the hood in particular is not at all threatening or sinister and instead comes across as a campy two bit stereotypical villain as limp as a piece of rotting <UNK> br br brady <UNK> who plays alan <UNK> may well be a good young actor but it was hard to see that in a film where he plays a <UNK> brat who just <UNK> and the same goes for vanessa anne <UNK> as tin tin since the most she gets to do is look pretty and be all for <UNK> <UNK> ironically it is young <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is the only interesting character of the film as <UNK> delivers a natural and relaxed performance br br <UNK> the series will be forever remembered as an excellent show that proves puppets can give solid performances <UNK> the film will be forgotten by most and remembered by a few as one big flop
<START> as myself and my other half are big fans of trash horror we couldn't resist getting out a movie that contained both of the <UNK> we were thrilled however for a 2004 movie with a rip off cover of freddy vs jason this is a disgrace the worst film i have ever seen but worth a look for a laugh if you are able to sit through it br br the acting is awful the effects well i could do better on my camcorder in fact its so bad they only bothered to put make up on the zombies faces and left out neck hands etc no story line weird flashbacks that make no sense and terrible script br br you broke my tooth from one vampire you broke my <UNK> was the response from the human who looked like uncle jessie from dukes crossed with santa
<START> <UNK> da <UNK> is one of the best <UNK> opera soap ever the a black <UNK> story that becomes queen of a small villa when <UNK> the most powerful man's of the area love in the colonial period of the brazil dominated by <UNK> that explored its <UNK> the largest <UNK> enemy <UNK> bride that it was changed by <UNK> is a woman of big it influences the <UNK> king close to and does to take revenge of the slave of everything very religious person she is a picture of the <UNK> society and religious of the time she <UNK> its life the morality of the villa that was committed by <UNK> that is a woman full of <UNK> that it faces the society of the time to <UNK> and it helps the slaves of the area the story also bill with forbidden loves <UNK> and vampires and religious <UNK> <UNK> da <UNK> does with that you don't want to lose a i only surrender from beginning to end
<START> in the movie several references are made in subtly to blade runner but one of the most obvious is the fact the cain <UNK> and his unit are all genetic <UNK> breed to be <UNK> warriors but as favorite quote of mine from the movie is you should have made them smart as well as fast kurt russell did a incredible job his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of relating the story then the rest of the cast combined even when he falls in love with sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions and his tears after being <UNK> from the group or his <UNK> when he is given a hug and his <UNK> to the mute young boy who in many ways reminded todd of himself and what he could have been if not for his selection to be a soldier
<START> this picks up about a year after the events in basic instinct catherine <UNK> sharon stone is now in london while having sex with a soccer player while <UNK> about in a car going at <UNK> miles hour don't ask she goes off the road and ends up in the <UNK> she survives he doesn't the police hire psychiatrist michael glass david <UNK> to see if she's mentally competent to stand trial naturally she starts playing with his mind instead and plenty of murders and sex follow br br this movie was doomed before it even opened it took forever to get a cast and director script problems were constant and the cast was not happy <UNK> complained about the movie often still it's not too bad it's a lot like the first there's a lush music score beautiful locations plenty of sex and nudity this had to be edited for an r a nicely convoluted plot and good acting but there's no impact it feels like a <UNK> of the first people are being killed here with a <UNK> <UNK> i believe just like people were being killed by an ice pick in the first in one cute moment stone picks up an ice pick and looks at it <UNK> she's also playing mind games with a man and might be getting him <UNK> in murders the similarities are too apparent br br this is also very r rated there's plenty of explicit sex talk male nudity <UNK> looks a lot better nude than michael douglas female nudity stone still looks great and some bloody murders the acting is good across the board stone is just fantastic here <UNK> looks miserable but is ok charlotte <UNK> and david <UNK> are good in supporting roles br br so this isn't at all bad but feels like a remake of the first still i recommend it people just attacked this because stone is not well liked and they thought it was stupid to do a sequel to basic 14 years after it was made
<START> dear me where do i start the dad isn't anywhere near old enough to be the girl's dad he corpses on camera in the first 5 minutes of the film the <UNK> <UNK> in this film is jesus christ zombies are <UNK> stupid and few and far between motives are utterly incomprehensible and a narrative does not exist people <UNK> to their destination in <UNK> driven at 3 <UNK> the world seems to be carrying on as normal yet these are supposed to be the end days breasts appear for the sake of breasts normally such an approach would provide some redemption but the rest of the film actually made me <UNK> in breasts or the future of humanity there's a dog for no reason and thin orange blood that turns the stomach the general and his <UNK> of shut the f k up is the only redeeming feature as for the rest i sincerely hope to hear that they had done the decent thing and killed themselves

<START> i wanted to give drawing blood the benefit of the initial doubt the opening moments with a naked woman <UNK> out and an painter diana about to paint her and then sucking her blood to drain out so she can use it for her art give the impression that this could be a kick ass artsy vampire flick turns out this initial impression turns out false oh troma the mark of some kind of lack of quality sometimes they'll offer up something that is trash but funny and with at least some <UNK> to the junk food craft or sometimes not this is a case where it's not even a whole lot of fun to watch since its attempts at humor i e the <UNK> father is an old <UNK> who does jimmy <UNK> impressions are weak at best and any unintentional laughs are <UNK> by sergio <UNK> bargain basement direction br br and it's not without him trying oh lord no he does try a lot which is a big part of the problem he and his producers had money for lights sure but the way they're used in the movie made i a former student filmmaker and aspiring director <UNK> in my seat if i saw this in a theater i would have to blind my eyes in many instances and would wonder whether or not his <UNK> understood really the basic 3 point lighting set up while this along with a very lackluster sound design or just lots of random loud <UNK> like in the art gallery scene shouldn't be something that comes to attention during a troma release it should be something basic that a filmmaker can tackle even if the script isn't very funny or scary and it isn't or if <UNK> does a weird mixture of songs placed at bizarre moments br br it's not a good movie by any stretch and perhaps if you're a vampire die hard or just a vampire period it might have some appeal as a low rent bargain basement alternative to near dark or as a slight improvement over say <UNK> blood freak you have better ways to waste your time overall
<START> i had to give this film a 1 because it's that bad but don't make this think that i didn't enjoy watching because i laughed and laughed and i even had a few questions so half of the time i was laughing half of the time i was saying what in the hell is going on or why would someone do this et <UNK> i mostly enjoyed the terrible fog effects the 80's style nude scene battle dialogue nude scene and the way that the <UNK> swords <UNK> in the wind when they ride their horses and there's some crappy model effects those aren't supposed to be real trees are they and i still don't understand this guy that they find in the cave what in the hell is he a friend of mine told me about these movies and i thought i would give em a try and i basically liked the film as people like ed wood films i have no real enjoyment of what the film was meant to be i look at it in my own hilarious way so don't let this distract you if you really thought this was an action movie it is i just liked it for other reasons it's much much worse than evil dead so it can actually make you think as though you are wasting your life by watching it which came into my mind a few times i guess the best thing for most people would be to have a few drinks have some friends around and laugh at this film maybe this is a bit harsh but i don't think so rent it and you'll see <UNK>
<START> i only saw this movie once and that was enough for me the movie has very little if any plot and seems to be nothing but continuous scenes of psycho sadistic violence and very little of anything else i wanted to see this movie because it starred <UNK> <UNK> of the second night of the demons and i wanted to see her playing someone normal unfortunately the tobe hooper script barely begins and goes nowhere as robert englund <UNK> the film and <UNK> up the scenery and plot <UNK> i know where you are now hiding from this film
<START> i think i should start this in saying that nearly any style of work can be entertaining in parts the true test is whether it is good from start to finish which is the reason i gave the <UNK> title for this review most of us would agree even those like me who enjoy reading many <UNK> that <UNK> can't compare with good novel writing for a number of reasons likewise <UNK> can't compare with good film making for a number of reasons and i actually believe it's a poor example of independent filmography from start to finish <UNK> feels like a <UNK> together <UNK> heck even <UNK> gets some <UNK> if i wanted to see an hour of <UNK> i don't i'd go watch it <UNK> while certainly <UNK> than the bubble <UNK> atmosphere of the aforementioned media is so personal that it is without an interesting story it's like watching the <UNK> of life which i think most would agree is very naturally boring and yet the creators of <UNK> want us to applaud it their very <UNK> film about making a film cue my yawn br br ultimately i come away not caring the least bit about any of it i'm shocked that i'm actually interested in taking time out to write this review even it's not that <UNK> is downright bad because it isn't it has a few moments where i crack a smile or think that maybe just maybe something of interest is about to happen it's rather that it's just downright mediocre i feel so indifferent about it that it's almost fitting of an <UNK> passionate indifference br br i hope the creators actors in the film get out of debt from their efforts they'll probably need it for when one of them moves out and moves on with life br br see this movie if you've got time to waste and nothing much you want to do otherwise pass it by and don't worry that you've missed some great <UNK> talent you really haven't
<START> welcome to <UNK> where the dead come out to play and even the boys in da hood can't stop them this low budget direct to video production seems timed to <UNK> with the release of land of the dead the latest installment of george a romero's famed zombie series the ghetto setting and hip hop soundtrack may provide additional appeal for inner city gore <UNK> ricky carl washington works at a medical research facility while raising his kid brother <UNK> brandon daniels but the teenager bored by <UNK> and cheese <UNK> in their <UNK> house would rather spend his time hanging with street friends <UNK> and <UNK> apparently there is not a lot for african american high school <UNK> to do on this side of the bay except deal drugs and <UNK> with the <UNK> including rival latino gang <UNK> ricky plans to sell their late parents' house and move <UNK> to the castro valley a more middle class and presumably <UNK> environment unfortunately before this can happen a drive by shooting leaves <UNK> dead on the <UNK> grief stricken ricky tries a last desperate <UNK> he tells <UNK> his lab assistant to steal some of the experimental cell <UNK> formula they have been testing on rats when a double dose fails to revive <UNK> there is no choice except to call <UNK> but a funny thing happens on the way to the <UNK> the boy is <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> zombie <UNK> the <UNK> drivers and <UNK> off into the night bent on revenge and hungry for fresh meat the feeding frenzy <UNK> more victims and before the night is over the east bay is a <UNK> between the living and the blood <UNK> undead the horror genre has seen more than its share of cheap movie makers from ed wood to <UNK> gordon lewis to charles band but low budgets do not necessarily mean bad films consider val <UNK> <UNK> cat people the <UNK> man <UNK> of the dead roger <UNK> poe <UNK> romero's night of the living dead and john carpenter's halloween the difference between memorable and awful has more to do with talent and ambition than money hood of the living dead is more fun than several hundred million <UNK> worth of recent high <UNK> horrors <UNK> has its charms in truly cheap films actors wear their own clothes amid real settings here the <UNK> houses have <UNK> painted walls in neutral <UNK> tones <UNK> a <UNK> as oppressive as douglas <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> lines seem more improvised than scripted so what the hell are we gonna do now just keep your eyes open for any f <UNK> thing that looks out of the ordinary ricky and <UNK> call their boss who calls an ex military man named romero i have a huge bitch of a problem that we have to take care of fast not a problem says the <UNK> closing his phone and grabbing his guns everybody has guns and even when fighting zombies they're on their cell phones as who isn't nowadays information is <UNK> with <UNK> understatement what happened we got into it with some crazy <UNK> <UNK> f <UNK> <UNK> it's that park zombie again ricky even has to blow his <UNK> girlfriend away saying only she's gotten out of hand unlike most zombie movies this one provides a motive for mayhem <UNK> takes revenge on the gang <UNK> who shot him who in turn continue the <UNK> this is urban film making that implies its own social commentary a near <UNK> production suggesting a future for low budget horror that reflects real life instead of supernatural clichés the brothers <UNK> who have <UNK> their name as if in anticipation of a new movement may inspire others to tell stories <UNK> from personal experience rather than imitating tired hollywood product considering their limited resources jose and <UNK> <UNK> have made a cheap but technically acceptable feature about people they know photographer rocky robinson gets the job done music by <UNK> <UNK> is no simpler than carpenter's haunting halloween theme and hip hop songs by the <UNK> <UNK> and others add atmosphere the result is promising if not exactly <UNK> they are learning their craft and unlike lewis and wood who never got any better their next may be one to watch

<START> cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some flaws from director <UNK> <UNK> whose admirable in making this movie about an expert <UNK> who finds himself taken hostage with a fellow friend by a gang of dangerous criminals on the search for suit cases full of stolen cash in the rocky mountains <UNK> stallone is impressive as <UNK> walker the expert <UNK> especially in the action fight sequences but some of them definitely border on the line of unrealistic for the sake of the film though i willing to suspend my disbelief the rest of the cast including john <UNK> michael <UNK> <UNK> turner rex <UNK> caroline <UNK> and leon are respectable as the supporting characters in the movie the action fight sequences are well executed but as mentioned before some aren't very realistic no matter how tough you are the climbing sequences however are very well done because instead of doing the whole film in a studio somewhere the locations they chose felt very real and the ariel views of the mountain <UNK> are marvelous adding a touch of reality to the movie the deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable the villains are solid but it would've been better if they had focused on a more central one instead of having many of them the pacing of the movie was a little slow but the good <UNK> the bad in this one if you're a big fan of <UNK> or <UNK> than chances are you'll enjoy this one too overall cliffhanger has character development with enough action drama some suspense excitement thrills and good performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch
<START> maybe <UNK> <UNK> is not the best movie ever made but it is better than many of you have said i still haven't seen a <UNK> themed movie better than this one br br you americans are <UNK> to watch very narrative movies with a clear beginning development and outcome but european movies are less narrative but makes you think much and feel br br many of you didn't understand the sense of the movie the purpose of this one is not show us a simple summer loving movie with commercial characters who fall in love and live happy forever summer holidays and beach are only a background and this movie is directed to every young boy who may feel identified with those boys br br maybe some of you didn't understand well this movie because of its 3 parts showed as flashbacks these 3 moments are <UNK> in <UNK> when they meet and love after a year and half living together in <UNK> mathieu doesn't go to a psychiatric himself he tries to suicide taking something and cedric brings him to hospital later he appears talking with a psychiatrist to find the reason about he done that the last part is when mathieu come back to <UNK> in winter alone to think about how his life have changed how his life become to be and trying to find himself br br it's possible that some people couldn't understand all this well because all the scenes are mixed among them but anyway as i said before this is not a funny movie if what someone want to see is meat for that we have <UNK> movies br br <UNK> <UNK> what want to show us is how cruel can be the life for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life mathieu only wants to go away from home and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him the happiness but what seemed perfect at the beginning later is not as good as he thought and he become troubled and feel that he has lost the way of his life he is lost and doesn't know what he really wants to do or what makes him happy he finally become depressed and tries to commit suicide br br so funny is not a funny movie very hot scenes only a few but this is not a movie for entertainment is all about feelings friendship love happiness <UNK> pain depression loneliness i as many others feel identified with life and problems of mathieu and that is what director wanted to do a movie who show us the cruel reality of a boy's life br br for me the best <UNK> themed movie ever
<START> i <UNK> to think what people must have thought of <UNK> after viewing this piece of overbearing preachy cinematic trash <UNK> with enough indian wannabe <UNK> and space brother <UNK> to stock a new age shop <UNK> makes anyone who gives a damn about the planet look like a <UNK> wearing crystal <UNK> idiot br br the plot alien <UNK> dawn chong arrives to guide a <UNK> playing underwear model in a mystical quest to <UNK> <UNK> impending <UNK> collapse but first they must defeat an evil alien who looks nothing so much like a <UNK> from a castro street bar fortunately they've got mystical grandpa willie nelson along to help who looks <UNK> embarrassed by the proceedings as well he ought to be along with <UNK> of cheap f x and <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> music br br sure the clunky script helps to obscure the film's trite plot and <UNK> pace but that's just the tip of this melting movie iceberg everyone concerned with this film should have their union cards <UNK> until they complete a real course in <UNK> science
<START> i was looking forward to this ride and was horribly disappointed br br and i am very easily amused at roller coaster and amusement park rides br br the roller coaster part was just okay and that was all of about 30 seconds of a 90 second ride br br it was visually dull and poorly executed br br it was trying desperately to be like a mixture of the far superior indiana jones and space mountain rides and <UNK> and failed in every aspect br br it was not thrilling or exciting in the least
<START> this movie could have been 15 minutes long if it weren't for all the <UNK> between son and father very predictable both male stars need a good slap in the face would you like some cheese with that <UNK> two chuckles and a headache i can understand why the mother left her <UNK> after <UNK> years i don't know how she lasted that long the first 5 minutes made me want to turn the movie off wishing i had never paid the 3 99 to watch it the movie didn't flow well and was painfully long i kept watching my watch hoping time would fly faster it didn't the script had so much <UNK> that it had to be easy for the writer to fill space on a positive note the scenery was pretty fall being my favorite season the car the 40 ford was also quite nice this movie gets an d rating approaching an f
<START> this is a pretty bad movie but not so bad as it's reputation suggests the production values aren't too bad and there is the odd effective scene and it does have an 80's <UNK> <UNK> that means that it is always kind of fun watch out too for jimmy <UNK> brief appearance his attempt at an american accent is so <UNK> rubbish it's fantastic fantastic too are <UNK> <UNK> breasts they make a brief appearance in the movie but the scene is repeated <UNK> times in the end credits in what can only be described as the 12 <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> boobs has to be seen to be believed as a horror movie it isn't scary the effects are silly and christopher lee turns up to <UNK> through his performance i guess he was buying a new house and needed some cash for the <UNK> the two central characters the man and the woman were so <UNK> that i have forgotten almost everything about them and i just watched this movie earlier tonight the werewolves are <UNK> less impressive than in the original movie in fact <UNK> they sometimes look more like badly burned apes the eastern european setting is quite good and the music provided by the new wave band <UNK> while being pretty terrible does at least give the film some added cheese br br overall good for a laugh not good quality but did you seriously expect it to be and at the very least you've always got <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the show is really funny nice theme jokes and one liners are really good with little extra <UNK> it can become a very popular show but the only major negative point of this show is the cast david spade does a great job as russell <UNK> price does a good job but who the hell did cast patrick <UNK> oliver hudson and <UNK> <UNK> br br technically russell and jeff are the main characters of the show which make viewers wanna watch the show russell is a playboy and jeff is a kind of frustrated family man the relationship <UNK> with an experience of all the problems a married couple face in a relationship br br patrick <UNK> does a horrible job as jeff he is not at all suited for the role he is like a robot literally there is no punch in his dialog delivery br br cast is really very important for viewers to like it the bad acting certainly will take the show downhill
<START> this is the kind of movie the us doesn't make it's why people rent foreign films it's a great story about how one person even if he is retarded can make a person find reason in an empty life everybody can learn from georges it also shows how people that are mentally challenged suffer in their life and shows them in a very realistic way i think as its classic in foreign films this movie has a bittersweet ending but that only makes it a better movie
<START> this is one of my all time favorites br br if the movie has a flaw it's that it comes at you like a raging bull it doesn't so much engage the viewer as assault him <UNK> is as <UNK> and <UNK> a production as tony montana himself nothing is left to the viewer's imagination br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fits the action to a <UNK> like the chorus in a greek tragedy it <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> a constant reminder of tony's <UNK> fate br br not so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress <UNK> rips across the screen with the <UNK> force of a runaway train
<START> i've had to change my view on the worst film in the world having just seen this one this is it br br make no mistake this film is awful br br here's a list of reasons br br hopeless storyline despite being based on a true story dreadful acting what was judge <UNK> thinking <UNK> bad stunts childish dialogue non existent continuity lack of atmosphere br br get the picture br br
<START> we <UNK> down br br aspect ratio 1 33 1 br br sound format silent br br black and white short film br br stan <UNK> ollie get mixed up with a couple of <UNK> kay <UNK> and vera white after setting out to visit a theatre which burns down in their absence needless to say their <UNK> wives <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> flowers are not amused br br leo <UNK> ok comedy laid the narrative <UNK> for william <UNK> masterpiece sons of the desert 1934 with l h playing brow beaten victims of <UNK> forced to tell a monstrous lie which <UNK> in spectacular fashion much of it is very funny especially the scene in which stan is <UNK> by <UNK> leading to a violent game of push and <UNK> however some of the fun is <UNK> by <UNK> and flowers playing their roles completely straight which adds an element of <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> scenario originally released in the uk as we slip up
<START> this film is one of those nostalgia things with me and i never really expect anyone else to get it but am pleased when i recommend it and somebody does enjoy it my late father hated arthur <UNK> but this film was one he really enjoyed and his consistent enthusiasm for the ghost train and old ted <UNK> transferred to me as a child years later i watch it every now and again enjoying the <UNK> i always wonder if it will not be quite the same but i am never disappointed in it there is much to enjoy the sequence on the train is truly inspired when <UNK> and <UNK> proceed to annoy the arrogant male passenger then the whole section in the station is amazing with so much going on you have to keep up yes it is dated and full of wartime <UNK> in accents and plot based on the original play by arnold <UNK> of <UNK> army fame but full of wonderful character performances including kathleen harrison as a <UNK> <UNK> the atmosphere is truly as near sinister as an arthur <UNK> vehicle could get this is available cheap as <UNK> in the uk on dvd so treat yourself it is a perfect saturday sunday morning or any day lazy afternoon lightweight piece of entertainment i thank you br br old movies can be good movies
<START> worst bob hope comedy ever and that includes some heavy competition hope on an island with sailors dreams <UNK> of being in a <UNK> with a geisha girl <UNK> his ship somebody certainly <UNK> this hope <UNK> over the cliff as it features <UNK> <UNK> and gina <UNK> and still can't work up any laughs or excitement where's bing crosby when you really need him
<START> the fact that this movie has been entitled to the most successful movie in <UNK> film history makes me shake my head it's true but pitiful at the same time a flick about the swiss army could be a good deal better br br the story sounds interesting at the beginning antonio <UNK> michael <UNK> gets forced to <UNK> his military training by the army while he is in the church wedding his love laura <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the acting in some way doesn't really <UNK> from just a few <UNK> getting drunk and stoned in the reality <UNK> <UNK> plays her role as the strong michelle <UNK> mediocre personally i found her rather annoying br br the storyline contains a comedy combined with a romance which does not work as expected the romance part is too trashy and the comedy part is not funny at all it's just a cheap try and does not change throughout the whole movie whatsoever it's funny for <UNK> 12 13 year olds but not for such as those who search an entertaining comedy the humor is weak except for some shots br br <UNK> cool stealing cool if you want a proper comedy about the swiss <UNK> make sure you did not <UNK> your military training yet and even then don't expect too much br br i'll give it 4 out of 10 stars because <UNK> <UNK> is quite funny during his screen time not a hell of a lot screen time though
<START> tv pilots don't you love them quinn martin tried this one out after being successful in a bunch of other tv detective movies but this one goes nowhere except in the realm of <UNK> where it belongs roy <UNK> is diamond head who takes orders from aunt mary to find super spy <UNK> i mean tree <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are there for ethnic comic relief and not much else tree sucks as a bad guy despite all his <UNK> that makes him look exactly the same as he normally does there's more unnatural clothing <UNK> here than you can ever imagine required in the 1970's and the show itself is so anti climatic why did it not go to series you figure it out it's quite blatant again it's fun for <UNK> but not a lot else
<START> i don't know maybe it's just because it's an impressive tribute to some muslim religious action <UNK> but i just felt the movie is so underrated i just can't believe that the movie has just been voted by only <UNK> people so far given that the movie was produced in 2004 and it has won many awards since then about the movie it's one of those well acted sweet movies <UNK> a french teenager due to sit for <UNK> is asked by his <UNK> elderly father to take him to <UNK> strange as it may seem if one doesn't know much about islam the father wants his son to drive them from their home in france to <UNK> <UNK> on a once in a lifetime religious <UNK> the generation gap between the father and the son is based on simple enough terms <UNK> may know how to read and write but you know nothing about life ' the <UNK> father to his son but some sort of <UNK> generation gap literature is avoided <UNK> of them are <UNK> in their <UNK> the father never speaks in french though <UNK> understands <UNK> but can only seem to answer in french though they encounter many people on the road there's the scary old woman they pick up in the <UNK> border on the way to <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who helps them out at the border of turkey the <UNK> and shy women wearing <UNK> on the way to <UNK> the focus is always on the <UNK> father and son there is not much of a conversation in the movie which makes it enjoyable to your eyes you see magnificent views in every city they go the director shows you even the blue <UNK> and the <UNK> sophia even though the movie is not relatively long br br generally i don't like movies which don't have enough dialogs and which take their power from camera subtleties but this one was really great despite some unanswered details like <UNK> unseen french girlfriend the movie appeals to senses great work of art and remember this movie is <UNK> <UNK> debut
<START> this is one of the most god awful movies ever <UNK> better just stick to basketball this movie took away apart of my life i will never have back i will make fun of this movie until i die and then some it is so horrible it is not even funny <UNK> would have a blast with this one
<START> dark rising is your typical bad obviously quickly produced horror sci fi fantasy movie it has a strange unexplained plot with holes so big you could fit an elephant through them most of the time i didn't know what the hell was going on but it didn't really matter it was a simple demon hunter returns from hell dimension to save <UNK> story with confusing stuff added on about witches and a book of evil with plot elements and characters who make no sense or disappear totally for no reason the acting is bad but there honestly is not much they can do with this script i am guessing there is a couple topless scenes which is probably the only reason this bad movie got made like so many other bad movies give this one a pass unless there is nothing else on t v
<START> the sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed tv series ever so naturally my expectations were through the roof and yet the show <UNK> them i love the mafia and crime genre in film and i enjoy following the compelling stories set in these worlds but this is so much more <UNK> hours of material gives the story a chance to not only be one of the most thrilling and unpredictable mafia action stories but also to be a great family drama a shocking character study a laugh out loud comedy a brilliant psychological examination dealing with the nature of good and evil and an intellectual arty collaboration of representative dreams and hallucinations all in one david <UNK> epic series manages to accomplish all of this and more and <UNK> hbo as the closest tv can get to cinematic perfection <UNK> the road for a number of other series to continue blowing audiences away br br realism is present when it is needed but <UNK> decisions to <UNK> from it for effect on occasion for dream episodes and the like only adds more layers to the series chase along with a strong writing staff including matthew <UNK> and <UNK> winter future creators of mad men and <UNK> empire respectively turns new jersey into an intricate universe full of the greatest cast of characters i've seen on tv br br james gandolfini <UNK> the show as tony one of the most groundbreaking characters on tv ever tony <UNK> to half of the mobster stereotypes from pop culture but he defies the other half entirely and through his family interactions and his therapy sessions with dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with whom he has a considerable chemistry that <UNK> that the therapy scenes always have a completely different feel to the rest of the show we see nearly every side to tony soprano and learn that he is more of an <UNK> than one would expect br br edie <UNK> matches the power of <UNK> performance as tony's wife <UNK> from her mixed feelings about tony's lifestyle to her <UNK> about murders to her torment over tony's cheating to her own thoughts about infidelity <UNK> runs the gamut of emotions throughout 6 seasons and <UNK> makes her the prime vehicle for the non mafia viewers to have eyes into such a corrupt world scenes between tony and <UNK> provide some of the most <UNK> and painfully realistic drama ever seen on television br br the supporting cast is almost as phenomenal and a wide array of characters <UNK> the cast over all six seasons somehow without any <UNK> nancy <UNK> steals the show as tony's overbearing mother <UNK> an insight into tony's personality problems and panic attacks the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> complaints is almost gruesome since she takes the character so <UNK> far michael <UNK> is christopher tony's <UNK> whose various poor choices lead him down a road that is painful to watch but brilliantly executed <UNK> de <UNK> plays <UNK> girlfriend <UNK> and is so well meaning and loving that the dark arc her character takes as she gets too involved with <UNK> career tony <UNK> is paulie introduced as the ultimate mafia stereotype and a source of comic but eventually he becomes one of the most sympathetic and complex characters on the show and nobody plays true anger better than he and that's just the tip of the iceberg br br familiar faces such as peter bogdanovich jon <UNK> ben kingsley lauren bacall will <UNK> nancy sinatra david <UNK> robert patrick hal <UNK> burt young and eric <UNK> make appearances over the course of the show while names as notable as joe <UNK> steve <UNK> and steven van <UNK> have regular roles as main characters in the series there are 50 great characters with powerful <UNK> and the excitement and tension never let up in any of the various subplots throughout the show br br comedic elements and entire episodes filled with brilliant hilarity <UNK> the <UNK> dramatic intensity of the series which is so <UNK> that for one reason or enough the credits of nearly any episode left me somewhat <UNK> the sopranos is the most powerful and <UNK> series i have seen overall and its <UNK> are so <UNK> that i would have to call it my favourite show in spite of <UNK> <UNK> most of which i disagree with br br whether you love or hate the ending or what you make of it is irrelevant the discussion it has created is an achievement in itself the iconic nature of the entire series makes it an essential part of television history there are multiple elements for anyone to love and marvel at in this show so if you're thinking of watching something else instead do yourself a favour and <UNK>
<START> originally conceived as a solo vehicle for dudley moore <UNK> only but <UNK> saw his ex <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> peter cook guest on the first show and so well received was it the <UNK> of b b c 2 insisted that he be on it every week from then on they were a classic comedy team cook was tall handsome and witty while dudley was short charismatic and <UNK> gifted the sketch that brought the house down had them in a pub wearing flat <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> about movie stars such as jane russell and greta garbo it remains one of the most hilarious skits of all time and even when cook corpses it still holds together well br br those characters idiot pete and even bigger idiot dud found their way into every episode of the show proper seen in a different setting such as a <UNK> or an art gallery in the latter they <UNK> <UNK> while discussing works of art that <UNK> <UNK> cartoon i don't see the joke says dud pete points out that when it was first <UNK> it probably had people in fits dud nearly <UNK> on his <UNK> you really are enjoying those <UNK> ad <UNK> cook the pair <UNK> their humour off each other in a way that was <UNK> to behold the sketches themselves set new standards for comedy standards that would not be matched until the arrival of <UNK> <UNK> br br as the show's popularity <UNK> so did the quality of the guest stars peter sellers for instance and john lennon the latter presenting a filmed item based on his poem <UNK> ted <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> leg too <UNK> had dud as <UNK> <UNK> a name later re used in the film <UNK> a one <UNK> man who <UNK> into the office of film producer cook to audition for the role of <UNK> cook tries to let him down as best as he can i've nothing against your right leg he says the trouble is neither have you br br dud would on occasion interview the eccentric sir arthur <UNK> <UNK> cook who when he was not teaching <UNK> to fly underwater was planning on opening a restaurant called 'the frog the <UNK> another classic was 'the <UNK> <UNK> also <UNK> in <UNK> but my all time favourite has to be <UNK> a <UNK> funny and accurate parody of <UNK> and sylvia <UNK> <UNK> pete and dud played all the roles with the latter making a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> had <UNK> van <UNK> as the star of a <UNK> is tom jones' style variety show 'the immortal <UNK> was a spoof documentary on the life of <UNK> movie star <UNK> <UNK> in an unforgettable moment she drove through london <UNK> through a <UNK> i want to be alone br br a season 3 feature was <UNK> <UNK> with the likes of <UNK> barker spike <UNK> barry <UNK> willie <UNK> and others suspended over a <UNK> tank they each had to <UNK> the line of a poem and anyone failing to make it rhyme wound up in the nasty stuff br br three seasons were made in all produced at different times by joe <UNK> dick <UNK> and jimmy gilbert sadly very few <UNK> survive to make matters worse the scripts were destroyed as well it <UNK> belief that this situation was allowed to happen br br the show ended in 1970 the comics then hit broadway made the infamous <UNK> <UNK> tapes but <UNK> ever increasing alcoholism broke them apart eight years later cook announced that a new series was in the <UNK> but it turned out to be <UNK> thinking on his part his ex partner was making films in america and had no intention of working with cook again not at that time anyway br br enough footage was <UNK> together for a season of b b c 2 repeats in the early <UNK> as expected some items had not held up as well as others cook died in 1995 and by way of a tribute the b b c put together a programme <UNK> from various <UNK> interviews and <UNK> only but <UNK> shows it ended rather appropriately with pete and dud finding themselves in heaven bloody hell <UNK> the latter moore passed on in 2002
<START> i watched this film last night with anticipation but really wasn't very impressed br br with the exception of <UNK> i thought the acting was poor and the narrative was limited it came across like a <UNK> for <UNK> drama br br i felt that the film was very contrived the whole set up of <UNK> in the context at the start yes we get that this is 80s britain you can stop now was tiresome and gave a very one sided view of what life was like in 80s britain poverty war <UNK> with <UNK> margaret <UNK> yet nothing in between there were actually middle classes who existed back then just ordinary working people with a decent <UNK> and a <UNK> the <UNK> clips also seemed to be added randomly towards the end for <UNK> <UNK> i presume br br the sequence of events felt a tad disjointed as the characters moved one one action to the next without us seeing how their mindset could've changed so quickly br br the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> was toe <UNK> i couldn't even look during the <UNK> scene i find it very hard to believe that she would've been attracted to a boy who was not only so much younger but also looked so much younger i know there were only four years between them but four years is nothing once you reach your <UNK> yet it's a huge difference in your teens in my experience that kind of teen age difference only occurs when the girl is the younger one since girls mature so much <UNK> and are more on the <UNK> of boys a few years older sorry but i didn't buy it an unnecessary plot point created for shock value br br the ending was somewhat abrupt and again contrived if the flag throwing incident was supposed to be iconic then it fell somewhat short in my eyes br br it bugs me that british films only concern themselves with either the upper classes or the poverty stricken don't get me wrong i love <UNK> and four <UNK> has its charms but can't we brits come up with anything different why are our films always so hung up on the class system i was born in 1973 so wasn't much different in age to <UNK> would've been in 1983 i grew up in a single parent family on a fairly down <UNK> <UNK> estate in a city in england however my childhood experiences were vastly different to those portrayed in the film i don't even remember racism being an issue although i'm not saying it didn't exist <UNK> is <UNK> not in my experience br br the bottom line is that i felt this film lacked substance and i was completely bored and <UNK> throughout
<START> rachel jo hannah tina <UNK> and john are all on top form here they deserve oscar nominations for their performances i am a great fan of the tv show <UNK> their music rocks and they're all so talented i am also a great <UNK> of sarcasm br br if you're an s club fan do not read this br br the performances are terribly weak the dialogue is terrible and the jokes are not even executed properly i feel sorry for the director the jokes are so unbelievably bad that 8 little passionate s club fans weren't laughing they thought they could do it better and they did they <UNK> the world they became s club <UNK> paul the fat ugly one who started a <UNK> band must be <UNK> his lucky stars that he left when he did one of the worst movies ever made beware of this movie do not go and see it you won't laugh you will cry 0 10 <UNK>
<START> what a great barbara stanwyck film that i happened to see the other night <UNK> was fantastic it was made in 1953 and probably for double bills but it kept me on the edge of my seat br br barbara stanwyck plays helen who with husband doug barry sullivan and son lee <UNK> drive to an isolated fishing spot in mexico for a vacation husband has a fall from the <UNK> and the only way he is to be saved is if barbara drives back to a garage for some rope br br while there she runs into a psychotic killer ralph <UNK> one of my favourites and what follows is a game of cat and mouse as barbara tries everything in her power to get <UNK> to come back with her to free her husband br br the film was so suspenseful and such a surprise i was not expecting such a great film but i suppose i should have realized is there anything barbara stanwyck does that is anything less than wonderful
<START> don't listen to the misleading title werewolf woman the europeans are well known for putting an emphasis on sex and nudity over actual scares in their horror films but this one here is just a bit too much werewolf woman seems to have a sleazy sex scene <UNK> off with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner fun the first few times but a hundred minutes of this becomes very monotonous quickly <UNK> not even a werewolf but a <UNK> chick whose <UNK> was <UNK> for <UNK> the film can't even decide its tone with the first ten minutes a flashback being legitimate supernatural horror i thought i was in for a trash classic after these to a rather poor character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller at the end the director insists this is based on a true story yeah all right br br to be fair there are a few entertaining aspects of the production the title werewolf woman is a <UNK> and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes however these become rather monotonous quickly also the dubbed dialog is pretty hilarious in a camp fashion especially the worlds most swinging doctor he drinks on the job unfortunately the film becomes pretty irritating fast there's no actual plot or anything else really its a shame because reading a description i felt the film had some real potential werewolf woman is far overlong slow moving and a bit too pointless even by the standards of the exploitation genre 4 10
<START> if you loved deep cover you might like this film as well many of the poetic <UNK> fishburne <UNK> in deep cover are from the lyrical script of once in the life a screen adaptation of a play that fishburne wrote if you love larry as much as i do you'll love this film that is all larry all hot and all fleshed out of course there is gun play and <UNK> substance use this is a gangster movie of sorts after all but the script is beautiful and the story is touching even a little on the chick flick side br br amazing film dark frightening sexy and exciting if you ever <UNK> out at night or hung out in a <UNK> you'll get the proper impact of the <UNK> sets <UNK> <UNK> being trapped in the life full of clever <UNK> and complex relationships this film is tight every sentiment <UNK> in the set dressing and camera shots good work
<START> wow i read about this movie and it sounded so awful that i had to see it and my gosh i can smell it in st louis where do i start national <UNK> was trying to follow up 5 years later on the success of animal house but they completely missed the mark i'll go <UNK> with these short flicks br br short film 1 br br poor peter <UNK> <UNK> from animal house apparently he wasn't working back then so the boys at national <UNK> probably called and said hey we're making a c <UNK> movie wanna be in it peter was like well i'm not doing much these days why not he was a great side character in animal house but he couldn't carry this sorry short flop for 5 minutes br br possible spoiler the premise is funny enough with jason cooper <UNK> telling his wife to leave him she needs to find herself it's too weird that they're actually in a happy marriage so he chases her off there she goes and cooper is in charge of the kids this off course leads to him burning the house down losing several of the kids and sleeping with an assortment of new york <UNK> including an ever so young diane lane then the wife comes back wants the kids and the film ends with a <UNK> flip that'll decide the fate of the children the idea was actually somewhat clever but the director <UNK> the characters all seem like they're falling asleep they had to be <UNK> up sorry <UNK> your legacy was <UNK> with this flop br br short film 2 br br more spoilers br br enter <UNK> <UNK> pretty girl recently finished college not sure what to do with her life so she becomes a slut starts sleeping around with some mega rich guys takes their money when they die and she doesn't stop until she <UNK> the most powerful man in the world fred <UNK> <UNK> i mean the president of the united states once again it could have been funny and though i was happy that <UNK> ann <UNK> in real life wasn't afraid to bare all her acting was horrible what a waste of time br br short film 3 br br i can't believe i made it this far here's the rookie cop brent <UNK> <UNK> benson with veteran stan <UNK> richard widmark <UNK> is young naive thinks he can really help people though he becomes cynical after being shot several thousand times <UNK> really has just given up caring he watches <UNK> <UNK> you name it and never <UNK> he figures the world is <UNK> and he'll probably get <UNK> if he does anything even christopher lloyd at the end of <UNK> run gets in on the action getting the police called on him committing a crime but having his lawyer there to protect him god bless america br br once again could have been funny the performances were intentionally campy but goodness no energy whatsoever henry <UNK> and bob <UNK> should be ashamed of having their names on this schlock i think the writing wasn't bad the ideas were there but the execution was pulled off as well as the rescue attempt in the iranian hostage crisis if i had been a part of this film i would want my name removed it's horrible then again that's why i watched it br br the only good thing about this garbage is that dr john did the film score repeating going to the movies over and over again and the film isn't much longer than an hour and a half show this one in film classes with the heading what you should never do in film making this script should have been left on the shelf because yep it's that bad
<START> bottom of the freddy barrel this is the worst film in the series beating freddy's revenge for that title a cheap looking with mediocre special effects incoherent mess with freddy turned into a <UNK> he has one or two cool lines but that doesn't save this illogical and sloppy sequel
<START> those who know who know the kelly legend are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> character never existed in reality but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment it holds up pretty well <UNK> performance in the title role is quite solid taking the <UNK> of <UNK> best ned not hard considering the previous <UNK> include <UNK> serious mick jagger former <UNK> champion australian rules football bob <UNK> a great <UNK> but a poor actor some location shooting film in the area i live <UNK> <UNK> outside melbourne as well as <UNK> <UNK>
<START> spoilers br br i watched half of this movie and i didn't like it br br first reason boring barely anything happens the women sit around and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope they smoke <UNK> read magazines care for their sick friend and cut up the occasional dead body boring br br second reason there are too many things left unexplained many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random men <UNK> them in a chair and <UNK> them who are these men how do they know anything about illegal activity concerning the <UNK> flesh <UNK> why does he kill one and let another one go br br also there is this dude who at first i thought also had the flesh eating disease but he puts his fist through a wall with <UNK> strength suggesting he's not quite what we originally thought never explained how frustrating is that br br conclusion i found the women annoying the story uninteresting the <UNK> tedious and the action non existent also the cover art is misleading since it makes you believe this movie is going to be cool when it clearly isn't i rented this movie based on some of the reviews made by other people on this website and although i respect the fact that some people might have enjoyed this flick i will from now on make sure i read more than two reviews deep into a movie so as to avoid renting another movie i regret seeing
<START> the movie took a new angle to <UNK> life which is nice to see and it shows how human he was his relationship with harilal is something that gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography br br my big <UNK> is that i thought gandhi was surprisingly <UNK> in the movie it could have been better acted by the person who played gandhi some of <UNK> statements seemed too smug and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie br br the movie is not really all rounded but focused only <UNK> on the relationship of the father and son the rest is <UNK> out and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie br br overall nice movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture
<START> this is one of the more adorable episodes of the twilight zone with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments there's the usual blond <UNK> dancer what is up with <UNK> <UNK> for that kind of character such that she keeps showing up in various episodes and other <UNK> characters but it's jack <UNK> old man who totally steals the show i consider this the funny light hearted version of the monsters are due on <UNK> street or perhaps a 20 minute twilight zone parody of the thing on another note i thought the young lover of the episode might be someone who eventually went on to other things he looked familiar but it seems that ron <UNK> disappeared after just two tv credits to his name
<START> time and time again it seems that the comedic actors of hollywood are surprising me with their talents as dramatic performers first it was robin williams <UNK> hour photo 2002 ' then it was jim carrey <UNK> <UNK> 2004 ' being one example then will ferrell <UNK> than fiction 2006 ' and now adam sandler yes that's absolutely right the guy who has based an entire career on making brainless <UNK> comedies i'm not complaining i've always been a fan has finally given me a performance of which he can be proud of course some readers may be wondering whatever happened to <UNK> drunk love 2002 ' but i can only assure you that it's a film i'm currently taking <UNK> to see as soon as possible since i've heard it's terrific my first film from director mike <UNK> <UNK> over me ' is an intelligent and <UNK> exploration of grief and friendship though it does occasionally stray into all too familiar territory the somewhat predictable storyline proves surprisingly deep and moving with both sandler and don cheadle giving memorable performances br br alan johnson cheadle is a successful dentist with a good family though he finds himself unable to communicate adequately with his wife <UNK> <UNK> smith and so his marriage is a little shaky charlie <UNK> adam sandler is <UNK> ex college roommate a man who lost his entire family in the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and who is still confronting his overwhelming feelings of grief a <UNK> figure with messy hair and <UNK> eyes often <UNK> in appearance to bob dylan charlie has abandoned his career in <UNK> and spends his time in <UNK> listening to music with <UNK> that cut out all sound from the outside world driving around manhattan in his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> himself in <UNK> video games and repeatedly <UNK> his apartment kitchen in <UNK> with his deceased wife's final wishes when alan and charlie meet for the first time in years the latter doesn't even <UNK> an old friend having completely abandoned any memories prior to his life <UNK> experience indeed at first he doesn't even acknowledge the existence of his family and abruptly loses his temper whenever anybody suggests that he seek <UNK> br br initially it may seem a bit exploitative for the filmmakers to be using the september 11 attacks as a storytelling device <UNK> wouldn't it be just as devastating if charlie's family had died in an ordinary everyday car accident however if you consider that the director's intention was to demonstrate the enormous pain caused to ordinary citizens by the tragedy then <UNK> over <UNK> does a very good job it's easy to get so caught up in meaningless <UNK> that you neglect the emotional costs of the terrorist attacks this is the first 9 11 <UNK> film i've seen that truly dealt with the suffering of those who weren't even involved whose only anguish was caused through losing those whom they loved adam sandler shows surprising range in a difficult role one which would have <UNK> to pieces had he not been up to the task <UNK> instantly between <UNK> anger and depression charlie <UNK> is a man with whom we can deeply <UNK> a hollow soul who thanks to the <UNK> of an old friend can finally glimpse light at the end of a dark bleak tunnel
<START> i thought this was a quiet good movie it was fun to watch it what i liked best where the <UNK> at the end of the movie they were great
<START> i was adopted at birth and certainly did not have the problems antwone fisher had in the movie but i still share some of the emotions and this movie really helped to bring them out and force me to deal with them it even caused me to realize that i do have a missing piece and i am going to seek out my <UNK> now br br i cried for almost a day after i saw this the first time <UNK> confrontation with his <UNK> <UNK> with his father's family's reaction to his sudden appearance are powerful for those of us who don't know what will happen if we find our birth parents and his self confidence and self <UNK> to his mother and against the <UNK> of his past were so powerful i could really identify with this and my need to tell people yeah i was put aside by my parents when i was born but another set of parents picked me up and loved me and now i am a success br br it also helped my wife understand me and our adopted children who did go through tragic experiences before they came to our home and it helped me to realize just how messed up our social system is if you remember reading the story last year about the foster kid in florida who was lost and then the miranda ashley story in <UNK> city where <UNK> ignored multiple sexual abuse complaints about the man who ultimately killed them and the week this movie was released yet another story in new jersey of three kids who were ignored by the system one died the state apparently thought the home they were in was ok because the guardian was employed as a stripper and only occasionally used heroin br br there are just so many issues that are brought out in this movie and they are dealt with so well by the script and by the acting that antwone fisher should be a best picture <UNK> for sure no matter if you are adopted or not it is a heart <UNK> that can't be ignored by anyone concerned about children in our society
<START> how sad there is no option to post a mark lower than 1 i watched this piece of nonsense and could barely believe what i was watching every single part of the film was awful music acting direction story everything simply everything i actually found myself laughing out loud at various points in the film i particularly loved the bit where our hero is dashing through the hospital in soft focus slow motion and knocks the <UNK> out of the <UNK> hand because well just because product placement <UNK> <UNK> everywhere if you are of a christian <UNK> and very easily satisfied you may like this movie if you do like this movie you really need to get out more
<START> lindy meryl streep and her husband michael sam <UNK> have just welcomed a baby girl <UNK> as seventh day <UNK> they live their beliefs every day and soon have <UNK> dedicated to god at their church with their two older boys looking on michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to <UNK> rock one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of australia not being wealthy the family camps near the site after a wonderful first day lindy puts baby <UNK> to sleep in one of the <UNK> suddenly she hears <UNK> crying as lindy rushes to the <UNK> a <UNK> dog is just <UNK> shaking his head the baby is gone and soon so is the <UNK> although the entire camp looks for the baby she is not found <UNK> she is dead and that the <UNK> made off with their beloved child the <UNK> struggle to accept god's decision and go on with their lives but unfortunately the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is <UNK> that lindy murdered the baby she is subsequently arrested and put on trial how could this happen this is a great depiction of real events that shows how mob rule is not a <UNK> of the imagination the entire country turns against the <UNK> in part because they are seen as odd streep gives her best performance ever as the complex lindy whose own strong <UNK> demeanor works against her every step of the way <UNK> likewise does a wonderful job as the <UNK> and confused michael the cast is one of the largest ever with depictions of folks around the country getting their <UNK> into <UNK> case the costumes scenery script direction and production are all top of the line if you have never seen or heard of this film <UNK> that straight away it is not a far cry from reality to say that this cry should be seen by all who care about film and about the <UNK> power of the media
<START> some people say this is the best film that <UNK> ever released i'm not too sure about that since i have a fond place in my heart for some of their mysteries i will say that this is probably one of the most unique films they or any other studio major or minor ever released br br the plot is simple the ghost of a wrongly executed <UNK> has returned to the swamp to kill all those who <UNK> him as well as all of their off spring into this mix comes the <UNK> of one ghosts victims the current <UNK> she takes over the ferry business as the ghost <UNK> in on the man she loves br br <UNK> in dense fog and set primarily on the single swamp set this is more musical poem than regular feature film listen to the <UNK> of the dialog especially in the early scenes their is <UNK> <UNK> to them likewise there is a similar <UNK> to the camera work as it travels back and forth across the swamp as if crossing back and forth across the door way between life and death innocence and guilt the film reminds me of an opera or <UNK> or musical object lesson more than a normal horror film its an amazing piece of film making that is probably unique in film history br br this isn't to <UNK> the <UNK> this is a low budget horror mystery that tells you a neat little story that will keep you entertained its tale of love and revenge is what matters here not the <UNK> film making and it holds you attention first and foremost the technical aspects just being window dressing if there is any real flaw its the <UNK> of the production the fog does create a mood but it also hides the fact that this swamp is entirely on dry land the constant back and forth across it is okay for a while but even after <UNK> minutes you do wish that we could see something else br br don't get me wrong i do like the film a great deal its a good little film that i some how wish was slightly less poverty stricken its definitely worth a look if you can come across it
<START> this is one of the few episodes if not the only one with an <UNK> error in its storytelling while handling the <UNK> situation christopher states that he has heard about pie o <UNK> death in the fire accident this is an important detail because in this context it is quite obvious that christopher knows from the beginning that tony is the one who must have killed <UNK> there is however no way chris could have heard about the accident who should have told him and when by the time he is torn out of his <UNK> by tony's call nobody else was informed tony knows that which makes it even worse hearing christopher talk about pie o <UNK> death could therefore only lead tony to the conclusion that chris himself has set the fire given the <UNK> elaborate writing process as told by the writers themselves on the dvd i really wonder none of them realized the problem there the story just doesn't work that way unnecessary to add that i'm a huge fan of the sopranos otherwise i certainly wouldn't care
<START> when its dvd was released i came to market and bought it and i think my money was on right way as i expected before buying it awesome movie what else i can say for will smith he's been an awesome actor like always whether in actions movies or serious always he gives a record <UNK> performance i think this is the movie after august rush which makes a person cry while watching it the way the director described the story was really awesome his previous life and his new life in movie was correctly <UNK> to the audience even i could not find any fault in the story or the way they shoot it i think its dvd should be a household because this will be really a nice thing for your collection it is not the movie which needs pop <UNK> for enjoyment this is the movie which let the audience learn a lesson now what is the lesson you can see that while watching and i advise those people who are movie critics please watch this if you could find any criticism about this movie then please talk to me
<START> hidden frontier is a fan made show in the world of star trek the story takes place after voyager has returned from the <UNK> <UNK> it has some characters from the official star trek shows but most of them are original to the show the show takes place on the star base deep space 12 and on several space ships which gives it opportunities the official shows don't have the characters have the opportunity of a rising in the <UNK> which characters in shows with only one ship doesn't have the show has good computer animation of <UNK> but the acting takes place in front of at green screen and it gives a green glow around the actors not all the actors are equally good but most do fine the episodes are character driven and the characters develop over many episodes that is a bit more like in <UNK> 5 than in most official star trek shows hidden frontier takes <UNK> that even the official series has <UNK> from using all in all i enjoyed watching it
<START> ok i think the tv show is kind of cute and it always has some kind of lesson involved so when my kids decided they wanted to see this movie i decided to tag along i wish i'd stayed home and watched the tv show instead br br the fact that the humor is silly and unoriginal is the least of the problems with this movie the plot is next to non <UNK> the characters seem to exist in a <UNK> and worst of all gadget does not carry any lesson whatsoever it appears that disney took all of the things that make inspector gadget work on tv and tossed them all to be fair my younger child 8 years old liked the movie but the older one 10 years old came away thinking it silly he was too old for the youth humor but too young for any of the adult humor br br generally i like disney films but this one misses by a mile it is ok for a very narrow age band say 7 to 9 but a must miss for everybody else
<START> no br br basically your watching something that doesn't make sense to not spoil the film for people who actually want to this take a look at the flick i will explain the story br br a normal everyday to day women is walking down a street then <UNK> herself driving by in her own car she follows her and many events take place during that time that include her and her family br br i specifically made an account to comment on this film of how horribly written this was the acting was great the events were great but the story just brought it nowhere it could of been added to tremendously and be made into a worldwide <UNK> i'm not sure what the writer was trying to accomplish by making this usually at the end of films most of your questions get answers but this film has you asking what just happened and 1 hour 20 minutes just passed for nothing br br spoiler starts br br they had this area between 2 <UNK> <UNK> and behind the glass that would come into our world and kill us it was not <UNK> on all during the film and you never know how it was happening or why it was or when it happened nothing gets explained during the film the main character shouldn't of even been the main character at the end of the film the guy who finally figures it all out and runs away her sisters boyfriend should of been the main character but sadly the movie ends 20 seconds after br br i bought this movie for 10 threw it out right after don't waste your time i really hope nothing like this is made again
<START> domino has been widely condemned on this site for its frenetic editing style and sickening photography it's <UNK> <UNK> its <UNK> and criticize its <UNK> of style over substance i couldn't disagree more i believe that domino represents the absolute height of tony scott's film making career br br after having created the <UNK> hollywood action movie style throughout the late eighties and early nineties tony scott has moved <UNK> closer to a more <UNK> style of cinema as early as <UNK> tide scott used his <UNK> talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters the <UNK> and drama inherent in the conflict on board a nuclear submarine was <UNK> in the excellent use of long <UNK> combined with <UNK> angle framing this was then carried through to enemy of the state and spy game which visually represented the worlds of <UNK> and espionage respectively br br man on fire was an extreme departure a move into an <UNK> more <UNK> aesthetic here scott used an <UNK> hand <UNK> camera and flash frames to express his character's explosive rage although not entirely successful it introduced the techniques which were to find their full expression in domino br br <UNK> in the framing device of an fbi <UNK> domino presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter via her narrated disjointed <UNK> of memory she <UNK> at memories as we all do in <UNK> flashes and brief <UNK> as domino <UNK> her story <UNK> scott <UNK> it visually <UNK> not only the events which she describes but also the point of view which <UNK> them she does have <UNK> of <UNK> in her system but her individual vision is anyway unusual that of an woman who <UNK> the life of luxury for bounty hunting br br it is when domino begins to relate the events which lead to her <UNK> that scott really lets rip together with cinematographer dan <UNK> and composer harry <UNK> williams scott <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> of contemporary <UNK> gradually we begin to realize that unusual though she may be domino is no more disjointed than the <UNK> culture she has rejected as she <UNK> through this cultural <UNK> scott makes his viewer more aware of the innocence which it destroys through the <UNK> children which the narrative introduces ultimately scott portrays their salvation as the only escape we have from this surreal trip br br to criticize this movie for being overly stylized is akin to <UNK> a <UNK> or a <UNK> for not representing that which is <UNK> human like any great painting the meaning in domino is in the surface and the surface is everything br br i am not in any way associated with scott free but have always been and will continue to be a huge admirer of tony scott's work
<START> when <UNK> became the movie trilogy most of us are familiar with a lot of it was sheer action and less of anything else this <UNK> is kinda the opposite though <UNK> only half a dozen episodes it isn't filled with action but emotional things the two main action sequences in this i believe are enough to satisfy me after seeing so many gundam series movies and <UNK> i was completely ready for a <UNK> esquire movie this movie did a fantastic job of that what makes this movie stand out is that shows both sides of the war have good and bad people it made the <UNK> seem more human rather than the original movies where they're depicted as the second rise of evil nazis most people that don't like anime that i've forced to watch this movie lol liked it so i'd recommend it to a lot of people just for the anti war story if you're a gundam fan and haven't seen this you shouldn't be reading this you should already be watching it right now
<START> this review is for the extended cut of this movie br br i first watched dragon lord when i bought it on dvd many years ago i always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of it to get the general idea br br that being said i've always found the storyline a bit confusing the movie is after all a love story and it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20 minute fight scene br br well in the extended version this is no longer so the old original version begins off with a huge barrel climb <UNK> like sequence which is the new ending sequence in the extended version the opening sequence is dragon jackie chan hanging around his house and pretending to be training and <UNK> whenever his father is around br br other <UNK> have also been shift or prolonged in the extended cut and the story makes a lot more sense when you watch it the pacing is also better and overall it just works better it feels more like a love story and doesn't leave you asking questions about why it ends so drastically and dramatically as the regular version does br br i suggest everyone who is a hong kong cinema or just plain jackie chan fanatic to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intended or at least that's how i think it was intended why else would they make it and <UNK> some of the scenes when i was done watching it i felt like i had watched a completely new jackie chan movie although most of the sequences were the same
<START> i dont know about you but i've always felt drawn to <UNK> cinema the first <UNK> film i managed to get a hold of was peter <UNK> the cook the thief his wife and her lover which blew my mind and creative <UNK> into <UNK> the film was the ultimate <UNK> both beautiful and grotesque this is what <UNK> <UNK> was about exploring intellectual ideas and bringing the visceral to the screen with purpose life real life can be like living in a <UNK> and art expressed shows it for what it is i love movies of all types but especially those that both entertain and have something to say whether i agree with it's stance or no br br 8 1 2 women is a dry <UNK> <UNK> where a father and son gather a <UNK> to <UNK> their many sexual fantasies there is only a very brief <UNK> to fellini in the film unlike what the previews have suggested the main focus of the film falls on the <UNK> relationship between father and son brought together after the <UNK> death in the early scenes of the film the <UNK> sadness is believable you can feel his pain what happens afterwards is plain by <UNK> standards the gathering of the <UNK> observations on love and death and flesh displayed for the sake of flesh one could argue this but i feel the movie to be shallow and pointless and the idea that this could be a comedy is <UNK> to me the acting for the most part if fine especially good are polly walker and amanda plummer though poor mandy should put her clothes back on what the film lacks is a compelling story and the usual <UNK> touches of excess that made his other films so wonderful to watch br br while filled with moments of insight and the occasional taboo 8 1 2 women is too cut and <UNK> to be considered art too bland to considered <UNK> and simply too dull to be considered worthwhile br br save your money i can only recommend this film as a sleeping aid br br 4 out of 10
