<START> okay so <UNK> a little hokey looking by today's standards and some of the acting is pretty stilted and most of the special effects could now be <UNK> by a bright 12 year old kid with a decent computer editing program and don't get me started about the poster br br this is still a great movie 40 years after it was released i grew up watching science fiction on the local tv <UNK> science fiction adventure theater on sunday <UNK> so i've seen quite a few sf movies from the <UNK> at a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him <UNK> a <UNK> model of a city forbidden planet forever raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie which actually had a plot br br i doubt that many sf movies made in the <UNK> will still be considered worth watching in <UNK>
<START> i must say that i was <UNK> with this film i have never been a huge <UNK> fans i find their songs kind of childish and <UNK> nostalgic this is me in grade 9 if i had a million dollars shoe box of life etc however i have seen clips of their live show and i really like the <UNK> and goofy nature of the show i was hoping that this movie would highlight this which is unfortunately the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling there is a <UNK> bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring despite how much jim <UNK> was digging himself the film does not and shows only a few minutes of it and you know they've had better moments as in the <UNK> concert <UNK> <UNK> he's the man in charge my <UNK> steve <UNK> and i'm really large br br <UNK> are kind of like when i went to europe a few years ago and heard that <UNK> blue song by <UNK> 99 or whatever every 2 minutes i came back to canada and then a month later that song was all over the place again i nearly <UNK> off my own arm <UNK> is like that years ago i remember many a fond memory of sitting around <UNK> in canada listening to people play if i had a million dollars <UNK> was a cult phenomenon in canada and much of their humour has a particular canadian <UNK> to it <UNK> dinner is a <UNK> for many students up here and the name gordon is <UNK> canadian a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and i was somewhat <UNK> then all of a sudden they become huge in states and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band yeah they're brand new but they're all in their 30's while the rest of canada is going oh <UNK> i thought those guys <UNK> years ago do i have to listen to <UNK> <UNK> again br br the concert footage is not bad but i would have liked to have seen more of their stage routine the shooting is not that great and things like clips from their massive free show in boston are <UNK> over much too quickly the interviews are surprisingly dull for such a funny bunch of guys i think they're all old and they have families and houses and stuff and have settled down a bit there are times when they go into spinal tap type of material where they deliver deadpan satire then they break into laughs and <UNK> that kind of ruins it the interviews with <UNK> <UNK> a canadian media <UNK> and terry david <UNK> music dude are extremely pretentious and verge into tap territory unintentionally br br this movie doesn't really document very much either i mean it's basically one show and at the start of the film they are already huge and have a massive <UNK> <UNK> it's not like we see them rising from obscurity and surprise they are popular it's a <UNK> planned out event so in the end it's rather lifeless kind of half live concert half documentary and not much of either br br
<START> generally speaking the plot was much better than i was expecting the laugh track was a bit annoying at times and did tend to get in the way however there were enough real chuckles in this episode to make up for it my biggest surprise was finding some of the best lines and situations were not shown in the trailers spade in particular was not presented in the best light in the earlier <UNK> but his character comes across quite well in the pilot there is is enough eye candy to please almost anyone and all the regular characters seem up to the task ahead of them now if the writers can just live up to what they have begun
<START> godzilla vs king <UNK> is a perfect example how a great idea can be ruined by pathetic topics like pseudo <UNK> here <UNK> from the future try to ruin japan replacing the local hero godzilla with their puppy monster the three headed golden dragon king <UNK> they fail however and in the end godzilla fights <UNK> the battles between the two <UNK> are very cool but the plot of the movie is full with holes and the all thing about japan is great is really stupid the creators of this movie didn't even threat with respect the enemies of japan making them stupid big blond guys who are easily <UNK> by the clever japanese the good thing is that in the end godzilla and king <UNK> nearly destroyed the both japan and it's ridiculous enemies in one actually two spectacular <UNK> but till this battle <UNK> the film was really dull and pathetic
<START> i can <UNK> and <UNK> say that in all my <UNK> years on this planet that is the worse <UNK> children's film i have ever seen in my life br br i took my three grand children to see it and even they were struggling to raise a smile during the all <UNK> 90 mins the sexual <UNK> i will leave for another day but they were as tasteless as the film they should pay you to watch it not you pay them it's truly truly awful there is no other way to describe it the people that made this film should be brought to task for taking money under false <UNK> br br <UNK> for my spelling mistakes but i am so upset that it <UNK> the time i had with my <UNK> regards stephen
<START> saw this film yesterday for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it i'm a student of screen writing and i loved the way the minor characters <UNK> just when something pivotal climatic happened in a scene br br i thought the dialogue was very sharp and the premise of story is rather shocking at one particular point barbara stanwyck is openly <UNK> with her daughter's boyfriend and <UNK> some passion in her husband whom she hasn't seen in ten years and with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shots and then <UNK> she <UNK> up with her old <UNK> mate dutch the reason she left town in the first place all at the same time the moral majority must have been totally <UNK> when they saw this flick back in the 50's br br love the costumes and cinematography and the straight from the hip dialogue just to watch barbara stanwyck and co doing the <UNK> <UNK> is good enough reason to rent this film on dvd br br one of the best films from that period i've seen in a long time
<START> i'm watching the series again now that it's out on dvd <UNK> it's striking me as fresh as relevant and as intriguing as when it first aired br br the central performances are gripping the scripts are layered br br i'll stick my neck out and put it up there with the prisoner as a show that'll be winning new fans and still be watched come <UNK> br br i've been asked to write some more line it seems imdb is as user <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as ever <UNK> and to the point is clearly not the imdb way br br well unlike <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> american gothic understands that simplicity is everything br br in 22 episodes the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons on top of which it questions personal <UNK> and strength of character in a way which challenges the viewer at every turn to ask themselves what they would choose and what they would think in a given situation br br when the show first aired i was still <UNK> for twin peaks and thought it would be a cheap knock off personally i'm starting to rate it more highly and suspect it will stand up better over the years <UNK> it don't get more controversial than that
<START> the problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple indiana jones was so closely <UNK> after alan <UNK> or at least is an alan <UNK> type of character that the <UNK> director made the mistake of <UNK> the <UNK> movies for dialog and story far too deeply what you got as a finished product was a <UNK> mess of the name alan <UNK> in an uneven <UNK> <UNK> of a cheaply <UNK> <UNK> saga with a touch of austin powers esquire cheese here and there br br it was labeled by many critics to have been a great parody or unintentional comedy unintentional is the word this movie was never intended to be humorous witty yes but not humorous unfortunately it's witless rather than witty br br with this new <UNK> mini series you get much more story character development of your lead solid portrayals and a fine even entertaining blend this story is a bit long much longer than its predecessors but deservedly so as this version carries a real storyline and not just action and eye candy while it features both action and eye candy it also <UNK> the mistake made in the 1985 version by forgetting <UNK> all together and going back to the source <UNK> for <UNK> making for a fine well thought out plot and some nice <UNK> sub plots br br now this attempt is not the all out action <UNK> that is indiana jones nor is it a poor attempt to be so this vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful rendition of the <UNK> <UNK> saga filmed on location in south africa the audience is granted beautiful if desolate <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cultures and some nice <UNK> footage to blend smoothly with the performances and storyline here br br steve <UNK> totally surprised me with this one as i have never been one to <UNK> to his vision in fact i have disliked most of his work as a director until this attempt i hope this is more a new vein of talent and less the <UNK> that it seems to be br br this version rates a 9 8 10 on the tv scale from br br the fiend
<START> forget the jaded comments that come before these this is an action packed but sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting well acted even by elizabeth <UNK> recommended for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change
<START> this superb film draws on a variety of talented actors and musicians at the top of their form <UNK> crosby martin <UNK> <UNK> are completely at home in the story that apparently was <UNK> by billy wilder one would love to know more about how much he had to do with it because it's an exceptionally clever variation on the <UNK> master <UNK> servant tale nearly an allegory of the entertainment industry run by <UNK> up <UNK> but made into a vibrant world of art and play by an exploited <UNK> of <UNK> and non <UNK> looking at the last six decades of music tv and film in the us it's hard not to see the underlying insights of this film as <UNK>
<START> irritating illogical flow of events pretty much every joke is so simple that it can hardly be regarded as one no wonder the cinema was empty and people actually walked away yes away i stayed since i was enjoying a wonderful ice cream with nuts during the whole movie
<START> i enjoy quality <UNK> and this ranks up there with some of the finest the cg is out of this world or at least pre dates our world and the insanity of a 6 foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad i quite enjoyed some of this but the acting is so <UNK> awful and even the obligatory nude scene doesn't really have any <UNK> out in it just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one i don't know who wasted more time me watching this or the poor <UNK> who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers i can assure you it wont however on a <UNK> note i have managed to successfully do the 6 degrees of kevin bacon from this movie so i think it was almost worthwhile watching the <UNK> minutes of it
<START> i'll start by <UNK> to filmmakers everywhere for using the terms filmmaker film or movie in connection with this but criminal and crime against humanity seem a bit harsh br br the writing pathetic br br the directing pathetic br br the acting pathetic br br the cinematography too inept for words br br the technical skills used to <UNK> this atrocity none whatsoever br br this <UNK> of waste could hardly be called cinema the majority of family home movies come closer to <UNK> that distinction than revenge quest no this is just a 10 car pile up caught on video br br we'll skip the plot in this review because there are far too many holes to be covered at once let's just say that it stinks worse than the rest of this movie to call the acting one dimensional would be giving them credit what little there is is atrocious to begin with and made much worse by the terrible video and editing br br the worst part of this atrocity though apart from the plot would have to be the effects or rather the disturbing lack thereof there are no <UNK> in the guns no <UNK> and what few sound effects existed were either stock gun sounds or they were generated by mouth yeah you read that right the filmmaker actually had the <UNK> to record a <UNK> sound for the elevator doors i guess he felt it made them sound more futuristic this is supposed to be set in the year <UNK> after all that doesn't explain the sounds he created by mouth for the fist fight scenes however br br if it wasn't bad enough that the sound quality is terrible he just used the <UNK> that was <UNK> on the video camera and it shows the use of stock gun sounds was almost worse than not using any sounds at all the sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack like a drunken <UNK> in a herd of sheep and they're just as clumsy picture this the bad guy enters an office building searching for his prey a lady starts to run in fear he raises his gun an <UNK> and shakes it we hear a sound that is clearly not an <UNK> the woman runs away from camera and suddenly a single blood pack only 1 explodes on her back looked like she was hit by a <UNK> and she falls flat on her face br br bear in mind that my description does far too much justice to the <UNK> of the actual sequence br br in another sequence one which almost but not quite makes the movie funny enough to watch takes place in a <UNK> the bad guy chases the good guy and the lady he's protecting down the stairs shaking his plastic <UNK> all the way you may wish to duck there are badly timed sound effects flying all over the place br br i supposed alan <UNK> can't be locked away for <UNK> of this train wreck but he did follow through all the way to editing and releasing it if there's any justice there's bound to be some <UNK> out there with his name on it br br should you decide to watch this <UNK> of industrial waste and i would strongly advise against it be sure to watch for the entire scenes lifted nearly <UNK> from <UNK> and the am radio that <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> try not to focus too hard on the plot it will only hurt you more if you do br br 0 stars of 10 and that's being generous
<START> yes this is one of the great musical movies i grew up with with such great <UNK> as frank sinatra and gene kelly not to mention the <UNK> and glorious voice of kathryn grayson the music and dancing is superb i understand frank took lessons from kelly and there is kelly dancing with jerry mouse which is quite unique for the time betty <UNK> plays the waitress who falls in love with sinatra she is one of hollywood's great underrated stars i saw this again on a e tv and as well have it in my old vcr tapes never get tired of these old musicals whatever happened to hollywood
<START> <UNK> care by <UNK> von <UNK> is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made this extremely cheap dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations a horror veteran george kennedy is completely wasted as as professor <UNK> the acting is abysmal the action is slow and the climax is laughable a famous surgeon has a car accident he lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage <UNK> care is clearly influenced by american slasher films including halloween and friday the 13th series the killings are hilarious and the dialogs are painfully stupid still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look you'll laugh until it hurts with this one you can believe me
<START> who was george c scott george c scott was a renowned actor practically any movie that he's been in is the better off for it now ol' george had absolutely nothing to do with this movie but he once said something that describes said movie to a t br br i don't recall his exact words but he basically said that great writing can save bad acting but great acting cannot save bad writing never has this little observation been <UNK> than in the all new adventures of laurel hardy for love or mummy br br the casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect bronson <UNK> laurel and <UNK> <UNK> hardy not only look the parts but they do an exceptionally good job at <UNK> the real deal mannerisms and all this movie should stand as a lasting testament to their talents that said this movie falls flat on its face when it comes to you guessed it writing br br aside from the opening dialogue between <UNK> and <UNK> which was very in character and a brief gag involving a taxi this movie is an absolute chore to sit through br br problem 1 too much time and effort went into the plot br br i don't want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the pretty british lady what i want is to see stan and ollie or at least their stand ins way too much screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or to the not very funny secondary characters that said plot <UNK> around br br however even if this movie had been all jokes that would still leave us with br br problem 2 most of the jokes are what i would call watered down slapstick br br what do i mean by watered down br br in slapstick a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way for comedic effect ala looney tunes 3 stooges or how about laurel hardy br br in watered down slapstick as i define it a character gets mildly hurt or <UNK> and the filmmakers play that up for comedic effect br br maybe an <UNK> would help br br in looney tunes <UNK> duck gets shot by elmer <UNK> his bill falls off and he puts it back on that is classic slapstick br br in this gem ollie accidentally <UNK> into some people they turn around tell him to be careful and continue on their merry way that's not slapstick that's not even funny that's just boring and this movie is full of these kinds of jokes it's as though they're this movie's bread and <UNK> the writers and directors just take these dull moments and act like they're supposed to be funny granted the example i just gave is the most extreme case but i can only cut it so much slack br br long story short the film just doesn't work because the script fails to capitalize on <UNK> and <UNK> abilities to <UNK> stan and ollie instead the script <UNK> on plot exposition and lame jokes watching this movie is basically watching two excellent <UNK> who were given no real material to work with br br not a good movie but an incredible sleeping aid br br i say give this one a miss and stick with the real deal just so long as you steer clear of <UNK> k and be big
<START> they had an opportunity to make one of the best romantic tragedy mafia movies ever because they had the actors the budget and the story but the great director john huston was too <UNK> trying to <UNK> out this missed classic <UNK> trying to find black humor as often as possible which <UNK> the movie very much and also they were so <UNK> with details like sound and detailed action maybe it was the age of the director who passed away two years later
<START> warning tons of dead <UNK> don't read if you haven't seen this series or you can whatever br br they're are few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and comes out with another <UNK> <UNK> maybe even some words that can't be <UNK> but when elm street 6 freddy's dead shows everyone who thought the series got old and wanted to stop seeing him or people who wanted their hero or <UNK> just stops for his final breath this film was it br br this film starts with a parody of wizard of oz then you see a kid who is named only as john <UNK> who is the last child in <UNK> <UNK> leaves and gets out of freddy territory a woman who <UNK> at a hospital place to get kids off their feet kind of place meets this boy and at the same time has a dream about a man a water tower and a promise of a secret floating in her mind goes back to <UNK> to figure out this frightening vision and soon finds out that she is freddy's child and we soon find out that freddy can only leave <UNK> if his daughter can be a sort of host for him and beyond that fright ensues this film seems to hit the nail on the head of everything you wanted to know br br this film has tons of humor and cameo <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> and tom arnold alice cooper johnny <UNK> and a very young <UNK> meyer playing a teenage <UNK> who sees <UNK> vision of flowers and iron <UNK> in a <UNK> da <UNK> then gets stuck in a super mario parody of sorts this film will either make you hate this movie or like krueger even more the best of the best
<START> this is the version that even the author hated because it's so <UNK> they gave it a <UNK> <UNK> and changed a lot of the dialogue and it's just a big pile of <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> is quite good i believe he <UNK> the role but everyone else falls into that acting style of the 40's that is really just posing the one great feature the music this has one of the best scores ever recorded and it's worth seeking out in a record shop overall i think the 1989 <UNK> grey eric <UNK> penelope miller version is far superior
<START> anyone who has watched comedy central around midnight in the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie i first saw ads for this movie back in 2001 it looked like it could be funny but i wasn't about to call up the number on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie first i figured i would wait until the movie was available to rent at blockbuster br br about a year and a half later i was at tower records and in the dvds for less than 20 pile there was a copy of this movie seeing that the dvd was only 6 99 i decided to buy it i got home put the disc in the dvd player and waited for the laughs to start and i waited some more the laughs never came br br i'd have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when i say that this movie was horrible sick desperately tasteless and poorly written and directed the underground comedy movie is an atrocious piece of garbage and is in my opinion the worst movie of all time no stars
<START> if the myth regarding broken mirrors would be accurate everybody involved in this production would now face approximately <UNK> years of bad luck because there are a lot of mirrors falling to little pieces here if only the script was as shattering as the glass then the broken would have been a brilliant film now it's sadly just an overlong derivative and dull movie with only just a handful of remarkable ideas and memorable sequences sean <UNK> made a very stylish and <UNK> photographed movie but the story is lackluster and the total absence of logic and explanation is really frustrating i got into a discussion with a friend regarding the basic concept and meaning of the film he thinks <UNK> found inspiration in an old legend claiming that <UNK> your <UNK> is a foreboding of how you're going to die interesting theory but i'm not familiar with this legend and couldn't find anything on the internet about this neither personally i just think the broken is yet another <UNK> variation on the theme of invasion of the body <UNK> but without the alien <UNK> the broken centers on the american <UNK> family living in london and particularly gina when a mirror <UNK> breaks during a birthday celebration this <UNK> a whole series of mysterious and seemingly supernatural events gina spots herself driving by in a car and follows her mirror image to an apartment building whilst driving home in a state of mental confusion she causes a terrible car accident and ends up in the hospital when <UNK> gina feels like her whole surrounding is changing she doesn't recognize her own boyfriend anymore and uncanny <UNK> of the accident keep flashing before her eyes does she suffer from mental <UNK> <UNK> by the accident or is there really a supernatural conspiracy happening all around her writer director sean <UNK> definitely <UNK> feelings of curiosity and suspense in his script but unfortunately he fails to properly elaborate them the broken is a truly atmospheric and stylish effort but only after just half an hour of film you come to the painful conclusion it shall just remain a beautiful but empty package there's a <UNK> high amount of fake suspense in this film this means building up tension through ominous music and eerie camera angels when absolutely nothing has even happened so far by the time the actually <UNK> kicks in these tricks don't have any scary effect on you anymore some of my fellow reviewers around here compare the film and particularly sean <UNK> style with the <UNK> of david lynch stanley kubrick and even alfred hitchcock but that is way way  way too much honor ps what is up with that alternate spelling the one with the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i don't know what they were thinking by they i mean anybody even remotely connected to this disaster i've seen so bad movies i've seen so really bad movies and then there's this but i will say one thing whoever wrote the script has <UNK> to put what could possibly the most inane dialogue over written onto the screen there is nothing good about this movie either from a technical standpoint or any other standpoint whoever allowed it to be made and then released should have been fired immediately there are a few fairly well known names in this movie actually i hesitate to use the word movie it's more like a collection of random scenes that have no relation to another and make less than 0 sense anyway i fail to see why anyone with any dignity would appear in this i got it really cheap and i still got ripped of even if i had gotten this movie for free i would still have been ripped off this is an <UNK> 0 10
<START> two <UNK> battle in the fourth dimension one brian thompson as a <UNK> trying to destroy the earth the other jeffrey combs as a anton <UNK> trying to save it doctor <UNK> is an enjoyable fantasy fare which offers plenty of cheese the plot is pretty silly and the gore is completely absent but the film is very short and entertaining so if you have enough time to kill give this one a look my rating 7 out of 10
<START> after <UNK> strikes <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> is my second favorite movie from the star wars series br br luke went to <UNK> to save han solo from <UNK> at the same time the <UNK> empire is doing in secret the construction of a new space station like the previous death star if this station stays totally constructed it will be the end of the rebel alliance both vader and the emperor are <UNK> because of the <UNK> of the new death star and they need to kill many of their <UNK> to have the project made in schedule br br <UNK> and <UNK> are inside <UNK> palace to send a message from luke to <UNK> where <UNK> pretends to <UNK> <UNK> life he gives <UNK> and <UNK> as a gift to <UNK> as part of his plan <UNK> does not accept the <UNK> since he is using han solo as a piece of his <UNK> decoration han still is frozen in <UNK> <UNK> is hidden as <UNK> guard and <UNK> is also gave to <UNK> by a reward hunter when the same hunter tries to save han solo and makes him stay in human form again we see that is actually princess leia in a disguise the problem is that <UNK> discovers <UNK> plan and takes her as his slave while han is thrown away in <UNK> cell br br luke comes as a jedi knight to rescue his friends at his first try to kill <UNK> he falls into <UNK> monster cell <UNK> but easily kills it <UNK> stays angry and decides to thrown han <UNK> and luke to <UNK> a big creature from the desert who stays 1 000 years <UNK> it's <UNK> luke han and <UNK> has success in <UNK> again and even <UNK> <UNK> dies when han accidentally throws him in to <UNK> mouth leia kills <UNK> and goes after han luke and <UNK> as well <UNK> and <UNK> br br everybody's safe again luke decides to go to <UNK> to complete his training as a jedi as well his promise to <UNK> the problem is that <UNK> is too old and sick since he already has <UNK> years old and before he dies <UNK> says to luke that he does not need more training but to really be a jedi he must fight with vader again he <UNK> to luke that vader is <UNK> dad and that there is another skywalker besides luke in his last moments <UNK> asks to luke to remember his <UNK> about the temptation of the dark side and to luke <UNK> his jedi knowledge to other people when <UNK> dies <UNK> <UNK> spirit shows up to luke and tells him that <UNK> father killed his good side <UNK> to become darth vader and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a <UNK> luke stays worried about killing his own dad and says that he feels that his father still has kindness <UNK> wan tells luke that his twin sister is leia and says the reasons why luke and leia were separated since babies he gives his last advice to luke saying that if he refuses to kill vader the emperor will win the war br br at the same time the emperor says to vader that he must give luke to him when he shows up since luke is stronger than before and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring luke to the dark side br br now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war series when the rebel alliance plans to attack the new space station the <UNK> death star <UNK> luke will confront vader and the emperor and leia han and <UNK> needs to turn off the <UNK> star <UNK> power field with the help of the ewoks little creatures who looks little bears br br this is for sure one of the most exciting star wars of all
<START> this movie does have some great <UNK> <UNK> visuals and it tells a story that is <UNK> free of hollywood's sugar <UNK> which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film but some of the scenes go on for much too long the wedding especially and i found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialog to be more fit for the stage than for the silver screen br br the dialog was particularly distracting and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on most of the characters were either italian americans or italian immigrants living in new york in the <UNK> and thirties but their dialog sounded like they were practicing lines for a shakespeare play while they mixed <UNK> and laid <UNK> toward the end i was laughing and not because the filmmakers wanted me to i guess the stilted poetry could be <UNK> by saying that the characters would have been speaking italian and the dialog is a literal translation of how they would really talk but it absolutely did not work for me br br another line of dialog made me laugh for a different reason the main character's son born and raised in new york in the <UNK> suddenly picks up a lovely <UNK> british accent i'm only guessing this had something to do with the fact that the movie was made in england br br i give this movie an <UNK> for effort and intention but a considerably lower grade for execution
<START> come on the new twist is nearly ok but from <UNK> the elm street children freddy is just killing people now more of the same special effects with no actual character development or anything simply bad and insulting scary nope not at all just bad
<START> the animation was good the imagery was good although not totally original however the story was too long way too confusing and over the top dramatic after about an hour i couldn't wait to get it over with with so many characters that have nothing to contribute and plot elements that either come from nowhere or go nowhere this movie really wasn't one movie at all and would have been better of as a short series or possibly two movies if you like this kind of typical story maybe you will like it but frankly i've been spoiled by much more creative stories that actually have some sort message to tell go rent a miyazaki film and watch it twice you'll get way more out of it
<START> this movie which was released directly on video should carry a warning label that it is dangerous to human health and may subject the viewer to <UNK> boredom it is yet another <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rapture religious movie with the good guys the <UNK> suddenly <UNK> and the bad guys the non <UNK> left behind it's an interesting concept especially since we see it happen on a flight <UNK> by a non believer who is having a <UNK> affair with a <UNK> aboard needless to say that <UNK> doesn't disappear either <UNK> with all the pilots being non <UNK> the plane did not crash or the movie would have been mercifully over though this could have be interesting without the heavy religious <UNK> as a whole the plodding movie makes one gag the acting is horrible and the obviously computer generated <UNK> are very fake looking plus it's yet another movie shot in canada that <UNK> to be new york city spare me i'll just read the bible
<START> this film is quite simply brilliant the cinematography is good the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking this is the story of donald woods a white south african who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid kevin kline is completely convincing so much so that when donald woods himself appeared on tv some years later i <UNK> him from <UNK> portrayal denzel washington also turns in a masterful performance as ever br br i urge you to watch this it is long but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story remember folks this really happened
<START> <UNK> 11 year old luke <UNK> as billy worm boy <UNK> moves to a new town at his new school young <UNK> is picked on by the other boys they put worms in his <UNK> getting his gag <UNK> under control <UNK> <UNK> a worm on <UNK> faced bully adam <UNK> as joe <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he can eat 10 worms in one day without <UNK> br br tall <UNK> <UNK> kate <UNK> as erika <UNK> <UNK> uses her <UNK> skills to help <UNK> director and former <UNK> writer bob <UNK> promises no worms were <UNK> in the making of this movie in a related note <UNK> star <UNK> martin has one funny scene how to eat fried worms is loosely based on thomas <UNK> popular novel pre teen kids into gross outs should enjoy the film br br how to eat fried worms 8 25 <UNK> bob <UNK> luke <UNK> adam <UNK> <UNK> kate <UNK> alexander <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie on mystery science theater 300 it sucked so much if i hadn't been watching it on mst3k i probably would've thrown it out the window the characters were incredibly lame and it didn't provide much of a plot in my opinion
<START> claire <UNK> debut is both a brave and self assured one in this depiction of life towards the end of french <UNK> <UNK> she explores the relationships between men and women black and white br br with the black servant <UNK> as the film's primary object of desire and <UNK> the film enters taboo territory from the beginning denis builds a picture of life through a series of character relationships that keep the informed viewer fixed to the screen the mood of the film is captured perfectly by the camera work and lack of lighting br br a great <UNK>
<START> dear readers br br the final battle between the rebellion and empire the second death star is <UNK> <UNK> and when it is completed it will spell doom for the rebel alliance luke skywalker now a jedi knight returns from <UNK> with han solo and princess leia now revealed as <UNK> twin sister they agree to lead the attack on the shield <UNK> on the forest moon of <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> leads the attack on the death star little do they know that a most ingenious trap has been laid for them and the emperor <UNK> himself is personally <UNK> the construction of the second death star br br return of the jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy it's got action drama romance great battles fantastic acting amazing fight scenes and awesome music by john williams mark <UNK> is fully <UNK> now into a jedi knight gone is the naive farm boy and in his place is a calm relaxed jedi determined to save the galaxy leia is still cool in this film as well as han and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> do their roles to a t while james earl jones still is <UNK> greatest villain darth vader ian <UNK> is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless emperor <UNK> the action sequences of this movie are <UNK> amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty john <UNK> score is still cool and enhances the film by several levels br br signed the constant dvd collector
<START> i was blown away by the re imagined battlestar galactica a show that always kept me guessing and brought me to tears on more than one occasion a hardened sci fi fan i like to think i can pick out the good stuff from the <UNK> and this was good stuff br br as such when i first heard about the <UNK> of a prequel series some months ago i got a sick feeling in my gut i was afraid that the formula that made battlestar so successful would be <UNK> in caprica which wouldn't work at all <UNK> story of a <UNK> <UNK> band of survivors trapped aboard <UNK> star ships and guided by <UNK> vision and a sequence of pseudo <UNK> was perfectly <UNK> by extraordinary music and a better cast of actors br br caprica feels different where bsg takes place after the fall of a great civilization caprica portrays that civilization in it's cold and <UNK> <UNK> the overall vibe i got from caprica was similar to that of minority report minus excessive and <UNK> <UNK> in true bsg form caprica has in it's first few hours of programming already <UNK> the issues of religious freedom racism the morality of playing god and the nature of the human soul br br the casting for caprica is also excellent each character is unique and deep from the obsessive and distant scientist turned <UNK> to his troubled and <UNK> daughter each actor and actress throws themselves into their respective roles br br music which was used so <UNK> in bsg also plays a significant role in caprica <UNK> powerful rolling drums and <UNK> <UNK> served it's themes very well caprica uses a more <UNK> sound which gives the show it's own feeling quite distinct from either of it's predecessors br br the new caprica is definitely it's own show pulling from the battlestar franchise only as much as it needs i look forward to the full series
<START> normally the best way to annoy me in a film is to include some reference to orson welles but here is a sci fi comedy <UNK> the war of the worlds broadcast and it is gold the very concept of a small bunch of <UNK> aggressive and stupid aliens being mistaken as kids in halloween dress is magnificent don't be fooled by the notion that because it seems like a kids' movie it is <UNK> it isn't there's a lot of hidden treasure a gem
<START> bear in mind any film let alone documentary which <UNK> any kind of truth will generate an <UNK> and <UNK> amount of cynicism from those to whom any suggestion of and or search for truths is already meaningless those of you who are already masters of psychology film and <UNK> of the soul will no doubt find this movie redundant after all you already know everything there is to know <UNK> br br for those of us in the minority like myself i found the <UNK> guide to <UNK> mostly brilliant and worth watching for those interested in movies psychology and modern philosophy br br a little like scott <UNK> understanding comics director sophie <UNK> inter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> psychologist and social critic <UNK> zizek right into many of the films and <UNK> scenes he <UNK> the cover is an image from the birds zizek takes a boat out to re create the shot br br <UNK> psycho analysis does not necessarily scream an evening of great fun but it is if you like movies that is having some knowledge of <UNK> psycho analysis helps symbolic real and imaginary are terms which get thrown around a little loosely at first but the scenes which zizek <UNK> and analyze make remarkably clear what was always for me a very abstract subject in fact it's probably better to have a <UNK> with the films he's discussing than with the <UNK> he uses which becomes <UNK> as the film goes on br br why i love this film isn't because it picks great films to analyze or reveals great truths about <UNK> but shows in a very practical and clever manner where film and psychology and by <UNK> philosophy meet br br why is the sound of music kinda <UNK> why is short cuts about more than just class and alienation why do the birds attack in the birds what is there to learn about the mind from alien <UNK> what does the planet of <UNK> want what does psycho and the marx brothers have to do with each other and what the hell is david lynch getting across in movie after movie well zizek has some ideas br br the role of the voice in both the <UNK> and star wars revenge of the <UNK> is maybe the movies strongest and most <UNK> moment when he gets into feminine sexual <UNK> i begin to wonder at one point zizek admits his feeling that flowers are a kind of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that they are disgusting and should be hidden from children <UNK> it seems but br br anyway it's a fascinating documentary which anyone who has ever seen a movie and thought it meant something more than was literally stated should make an attempt to see br br and anyone interested in <UNK> zizek this is a must as well much less dry than reality of the virtual and more direct than zizek two other pseudo <UNK> about the elvis of contemporary cultural criticism as he is being dubbed in the english speaking world br br the <UNK> guide to cinema is not about the role of sex in cinema zizek claims cinema is the ultimate <UNK> art because it teaches how to desire and not what to desire and that it is the only contemporary art form that can allow for these desires to be <UNK> this is not a film about finding the reality in cinema it's about finding the cinema in reality and how important and exciting that can be hard to find and a bit long but well worth the trouble one of the most stimulating movie watching experiences i've ever had
<START> im not usually a lover of musicals but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be oliver this film is so well made the characters are well depicted the costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are great my favourite being <UNK> the <UNK> by ron moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of fagin i wasn't old enough to see oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs usually it was <UNK> will buy my wonderful <UNK> i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film its a timeless musical you definitely couldn't remake it it stands on its own its not accurate to the book and i don't think it would have worked so well if it had been i don't think charles dickens would be disappointed as he wrote oliver to depict the poverty in london the <UNK> the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive and the film portrays this very well also another great reason to watch this film is <UNK> the old type english bull <UNK> notice his long thin legs this was <UNK> out of the breed many years ago they must have hunted high and low to find a <UNK> like him and he is exactly how an english bull <UNK> would have looked in victorian times notice he has <UNK> which is probably makeup on his face bill sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit a victorian bull <UNK> had a record amount of kills in a rat pit his a beautiful dog any way and notice he <UNK> bill sykes after he has killed nancy he obviously has his standards his not the <UNK> head bill sykes thought he was this is a great musical to watch if you like musicals and if you don't like musicals give it a try any way there's something for everyone in this film
<START> all dogs go to heaven plays on the <UNK> criminal underworld the film is a delight for children with a comical and dark but satisfying and happy ending storyline with plenty of song and dance it features <UNK> charlie a fellow <UNK> criminal who is murdered but returns from the dead he meets a homeless human girl who looks up to him and through this relationship he realizes the meaning of life and self sacrifice this is a cute animation loved very much through my eyes as a child i would highly recommend this film to children i'm unsure about how adults would react to it i tried to watch it a few years ago on vhs but those <UNK> don't last long do they
<START> for his first ever debut this film has some riveting and chilling moments in the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach <UNK> every moment during this film the ending is superb the makers of <UNK> witch obviously watched this film it's ending wasn't an end but a beginning of the end a great movie and only a piece of <UNK> great as far as scare factor a perfect score it makes you think and scared out of your mind
<START> i sit through movies like <UNK> de <UNK> and i want to talk about cinema for hours the admiration this movie caused me is beyond my own limits of explanation because i'm watching the scenes of the film and i search inside my thoughts for film making ideas and dialogue <UNK> that could emerge from something bigger than <UNK> <UNK> mind br br looking the environment so <UNK> so simple i'm thinking this man is a genius no wonder he created what is probably the best television show <UNK> ever witnessed and then a first movie full of elements some contemporary directors haven't still achieved el <UNK> del <UNK> is the name and it <UNK> a few years ago my enthusiasm for our everyday cinema br br starting his journey from people's daily real lives <UNK> goes where <UNK> <UNK> never could in el <UNK> the federal police <UNK> life <UNK> film was a journey into a man's mind and experiences not into the places he saw yes there was a detailed training and lots of crime situations but <UNK> in in there his is more of a detective story like the ones we know and love with the mysteries and the thrilling music br br but there's a lot of humanity in his writing and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of his main characters <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> there are a lot of actors of great caliber in the film but these two actors are the ones the film can't do without the first character luis <UNK> is a detective that has just found out his wife <UNK> on him and has to work on a case br br the second one is a psychiatrist that is assigned the treatment of the detective he wants to deal with him in regular sessions but the sheriff takes advantage of the time <UNK> and suggests he joins <UNK> in his routines it's nothing the usual stuff no problem but it is bigger than that and it will unfold a part of the doctor's personality he didn't know br br the relationship developed between the two leads can't be explained unless it is observed because it regards such a complexity that demonstrates how talented are some men like <UNK> that are trying today to leave a signature in our history reaching points of unbelievable <UNK> during a high pressure situation <UNK> tells <UNK> how do we continue our treatment and <UNK> answers no i'm not your doctor you call me to have dinner i'm your friend we laugh because we can't help it br br and we can't help laughing when <UNK> crashes a car in the street and doesn't gives importance to it or when he <UNK> all the red lights in the street or when he <UNK> pot in his police <UNK> and <UNK> can't believe it but then <UNK> it too because he's screwed up or when <UNK> tries to be friendly with <UNK> <UNK> friends magic from diego <UNK> is what we receive there he a psychiatrist himself gives a performance in plan <UNK> de <UNK> but <UNK> with all his range luis <UNK> on the other hand is back on track with a top notch portrayal that reminds us the great actor he is br br there's a passion i have for this and as i said i could write about it for hours but unfortunately that's not the way it works and i have to be precise and <UNK> although i have to watch a lot of the old movies and study them i could assure that <UNK> de <UNK> is the comedy <UNK> had been waiting for and never <UNK> now
<START> kevin spacey is very talented but unfortunately directing is not his <UNK> i had high expectations about the film before i rented it and maybe that is why i disliked it so much i admire <UNK> attempt at making a film that takes place mostly in one small setting but it's not the attempt that counts i found the film dull boring and stretched out the acting was nothing spectacular gary <UNK> has done much better especially since he is conscious in most of his other films <UNK> <UNK> was disappointing but this was one of his first films i did get a kick out of how young and <UNK> this scream star looked the only thing that impressed me about this film was the one shot of the car wreck from above the center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on along the line and past the wreck however that shot was very usual suspects ish and my guess is spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his which is very good mind you if you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting watch hitchcock's <UNK> maybe spacey should have watched it before filming this
<START> this is without doubt one of the worst films i've ever seen br br the plot is so full of holes the story is like a bad remake of a bad suspense movie and the actors sound like were reading directly from the <UNK> for the first time worst of all is steve <UNK> he plays his character like he was in police academy the same foolish <UNK> and that's not suited for a leading man in what should have been a thriller br br it's really hard to believe that <UNK> would make l a <UNK> ten years later br br avoid this like the plague
<START> there are two movie experiences i will always <UNK> the first was seeing star wars for the first time at the age of 10 with my little brother a close second is <UNK> into halloween at the <UNK> <UNK> with my good friend <UNK> in late october 1978 halloween left me breathless speechless and downright scared everyone knows the story young michael myers decides to kill his sister on halloween 1963 he escapes a mental hospital 15 years later to return to <UNK> to wreck havoc once again he spots laurie jamie lee curtis a shy senior who enjoys <UNK> and begins stalking her her <UNK> friends across the street are killed one by one as michael sets his plot to get her ironically the young boy she tends on halloween is afraid of the <UNK> and can see him outside during the murder spree dr sam <UNK> donald <UNK> works hard to find michael before he <UNK> his fury he has no proof no evidence just a <UNK> he has to sell to sheriff <UNK> charles <UNK> as the plot unfolds you have a suspense driven movie instead of a cheap thrill scare alfred hitchcock once said you can have four men at a table playing cards and they don't know there is a bomb and it goes off that is a cheap thrill however put four men at a table who discover a bomb and discuss what to do about it then it doesn't go off then you have suspense director john carpenter takes that advice to the <UNK> in halloween the audience will see glimpses of him outside watching stalking his victims we gasp will he kill her when will he kill her then michael disappears carpenter also uses the suspense in <UNK> of special effects that usually highlight the gore this movie has little blood but still provides good scares one of the best scenes is michael <UNK> bob off the ground he <UNK> the knife back as it <UNK> off the <UNK> then he drives it all you hear is a loud <UNK> then the audience sees <UNK> feet drop <UNK> carpenter was the first to use a <UNK> point from the scene of the killer this also peaks our audience what will he do what's going on inside his mind finally carpenter's <UNK> masterful score adds to the tension moreover the <UNK> screen writing he did with debra hill gives us a story which develops characters we care about the teens are not party mad but merely going through the rebellious angst of teenage <UNK> finally there is some decent acting in this b low budget thriller nick castle who plays the shape michael adds something to the mindless killer it is cold <UNK> and without any <UNK> moreover the personality does everything the same way he kills only when trapped or to set up a trap he <UNK> the victims apart he also relies on <UNK> strength and that mask used a <UNK> william shatner mask gives an impression of something that has no soul or emotion while <UNK> is melodramatic in his deadpan monologues he comes across as someone scared desperate and determined it made me wonder if he represented <UNK> <UNK> attempt to explain evil the crown jewel though is jamie lee <UNK> debut she plays the laurie character as someone scared but also determined and strong who fights back the end is one that left me speechless this was the first concept of an <UNK> serial killer who could not be stopped movies like star wars have the advantage that it can be enjoyed numerous times halloween and other scary movies though do not have that advantage so if we could <UNK> our minds of the first time we see a movie to experience it again as fresh and new halloween would be the movie i would choose
<START> an illegal immigrant <UNK> the social support system causing dire consequences for many well filmed and acted even though the story is a bit forced yet the slow pacing really sets off the conclusion the feeling of being lost in the big city is effectively conveyed the little person lost in the big society is something to which we can all relate but i cannot <UNK> going out of your way to see this movie
<START> in answer to the person who made the comment about how the film drags on and who believed there was no purpose to the role of <UNK> brother here is my response br br the role of <UNK> brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story craig <UNK> norman could have <UNK> the troubles associated with living life to the full by looking at how <UNK> brother turned out there are various instances where brad pitt and his lives run in parallel for example when <UNK> brother takes craig <UNK> to a disjointed bar and subsequently he finds brad pitt there a few days later the dramatic irony was there so craig <UNK> character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film
<START> this film had a lot of promise and the plot was relatively interesting however the actors director and <UNK> seriously let this film down br br i feel bad for the writers it could have been good the acting is wooden very few of the characters are believable br br who ever edited this clearly just <UNK> some new edit techniques and wanted to <UNK> them all over the film there are lots of quick <UNK> edits in almost every scene which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying br br i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of <UNK> but alas no it left me feeling like i'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money
<START> this was the most <UNK> film when produced sir alexander <UNK> and h g wells were both <UNK> by its poor ratings for good reason it was and remains far ahead of its time aside from the seemingly poor direction probably editing at the very beginning the work moves along to a stunning conclusion br br whether its sir ralph <UNK> <UNK> role or even better his wife's sir <UNK> as <UNK> to space <UNK> raymond <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> center role all deliver mind <UNK> performances br br the scene with mr <UNK> <UNK> set of the small girl child running out to an absolutely <UNK> to be <UNK> scene commenting <UNK> just keeps getting <UNK> and <UNK> that <UNK> brings tears to any parent <UNK> this is not a film for the young unless <UNK> and rather those who have seen 'the <UNK> it <UNK> br br sure the <UNK> <UNK> looks hokey while using a <UNK> <UNK> now <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> may be viewed as ridiculous vs rockets give sir <UNK> a break mr wells made that choice and at 8 million this film went way beyond <UNK> <UNK> so he concentrated on what he could manage br br the true power of this greatest of cinema rests in <UNK> <UNK> final statement of human destiny his friend <UNK> doubts the wisdom of space <UNK> saying <UNK> such little animals ' john <UNK> proper response is <UNK> <UNK> little animals and if that is all we are we must live and die as such ' they are standing under a large <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> his hand over the night sky <UNK> we may have all the universe or nothing ' then the final chorus breaks in <UNK> shall it be ' this is not <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> anything you may consider <UNK> this is the real thing br br i remind all of steven <UNK> most recent address upon his latest <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> must leave earth or die ' the very core of this work i love <UNK> <UNK> yet this <UNK> for the wise viewer offers far more <UNK> shall it be ' be in the proper <UNK> whatever that takes this will take your breath away i <UNK> overall for humanity the most significant of cinema br br since <UNK> i note many have commented on the poor <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> examples in the 80's i developed a <UNK> <UNK> process which required a <UNK> original this led me to michael <UNK> who sadly noted all were gone so we must <UNK> what remains <UNK> but true '
<START> the first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least however it improved afterwards as the valentine party <UNK> apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie the scene at the garden with kate was well shot and so was the very last scene the <UNK> in those scenes there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty the way slashers should be edge to it the earlier murders are <UNK> devoid of gore
<START> pegg has had a few hits in the past few years starting with shaun of the dead in 2004 movie on to hot <UNK> 2007 early 2008 he came out with run fat boy run and now comes this how to lose friends and alienate people which is in many ways one of my favourite <UNK> of the year br br the film is about sidney <UNK> a man who writes a failing magazine who makes fun of <UNK> mostly because he is not one of them anyway one of the most successful magazine owners played by jeff bridges invites him out of nostalgia to work at his magazine sidney is of course excited and moves to america there he meets a girl currently writing a book and hilarity ensues br br this film is great and i hope more come out like it in the near future pegg has once again given people everywhere another good film and i cant wait to the see the third part of the blood and ice cream trilogy paul i rate this film <UNK>
<START> i read somewhere that when kay francis refused to take a cut in pay warner bros <UNK> by casting her in inferior projects for the remainder of her contract br br she decided to take the money but her career suffered <UNK> br br that might explain what she was doing in <UNK> over broadway though it doesn't explain why donald crisp and ian hunter are in it too ludicrous is the word that others have used for the plot of this film and that's right on target the murder trial her seedy vaudeville career her success in london her final scene with her daughter no part <UNK> leads to the next part br br also the sets and costumes looked like b movie stuff and her hair turner is showing lots and lots of her movies this month watch any other one and you'll be doing yourself a favor
<START> i understand this movie was made on a very low budget but that is no excuse for the monstrosity that is grendel deathstalker the throne of fire barbarian queen conquest the <UNK> barbarian were all done on <UNK> budgets and poor special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a good sense of humor the primitive costumes dark <UNK> and beautiful <UNK> landscape gave grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and <UNK> film but the makers completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely poor cgi effects and <UNK> characters compare this film to beowulf 1999 it may not be citizen kane but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget sci fi adventure movie can be made by using credible special effects and appealing characters
<START> the dialogue was pretty dreadful the plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents not visually stunning actually visually annoying at times most definitely one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button if you could watch it for free have absolutely no other <UNK> open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little <UNK> lady well maybe i'd recommend it to you but not anyone else i could think of at the moment
<START> is this your typical women in chains navy transport love story maybe hell you know how the formula works by now pretty woman is introduced in to a picture someone has to fall in love with her br br i think this film does follow some typical story lines but that doesn't say anything about the content there are great scenes with <UNK> glover dennis hopper and gary busey although short some things didn't make sense such as the need to get in to random fights but it is entertaining to watch the fights were actually well done br br this is definitely a comedy foremost but it does have a lot of good feel to it the humor is well balanced you won't hurt your stomach on this but you will keep a smile br br there is a little bit of steamy action so not one for the kids
<START> i saw this film premiere friday 1 19 night in park city for sundance and was incredibly moved sitting in a theater and hearing first hand the anguish soldiers go through was almost more than i could bear others in the audience were equally moved and while we wanted to turn away the least we could do was bear witness as these men and women shared their experience with us robert <UNK> paul <UNK> sean <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> all veterans of the war in iraq and featured in the film were present while they may be home now you can tell this war is still inside them and probably always will be whether you support the war or not it is our duty to support the troops with something other than a <UNK> <UNK> see this film
<START> for getting so many positive reviews this movie really disappointed me it is slow moving and long at times the story is not clear particularly in the <UNK> relationships among characters my advice read the book it's a fabulous story which loses it's impact on screen
<START> i rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable judge for yourself be warned the following will not only give away the plot but will also spoil your <UNK> for watching the movie br br a computer virus designed by a frustrated nerd sends out a code through television screens and computer <UNK> when the code in the form of light enters the eye it can access the <UNK> <UNK> of your body what it does is forcing the body cells into <UNK> of <UNK> within seconds after <UNK> the patient reaches for his neck develops tunnel vision his skin will turn white of the <UNK> after which he falls and his hand and <UNK> will crack in a cloud of <UNK> br br this virus is very intelligent when it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to <UNK> the code with a <UNK> <UNK> device <UNK> by hands the device is set on a very high <UNK> which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the <UNK> head the virus also senses <UNK> against remote controls and the keyboard of an <UNK> fortunately it could be stopped by throwing over outdated <UNK> <UNK> in a rack and <UNK> the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some <UNK> water br br oh dear
<START> i'm just quite disappointed with soul survivors it doesn't worth even a comment in this forum the script is very poor as well as all the acting and for our entertainment it features a pointless plot br br please do yourselves a favor be a real survivor don't waste your time in this piece of crap someday you'll thank me
<START> i stumbled on this late last night n tcm br br hadn't seen it since it came out originally but had never forgotten it br br i had completely forgotten how gorgeous and talented <UNK> <UNK> was when she was still young <UNK> for <UNK> winters before she <UNK> out br br ronald coleman though was the quintessential state actor of his time i had read othello in high school english and hated it after seeing a double life i read it again and finally understood what the play was about br br the gordon <UNK> writing team was at its peak when this script was done br br a movie well worth remembering and <UNK>
<START> this movie is awful i don't even know where to begin i'm speechless i can't even describe how awful this is the blood is <UNK> first of all and the acting is awful the only good part was the biker chick that saves the day this movie was <UNK> i don't see how it could even get a vote of 1 its so bad it looks like it was made by <UNK> students
<START> this movie has some things that are pretty amazing first it is supposed to be based on a true story that in itself is amazing that multiple <UNK> would hit the same town at night in the fall in <UNK> i wonder if the real town's name was close to <UNK> which is the town's name in the movie there is an <UNK> <UNK> but there is also a town that starts with <UNK> something br br it does show the <UNK> moving <UNK> on record in the the seen where the boys are in the house on the other hand the scene where the tv goes fuzzy is based in fact before <UNK> radar and weather radio we were taught that if you turned your tv to a particular channel not on cable and tuned the <UNK> just right you could tell if there was a <UNK> coming the problem was that by then you would be able to hear it br br since i know something about <UNK> <UNK> it made this movie fun for me i enjoy it more than <UNK> i mean give me a break there is no way you could make it through and <UNK> by <UNK> yourself to a <UNK> in a well house
<START> alan johnson don cheadle is a successful dentist who shares his practice with other business partners alan also has an loving wife <UNK> <UNK> smith and he has two daughter <UNK> <UNK> smith <UNK> <UNK> he also let his parents stay in his huge apartment in new york city but somehow he feels that his life is somewhat empty one ordinary day in the city he sees his old college roommate charlie <UNK> adam sandler which alan hasn't seen charlie in years when alan tries to befriends with charlie again charlie is a lonely depressed man who hides his true feelings from people who cares for him since charlie unexpectedly loses his family in a plane crash they were on one of the planes of september 11 2001 when alan nearly feels comfortable with charlie when alan mentions things of his past charlie turns violent towards alan or anyone who mentions his deceased family now alan tries to help charlie and tries to make his life a little easier for himself but alan finds out making charlie talking about his true feelings is more difficult than expected br br written and directed by mike <UNK> <UNK> indian summer the upside of anger made an wonderfully touching human drama that moments of sadness truth and comedy as well sandler offers an impressive dramatic performance which sandler offers more in his dramatic role than he did on paul thomas <UNK> punch drunk love cheadle is excellent as usual <UNK> smith is fine as <UNK> supportive wife <UNK> tyler is also good as the young psychiatrist and <UNK> <UNK> is quite good as the beautiful odd lonely woman who has a wild crush on alan this film was sadly an box office disappointment despite it had some great reviews the cast are first rate here the writing director is wonderful and russ t <UNK> terrific widescreen cinematography the movie has great nyc locations which the film makes new york a beautiful city to look at in the picture br br dvd has an sharp <UNK> widescreen 2 35 1 transfer and an good <UNK> digital 5 1 surround sound dvd also an jam session with sandler cheadle an <UNK> photo montage and previews i was expecting more for the dvd features like an audio commentary track by the director and deleted scenes reign over me is certainly one of the best films that came out this year i am sure this movie looked great in the big screen which sadly i haven't had a chance to see it in a theater but it is also the kind of movie that plays well on dvd the film has an good soundtrack as well and it has plenty of familiar faces in supporting roles and bit parts even the director has a bit part as <UNK> <UNK> who's an actor himself reign over me is one of the most underrated pictures of this year it is also the best sandler film in my taste since the wedding singer don't miss it <UNK> widescreen 1 2 out of
<START> by no means my favourite austen novel and paltrow is by no means my favourite actress but i found the film almost totally delightful paltrow does a good job and <UNK> stevenson and the one who plays <UNK> <UNK> are all absolutely terrific the period detail is not <UNK> the feel of the movie is just right in fact but the real <UNK> is jeremy northam as mr knightley there could not be more perfect casting imo i hated mr k in the novel but found him wonderfully human and <UNK> in the film <UNK> good looks and smiling eyes are no <UNK> to enjoyment either highly recommended <UNK>
<START> i have been watching horror movies since i was 5 years old beginning with <UNK> play since then i have seen good horror movies and bad but this is without question the dumbest movie i have ever seen the actors did all they could with the material the plot was just idiotic plus it was just all gore i can stomach a lot of blood but that was just ridiculous in one of the scenes a character gets stabbed in the rear end and <UNK> with his intestines plain stupid another problem with this movie is that its boring and probably the <UNK> movie ever made the end of it is just dumb but then again it goes with the rest of it at the end when the girl gets away from the cannibal <UNK> she receives help from a old lady the old lady is making tea but when she turns around to talk to the girl the girl attacks her she turned into a cannibal retarded movie
<START> i loved the original it was brilliant and always will be strangely though i actually looked forward to seeing the re make i'm usually a little bit against re makes because there's far too many of them but somehow this intrigued me i was really enjoying it to begin with caine brilliant as usual and jude law managing to hold is own next to him it was quite clever how it was <UNK> and it was working what stops this from being really good is the last seven minutes it goes completely away from the original so far in fact that is <UNK> to be clever and just gets annoying the end in the original was fantastic so much tension was built up and it was unbelievably clever this it grows not in tension but in frustration as it seemed they decided to make <UNK> character a homosexual it was if they were trying far to hard to be different and then bang <UNK> dead roll credits this film is worth the watch simply for the performances but those last seven minutes really do drag it down what a pity
<START> rant start i didn't want to believe them at first but i guess this is what people are talking about when they say south korean cinema has <UNK> and may even be going downhill after the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie <UNK> aka the host of 2006 which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a b movie genre <UNK> korean blockbusters have become more and more generic even though their budgets mainly spent on special effects have become more and more fantastic do south korean movie makers really want to <UNK> all the audience and <UNK> <UNK> which their industry has built up since the 1999 break out film <UNK> <UNK> by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like <UNK> china did rant end br br the only reason i can <UNK> for making this movie is to <UNK> the <UNK> into <UNK> the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a korean east asian <UNK> dragon i have seen to date for the final scenes now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the 1996 <UNK> the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of <UNK> animated dragons remember <UNK> dragons in 2000 hasn't anyone <UNK> that the trick is not how much special effects you use but how well you use it i hope there are more and better korean legends they can use because they have just killed a lot of international interest in korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one br br in short i agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how <UNK> felt about having their folk <UNK> <UNK> being played at the very end as a creature feature i would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it but i've seen many video games with better camera work and scripting just less dragons
<START> when i found out there was a movie that had both my favorite actresses meryl streep and <UNK> <UNK> i went through the roof but i had a hard fall after watching this lame movie and i still have the <UNK> first of all the character that jeremy <UNK> an actor i still admire even after this disappointment plays was just awful he treated his family like crap especially his sister played by glenn close i could not get close or sympathize with any of the characters and i'm no <UNK> but the sex scenes were really unnecessary or they could have been toned down <UNK> and <UNK> characters could have been developed a lot more and their romance could have been much more passionate and what was with <UNK> character and her mystical powers why didn't they go into this more this film had a lot of dead ends and the bottom line is that this is a really lousy movie and there was a lot of wasted talent here
<START> so on the chills network on cable they are having vampire month i'm such a <UNK> but i love vampires so after a few <UNK> that they showed i was pretty disappointed but then i noticed <UNK> was written by stephen king so i decided to go ahead and check it out well much to my surprise this movie was really bad most stephen king films are entertaining and some are very scary while <UNK> was bad it was a beautiful kind of bad i had a good time laughing at this movie and just taking it for what it was i've never read <UNK> from what i understand this is the only real vampire story by king so i can't really compare book to film i don't know if it was just my tv but <UNK> looked like it was made for tv the special effects were corny and the story was a bit far fetched even if it is fantasy it had a lot of problems br br charles brady and his mother mary are vampires who feed off the life force of virgin women they are considerably more <UNK> than humans and have powers of both <UNK> and illusion their one weakness is cats who are not only able to see through their <UNK> but whose <UNK> are capable of <UNK> severe to fatal wounds upon them they also maintain an incestuous relationship charles and mary have taken up <UNK> in a small indiana town charles <UNK> the local high school and there he meets <UNK> robertson in his creative writing class <UNK> does not suspect the real reason why charles wants her so much to take her life force for his mother who is starving at first it seems that charles has fallen in love with <UNK> on their first date however a <UNK> at the nearby cemetery charles attempts to drain the life force from <UNK> while kissing her as it happens deputy sheriff andy simpson who had earlier tried to pull charles over for <UNK> drives by the cemetery and notices <UNK> car when <UNK> runs to him for help charles tracks andy down and kills him when charles then turns to resume his life force <UNK> make out session with <UNK> the <UNK> cat <UNK> rises to the occasion and nearly kills charles by scratching him in the face and chest <UNK> wounded by <UNK> charles <UNK> back home to mary mary then seeks vengeance on <UNK> family br br so to sum this movie up basically you should expect the cheese to <UNK> the scene where charles attacks <UNK> for the first time is very cliché and you almost vote for charles to win just because <UNK> is one of the dumbest female leads in horror movies then you gotta love the scene where mary has a gun and shoots it at a cop car and somehow the whole thing explodes god bless hollywood explosions and <UNK> i'm taking the movie for what it is it's just so deliciously bad that it turns into a dark comedy for me that i could just enjoy making fun of i'm not sure if this is what stephen king wanted to see for his story but he does have his typical cameo in the film so my suggestion if you watch this movie just take it for what it is and don't over think it it's mindless entertainment with corny effects bad casting a silly story and enough cats to make the crazy cat lady from the <UNK> say wow that's a lot of cats br br 4 10
<START> i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies anyway everyone remembers the <UNK> titanic it was big fast and <UNK> until april <UNK> it was all over the news and one of the biggest <UNK> ever well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship well onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film br br so our two main characters are jack <UNK> <UNK> and rose kate <UNK> they're not annoying too much but watch this and you'll find out why they could become annoying http <UNK> com <UNK> the main villain i guess is bad luck fate hand of god no <UNK> intended or just plain <UNK> <UNK> billy zane combine all of the above and what do you get oh yes we get a love story on a sinking boat the supporting characters are the following my personal favorite mr andrews victor <UNK> <UNK> he was so nice <UNK> david warner <UNK> ewan stewart <UNK> jonathan phillips captain smith bernard hill molly brown kathy bates and many more we also got the present day treasure hunter <UNK> <UNK> bill paxton they add something to the story something good the action in here is awesome especially in the second half the drama as also good in the end you can have your eyes dropping <UNK> or silent tears the story is simple and it works a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond she calls and tells her tale on the <UNK> titanic two lovers separated by social class and ultimately the fate of the ship everything about the story works and there are very few flaws i give titanic an <UNK> awesome
<START> all of those who voted less than 5 are obviously not fans of clean tongue in cheek humor keaton is brilliant in this as in most of his work this is not a blockbuster bigger than life affair this is campy slapstick humor played out by some of hollywood's best and very versatile actors <UNK> was equally on the mark as the top dog <UNK> once br br if you want to see the funniest attempt at not really <UNK> ever filmed you gotta see <UNK> do his piece as <UNK> br br i gave it a 7
<START> pam <UNK> stars as <UNK> she's a nurse who seeks revenge on the drug dealers who got her sister hooked on bad heroine like any 70s <UNK> flick you can expect to see the racist bad guys get their just <UNK> br br there were scores of these films made during the 70s and they were really <UNK> to both black and white audiences alike this is mainly due to the vicious racial <UNK> in these films and the <UNK> stereotypical characters especially the female characters br br other common threads between <UNK> and other films of its type include brutal violence corrupt cops car chases a generous abundance of nudity and sex crazed gorgeous women not to mention urban <UNK> populated by drug dealers <UNK> <UNK> and other criminal <UNK> br br pam <UNK> was the <UNK> queen of 70s <UNK> <UNK> she was magnificent being both tough as nails and drop dead gorgeous like in her other films pam <UNK> the other characters in <UNK> in fact pam is so charismatic on screen that these sorts of films are unwatchable without her as the main character br br if you like pam <UNK> you're better off seeing her other films like <UNK> brown or perhaps friday foster these films have much less empty sleaze than <UNK> does <UNK> character in <UNK> <UNK> herself way too much to get the bad guys <UNK> characters in her other <UNK> films don't <UNK> as low to get revenge as <UNK> did br br i'd say only watch <UNK> if you're unable to see any of pam <UNK> other films otherwise <UNK> is a waste of time only <UNK> talent as an actress makes viewing <UNK> bearable
<START> watching this movie l thought to myself what a lot of garbage these girls must have rocks for brains for even <UNK> to be part of it waste of time watching it faint heavens l only hired it the acting was below standard and story was unbearable anyone <UNK> watching this film please save your money the film has no credit at all l am a real film buff and this is worse than attack of the green tomatoes br br l only hope that this piece of trash didn't cost too much to make money would have been better spent on the homeless people of the world l only hope there isn't a sequel in the <UNK>
<START> the only notable thing about this film is that it was steve <UNK> first big starring role br br <UNK> talent is undeveloped and raw but <UNK> honest in this campy little sci fi horror piece steve shows himself as the anti establishment hot rod car loving actor who would become a polished icon of the film industry just five years hence br br later on mcqueen would say he hated this film and that he was the blob but everyone has to start somewhere and the blob is cute fresh and innocent would that we all had stayed that way br br the plot is fast paced and although predictable still an entertaining hour or so and it's really fun to see steve mcqueen before he became the king of <UNK> and anita <UNK> before she became andy <UNK> girlfriend a close friend sent me the dvd a while back and it's a <UNK> addition to my steve mcqueen film collection
<START> spoilers br br in the words of jean paul <UNK> hell is other people in the odd couple jack lemmon and walter matthau demonstrate just how accurate this can be as felix <UNK> and oscar madison lemmon and matthau respectively create two good friends who decide to live together as the two begin to slowly grow more and more frustrated with each other the laughs come thick and fast before felix <UNK> leaving oscar a changed and more <UNK> individual br br jack lemmon as <UNK> is absolutely superb as the neurotic cleaning obsessed <UNK> <UNK> with life as a single man walter matthau in contrast to <UNK> character is equally as good as the <UNK> sports writer who simply wants to play poker to earn money for his child benefits br br lemmon and matthau are <UNK> in their selected parts to some degree <UNK> upon the beautiful script by neil simon and simultaneously because they work well as a team as two friends who are <UNK> different in <UNK> although similar in relationships with ex wives and children these two late great actors create a <UNK> which is practically impossible to recreate so great in fact that the world screamed out so much for something similar that two years before <UNK> death and three before <UNK> the characters were reunited in an inferior sequel this idea whilst following hollywood's irritating obsession with sequels might have worked to a certain degree but at the same time it could never come close to <UNK> the genius of this original film br br ultimately it's not really possible to say anything else with simon's amazing script filled with humour and laughter the creators of this film were already onto a hit the casting of jack lemmon and walter matthau as felix <UNK> and oscar madison though is the most important part of this film the odd couple with it's traditional soundtrack which even gained a tribute in the simpsons it's excellent script and it's genius leading men is a tribute to cinema and a feature for history to remember
<START> i like peter sellers most of the time i had never seen him portray an upper class brit until this movie he pulls it off pretty well although you see bits of inspector <UNK> in the mix it doesn't get interesting until goldie hawn arrives br br i never expected the youthful hawn to deliver such a solid performance her timing was great and her expressions were priceless the way she alternately shoots sellers <UNK> character down and <UNK> him is beautiful to watch verbal <UNK> like i've seldom seen from a movie of that era br br the last thirty minutes of the movie does fall flat it is worth the let down just to see the first sixty hawn is nude for a few glorious seconds early on enjoy it
<START> i consider myself a bit of a <UNK> of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that <UNK> me from calling gentleman jim the best boxing movie ever made that is the robert wise paul newman flick somebody up there likes me that movie might be number 1 but gentleman jim is a close number 2 br br the movie doesn't just <UNK> the rise of james j corbett it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition in the late <UNK> boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare <UNK> rules to the more <UNK> days of the <UNK> marquis of <UNK> rules and the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and <UNK> br br gentleman jim is not a realistic look at those days it is <UNK> and yes even a bit hokey at times but always delightfully so errol flynn is perfect as the gentleman jim who really isn't a gentleman at all but merely a fast <UNK> from a working class family <UNK> smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a love hate relationship and we all know it is of course love that will win that match in the end br br at the end of gentleman jim the great john l sullivan whose famous line was not i can <UNK> any man in the world of course <UNK> again hands over his belt to corbett this is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made realistic no but wonderful hey if you want realism watch raging bull instead that is a much more realistic boxing movie but gentleman jim is a lot more fun
<START> like some of the other folks who have reviewed this film i was also <UNK> nostalgic about it before i had the misfortune to actually watch it again alas my childhood memories of this film were completely <UNK> and the <UNK> of pauline is now revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal racist and plain boring film making even the presence of old pros edward everett <UNK> and terry thomas can't overcome a <UNK> screenplay a horrible theme song and some wretched <UNK> <UNK> in addition the stereotypical depictions of african and arab characters make for painful viewing especially considering this was produced in the immediate wake of the civil rights movement michael <UNK> original <UNK> <UNK> reports that the <UNK> of pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical release judging from the results that is a completely believable and <UNK> scenario
<START> i was very impressed with this small <UNK> made picture the story about a pair of social <UNK> who meet become friends and provide each other with a support system both seemed to lack as children is at times hilarious at times sad but always provocative music mostly by underground bands was used to great effect as was the <UNK> with camera angles <UNK> and slow or fast motion techniques the performances the leads are played by the writers and directors of the film are some of the best i've seen in the last couple of years if you ever felt like a square <UNK> being forced into a round <UNK> i really believe you'll appreciate by hook or by crook
<START> this trashy b movie attempts to <UNK> as a study of sexual addiction but it is really a poor excuse for a <UNK> flick the story revolves around sammy horn subtle name played by michael des <UNK> sammy is a restaurant owner with a clueless wife grace <UNK> arquette and a young child he has a sexual addiction and must have meaningless sex every five minutes with any woman in his field of vision who will agree and of course every woman on the planet finds him irresistible despite the fact that he looks old enough to be collecting social security br br the story is centered on a conversation with his <UNK> <UNK> kinski where he is describing each of his sexual exploits via flashback this is nothing more than a convenient <UNK> point for a parade of serial sex acts which <UNK> at least 75 of the screen time br br it is hard to know where to begin <UNK> a film this bad the production values are abysmal the movie is shot on video with a look somewhere between a tv soap opera at best and an amateur porn flick shot in someone's garage the direction by joseph <UNK> is horrible with bad lighting uninspired framing and poor actor direction the script is vapid and the dialogue mindless and vulgar br br women are generally portrayed as sex obsessed <UNK> just waiting for an addict like sammy to come along and rough them up while feeding their <UNK> <UNK> with some <UNK> <UNK> as an example <UNK> sister comes over to <UNK> inform sammy that she knows he's been sleeping around and that she is going to tell his wife his response to that is to throw her up against the wall and begin <UNK> her about three seconds into it she has an <UNK> and is instantly converted to one of his sex <UNK> begging him to give her more just as they finish grace walks in and <UNK> says to her oh great to see you gotta run to pick up <UNK> and <UNK> the word about <UNK> <UNK> the bond of loyalty has been sealed with a good <UNK> no spoiler here because it is so typical of the obvious nature of the film that anyone who had seen the first fifteen minutes could have predicted it br br the sex depictions are all overdone mechanical and so poorly <UNK> that they are more comical than erotic most of them are done with both participants fully <UNK> the acting is wretched michael des <UNK> presents all the depth of a rain <UNK> he really seems to get into the <UNK> and profanity of the sex parts but when it comes to actually acting with arquette and kinski he is <UNK> <UNK> arquette is the closest thing to an actor in this film giving a bearable performance and looking genuinely hurt when she finally discovers that her perfect husband is a <UNK> animal <UNK> kinski is far too compassionate as the <UNK> but at least we have some acting happening here the rest of the cast is just a collection of <UNK> body <UNK> to whom they give thought provoking lines like hit me harder is that the best you can do ' and oh <UNK> br br this movie is among the worst i have ever seen a dubious distinction given the thousands of films i have viewed i have given it the extremely rare <UNK> of rating it 1 10 not to be seen within three hours of any meal
<START> joseph h lewis was one of the finest directors of film noir this is surely his best br br it doesn't have some of the standard features of what we now call film noir though american made it is set entirely in england it lacks gangsters it lacks a femme fatale it does not lack crime br br the title character answers an ad she is <UNK> that she'll be making some money as a secretary instead she wakes up days later as the <UNK> in a frightening plot only a very strong person could survive such a <UNK> unsettling ordeal and nina <UNK> gives the sense of a strong woman as julia br br part of the excitement comes from casting against type ms <UNK> has an elegant manner she is no screaming <UNK> victim she is actually a bit icy and <UNK> albeit <UNK> this makes her character's plight all the more believable br br surely the single most fascinating element is the casting of dame may witty she was and is probably most famous for the charming title character in the lady <UNK> she has a sweet manner and a harmless slightly <UNK> manner but here she is far from a heroine br br george <UNK> is excellent as her extremely troubled son the whole cast in fact is superb br br it seems that this famous and brilliant movie was made almost by accident undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he was doing but he did it on a low budget that is the thrill and charm of film noir the real film noir it is small convincingly <UNK> and in this case unforgettable
<START> stoic and <UNK> soldier sergeant todd a fine and credible performance by the ever reliable kurt russell gets dumped on a desolate remote planet after he's deemed <UNK> by ruthless and arrogant colonel <UNK> deliciously played to the slimy <UNK> by jason <UNK> who has todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced breed of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> todd joins a peaceful <UNK> community of self <UNK> <UNK> and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise director paul w s anderson working from a smart and provocative script by david <UNK> peoples depicts a chilling vision of a bleak cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough gritty tone throughout moreover anderson handles moving moments of humanity well <UNK> struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is genuinely poignant and stages the stirring action scenes with rip roaring gusto russell gives a strong and impressive almost <UNK> portrayal of todd he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions bang up supporting turns by jason scott lee as <UNK> rival soldier caine <UNK> connie <UNK> as the compassionate sandra sean pertwee as the kindly <UNK> jared and taylor <UNK> as mute little boy nathan gary busey as <UNK> seasoned veteran captain church michael <UNK> as the jolly johnny pig and brenda <UNK> as the sensible mayor <UNK> better still this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of being a <UNK> soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might david <UNK> polished cinematography joel <UNK> rousing full bore <UNK> score and the first rate rate special effects all further enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction action hybrid outing
<START> two houses one street one phone booth one car a girl next door a boy next door and a zombie this list of ingredients should suffice for a great horror movie all you need is some blue light <UNK> music and done not in the hands of dutch director van <UNK> though br br i like to <UNK> bad movie <UNK> from time to time the concept is really simple get some booze get some film loving friends and <UNK> yourself in the worst cinema can offer for such an evening this peace of filth is one of the best laughs guaranteed br br the bizarre thing is van <UNK> is still defending her film as if it were a great achievement to be a witness to this you'll have to listen to the dvd's commentary track again <UNK> and laughs guaranteed
<START> the opening <UNK> left me <UNK> with delight at their <UNK> the altered version of the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> the way the camera pans over the <UNK> it's strange to think that it's a wonderful <UNK> came out in the same year no great coincidence the 1940s was <UNK> with heaven and earth films but the glowing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> angels of the competition look <UNK> something best passed over in silence when placed next to alfred <UNK> vision br br it continues to look great all the way through as more and more striking ideas are <UNK> upon us i'm not a great fan of mixing colour with black and white in general one of the two visual schemes almost always looks ugly when placed next to the other not so here powell <UNK> colour into <UNK> and <UNK> into colour as if it's the most natural thing in the world a mere change of <UNK> both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their own br br as for the story this may be <UNK> best script or at least it would have been had the conclusion been a more logical outcome of <UNK> events other than that it's tight yet with more going on than i can possibly <UNK> to here was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary or both perhaps carter <UNK> up a fantasy that was as it so happened true everyone says we're meant to neither ask nor answer this question but i don't see why i'm sure we are meant to ask the question the film even gives us clues as to what the answer is indeed the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions the fact that other things ought to <UNK> our attention as well doesn't mean that this shouldn't <UNK> us as well there is as i've said before a lot going on br br consider the scene in which abraham <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lawyer plays a radio broadcast of a <UNK> match and <UNK> says the voice of england 1945 ' dr reeves the <UNK> <UNK> the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment and then produces one of his own a blues song from america which <UNK> <UNK> to as though he's got a <UNK> in his mouth reeves looks smug br br <UNK> well i don't see why it's <UNK> to <UNK> blues music and that's not what powell and <UNK> are doing anyway as the song is being played we get a shot of the american soldiers listening to it several of them nod their heads to the rhythm perfectly at home they don't find it incomprehensible there's something valuable about the song and neither reeves nor <UNK> knows what it is reeves probably realises as much all english audiences and all australian indian etc audiences as well know without being told that there is something of value in the <UNK> broadcast too and that while reeves understands that he is unable to explain it to <UNK> hence the blues broadcast which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else it's a clever scene br br one last thing i found david niven a bit cold without the charisma he would <UNK> later in his career but even so i don't think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began as this one did
<START> this movie is so great its set back in probably the 40's and meg <UNK> character struggles to be known as <UNK> ' plus tim robbins is so cute in this movie and everything about it has a magical feeling towards it <UNK> i watch it i feel happy it's definitely a girl movie and i'm a girl so i like it i also love the music the <UNK> is awesome but besides that i think it's a cute story and everyone should watch it
<START> marlon brando had long since lost interest in acting when he made this film his performance as the <UNK> is the worst of his career and that is precisely what he intended it to be he doesn't <UNK> instead he simply acts in a bizarre fashion and <UNK> fun at his embarrassingly <UNK> <UNK> the scene where brando climbs over the toilet <UNK> is probably the worst funniest moment in the history of cinema as we witness him fall head first into a toilet it is hard to believe that we are watching the same actor who starred in a <UNK> named desire on the <UNK> and the godfather br br i guess the real question is why marlon <UNK> like this in his later years was he sick of the movie business did he just like making a complete and utter fool out of himself i guess we'll never know but this film serves as a fascinating study as to what bad acting is all about br br on that note watch fellow acting veteran donald sutherland as he struggles to deliver his lines embarrassed at himself for <UNK> to participate in this travesty
<START> so i know that i voted 1 out of 10 but really this deserves no more than half of a star i hated it it was so stupid and unrealistic i can't believe any of the stars signed on to make this ridiculously absurd project br br james g and <UNK> o'hara were excellent in their characters and ben affleck and christina <UNK> were just as good too but the story sucked and i encourage anyone who sees this in the video store to not even bother picking it up and reading the back cover but to just walk away i don't even want to get into what the movie is about because it is too stupid to <UNK> about br br don't rent this it's horrible horrible
<START> i'm disappointed at the lack of <UNK> on this surprising and effective little film <UNK> <UNK> probably best known for his role as diego in ted <UNK> blow writes directs and stars br br i won't give away any plot points as the movie at least for me was very exciting having not known anything about it if you have a netflix account or have access to a video store that would carry it i highly recommend it it's a crazy fun and sometimes very thought provoking creation br br <UNK> direction is quite impressive and shows a lot of promise br br unpredictable with amazing imagery and a great lead performance spoken in beautiful spanish no <UNK> <UNK> god is on air is an amazing film you can show off to your friends br br see it
<START> first of all i have to start this comment by saying i'm a huge nightmare on elm street fan i think it's the greatest horror series ever for me freddy is the boogeyman of course freddy's dead which tried to be the last chapter back then is a weird movie it doesn't have the same atmosphere than the previous films freddy has a lot of screen time some think it makes him less scary which i do agree and that's in my opinion exactly the point this movie exists so we can know freddy a little better who he is who he were how he became the man haunting our dreams for some people it's a bad thing it's better if we never know because it's scarier not to know why evil is evil obviously those people won't like rob <UNK> remake of halloween to truly enjoy this one you have to see things differently it's not about a strange guy hiding in the bush of your <UNK> waiting to scare the hell out of you this was the first one and it was awesome as the years passed by freddy killed more and more people and nobody could ever get rid of him for good now it's time to learn about the nature of this evil the psychological aspects of freddy's realm of terror beside the story of freddy's past i also really liked the atmosphere of the movie no more kids in <UNK> only crazy grown ups the nightmare scenes are all great the soundtrack is awesome especially the opening song called <UNK> awake <UNK> performed by goo goo dolls in my opinion the final nightmare is a horror masterpiece and i can't believe it's so underrated maybe it is misunderstood or i have different tastes anyway all freddy fans should watch it it has a lot of scary moments as well as funny moments too and a lot of cameos get yourself ready for something different and you might not be disappointed
<START> basically this is an overlong unfunny action comedy first of all i'd like to say that i did enjoy the wayans brother scary movie 1 and the sequel had it's moments unfortunately white chicks doesn't even deliver half the laughs br br the humour in it is absolutely crude if you like <UNK> <UNK> stupid <UNK> you should probably look at this when it isn't crude it's idiotic the first 10 minutes of the film gave everything away to me totally unfunny simply idiotic br br however i watched the whole thing since i was with a friend otherwise i wouldn't have bothered the story is undeniably thin it was in scary movie too but there at least the laughs were quick and constant i think this is probably one of the main problems too with this film the laughs don't come quick enough some jokes are dragged out too long when they're more disgusting than funny in the first place if you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells then just avoid this if you want a silly comedy with more laughs then look at scary movie airplane <UNK> 1 2 br br 1 10 completely unfunny thin storyline a film that seems to be based on one idea i e what if we dressed up as white chicks for a film but simply didn't have enough material
<START> sorry fulci fans but i could not get through this one the soundtrack was about as annoying as they come the acting was <UNK> the story has been done and done and the direction was non existent br br massacre honestly looked like a children's film project but i've seen some of those and they actually look better than this did it appears to have been so <UNK> they couldn't afford anything not a <UNK> not a director no one who even remotely had a clue what acting was it was a very poor cinematic experience one of my worst br br this was about the worst suck fest i've seen next to terror <UNK> which is second only to killer <UNK> from outer space i've nothing else to say about it br br it rates a 0 1 10 from br br the fiend
<START> the only reason i knew of midnight cowboy was because it was in the <UNK> <UNK> top 100 for a top 100 it is not a very well known movie indeed i had to look hard to find a copy i got the dvd version for about half price surprisingly it was only rated <UNK> the uncut version br br i doubt many will take notice of this review more like comment so i'll make it brief br br this is perhaps one of the strangest movies i've seen partly because of the use of montages artistic filming very art house and the unusual theme there are many things in the film i still don't understand i've seen it twice and it makes for an emotionally confusing film br br the filming and acting were very good and it is the larger than life characters which make this film memorable the main character is joe buck a <UNK> from texas who moves to new york to become a male prostitute he meets the crippled <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rizzo and of course they become friends going through the usual <UNK> what makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different br br i felt the film didn't really develop the relationship between buck and <UNK> rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection although the ending is certainly quite sad and tragic you probably already know what happens by reading the reviews but its pretty obvious from the start br br i personally think the film beautifully and <UNK> explores its main themes the <UNK> of humanity shown by the darkness of the city streets the breaking down <UNK> most of the characters in the film exist beyond the law a <UNK> <UNK> etc yet you can't help liking them joe buck is endearing because he is so naive and optimistic while we begin to feel pity for ratso later in the film br br i think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very ground breaking for its period at the time and even now it was definitely not a typical movie quite art house at a time when the cinema was dominated by tired westerns musicals and dramas a film with such an unusual theme as midnight cowboy pops up br br on a personal level i must say i quite liked the film the imagery conveyed a dream like quality i particularly liked the scene at the party the music images etc stay in your mind for a long time after watching however as a movie for <UNK> sake it was a bit lacking not really my style of movie in thrills this is a film to be <UNK> and appreciated rather than a cheap thrills action flick br br although i would hardly consider myself <UNK> to <UNK> this film the characters and their motives were quite interesting from what i understand from the flashbacks joe buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother although it still doesn't seem to be relevant to the story he is a happy go lucky young stud who <UNK> his darker memories the religious <UNK> in the film are also puzzling some have suggested a homosexual connection between buck and ratso although i fail to see where they have got the idea from the theme of <UNK> sexuality in general is more than touched upon in their conversation and later in joe <UNK> encounter with a lonely old man but it has little to do with the main story br br certainly from a technical point of view one of the finest films of the decade it has more of a 70s feel to it than a 60s feel and revolutionary for its time touching on subjects few other films <UNK> to do while it has a simple sentimental story to it disguised by a hard edge the beauty of the film is in the strange often psychedelic sequences
<START> i saw this on the big screen and was <UNK> with it the period of queen victoria's younger years are a mystery and this is a perfect description of how a young girl was <UNK> into one of the highest roles in the world br br the script is perfect the acting is amazing the history and attention to detail is out of this world emily blunt is perfect as victoria funny how her mother is played by elizabeth the 1st and william iv is played by prince albert think <UNK> br br this portrayal of victoria shows that she was a rebellious young woman once i'm sure she would have been on <UNK> kyle show if it had been around then my mother and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life br br a perfect piece of a major part of british and <UNK> history
<START> sorry did i miss something did i walk out early the first ten minutes of unusual and untrue stories had me thinking this is going to be a classic but it was all down hill from there the acting was brilliant for what it's worth william h macy is fantastic and just gets better and better every film i watch him in but it never seemed to connect i was waiting for the big moment where all the stories inter connect and then suddenly it <UNK> frog it was if the writer said i've gone to deep how can i pull all these stories together <UNK> oh <UNK> it i'll just have it <UNK> <UNK> i like clever movies i like strange movies but this was just odd and boring 4 10
<START> this very funny british comedy shows what might happen if a section of london in this case <UNK> were to <UNK> itself independent from the rest of the uk and its laws <UNK> post war <UNK> merry mayhem is what would happen br br the explosion of a wartime bomb leads to the discovery of ancient documents which show that <UNK> was <UNK> to the <UNK> of <UNK> centuries ago a small historical <UNK> long since forgotten to the new <UNK> however this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please free from any <UNK> from <UNK> br br stanley <UNK> is excellent as the minor city politician who suddenly finds himself leading one of the world's <UNK> nations dame margaret <UNK> is a delight as the history professor who sides with <UNK> others in the stand out cast include <UNK> <UNK> paul <UNK> <UNK> wayne basil <UNK> sir michael <UNK> br br welcome to <UNK>
<START> a frank <UNK> wonders of life film br br keeping the blood <UNK> through our <UNK> is the responsibility of <UNK> <UNK> the magnificent br br in the mid 1950's at t and bell science teamed with famed hollywood director frank <UNK> to produce a series of cbs television science films to <UNK> the public about the universe around them a far cry from the dreary black white fodder so often <UNK> off on young <UNK> the <UNK> films would both <UNK> and entertain with lively scripts and eye catching visuals shown in technicolor the four films our mr sun 1956 the strange case of the <UNK> <UNK> 1957 <UNK> the magnificent 1957 the <UNK> <UNK> 1958 quickly became <UNK> favorites where they were endlessly shown in <UNK> format br br the star of the series was dr frank c <UNK> <UNK> 1982 an <UNK> english professor at the university of southern california this <UNK> <UNK> proved to be the perfect film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to his audience the sometimes complex facts in a manner which never made them seem dull or boring dr <UNK> who won a <UNK> award for his achievements continued making high quality <UNK> films after the <UNK> <UNK> were <UNK> br br <UNK> the magnificent which was produced written directed by <UNK> relates the story of the human heart and blood <UNK> system using animation and gentle humor film star richard <UNK> appears as the fiction writer <UNK> helping dr <UNK> tell <UNK> tale br br movie <UNK> will recognize sterling <UNK> as part of the tv production crew and the voices of marvin miller mel <UNK> june <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as various cartoon characters all uncredited br br the <UNK> <UNK> which begins the film is completely in tune with the <UNK> tone of the production
<START> this movie shows how racist john <UNK> is he portrays whites and other races that are not black as the evil that exists in our educational system how quick he forgets that it is this same educational system that made him what he is and failed at it ice <UNK> character is the epitome of an <UNK> black man that was responsible for most of the violence in this film <UNK> barely touched on the relationships between the white and black characters that were trying to reach out to each other when omar <UNK> says i need to be with my people that racist remark spoke volume and john don't think for a minute that the picture of thomas <UNK> in the tower <UNK> did not get my attention nice touch
<START> <UNK> run is an entertaining b movie with gary busey it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right to gary busey plays <UNK> smith a tough <UNK> who is framed for the assassination of a powerful cuban crime lord now on the run <UNK> must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by steve bauer scarface and action star jeff <UNK> the expert what i liked about <UNK> run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax gary busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and steve bauer is good as <UNK> sidekick even jeff <UNK> makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of <UNK> run is an enjoyable effort from <UNK> image films and i give it 7 out of 10
<START> i can not quite understand why any of the reviewers gave this documentary 0 other than for political reasons no the film did not investigate both sides of the story but then surely one film in favour of chavez against the <UNK> of propaganda against him should be seen as an attempt to balance out the narrative overall especially given a the history of cia involvement in latin america in <UNK> civil <UNK> <UNK> national security archive and b the coverage in that country and elsewhere of the clearly <UNK> scenes of chavez supporters shooting non existent opponents what is most amazing about this film is the fact that the film makers stayed in the presidential palace all of the way though the coup surely a first in documentary making images of a coup from both sides
<START> first off i would just like to say what a big fan of bette <UNK> i am stella is a very good movie with a wonderful cast bette midler john goodman <UNK> <UNK> stephen collins <UNK> mason this is one of my favorite films of all time it deals with a mother raising a child on her own she goes through a lot of things that are out of her way to bring up her daughter jenny played wonderfully by <UNK> <UNK> this movie is very good and i suggest that you pick up a copy to watch it roger ebert gave is 3 1 2 stars and it deserved 4 wonderful i give it 4 out of 4
<START> this film is about the unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with down syndrome br br the character development in this film is excellent we get to believe that harry is a businessman who <UNK> his family and georges is an innocent man who <UNK> loving and care from the normal society acting is excellent and the cannes best actor award is well deserved br br the fantasy scenes in the film highlights the fact that georges misery towards his <UNK> by his family and his desire to be treated like a normal person the song that gets played repeatedly also <UNK> this message the film shows that people who are mentally handicapped are good natured we have been treating them with <UNK> and neglect a fact that is <UNK> by the scene where georges gives a present to the waitress in the kitchen if we get to understand and share these people's world both we and the mentally handicapped can become very happy br br i was so drawn into the film and the characters' emotional experiences it is a touching film for good natured souls
<START> while urban cowboy did not <UNK> with the same <UNK> you might find at a <UNK> it did provide an accurate glimpse of that day and age in urban texas i also think that to truly critique this movie one would have to have lived in the time and relative place that it was made there was good music fun times and yes a few rough and <UNK> at the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the relationship of bud and sissy like two ships passing in the night was well conceived when pam <UNK> up the note that sissy had written to bud it <UNK> the tragedy of many true life romances the entire story was well thought out i thought the cast and crew did an excellent job i thought the screen play was well written and directed scott glenn should have received an oscar for best supporting actor
<START> thank god abc picked this up instead of fox the best description for those in the know is really <UNK> meets dead like me in the best way possible br br i'm not sure whether an experience with death and destiny early in life makes me a fan of brian fuller but i certainly enjoy his productions i also enjoy <UNK> floors <UNK> talking toys <UNK> and other mischievous items while a bit <UNK> i certainly think this enjoys its own <UNK> that doesn't require j <UNK> or <UNK> carter to be a wonderfully imaginative <UNK> here we can find the <UNK> and <UNK> of childhood and <UNK> crashing into each and actually making sense and making us want to live life to the <UNK>
<START> too bad i really like <UNK> <UNK> and gary busey but the director failed to put this together there's a lot of action a lot of promise but it all comes off hokey the director didn't do his job promising action comes off lame so much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film this version of the rage <UNK> credits it as 1996 simply isn't worth the time to watch it another director would have done a better job
<START> by the time this film was released i had seen chorus line on stage 4 times and had been <UNK> most eagerly the long <UNK> production of a film of the story my wife and i were in line hours before the box office opened on the day the film was released it was not just a disappointment it was a kick in the <UNK> br br first the story was moved outside so to speak by including scenes not in the confines of the theater those confines are a large portion of the meaning and impact of the story br br second third together <UNK> your own order one of the original songs with very dynamic dance number was removed a song which was not in the stage production was added say what i'm confused br br the only reason i gave this film 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers i've now seen chorus line on stage 6 times and wouldn't mind seeing it 6 more times before i die it is superbly written with wonderful music and heart <UNK> true stories if you want to see a musical which includes a great cattle call audition i recommend all that jazz if you want to see the story of a chorus line see it on stage
<START> what can i say about this film that <UNK> already been said well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the <UNK> and the kicks how charlie sheen though this was real i dont know im sure they would be hitting and kicking her alot harder if it was however the scenes with the <UNK> and the hot oil look very real and the final <UNK> in the eye scene is amazingly done and is <UNK> the only thing on film that has ever shocked me
<START> david <UNK> peoples meets paul anderson if it already sounds weird to you then you are right because it is br br peoples is known for his scripts with moral <UNK> of what is right and wrong the value of life etc he covered these issues in <UNK> <UNK> and pretty much in all of his screenplays there is something along those lines br br paul <UNK> first successful movie was a violent thriller not surprisingly so have all of his other movies and here is a violent thriller with moral <UNK> br br <UNK> script is quite apparent in the first half of the movie soldiers trained from birth taught to kill and never had a normal life they are replaced by better <UNK> <UNK> soldiers and todd one of the original soldiers is left on a planet and left for dead there he must cope with a group of <UNK> some want him to stay others hate him and there is an interesting drama here but then br br the bullets start to fly as the new soldiers move onto the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people big violent loud action ensues and <UNK> script turns into an anderson action fest it is hard to believe that the script was originally written that way but the end product is better then i expected entertaining somewhat though admittedly not very thought provoking and exciting once the action starts 7 10 br br rated r a lot of violence
<START> i enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of china in the 1930s in this beautiful film the story is simple an older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children the faces of the actors are marvelous to see the story reveals the devotion and <UNK> of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well the operas in the film remind me of farewell my <UNK> which was more sophisticated and intricate the story here reminds me of a dickens tale of days when children were almost <UNK> the plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the <UNK> humanity and history portrayed
<START> this movie reminded me that some old black white movies are definitely worth the look br br initially i had some <UNK> however from the beginning of the movie until the end i was captivated i was very impressed with the mixture of drama suspense comedy br br arthur <UNK> tommy <UNK> is hilarious and had me in <UNK> the whole time br br definitely add this movie to your movie night for some light relief from the sometimes depressing and too powerful or overly funny movies of today
<START> unfortunately this has been showing on star movies here in thailand for the last week or so it's complete rubbish acting as another member said this movie is a good example of <UNK> not to act ' i haven't seen a movie so poorly acted in a long time the actors can you call them <UNK> are completely flat and deliver their lines with the passion of a dead dog i would say that in order to truly understand how bad the acting is you would have to see the movie but that would be akin to torture br br i cringe as the leading lady delivers her lines and the rest of the cast with their accents fake or contrived is equally <UNK> another actress with the fake british accent was pretty yes but good lord was her accent terrible mix that with her lack of acting and you have a disaster she should just have said nothing and i could have accepted her as the pretty girl oh my we just got to the scene where the leading <UNK> lover says really me after a forced crying scene from her laughable no really i just laughed out loud br br the sets and the art directors offer some saving grace to the film some of the sets are colorful and some of the scenes are rather nice minus the actors br br the old magic <UNK> lady what another member mentioned the <UNK> love song that was in the movie totally inappropriate for a period piece set some 500 years ago br br i understand the movie was considered <UNK> <UNK> in thailand at the time of it's production i would be seriously upset if i were the producer of this movie just goes to show that money does not necessarily make a good or even mediocre film br br i would give the king maker a 1 out of 10 but the costumes and sets make save the film from such a rating 2 out of 10
<START> one of the things that interested me most about this film is the way the characters and their associated <UNK> are developed on the fly i suppose the writers wanted us to gain interest in the characters by not force feeding their characters the premise of using the art and craft of furniture design and construction was a unique theme and or <UNK> for what families siblings go through in life the complexity of having a twin serve as a surrogate father and even husband added great tension towards making this film emotionally interesting also although the story was not one that the masses might directly relate to i e jewish twins family business the themes are fairly universal as every family has a black sheep in it that made it very engaging
<START> unfortunately one of the best efforts yet made in the area of special effects has been made completely pointless by being placed alongside a <UNK> silly and equally pointless plot and an <UNK> clichéd screenplay hollow man is a rather useless film br br practically everything seen here has been done to death the characters the idea and the action sequences especially the lift <UNK> with the only genuinely intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects however it is just the same special effect done over and over again and by the end of the film that has been done to death also i was hoping before watching hollow man that the invisible man theme which is hardly original in itself would be the basis of something newer and more interesting this is not so it isn't long before the film turns into an overly familiar blood bath and mass of <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of clichés <UNK> up so fast that it's almost impressive br br on top of all this kevin bacon does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast are hardly trying their best good points might be a passable jerry <UNK> score but no competition for his better efforts a quite interesting use of <UNK> imagery and the special effects i was tempted to give this film three out of ten but the effects push hollow man's merit up one notch br br 4 10
<START> this movie was almost <UNK> to sit through i can get beyond the fact that it looks like it was shot with a home video camera and that this movie is supposed to span over weeks in time yet the characters do not once change outfits but the acting broke the 4th wall to pieces for me i've seen better acting in a 4th grade play aside from that the plot is unrealistic if the man suspected the guy he would have turned him in i was also heavily disappointed that all the killings were done with a gun what kind of gore is that that is not a <UNK> the zodiac did not kill using just a gun the authorities would have known it wasn't him another thing that really bothered me was that they called <UNK> identity disorder <UNK> 4 when that is the name of the book used to <UNK> people with mental <UNK> not the name of the disorder overall i think this movie is not the kind of movie that could be done with a low budget at least not as low as they had or they could have made sure they had better actors or more gore plenty of people have went the low budget route with out having to use horrible actors look at easy rider that had dennis hopper and jack nicholson and a low budget
<START> i think part of the reason this movie was made and is aimed at us <UNK> who actually play all the nancy drew pc games there's been a lot of movies lately based on video games and i think this in one of them br br so this movie does not follow any book but it does follow parts of the games i buy and play every nancy drew games as soon as it comes out and the games are from <UNK> and are for girls who aren't afraid of a mouse and some of these games actually won parents' choice gold awards they are not only fun but you can actually learn a thing or two while playing br br i took two of my step children with me to go see it and they loved it the 10 <UNK> old had started playing her first nancy drew game a day before i took her to see the movie and she was having so much fun playing the game i thought she would enjoy the movie as well and i was right she not only loved this movie but couldn't wait to get home to finish her first game and start another one br br my other step daughter is only 7 and she also loved the movie but she is still a little to young too play the games yet but she enjoys watching her sister play at times just to see what's going on br br the games are based for children 10 <UNK> and older all the games usually get pretty descent reviews and are classified as adventure games for more information on the games just check out <UNK> nancy drew games so personally i thought the movie was pretty good and i will buy it when it comes out on dvd
<START> i had the <UNK> to see this movie at the <UNK> film festival of <UNK> br br <UNK> or <UNK> is a 200 000 <UNK> movie about a father and his 2 sons the father has a traditional <UNK> somewhere in a traditional chinese village where local mostly aged men come to relax and to go bathing the father has to sons a <UNK> son who lives with him and a son who lives in a big modern city and who comes to visit him to this son the traditional village the <UNK> and his <UNK> brother seem strange and annoying but this changes along the movie br br though the story may sound cheesy or cliche it's not with really great performances especially of the father and the <UNK> son sorry i don't know their names and a great story the movie was touching and funny at the same time br br if you got a chance to see this movie do it it's a great alternative to mainstream hollywood cinema br br
<START> some moron who read or saw some reference to angels coming to earth decided to disregard what he'd heard about the <UNK> of humans and angels being larger than normal humans <UNK> them as mythical giants that were 40 feet tall is beyond ridiculous there was some historical references to <UNK> and furniture in parts of the world that were much larger than would be needed for standard humans these were supposedly built on a scale that would lend itself to a 10 to 14 foot human somewhat supporting the david and <UNK> tale from the bible there is no mention in any historical references to buildings or <UNK> that would support the idea of a 40 foot tall being if i was rating this movie on my own scale it would have been a negative value instead of a one
<START> <UNK> please forgive me but weren't more than half the characters missing in the original novel <UNK> is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a <UNK> of bread and then attempting several times to escape he breaks <UNK> and is pursued relentlessly by the police inspector <UNK> along the way there are many characters that weren't in this version some worth mentioning would be <UNK> <UNK> m <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the only character with the same name is <UNK> i was confused and frustrated throughout the whole movie trying to see how it was in any way connected to victor <UNK> epic novel
<START> i heard and read many <UNK> things about midnight meat train which is based on a short story written by no less than clive barker and supposedly the best adaptation of his work since the original <UNK> that he directed himself but so far i can only express very mixed sentiments about my viewing experience the most appropriate term to <UNK> the whole film in just word is nauseating the violence is sadistic and extreme which undoubtedly <UNK> fanatic young horror <UNK> but it's also <UNK> gratuitous and exploitative normally speaking i'm very pro violence but it has to at least serve some kind of purpose the <UNK>  literally  depicted in midnight meat train is exclusively meant to shock and to <UNK> the viewers with weak nerve systems and easily upset <UNK> and even that isn't fully effective due to the use of digital computer effects there are more shortcomings some even bigger than the pointless gore but perhaps i should focus on the good elements first the basic concept is definitely promising and multiple sequences like the chase in the <UNK> room for example are literally <UNK> with nail biting suspense and macabre atmosphere unfortunately the pacing is very uneven and the <UNK> of the potentially fantastic plot is made unnecessarily convoluted presumably the <UNK> of a short story into a long feature film scenario is responsible for the pacing <UNK> but i honestly feel they could have done more with the denouement as well as with the character played by <UNK> jones the plot introduces leon an aspiring photographer in new york whose agent <UNK> to search for the truly menacing face of the city through sinister pictures leon then becomes obsessed with stalking an <UNK> and <UNK> behaving butcher who always <UNK> the midnight train <UNK> right as the butcher turns out to be a relentless serial killer who literally <UNK> his victims with a big hammer but the killer's motivations and behavior suggest there's something far more substantial going on the <UNK> at night midnight meat train takes place in naturally unsettling locations like subway stations at night and animal <UNK> plus the film also <UNK> of good acting performances and a <UNK> of downright disturbing images like <UNK> on meat <UNK> and train <UNK> <UNK> in blood but director <UNK> <UNK> versus godzilla final wars doesn't take full advantage of it all the ending leaves a whole lot questions unanswered and even if clive barker meant to have like this i still think we deserved a slightly more <UNK> finale midnight meat train is a somewhat intriguing and definitely haunting film but not without <UNK> it's not intended for easily offended viewers but maybe people looking for plot <UNK> and clarity should leave it alone as well
<START> another entry in the holiday horror category that fills the shelves of your local video store the spoiler <UNK> nerdy teen taking revenge on the <UNK> kids who <UNK> him plot will of course be familiar to those who've watched it before and those who've seen it before will probably watch it again those who are expecting <UNK> bergman and will subsequently become <UNK> about their wasted time should just skip it marilyn <UNK> on the soundtrack and david <UNK> denise richards and <UNK> <UNK> as eye candy go with the flow and enjoy it oh and i loved the creepy mask
<START> in my lit class we've just finished the book <UNK> and this movie is nothing like the book 1 brian never ate worms in the book 2 he didn't know the <UNK> name 3 his mom was cheating on his father in a station <UNK> not in the woods where anyone could see 4 the man the mother is cheating with doesn't have black hair he has blonde br br now for the unrealistic parts of the movie 1 a thirteen year old can't punch his fist through a window in one punch br br and for the acting the kid who played brian was a horrible actor br br however i do believe that the scenery was impressive though i highly doubt the director even read the book br br this movie is good if you have not read the book <UNK> by gary <UNK> but if you have then begin a complaint letter to the director
<START> a series of random seemingly insignificant <UNK> at her sister's <UNK> house has miss <UNK> quite <UNK> a ring light <UNK> a <UNK> a lighter a <UNK> a shoe  there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it miss <UNK> asks her <UNK> the great <UNK> detective <UNK> <UNK> to look into the matter but what <UNK> sees is something far more sinister than miss <UNK> could have imagined and <UNK> fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the <UNK> house if found murdered it's up to <UNK> to bring a killer to justice br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a solid but not spectacular entry in the long running <UNK> series i appreciate how faithful the script is to agatha <UNK> original story i realize that certain liberties had to be taken but i appreciate the effort nonetheless the major points of the mystery are all there  the petty <UNK> the <UNK> house the students the ripped <UNK> and of course <UNK> ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens with a few exceptions the cast of students is almost as i <UNK> them <UNK> lewis and jessica lloyd standout among the group as <UNK> as i always enjoy david <UNK> <UNK> i get a real kick out of the episodes with phillip jackson's inspector <UNK> and pauline <UNK> miss <UNK> this episode is a real treat as miss <UNK> gets more screen time than usual finally i enjoyed the use of the ever present mouse as an <UNK> of the activities in the hostel it's a fun little play on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> title br br i realized while re watching <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> just what a tremendous influence agatha <UNK> work was on the highly stylized italian mystery films or <UNK> of the 60s and 70s take the murder of mrs <UNK> as an example if you were to <UNK> up the graphic nature of the scene you would have something straight out of an early 70s giallo in fact the entire plot of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> could have been used in a giallo it's just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked
<START> this is one of the greatest child pet movies ever created i cry every time i see shadow yelling wait wait for me peter as the family car is pulling away this is a must see if you love animals best movie ever the lines in the movie are sometimes stupid like when sassy says to chance <UNK> rule and dogs <UNK> lines like this i could do without but when i was six i bet i loved that line the storyline may seem <UNK> to some but i like it shadow as the older dog who's preparing chance to take over for him when he's gone is really moving when you think about it it reminded me of my childhood dog i think everyone can find a piece of themselves in <UNK> bound
<START> i'd heard about this movie a while ago from a friend and she recently got it on dvd there was a lot of anticipation and excitement as we'd both heard that this was a terrifying film really scary how disappointed was i very apart from that one scene we all know which bit nothing happened i was expecting to see the woman in black a few times and for her to do a few more <UNK> scenes like appear at the window or walk across the hall or something br br nearly all the reviews here say what a scary gripping atmospheric movie this is i just didn't see it i'm afraid maybe there's a difference in what people find scary in the us to here in britain br br a big let down after all the hyped reviews
<START> an obvious b grade effort to cash in on the hostel saw buzz my expectations for this film were low really low and yet it still managed to disappoint on every level the acting is so bad it's not even funny the plot line is non existent and the only scare was realizing that i had wasted <UNK> 21 minutes watching it i'm surprised to note that <UNK> people gave it a 10 star rating i can only suspect that 33 of these are cast and crew the <UNK> is possibly the directors mother although i'm sure even she would find it hard to go higher than a 2 dvd extras include an hour long making of feature which raises the question why although perhaps it serves to demonstrate what not to do avoid at all costs
<START> most of the french films i've seen and enjoyed were more talk than action but that's okay i found them interesting well photographed and with intriguing actors however i did at one point wonder if <UNK> depardieu was in every french film ever made it seemed that way br br this movie has the same interesting visuals and had a good opening but then it became talk talk and more talk which is fine for a drama but not for a murder mystery after awhile i almost fell asleep watching this br br actually the film was more like a play with almost all the scenes played out in one room thus if you love plays you should like this but i want a little more bang for a murder story
<START> remembering the dirty <UNK> of this <UNK> vapid movie is akin to digging into your chest <UNK> with a rusty <UNK> <UNK> perhaps home alone 2 lost in new york 1992 was a bit on the predictable side but this pathetic excuse for a film is just one of the most shameless <UNK> at <UNK> i have ever heard of a boy fighting off spies terrorists when he's home alone in a chicago <UNK> with the <UNK> ridiculous why did this film have to be made i am the kind of person who believes even terrible movies are not wastes of time but rather learning experiences however this is actually a waste of time it should be avoided at all costs
<START> the movie starts with a nice song looks like a thriller with <UNK> khan walking around in a suspicious way but then suddenly we are forced to a comedy with the routine stupid idiots like <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> acting like grown up kids their scenes are quite funny first and then get boring there is a bored sub plot of <UNK> brother being killed towards the end the film tries to get serious with the villain kidnapping our heroes but here it gets even stupid then a lengthy bashing bashing climax straight out of <UNK> <UNK> and wait there is also a long chase in <UNK> house br br the film is so boring that it makes you fall asleep br br direction by <UNK> is very bad music <UNK> is routine except the first song br br cinematography is bad the film has a cheap look throughout br br <UNK> <UNK> is good in his 1st scene where he goes to pay his rent and i was happy that the actor isn't loud and over the top like other films but no he becomes his usual self and gets irritating most of the times <UNK> should not speak in a film his <UNK> delivery is terrible <UNK> is the saving grace he is the sole actor who acts very well in this film <UNK> <UNK> tries hard in his first comic film as an adult but doesn't impress much <UNK> is bad as always <UNK> khan gets less scope and is usual <UNK> is a non actress <UNK> <UNK> is terrible
<START> i found this to be an utter waste of time effort and money i know disney always displays lack of creativity when making straight to video films but <UNK> the plot of the original film with a new perspective is an all time low soon they'll just be re releasing the original films with new animation and new songs and be calling it a new version of the movie we all love nathan lane surprisingly returns to his role of timon yet again timon and pumbaa the animated animals from the world of the original lion king <UNK> on a narrative journey to tell us the original story the way it really happened as they see it br br of course timon is now the hero of the story <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> blah blah blah br br the musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap the vocal talents are impressive for a video feature but then again when was the last time you remember matthew <UNK> whoopi goldberg or nathan lane being in anything of real commercial substance overall if you liked the original you'll hate this it's insulting because it's unfair to children and adults alike and that about sums it up
<START> as a girl <UNK> moved away from her small village to tokyo leaving behind her two best friends <UNK> and <UNK> she returns as a young woman surprised to find that <UNK> died when she was a teenager she <UNK> with <UNK> and they are horrified to learn that <UNK> is mysteriously being <UNK> via the island of <UNK> oh boy i rented this because i like asian horror and i think <UNK> <UNK> a nifty actress unfortunately if i had to describe <UNK> in one word it would be <UNK> this movie is silly boring poorly filmed unimaginative and most of all <UNK> <UNK> has minimal screen time as the <UNK> <UNK> and her character is given little to work with
<START> if my grandma did films they would probably do much better figure than this one incredible bad the main characters the mom the dad and son are ok specially the mother she's a nice actress and the kid also proves to be a nice one specially on the scenes where he is supposed to be scary but does the the director know the meaning of the words plot point <UNK> and good script the script hasn't any <UNK> atmosphere to become a suspense thing if you like being chased by trees you can probably enjoy it otherwise just stay at home and sleep oh actually there was something funny the movie's from 2001 but we couldn't realize it since the image is so bad like on mini <UNK> and the cars are so old like 70 and 80's
<START> there's been a <UNK> for the past few years for often as not ironic zombie related films as well as other media <UNK> of the flesh eating <UNK> dead fido is a film that's either an attempt to cash in on that simply a <UNK> of it or both and it falls <UNK> into the category of ironic zombies the joke here is that we get to see the walking dead in the <UNK> context of a <UNK> stereotyped <UNK> clean alternate history we are in the wake of a great zombie war and the creatures are now being <UNK> as slaves version of a 1950s <UNK> br br it's a moderately funny concept on its own and enough perhaps for a five minute comedy sketch but it can't hold up a feature film on its own the joke that rotting corpses for servants are <UNK> with this <UNK> version of a small town is repeated over and over again and loses all <UNK> the soundtrack relentlessly plays sunny tunes while zombies <UNK> <UNK> the word zombie is constantly inserted into an otherwise <UNK> <UNK> line for a cheap attempt at a laugh br br the very <UNK> and <UNK> of the representation of the <UNK> fifties here can't help but <UNK> me it is so stylized in it evidently <UNK> inspired way that it is more apparent in waving <UNK> of its 1950s <UNK> around than actually bearing any resemblance to anything that might have happened between 1950 and 1959 there is something <UNK> <UNK> about it as if the film is <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> about how more open down to earth and superior the <UNK> are br br because the characters are such broad <UNK> of pop culture 1950s types it's difficult to develop much emotional investment in them each has a few character traits thrown at him or her helen is obsessed with appearances and bill loves golf and his haunted by having had to kill his father but they remain quite two dimensional performances within the constraints of this bad writing are fine the best is billy connolly as fido the zombie who in the tradition of boris karloff in frankenstein actually <UNK> character and sympathy to a <UNK> green monster who cannot speak br br there are little bits of <UNK> allegory thrown around to <UNK> <UNK> racism <UNK> war paranoia et <UNK> but none of it really works on a <UNK> level and the filmmakers don t really stick with anything br br unfortunately this film doesn't really get past sticking with the flimsy joke of look zombies in <UNK> it to <UNK> ' for a good hour and a half
<START> i haven't yet read kurt <UNK> mother night though i've read other books of his all outstanding pieces of satire and game changing novel pieces after seeing keith <UNK> film adaptation of his book it will be an immediate must read in the near future it's the kind of material that i'm sure if it wasn't made in 1995 <UNK> as a film it would be picked up right away today in the time period when many period post present holocaust ww2 movies are quite popular except that this is much darker though even more <UNK> about the nature of playing roles and the real underlying horror of living with life after war than say the reader it's about the very real danger of pretending in wartime which is what being a spy in ww2 is really all about br br it would be one thing if mother night had a script with a lot of emotional depth and complexity about the moral choice and constant role even after the war ends for howard w <UNK> nick nolte which is does but it's also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique keith gordon is not someone i usually think of as a director of really strong material more so i think back to him as an actor oddly enough featured briefly with <UNK> himself in back to school but this is a revelation he takes the story of campbell as a story of a <UNK> life a german propaganda master the only american left in berlin who is actually a spy for the americans but can never have his identity revealed and was before a playwright who really <UNK> to a nation of two himself and his wife <UNK> lee it follows him from his prison cell awaiting trial in israel in <UNK> as he writes his <UNK> and tells of his <UNK> about being a <UNK> nazi and then in 1960 in semi hiding in a new york apartment which is where the bulk of the film takes place br br mother night can be quite heavy like on a level one might associate with the <UNK> but on another more emotional cerebral level than the stark poetry of that film gordon by way of <UNK> is trying to give us a strong look at a man who has nothing except the memory and then later a weird <UNK> of his long lost love in a sister who has come back to him in nyc so he's left to his own devices when he befriends a painter alan arkin very very good here and then is found out as a nazi in hiding by a white <UNK> <UNK> leading <UNK> to his apartment on the surface this should be just a straightforward spy story but not a thing is straightforward the <UNK> of this man's life is <UNK> but it's ultimately of his own choosing campbell is one of those characters that could be <UNK> for hours on end but the same conclusions might be reached and in a way mirrors the line <UNK> said the bigger the lie the more people believe it that is except for the <UNK> few who started the lie and know its secret and power br br but oh it would be one thing if it were just a wonderful and tragic comic tale or another if it were featuring some really fantastic performances which is does nolte is at his very best here and <UNK> lee who we might remember from twin peaks as laura <UNK> <UNK> in multiple roles especially in the scene when she reveals she's not <UNK> <UNK> it's also a <UNK> shot film with brilliant lighting and shots that reflect the state of mind of the character or just the <UNK> or sickening colors of the time watch the scene where an old campbell watches a film of his younger self <UNK> out a rant the <UNK> of faces is great and the music <UNK> rise the level of tragedy it could be <UNK> some of the music is too much but at other times it <UNK> the material past its own usual dramatic <UNK> and makes it operatic <UNK> about human nature br br it's not always an easy film to take emotionally and some of the twists do have that <UNK> of <UNK> as in any spy story but it's the <UNK> from <UNK> that sticks through the way of taking appearance and performance of life imitating art imitating life imitating death and making it into something worth remembering i have no idea just yet if the book is better than the film or the other way around but at the moment it's hard for me not to recommend this to anyone looking for a masterpiece of post ww2 holocaust storytelling
<START> i never saw this when i was a kid so this was seen with fresh eyes i had never heard of it and rented it for my 5 year old daughter plus the idea of christopher walken singing and dancing made me curious the special fx are cheesy and the singing and dancing is mediocre but the story is great my daughter was <UNK> i loved watching walken in this role thinking about what the future held for him very amusing to see him dance and if the songs weren't great at least they weren't disney over produced <UNK> <UNK> the ogre scene in the beginning was a little scary for her and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end but it was mostly <UNK> interestingly we had recently read <UNK> in boots and i had wondered about the <UNK> of the story but while staying true to almost every aspect <UNK> acting made it believable great fun i'd watch it again with my daughter
<START> the robin cook novel coma had already been turned into a pretty successful movie in 1978 a couple of years later it was the turn of another robin cook <UNK> to get the big screen treatment but in the case of <UNK> virtually everything that could go wrong does go wrong this is a dreadful adventure flick <UNK> of wooden performances stupid dialogue unconvincing characters and <UNK> pacing the only reason it escapes a 1 out of 10 rating is that the egyptian backdrop provides infinitely more fascination than the story itself hard to believe franklin j <UNK> of <UNK> and planet of the apes is the director behind this <UNK> br br pretty <UNK> <UNK> baron <UNK> anne down is on a working vacation in <UNK> when she stumbles across the shop of <UNK> dealer <UNK> <UNK> john gielgud <UNK> befriends <UNK> and is impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge consequently he shows her a beautiful and incredibly rare statue of <UNK> <UNK> i that he is keeping secretly in his shop the very existence of the statue <UNK> intense excitement in <UNK> for it could provide vital clues in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> long lost tomb a prize as great as the discovery of <UNK> tomb in <UNK> before <UNK> can tell <UNK> any more he is brutally murdered in his shop with <UNK> watching in silent terror as he meets his grisly end afraid yet <UNK> by what she has seen <UNK> attempts to track down the treasure she finds herself helped and <UNK> in her quest by various other parties none of whom are truly <UNK> for one there is <UNK> maurice <UNK> seemingly a friend but perhaps a man with sinister <UNK> motives then there is <UNK> <UNK> frank <UNK> an egyptian for whom <UNK> feels a certain attraction but who may also be hiding dangerous secrets from her br br the biggest problems with <UNK> generally result from its total disregard for <UNK> down couldn't be less convincing as a female <UNK>  one assumes she would be quite well educated and <UNK> yet she spends the entire film screaming <UNK> like some <UNK> bimbo from a teen slasher flick on those rare occasions that she actually isn't running from a potential villain she does other brainless things such as taking <UNK> flash photos in a 4 000 year old tomb the plot twists are heavy handed to say the least mainly <UNK> of revelations and double crosses that can be predicted well in advance one can't even try to enjoy the film on the level of dumb but entertaining action fare because the pacing is awfully <UNK> what little action can be found is separated by long stretches of tedium a famous review of the movie <UNK> <UNK> stinks never before has a 2 hour film been so <UNK> summed up in 2 words
<START> disappointing and irritating the screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature but instead strings together clichés in a disjointed fashion character is not explored in depth these are puppets <UNK> down in a plot he openly <UNK> needed a dramatic element the mother's affair with her daughter's lover br br anne reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situations and lines such standing <UNK> to allow her angry daughter to slug her in the eye the script portrays darren daniel craig as a dr <UNK> mr hyde without any hints about why except that he <UNK> cocaine before the big scene br br a mature writer could have done so much more with this topic

<START> tv does influence society just look at the <UNK> in popularity of <UNK> <UNK> after this shallow little piece of work <UNK> besides real people who look as good as these people do don't have any problems br br besides does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a nice manhattan <UNK> considering what they do for a living nbc just loves to insult the viewer's intelligence even if they're just around <UNK> level i know a person who makes 100 000 a year as a web designer and lives in a tiny one bedroom apartment in manhattan that costs <UNK> a month in rent br br i'd like to see a show called <UNK> where it's six ugly <UNK> in dead end jobs living in a crummy neighborhood where <UNK> constantly <UNK> and someone gets <UNK> every week and then the <UNK> <UNK> up the rent now that i would watch
<START> being that i loved the original <UNK> even with all its flaws i have to say this remake trailer was abysmal br br listening to <UNK> say in that lazy american accent <UNK> <UNK> makes me feel sick the set doesn't look roman at all it looks like some rich actor's hollywood mansion backyard and the roman costumes look like cheap crap you buy at a suburban costume shop br br that charming <UNK> <UNK> looks like a fifty year old hispanic woman totally terrified out of her mind as if not knowing it's a movie trailer br br the acting has got to be some of the worst i've ever seen with most of the lines i hear being random actors screaming <UNK> as <UNK> and <UNK> annoyingly as they can br br the random sex scenes also filled a good 40 or 50 of the trailer and the scenes with notable actors actresses like gerard butler who <UNK> the screen in shadows for all of three and a half seconds not doing anything but looking uncomfortable or going all out over the top with their minimal lines just dragging it down with the <UNK> of their delivery br br <UNK> <UNK> part consists of her looking like her usual <UNK> crack whore self <UNK> against a door <UNK> about the moon or something you can't tell because she's either drunk or high or just <UNK> <UNK> br br karen black is just annoying randomly laughing and screaming in such a way that <UNK> you br br helen <UNK> she was in the original and her return to <UNK> consists of <UNK> i particularly love and by love i mean hate <UNK> line <UNK> <UNK> no <UNK> me something incoherent something that sounds like <UNK> it's also insanely arrogant to say <UNK> four year reign was greater than <UNK> birth and death br br honestly this has got to be the worst most exploitative self <UNK> arrogant piece of crap labeled as art i've ever seen even if gore <UNK> hated the original <UNK> he shouldn't have shown up or given his name over for this crap pile no matter how much they paid him unless it was a billion <UNK> <UNK> worst trailer ever
<START> this movie should not be compared to the <UNK> or other caper heist con game films what makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships <UNK> and trust it's also a fairly cutting critique of <UNK> given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily <UNK> and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale has mr mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy highly hugely recommended
<START> max had the v 8 trace <UNK> of fires last and only hero has a jet engine on the back of his car allowing him to make unintentionally humorous faces as he rockets around the halfway desolate <UNK> be amazed as mad max 2 aka the road warrior is <UNK> and spliced back together as a new movie albeit filmed in a lackluster manner with bad actors and lousy stunt work br br why is <UNK> set in a post apocalyptic <UNK> simple the road warrior was actually any questions can be answered by it was that way in the road warrior except for the out of work mutant actors from the original 60's the time machine film that make a cameo appearance for sake of giving the audience some non <UNK> action to chew on for a few minutes br br in typical 80's fashion all cars driven by bad guys that are <UNK> or slightly <UNK> explode in a huge <UNK> explosion inevitably all car chases will happen near convenient cliff sides and cars will <UNK> fall off of them along with this 80's cinematic wild ride is the general rampant <UNK> in this style of <UNK> film generally i waited for <UNK> rocket powered car to <UNK> and shoot flames so there would be another shot of him <UNK> up his face like he is supposed to be tough which comes off more as him looking <UNK> badly choreographed action coupled with bad acting makes this film a true <UNK> the unintentional humor value even manages to wear thin br br rats nights of terror by bruno mattei is superior and that in and of itself is saying a lot by this count <UNK> texas <UNK> is a cinematic masterpiece compared to <UNK> of fire a poor road warrior knock off that doesn't have near enough cheese factor to make the film watchable br br
<START> this the direct to video death <UNK> of the tremors series features sixty inspired seconds <UNK> you'll know it when you see it and more tedium and filler than you can shake a stick at tremors 4 was obviously shot on a <UNK> low budget that means they only had enough special effects <UNK> for three or four minutes of precious worm on human violence tops the lackluster cliche <UNK> cast and hackneyed writing ensure that the remaining hour and a half of the tremors 4 experience feels at least fifteen thousand years long only hardcore tremors fans will be able to sit through much less enjoy this film if you aren't among them don't bother
<START> i have to say as being a fan of the man who created halloween the fog christine the thing probably his best films br br then you got this <UNK> i can't <UNK> think he put any effort at all into this like he did with cigarette burns at least his son made a decent soundtrack br br you have to look at this from the standpoint that it didn't seem like a movie it looked as if someone else directed it for one thing i won't believe carpenter put any effort into this at all br br i was just listening to his old school <UNK> <UNK> the fog soundtrack and it was awesome especially for the times br br he was using a style that no one had and it worked so well for his films
<START> ever since i heard of the ralph bakshi version of the lord of the rings i wondered what the hell is <UNK> animation well i finally found out i saw this movie about three years ago not having any idea who ralph bakshi is and i liked it a lot very good story line it even has a little character development which is great for a cartoon see it if you get bored with contemporary animation don't get me wrong i'm not saying it's just a nice cartoon it's a pretty good movie too
<START> no doubt frank sinatra was a talented actor as well as a talented singer after all very few actors nowadays can get a scene just right in one take and that was pretty much sinatra's <UNK> <UNK> on set br br i feel that as the 1960's wore on the quality of the man's films really started to tank the tony rome detective series was nothing short of trying to compete with dean <UNK> matt <UNK> series which came out at the same time perhaps even a james bond competition but nothing really worked for frank during these years his personal life in <UNK> his music <UNK> out sinatra appeared more like a <UNK> to the 1950's the last great sinatra film of this period was probably von <UNK> express in 1965
<START> poor paul <UNK> after landing the role of scott <UNK> in strictly ballroom the best film in history he managed to find himself doing a lot of rubbish none of the characters in this film is very unlikable or even <UNK> but <UNK> lead is the sort of person you prefer to ignore completely <UNK> and he wears <UNK> big mistake in costume design that one
<START> disappearance is set in the <UNK> desert as jim harry <UNK> patty <UNK> susan <UNK> plus their two kids katie <UNK> <UNK> matt <UNK> <UNK> along with ethan jamie <UNK> a friend of the family are travelling along they stop at a <UNK> diner ask about an old deserted mining town on the map called weaver no one claims to have heard of it but it's definitely there the family decide to take a <UNK> in order to check it out take some pictures once at the town they take some pictures have a look around but when it comes time to leave their car won't start they have to spend the night there while looking around they find a camcorder <UNK> which they play only to discover footage of a scared woman saying all her friends have disappeared the next morning their car has disappeared as things take a very sinister turn what is <UNK> secret will the <UNK> ever leave there alive br br written co executive produced directed by walter <UNK> i have to say that disappearance is one of the most frustrating films i have ever watched for the first 85 minutes it was a pretty good mysterious mix of thriller horror film but then we are treated to one of the single worst endings ever in motion picture history the script suggest lots of different things but never <UNK> or <UNK> i was sitting there genuinely intrigued about what was going on from the families car mysterious disappearing the four recent graves the thing in the abandoned mines the supernatural <UNK> the sudden unexplained disappearance of ethan his just as unexplained <UNK> the <UNK> sinister motives the <UNK> in the car going crazy the crashed plane the <UNK> denying weaver existed the possible side effects of a <UNK> bomb being dropped near weaver in the 40's but they are all tossed out of the window for all we know could have been totally separate random events everything was coming along nicely was set up for a big twist revelation but none was <UNK> instead i was treated to the most ambiguous strange surreal downright frustrating ending possible if nothing else the ending <UNK> much of what has gone before leaves the viewer with more questions than answers it's almost as if the makers had these great ideas but then didn't know what to do with them just made the ending up on the spot i just felt i put so much effort into watching the film which can be pretty slow at times without any sort of reward in fact the ending felt more like a kick in the teeth or a good two finger <UNK> br br director <UNK> does a reasonable job here the old ghost town has a certain atmosphere the large <UNK> desert locations give a good sense of isolation it's well made but what were they thinking with that ending nothing fits nothing makes sense it's just a huge frustrating mess that after sitting through the thing for nearly an hour a half leaves you confused wanting to know more despite being a horror film there's no blood or gore although there are one or two creepy moments here there the film actually reminds of the hills have eyes 2006 remake for large parts as that is what the film is set up to be before a bizarre ending which does nothing to bring any closure to the film br br technically the film is good with high production values good special effects sets locations cinematography set in america but filmed in south australia the acting is fine from a decent cast br br disappearance is a really odd film for a long time it <UNK> up to be a neat little horror mystery thriller but it never explains anything which happens the truly surreal ending just throws up more questions than answers i really can't see anyone making head nor tail of this i really can't
<START> undoubtedly the best heavy metal horror item made in the <UNK> <UNK> 80's which admittedly doesn't sound like much considering how utterly abysmal many other entries in this odd little fright film sub genre like hard rock zombies blood tracks terror on tour and the especially <UNK> jon <UNK> <UNK> starring stinker <UNK> nightmare tended to be that aside this one still deserves props for <UNK> the excessive splatter and needlessly flashy special f x <UNK> <UNK> in favor of focusing on adolescent high school characters who are depicted with greater <UNK> and <UNK> than the norm for a mid 80's teen targeted <UNK> moreover the film's pointed <UNK> <UNK> of both ridiculously overblown 80's heavy metal stupidity and the nauseating self <UNK> of the uptight <UNK> conservative <UNK> who claimed it was the devil's music are very clever and on the money funny famed greed decade heavy metal god <UNK> <UNK> has a hilarious bit as a smarmy anti metal tv <UNK> br br marc price the hopelessly <UNK> <UNK> on family ties gives a surprisingly strong and winning performance as eddie <UNK> <UNK> a geeky socially awkward and severely <UNK> heavy metal <UNK> who's constantly picked on by the stuck up jerk <UNK> bullies who make up the majority of the student body at <UNK> high school the cruelty and mean <UNK> of the high school kids is nailed with painfully credible accuracy <UNK> life takes a turn for the worse when his rock star idol sammi <UNK> an <UNK> whacked out portrayal by tony fields <UNK> in a hotel fire hip local disc <UNK> <UNK> kiss front man gene simmons in a cool cameo <UNK> eddie up with <UNK> final <UNK> album which when played backwards <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> spirit back from the dead sammi encourages eddie to <UNK> him on all the vile <UNK> who make poor <UNK> life the proverbial living hell only to have meek eddie prove to be a most reluctant would be <UNK> it's up to eddie <UNK> by token nice girl leslie graham <UNK> <UNK> by the lovely lisa <UNK> to stop sammi before things get too out of hand br br <UNK> directed with commendable <UNK> and sensitivity by character actor charles martin smith who also briefly appears as a nerdy school teacher <UNK> written by michael s murphy joel <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> acted by a uniformly up to snuff cast this <UNK> sleeper even comes complete with a handful of nifty jump moments an outrageous attack in the back of a car by a <UNK> <UNK> long <UNK> mutant <UNK> rates as the definite highlight a rousing carrie style high school dance slaughter sequence a neatly <UNK> halloween setting revenge being correctly shown as a truly ugly business and a solid central message that you shouldn't make a particular over hyped person your hero strictly because of the <UNK> anti establishment <UNK> said fellow does to qualify for that special status
<START> de <UNK> is becoming one of my favorite directors but this one was a hit and miss for me a <UNK> idiot youth becomes the leader of a community of illegal <UNK> in a deserted area outside <UNK> it is a detailed and <UNK> story of the innocent poor masses complete with evil <UNK> and trigger happy police forces but slowly it <UNK> into a magic fantasy tale as the boy wonder <UNK> develops <UNK> superhero powers i had it up to here with the ever smiling <UNK> after 10 minutes and when the magic took over i was left in the dust there were so many wonderfully <UNK> shots so many good characters among the <UNK> that i kept thinking it was a waste the movie wasn't more serious with its material the <UNK> of <UNK> and fantasy comes out more as an experiment of the look what we can also do mum sort than as a fully developed piece of work art
<START> this story about three women is a very sensitive study about <UNK> charlotte van <UNK> <UNK> the youngest laura <UNK> <UNK> who is about <UNK> and martha <UNK> <UNK> the oldest who is the mother of <UNK> they live together in the same building they have different expectations of life the vital laura wants a child <UNK> comes from a village and wants to change her life in <UNK> martha dreams about her youth when she was a young girl in fact nothing happens in this movie so you wait for something for instances an accident which could <UNK> this story as times goes on you discover that the director <UNK> van <UNK> <UNK> only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing more this movie is disappointing because you expect the women to learn from their experiences which is not the case so one is left with a feeling of <UNK>
<START> sometimes i watch a movie and am really impressed by it  and still it is not easy to explain why i liked it that much this is mostly true for the <UNK> movies  the ones one can hardly compare with the rest out there <UNK> mister tom is one of these special movies there is a lot of emotion in that movie  and the acting was so good that while watching the movie i was crying and laughing as the story went on the young nick robinson  is a young boy william <UNK> from london because of the air strikes there during the second world war mr tom played by john <UNK> is an old man leaving in the village the <UNK> children were send to br br at first tom refuses to take any <UNK> such as taking care for a troubled young <UNK>  but accepts since he is left without a choice during the stay mr tom discovers how horrible the life has been for the william  alongside his <UNK> his mom sent a belt and written <UNK> to the host of her son  not to hesitate to use it this belt is <UNK> in the field  never to be used in such a brutal manner mr tom provides a real home for william and the boy is happy with his new life he goes to school makes new friends and discovers hidden talents all of the sudden a letter william is called home in london with a letter mentioning that she is not feeling <UNK> it starts all over again  only this time it gets much <UNK> there are many feelings you can sense in this movie  love fear sadness happiness pain hope  and much more <UNK> mr tom is another masterpiece of the british cinema comparable only with others such as dear frankie and billy elliot  if one is to compare i have truly enjoyed watching it and highly recommend it before finishing this review i would also like to mention the great performance of thomas orange in the role of <UNK>  reminded me of a friend of mine from my own childhood
<START> according to imdb takashi miike's master of horror segment <UNK> was banned in the us so i figured i'd translate the swedish review i just wrote for it br br it was hard to not have any sort of expectations from <UNK> the killer director takashi miike's episode in the masters of horror series and the dvd cover of <UNK> did in deed look very promising br br the story mostly takes place in a remote japanese <UNK> some time during the 19th century and it tells the tale of a journalist searching for <UNK> the woman he left behind and whom he promised to return for tired and <UNK> he arrives at the <UNK> hoping that this will be the end of his very long journey it turns out that one of the prostitutes a <UNK> and quiet girl know about <UNK> and the desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what has happened to her since he left the story she tells him is as <UNK> as it is hard to swallow br br the first thing that hit me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the japanese cast for the most part spoke <UNK> american english but i will leave it at that it's not that big a deal what is a big deal however is how miserable the rest of it was miike's tale moves at such a slow pace that i couldn't help looking at my watch several times during the <UNK> minutes the extended <UNK> scene that takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie felt so <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> that not even that scene became interesting i felt like it was violent just for the sake of violence itself with no sense of style or purpose the only scenes that <UNK> any kind of emotion out of me were the images of bloody <UNK> rolling along the bottom of the <UNK> flowing water and in all honesty the only emotions they <UNK> were feelings of disgust br br the journalist seeking the love he left behind is played by billy <UNK> for me most memorable as frank <UNK> al <UNK> <UNK> assassin in brian de <UNK> the <UNK> 1987 i've always found <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> to be very icy and i mean that in a good way and that is probably why i was almost annoyed when i found him to be so terrible not in a good way in this one his acting seems to flow between no feelings or empathy whatsoever to displays of some really bad overacting when his character is supposed to react to the awful things <UNK> has been subjected to i was sitting in the <UNK> <UNK> and turning in an attempt to escape the horrible <UNK> put forth by <UNK> i'm grateful that most of the story is told by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of a geisha 2005 who plays the <UNK> prostitute br br the finale is probably supposed to be <UNK> maybe even revolting and horrid but i just found it to be kind of you know blah and i looked at my watch again for the <UNK> time just wishing the crappy episode would end maybe the finale caused me to smile just a bit but that's only because i couldn't help thinking of an episode of red dwarf and the upside down <UNK> of craig charles and danny john jules with eyes glued on them to make them look like aliens lucky you if you've seen that episode and now decide to see <UNK> i will forever have ruined the visuals of the ending for you br br my first thought when <UNK> finally ended was that the only thing that made the pain of watching it worth it was hearing the main title theme by edward <UNK> the same music i believe is used in every episode of this series and that if anything is a big <UNK> warning don't you think br br one might point to the costume design by <UNK> <UNK> and say that there at least is something not lacking in style and <UNK> but there are so many other films and tv shows that is so much better at showing off the japanese geisha fashion this is nothing but inferior and i am disappointed takashi miike's masters of horror episode is boring uninspiring and pointless in other words it's really really bad
<START> with a minimal budget a running time of eight minutes and a great amount of imagination <UNK> <UNK> has achieved one of the most moving shorts i've ever seen the subtlety of the screenplay is really remarkable since it doesn't give the ending away until the very last moment br br don't let anybody tell you what the short is about since you'll be able to enjoy it a lot more <UNK> <UNK> is the discovery of the year for his one man show directing writing and acting in this <UNK> short is the most remarkable effort i've seen in years also pay attention to the performance of <UNK> <UNK> her reaction shots are incredible br br overall rating 8 10
<START> well i can and will be very short this is a wrong balanced non convincing film that could have been a little bit better the script seems to not know which way to go from funny to cliche wise serious it's a bit silly that plus too much sentences we have heard before the <UNK> is in florida or no he is in <UNK> no he is in he is <UNK> the <UNK> br br 4 out of 10
<START> at first glance this movie has got everything a psycho wants a vampire story with a not under 18 <UNK> filled with hyper violence drugs gore sex including lesbian sex some fanatics <UNK> and even a gay <UNK> cop but then this movie is a succession of bad story so thin bad acting with a ridiculous english accent making you believe you're watching a bad monty python bad music '80s hard rock the <UNK> is awful the ending is a real shame plus the scenes of sex are ridiculous the gore not very impressive and those vampires reflect in a mirror and don't even fear daylight you get to be very disappointed unless you see it as a space <UNK> or <UNK> 2 i hope <UNK> will one day reach the bottom 100 because that's its real place br br i'd say it can still be fun to watch if you have friends and enough beer br br 3 10
<START> i agree with the previous comment what a disappointment rented it thinking it was going to be a good movie since mira and olivier where in it i was surprised by their performance expected more since they're good actors br br thought it was a slow beginning but it got worse i even laughed at some bad stunts when is supposed to be a mystery movie you can even guess who is the killer beforehand br br for real what happened br br sorry to say but don't even bother you'll waste time and money br br boring
<START> i was really impressed with this film the writing was fantastic and the characters were all rich and simple it's very easy to get emotionally attached to all of them the creators of this movie really hit the nail right on the head when it comes to creating real life characters and getting the viewer sucked right into their world further the music is terrific they employed some <UNK> to do the score and some of the soundtrack and they do a fantastic job adding to the movie if you have a chance to catch this movie in a small theater or at a film festival like i did i highly recommend that you go see it also on a personal note <UNK> <UNK> is beautiful in this movie that's reason enough to go check it out
<START> how can someone not like this movie this movie is so good that the first week i saw it on the shelf at the video store it was stolen best horror movie ever i mean he took the <UNK> and he well you know <UNK> how is that not funny the only movie that comes close to touching this is bride of <UNK> and that was just great
<START> the events of september 11 2001 do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie <UNK> or the progress of the two french brothers in my view it would have been better to leave this out i think the directors tried too hard perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop the comment of one of a policemen this <UNK> f ing <UNK> is apt br br nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events the <UNK> were in all the right places at the right times no other footage from the day matches what they shot
<START> words are seriously not enough convey the emotional power of this film it's one of the most wrenching you'll ever see yet the ending is one of the most loving tender and emotionally fulfilling you could hope for every actor in every role is terrific especially a wise and understated jamie lee curtis a tightly wound and <UNK> ray liotta and a heart stopping turn from tom <UNK> that should have had him up for every award in the book he's the 1 pick for <UNK> best actor in danny <UNK> alternate oscars the last half hour borders on melodrama but the film earns every one of its tears and unless you're made of stone there will be plenty of them
<START> what an awesome movie it was very scary great acting well written nice plot twists interesting characters very good direction and a surprise ending that will leave you with a smile on your face this is one popcorn horror flick that may not be appealing to non horror fans but is still nonetheless one of the best thrillers out there today i highly recommend it to only fans of br br 1 the horror genre br br or br br 2 an actor or actress featured in it br br out of stars br br ps i am sick and tired of people comparing this and other modern horror movies with scream ya know what they didn't want to be like scream everyone's like oh they copied scream well if i am not <UNK> scream also copied other movies too in fact just about every horror movie copied an earlier one scream however was a good film but still stop comparing and enjoy it for what it is br br go and rent this one br br
<START> let me start by saying that war inc is not everyone's cup of tea it is however very enjoyable and gets you thinking oh crap the comedy involved the film isn't obvious at all it's quite subtle <UNK> tanks dry cleaning service etc and it changes with the twists turns in the plot br br i may be the only one but i won't compare this with <UNK> point blank because it's different john cusack i wouldn't say he was amazing or brilliant but he was good on the other hand his sister joan cusack was incredible in her delivery of lines comedic timing even though she was hardly in the film i'd say the same about ben kingsley br br marisa tomei plays a convincing reporter and manages to pull it off <UNK> duff is very commendable for her role as central asian pop star <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> development as an actress is very noticeable in the film and she does a very good job even though her accent is a tad unreal br br overall the film is what i would call entertaining it doesn't have a particular storyline and it's quite silly at times but it does have a subtle message i'd say it's worth a watch
<START> silly movie is really really funny yes it's got its dead moments it can be a bit too obvious it <UNK> a bit in the second half and the story is an incoherent mess but it's laugh out loud funny all the way and it's worth seeing just for ed <UNK> as a right wing <UNK> this movie is in the same class as elvira mistress of the dark another incredibly funny <UNK> film
<START> i grew up in brazil and i used to visit and marvel at the beautiful coast where the movie was filmed the area is called <UNK> and is part of the green coast of the <UNK> de <UNK> state it is some 150 miles from the <UNK> de <UNK> city br br this movie brings back to life the world of <UNK> century brazil where europeans were barely starting to explore the <UNK> which was still in <UNK> state and <UNK> populated by various native <UNK> french and portuguese fought each other for territory and for the upper hand on the brazil wood trade all the while <UNK> with the natives who also fought each other for whatever reasons br br one french <UNK> a <UNK> is left to die by his own <UNK> but manages to escape and is kept prisoner by an all naked native tribe while he is a slave of the chief according to the customs of the tribe he is allowed to live in relative comfort for months until the time is right for him to be killed and eaten in a ritual of revenge br br what i love about this film is that it <UNK> in loving detail the <UNK> <UNK> and their way of life they walked naked and were cannibals and asks us to recognize and accept the life in those times as it was in a gorgeous garden of <UNK> life was messy violent full of pathetic <UNK> and bizarre customs the europeans arrive and bring their own problems including more violence with better weapons and greed there is no <UNK> noble <UNK> or heroic <UNK> here it is just people trying to survive in a tough world br br the movie is neither <UNK> sympathetic nor <UNK> of the natives from what i know of the subject the depiction is fairly accurate which adds an air of <UNK> to the project how many movies have you seen regarding the lives of brazilian natives and their early affairs with europeans
<START> from the mind of harry alan towers comes another piece of cinematic <UNK> supposedly based on the work of h rider <UNK> the only similarity it bears to anything <UNK> actually wrote is that it takes place in africa albeit an africa that has dinosaurs which our <UNK> <UNK> use to pull their <UNK> and has some characters with the same names br br our heroes david <UNK> patrick <UNK> and john <UNK> set out to seek treasure armed only with a <UNK> and end up precisely where the treasure is purely by chance on the way they meet a <UNK> assortment of extremely lame monsters pick up a french chef and <UNK> has an affair with the queen of <UNK> br br it's so ridiculous it's a hoot that's the only reason i didn't give it a 1
<START> my children just happened to stop at this movie the other night and as things started to play out it really <UNK> my interest i had to head out for <UNK> league so i had them record it for me on the <UNK> so i could watch the rest later well i just got done watching it and the front of my shirt must be <UNK> after crying <UNK> it was an excellent movie even though i could almost feel the pain and anguish these girls were experiencing and i never in a million years would have guessed the reason why <UNK> had gone from this beautiful girl to an anti social <UNK> this was probably why my shirt was <UNK> because i've experienced that same pain that <UNK> was feeling i too would not have sought out this movie but i'm sure glad i saw it very moving very touching great for those who love a good drama or tear <UNK>
<START> these days spielberg's the color purple is mostly remembered for being nominated for eleven oscars and winning <UNK> what's even more <UNK> is that spielberg himself wasn't even nominated for best director needless to say the film makers deserved more acclaim than they were <UNK> br br the story concerns the trials and <UNK> of <UNK> johnson whoopi goldberg an african american woman dominated at first by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband the film <UNK> several years and focuses mainly on <UNK> relationships with the women around her it's told from a decidedly female perspective but you <UNK> fear that it's a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the story is an interesting one <UNK> with humour at times although the central character's struggles are paramount some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the film's end but i didn't mind even though similar content in a lesser film would likely have me rolling my eyes br br the film received three oscar nominations for acting whoopi goldberg best actress oprah <UNK> best supporting actress and margaret <UNK> best supporting actress i think that goldberg and <UNK> were certainly deserving and danny glover was <UNK> <UNK> br br as already mentioned spielberg didn't receive a best director nomination for his efforts such an <UNK> <UNK> belief since spielberg's direction here is top notch i'm not especially crazy about <UNK> <UNK> score but it's not below average by any means br br in the end the story is a satisfying one well told by a master film maker working from <UNK> prize winning material give it a try and you'll probably be as <UNK> as i am about how it could be so poorly treated on oscar night
<START> it could have been better had it been directed by someone with more experience <UNK> didn't do a bad job but it is not a great work of cinematic art br br it is however a beautiful movie i have loved it since local channels used to show it graham greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories many love the fallen idol but i am not among them i think i saw <UNK> rock once many years ago and liked it but maybe i'm simply thinking <UNK> of the novel this is superbly cast charles boyer does not it's true come across as spanish but he seems to have the perfect <UNK> for this character tired <UNK> caring lauren bacall is appealing as the british girl who falls for him but the supporting players are the best <UNK> <UNK> is excellent her performance is a little grand <UNK> but i <UNK> that to the director peter lorre whom we first meet as he gives boyer a lesson in an <UNK> like universal language is excellent as always br br and <UNK> <UNK> could break the hardest heart she comes across as a <UNK> early teenager the character wants to be helpful she does her best br br i recommend this movie highly not without <UNK> the <UNK> is primarily that it is a little <UNK> but the story and acting can <UNK> be <UNK>
<START> nicely done and along with new <UNK> it's a great <UNK> <UNK> to see james <UNK> in the latest episode <UNK> check it out br br i like the growing characterisation and think we have good <UNK> for the tv actors in a fan produced piece this show manages to capture the feel quite well as they state on the <UNK> it has improved over the years with experience and i hope with some more experience a strong script editor and a pick up in timing and cgi that <UNK> will becoming more remarkable than it already truly is br br good work to all concerned br br i have a huge soft spot for <UNK> <UNK> great acting although i'm a bit tired of <UNK> laws enough already <UNK> great if a little uptight and it's cool she got the ship <UNK> <UNK> nice like fred <UNK> but lacks the gritty edge of a commanding officer and does seem too pleased with himself the doc <UNK> and <UNK> are right on the money in my eyes as is the wonderful <UNK> what a beautiful accent a real russian well i'm guessing <UNK> <UNK> from the czech <UNK> br br it gets my vote and the cgi is <UNK> some of the <UNK> obvious but on a small budget <UNK> br br really glad i found it br br ok some of the acting isn't great but it's fan made and is therefore allowed to be <UNK> sorry <UNK> cole br br the gay material is <UNK> on too thick graham <UNK> be embarrassed trek doesn't pay that much attention to <UNK> couples so why <UNK> gays with all the <UNK> it's not necessary to <UNK> someone's sexuality to this extent i hope they tone it down let <UNK> <UNK> be people not <UNK> i don't treat my gay friends any differently they're just regular guys br br <UNK> it's a mixed bag i can tell its all stock trek <UNK> stuff and works most of the time but timing can fall flat now then the end of worst fears part 2 misses the <UNK> and the edit love the fact they use the galaxy quest music br br i certainly can't wait for more <UNK> br br never give up never <UNK> br br <UNK> les <UNK>
<START> this was one of my favorite series when i was a kid the swedish <UNK> company decided to broadcast it once again a couple of <UNK> ago when i had just finished my first <UNK> of medical school i was surprised to see the depth in which the organs was explained sure some things are <UNK> but most of it was correct even though it was made 22 years ago and quite understandable i would suggest that all soon to be medical student should watch it it is a very good way to learn some of the basic medical words for example now i'm in my <UNK> <UNK> and i think i'll watch the series once again as soon as i've bought the dvd box
<START> i've seen a lot of tv movies in my time as a student the majority the normal waste of time that us television throws out this one however was well crafted and plotted and had a very nice twist at the end having only seen richard dean anderson in <UNK> and stargate i was surprised with his excellent performance rather than the rather gamut of expressions from a b that he normally gives it was a pleasant surprise to see daphne <UNK> after quite a long time dating back to the fly ii also nice to see robert <UNK> in a leading role again i can't say that i ever take jane <UNK> seriously after her benny hill days but she just about managed to cope well in her role all in all a highly recommended film
<START> forgive me for stating the obvious but some films are good and some films are bad of course there are extremes within those two broad categories films such as the godfather saving private ryan and star wars <UNK> <UNK> into the good category at the other end of the spectrum there are those films that simply don't deserve to be mentioned by name occasionally however someone produces a truly <UNK> film a film that should be <UNK> out as a <UNK> of how awful a film can be a film that is more than bad such a film is maiden voyage br br briefly maiden voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is <UNK> by a gang of evil criminals who demand a <UNK> from an equally evil scheming <UNK> owner of course there is an all american hero on board complete with <UNK> jaw and <UNK> chest who saves the day br br this is a production that <UNK> new depths everything about it is bad the acting the direction and the so called plot are breath <UNK> poor in short it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate viewer even an american viewer would be annoyed by its shortcomings br br yes it's that bad br br i will resist the temptation to <UNK> a list of things that <UNK> me about this film however its dumber than dumb conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what i mean br br imagine in your mind that you are an evil <UNK> and you are stood in an open <UNK> on a calm sea you are in company with the hero who holds a <UNK> bomb said hero throws the bomb to you and <UNK> overboard what would you do i don't know about you but i would throw the bomb as far as i possibly could into the sea not this guy he watches as our hero <UNK> away and then he tries to <UNK> the bomb with unfortunate for him results enough said such a demise would merit a mention in the <UNK> awards website and might also be a suitably apt conclusion to the production <UNK> lives
<START> there are several things wrong with this movie brenda <UNK> character being one of them i do not believe that the girl is a lousy actor i honestly don't i believe she is given poor lines she is just supposed to be that vain rich girl and while it is funny in the tv shows she plays in it can't even get a dry laugh from me here br br either way i really should have known what to expect when i sat down to watch this film br br the movie was not that terrible initially <UNK> reaction to <UNK> was completely natural i mean how would you feel if a man claiming to be a <UNK> monk chased you around commanding you to wear a <UNK> and <UNK> that you were needed to fight the great evil and save the world which brings me to another point i know this movie is entirely fiction but it is still has a <UNK> in chinese culture it seems like all of the warriors in <UNK> family line were women correct me if i'm wrong but i doubt that the monks would've just been okay with that sure maybe they could've worked it in somehow but they offered no explanation whatsoever by doing so they just contributed to the many cheesy attempts at female <UNK> made by hollywood and the media br br <UNK> that however let us continue br br <UNK> character becomes more unbearable as the film go on yes she is a teenager and it is near <UNK> i mean who wants to fight evil during <UNK> the problem is when the evil starts to <UNK> himself wendy does not seem as freaked out as she should be she is extremely <UNK> even for someone like her she continues not to care about her training i will use this conversation as an example <UNK> if you do not win this battle evil will take over and everything good will be gone wendy <UNK> talk about pressure well let's talk about something else yes let's wendy let's also go dancing when you should rightfully be training of course <UNK> lets her but his character has an excuse better that he <UNK> with her than that he not and she not train at all and get them both killed br br oh speaking of which <UNK> also told wendy that it was his destiny for him to die for her in battle as he had for her great grandmother i am assuming that part br br this makes <UNK> actions more unforgivable br br as the script writer would have it <UNK> <UNK> and this great battle are on exactly the same day do you know what wendy does do you even have to guess yes she does end up going to the battle for when she tries to leave for <UNK> the monks who <UNK> had trapped in the body of her coach and teachers because she felt weird fighting an old man inform her that <UNK> has gone to battle alone so she goes to save him br br we initially see some half decent fighting that is actually entertaining until finally the great evil comes out of <UNK> rival for <UNK> body and creates the actual <UNK> of himself out of the broken pieces of the bodies of his ancient warriors br br don't ask br br anyway wendy gets all <UNK> then <UNK> goes and <UNK> her from this guy forgive me for forgetting his long chinese name and manages to get himself killed br br wendy catches <UNK> as he makes his long descent from being thrust <UNK> high into the air br br she screams title of said article out br br now it was bad enough that wendy became powerful far far too fast no i will not let it be <UNK> because it was her destiny and she had the power within her br br since when though did she learn healing no worst since when could she <UNK> people so <UNK> is raised from the dead then wendy and he fight the guy br br he loses way to easily the worst part is when they jump together and kick him at the same time and he is <UNK> forever then the monks <UNK> wendy on her sacrifice br br two things 1 don't the script writer and director know a battle needs a little more <UNK> to it 2 what sacrifice the fact that she didn't go to <UNK> because the girl did not break a sweat or even bleed i mean come on now this movie was tv pg i wanted to see somebody get hurt br br ah <UNK> moving on br br i know it sounds like maybe i should have given the movie a one based on my comments part of critique you must know though is breaking a thing down you don't necessarily try to look for the bad but if it's there you bring attention to it this movie has a lot of bad but something funny happens when you never really expect something to be all too great in the first place br br so i suppose it was all right not that me not saying it wasn't all right would've stopped anybody from watching it
<START> i've given <UNK> <UNK> a low score not because it was a bad movie but because it doesn't do anything worth <UNK> br br i've not seen any of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> work before but for the <UNK> me included <UNK> <UNK> is advertised as a homage to <UNK> <UNK> a japanese director whose last film was way way in <UNK> the film is an extremely sparse work containing very little dialogue story music or emotion br br <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> a <UNK> wandering character who spends her time in her local coffee shop or loosely investigating a <UNK> composer she likes <UNK> <UNK> plays her friend who works in a cd shop and occasionally <UNK> his <UNK> interest in trains and that's about all it br br we watch as <UNK> drinks coffee alone walks around waits for a train catches a train falls asleep on the train the kind of mundane reality anybody in japan can see on a daily basis <UNK> captures these ordinary moments of these characters life but without any meaning to these vignettes it's an entirely pointless film to make or watch
<START> i saw the new <UNK> and edited version yesterday and loved it then i went home and watched it with subtitles and i loved it i am ready to watch it again br br i am a sucker for the mild mannered secret identity and what could be more mild mannered than a <UNK> <UNK> the scenes where he reveals his super powers to his friends or absent <UNK> forgets to be meek are my <UNK> br br of course the martial arts are stunning there is really not much i can say about them if you are familiar with the hk style however if you are not we <UNK> <UNK> briefly and walker texas ranger was on we noticed that after every strike there was a cut not in black mask br br
<START> bad movie it´s too complicated for young children and too childish for grown ups i just saw it because <UNK> a robin williams fan and i was very disappointed
<START> happened upon a copy of this not mine and if i had spent my own money on this i'd be finding those responsible and demanding it back all i can say is this would be a terrible student film any understanding of the medium of film is absent acting is god awful the story would have been rejected from the original twilight zone series as unoriginal and lame and the change in tone of the lead character's reaction to the <UNK> is laughable br br i can only agree that the <UNK> reviews of this film are from friends and family i'm afraid it's not even <UNK> bad br br amateur in the extreme br br avoid avoid avoid
<START> good action show but nothing new this one took place high in the mountains which showed some nice scenery and such one man takes on a group of <UNK> the lead flies and he kicks butt it could have been called rambo goes to the <UNK> it was that pat it did have one very effective scene right at the first of the film which had me cringing in horror not a bad picture but just same ol' same ol'
<START> sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a <UNK> of its greatness i remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the re release of the <UNK> really nervous laughter it <UNK> just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of satan coming out of a 12 year old girl in the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic the wicker man however it made me think that this new <UNK> is about as scary as the south park character <UNK> the friendly forest monster with tv's patrick <UNK> for a leg and a <UNK> stalk for an arm who's favorite <UNK> is <UNK> wicker <UNK> br br 3 years ago a friend of mine in hollywood told me that he heard that nicolas cage was going to do a remake of the film i started laughing and my friend keith got mad at me <UNK> nicolas cage as a great actor i just didn't think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for <UNK> i was right gone is the <UNK> the outstanding original music the originality the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue instead we have horror movie clichés affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart like many of the countless hollywood remakes we have been <UNK> with lately this feels like we are watching 4th <UNK> on a <UNK> playing <UNK> br br the original film takes place on a remote scottish <UNK> where a scottish police officer is <UNK> there to find a missing young girl named <UNK> <UNK> in the new spin a california cop cage is <UNK> to an island of the coast of washington state by his ex girlfriend to find her missing daughter she sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago the crash still <UNK> him in part because the girl's body was never found yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north alone to help his ex girlfriend find her daughter he arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the <UNK> of <UNK> many of whom seem like they didn't get call backs for roles in the village and like the village it isn't long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here not even the <UNK> eyed blind sisters who speak in <UNK> br br i think that the opportunity in hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry i think someone like nicolas cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his <UNK> we needed a bad re make of the <UNK> like we needed yet another <UNK> <UNK> movie i'm starting to wonder if nicolas changed his <UNK> from coppola because he wanted to or because he was <UNK> with to do so
<START> i'm certainly glad that a film was made about carl <UNK> amazing life story coming as it did during the civil rights era brashear became an inspiration for people of all minority groups not willing to settle for a status expected br br brashear as played by cuba gooding jr leads by example in the conduct of the life he has chosen very similar to jackie robinson who integrated baseball and made it stick by his character and conduct as brashear gooding knows that he does not want the <UNK> life that his father carl <UNK> has and <UNK> makes it real clear to get more out of life than he's gotten br br but while harry truman integrated the armed services after world war ii the navy still has its <UNK> a black man can only be a cook or an <UNK> <UNK> the real fighting parts are denied him that's not good enough for gooding who applies to become a navy deep sea diver br br once at the diving school at <UNK> new jersey gooding gets it all thrown at him mostly by the master chief petty officer in charge robert deniro deniro may have some <UNK> prejudices but he's nevertheless a hero and one who can inspire if one can get passed racial <UNK> br br the best thing about men of honor is the chemistry between deniro and gooding they certainly come from different places but as they get to know each other both turn out to be men of honor br br other good performances to note are <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> wife and hal <UNK> as the head of the diving school a guy the navy just wish would <UNK> for reasons you'll see br br men of honor is an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change
<START> i've noticed that a lot of people who post on the <UNK> board seem to hate this show which i actually find very surprising i think it's one of the best british kids' shows there is it's a shame it's ending because it's very funny if a bit cheesy sometimes and has great characters the main character is a little like del boy although quite a lot smarter with his 2 best friends he tried to make a million pounds for his mum by starting an online business and <UNK> a <UNK> of <UNK> his friends are seymour who likes to cook and danny who is simple minded and the comic relief character throughout the show some characters have left and new ones have come in but it's always been entertaining and <UNK>
<START> this movie is beautifully designed there are no flaws not in the design of the set the lighting the sounds the plot the script is an <UNK> to a complex game where the participants are on a simple mission br br paxton is at his best in this role his mannerisms the <UNK> used in the tones of his voice are without <UNK> each shot <UNK> done surprises turn up one after another when the movie reaches past its first hour this may not be the best picture of the year but it's a gem that has been very well polished it's not for the simple mind
<START> i began watching a replay of this tv movie on a sunday afternoon thinking it was just another dumb airplane disaster flick i was wrong br br <UNK> clock is an intelligent political thriller that is far beyond the quality of most tv movies it could just as easily have made its debut on the big screen br br the cast is excellent including veteran actors richard dean anderson edward <UNK> robert <UNK> and robert <UNK> daphne <UNK> turns in one of her best performances as a medical <UNK> working for the cia and <UNK> jane <UNK> is also very good br br the dialogue is well written and the story is compelling throughout in fact the final hour is so filled with plot twists and suspense that you can't leave your seat for a second if you get a chance to see this movie <UNK> the time nearly four hours you will be richly rewarded
<START> this was a well written tale of the making of the batman sitcom and actually <UNK> our heroes on a great quest as well as offers their tv shows history unlike the <UNK> and <UNK> family documentary movies we not only get a look into the past and present lives of adam and burt but also get to see them back in action filled with <UNK> and <UNK> and the <UNK> s batman is back <UNK> well told tale that not only gives us a satisfactory closing to the batman series but fills the modern fan in on all the hollywood tales that about them that haven't been heard in 35 years br br kudos
<START> i love this movie my only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed br br it's true that frank sinatra does not get a chance to sing as much in this movie but it's also nice that it's not just another frank sinatra movie where it's mostly him doing the singing br br i actually thought it was better to use marlon <UNK> own voice as he has the voice that fits and i could not see someone with this great voice pulling off the gangster feel of his voice br br <UNK> <UNK> sit down you're <UNK> the boat is a foot <UNK> sing a long that i just love he is a hard act to follow with his version and i still like his the best br br vivian <UNK> is just excellent in this part and <UNK> <UNK> is my favorite of her songs br br i really thought jean simmons was perfect for this part maybe i would not have first considered her but after seeing her in the part it made sense br br michael <UNK> choreography is timeless if it were being re staged in the year 2008 i would not change a thing br br i find that many times something is lost from the stage version to the movie version but this kept the feel of the stage even though it was on film br br i thought the movie was well cast i performed in <UNK> versions of this and it's one of my favorites of that period
<START> wendigo is a pretty good psychological thriller the film has some great drama between the characters and some good creepy scenes the acting is good the characters act like a normal family the wendigo effects are good the deer form reminded me a little of the rabbit in <UNK> <UNK> br br the film sees a family going to stay at a house for a while but accidental hit a deer a group of hunters arrives and one of the hunters named <UNK> starts to argue with the dad george after the car is lifted they drive off to the house the son miles is a little <UNK> up about the deer but his parents try to tell him that it's natural for things like that to happen that night while he's in bed he starts to see weird things in bedroom the next day they go into to town and miles meets a man at the counter who gives him a little statue of the wendigo when miles shows kim the statue and tells her that a man at the counter gave it him the owner says the she only works there once returning home george takes his son <UNK> and while there <UNK> he's knocked off the board and miles is chases by the wind after gaining <UNK> they go looking for george they find him outside the house where he tells them he was shot in the hospital kim tells the sheriff that <UNK> may have shot him the <UNK> goes to <UNK> place where he's <UNK> over the head with a hammer as <UNK> drives down the road he finds that the wendigo is after him br br wendigo is a pretty good thriller that has some chilling moments check this out 10 10
<START> yeti curse of the snow demon starts aboard a plane full of american high school teens who are on their way to play a football game in japan unfortunately during a fierce thunder storm their plane crashes in the <UNK> unlucky really with some dead some alive the survivors have to think about themselves decide to wait it out until help comes however just when they think their luck couldn't get any worse they soon discover that a huge hairy yeti type <UNK> snowman creature wants to kill eat them all trapped cold starving fighting for survival will help reach the stranded teens in time br br yeah with a title like yeti curse of the snow demon it can only mean one thing that is that someone at the sci fi channel has made yet another <UNK> <UNK> although to give these things a bit of variety the sci fi channel here in the uk are now dubbing them as a <UNK> <UNK> as if that will make any difference directed by paul <UNK> one has to say that yeti curse of the snow <UNK> is a terrible film but a somewhat entertaining one at the same time sure it's bad but it's sort of fun at times too the basic premise is alright actually it's a sort of cross between alive 1993 with it's plane crash the survivors having to turn cannibal to survive the excellent gory killer bigfoot another legendary hairy monster exploitation flick night of the demon 1980 which i would defend with my last breath i have to say it's not exactly a marriage made in heaven but as i said it's fun at times if not exactly gripping or well written the character's are mostly annoying american teens there's the expected arguing there's the macho hero the strong female the coward who thinks only of himself so there's no <UNK> for originality there are some plot holes too if a plane load of people crash why only send two rangers on foot to search for them how are you going to dig a large hole line it with <UNK> sticks in the space of ten minutes why did the yeti not kill that bird at the end it had killed everyone else up to that point so why not her the <UNK> are actually two <UNK> running <UNK> twist isn't used to any effect at all either at least there's a good pace about the film it certainly moves along at a fair old pace i never found myself becoming bored with it there's some moderately gory action the film does have some fascination in seeing whether the kids are going to survive or not if they are going to eat their dead mates or not br br the one thing you can always say about these sci fi channel <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> is that the cgi computer effects will be laugh out loud hilarious so that proves to be the case yet again the plane crash at the start looks awful the yeti when it's cgi looks simply embarrassing jumping all over the place like it's on a <UNK> stick there one or two nice gore scenes including a ripped off arm a <UNK> head a ripped out heart some dead bodies some blood splatter the best bit when the yeti rips a guy in half beats him with his own ripped off legs before biting a big <UNK> out of them according to the imdb the actor playing the yeti took three a half hours to get into the suit the make up which seems like a long time since it's actually a pretty <UNK> looking creation apparently the original title was <UNK> curse of the snow demon with <UNK> meaning demon in <UNK> <UNK> so now you know br br this has reasonable production values considering the usual sci fi channel stuff they <UNK> out although the mountain location looks nothing like the harsh bleak <UNK> was probably <UNK> near some <UNK> resort somewhere during a lot of the daytime scenes it actually looks pleasantly warm the acting isn't that good i didn't think any of the girls looked that good either which didn't help br br yeti curse of the snow demon is another terrible <UNK> fi channel <UNK> <UNK> if i am honest that any sane person will not like but if your looking for a bit of horror themed fun then this isn't too bad there are one or two entertaining moments that make it somewhat watchable even if it's not very good
<START> when good times premiered in 1974 it was one the first black family sitcoms it centered on the poor chicago based evans family and their struggles to make ends most of the early episodes focused on the parents james and florida evans and their struggle to provide for the family john <UNK> and esther <UNK> were the best part of the show they were terrific actors and had great chemistry as james and florida evans they had three kids j j thelma and michael j j was the <UNK> chasing but well meaning teenage son who made up for his lack of <UNK> with artistic talent thelma was an attractive bright girl who was constantly <UNK> insults with j j michael was a near child <UNK> who was well educated on social issues and was destined to become a lawyer br br in 1976 the producers made a huge mistake by firing john <UNK> literally killing off his character this really changed the focus and not for the good i might add the shows began to focus more on j j and his <UNK> like behavior which <UNK> black viewers as well as series star esther <UNK> who left after the next season instead of a show that focused on key african american issues that existed in society at the time viewers got shows that were <UNK> with <UNK> chasing and fat jokes br br once esther <UNK> left the quality of the show suffered even more although it was still watchable it was no longer the great ground breaking show that it once was br br although esther <UNK> came back for the 1978 season it became obvious that the show was on its last legs all loose ends were tied up during that season and the show quietly faded off the air br br first three season a last three seasons c

<START> i have to agree with some of the other comments and even go a step further br br nothing about this film worked absolutely nothing <UNK> our central character makes the decision to become a surrogate mother in order to earn enough money to buy a restaurant but along the way fall for a wise ex <UNK> at the same time her friend <UNK> is trying to get her lawyer boyfriend to finally marry her she also happens to be sleeping with marlon who is desperately in love with her then there's <UNK> brother <UNK> who gets involved with a former coke addict <UNK> who reveals she was sexually abused by her adopted father on the <UNK> we also have the <UNK> who has an assortment of equally odd friends one of whom dies on the couch at the beginning of the film so far so good but after introducing these characters and story lines addressing life death grief and love in the first half the film simply loses direction br br if the writer had only selected one or two characters and allowed us to follow their stories maybe things would have been fine but equal screen time is given to all with the result that no one story or character is fully developed for instance why does <UNK> think she will be able to hand over her child in exchange for money especially when the <UNK> parents are a creepy <UNK> lawyer and his semi alcoholic and depressed wife why is <UNK> so desperate to marry a man who is a jerk and clearly doesn't love her how is it <UNK> manages to kick her coke habit overnight is <UNK> regularly drawn to women with overwhelming problems or is <UNK> the exception has <UNK> and <UNK> mother always been on the eccentric side or is it a more recent development why is <UNK> so keen on <UNK> that he has one in the middle of his living room why did <UNK> spend years in prison for stealing a car a relatively minor crime how does <UNK> manage to end up giving birth to <UNK> baby when there is no suggestion that they ever had sex br br these questions are <UNK> in the screenplay but sadly are never answered i can only assume they were answered in the original novel and that is why the writer felt the need to include it all in the script big mistake losing several subplots especially the <UNK> and marlon story which adds nothing to the overall film would have <UNK> things considerably and allowed more time to develop the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> characters who are clearly more central to the plot and underlying themes than anyone else br br add to that the most pedestrian directing style seen outside of the average soap opera and the result is a huge missed opportunity for all including <UNK> fox who does her best to rise above the material i'm not surprised that this appears to have been the director's last film as this effort shows no evidence of a visual style or ability to tell a moving and intelligent story
<START> this <UNK> is like a <UNK> <UNK> meal compared to ang lee's very good but very underrated 2003 the incredible hulk br br ang lee's the hulk is a comic book movie for the thinking person the hulk takes some time to appear about 40 minutes but when he does we see the conflict at our <UNK> core he does his best to avoid losing control but as he admits when he does give in to his rage he likes it br br now compare this to edward <UNK> turn where there is no display of conflict in his personality and he turns into the hulk whenever he becomes excited and his pulse rate hits 200 beats per minute not <UNK> not <UNK> but exactly 200 to this reviewer this felt akin to the introduction of <UNK> <UNK> in the phantom menace which tell how strong the force is with one as if mystical abilities can be <UNK> through a blood test in the 2008 movie all ed <UNK> bruce <UNK> has to do is to keep his pulse rate under 200 as <UNK> by a device <UNK> onto his <UNK> and for the record it is extremely difficult to get one's pulse rate up to 200 even through a very <UNK> run especially for a physically fit person br br emotions drive eric <UNK> hulk he has repressed memories of his mother's death and his father's role in his early life on the surface he is calm but there underneath there is significant anger enough rage to fuel the hulk when it is unleashed but the hulk never kills intentionally even his <UNK> mostly he just wants to get away or close to betty ross jennifer <UNK> he <UNK> his <UNK> and in one critical scene saves a fighter jet pursuing him from a <UNK> br br in the 2003 movie the visual effects are there but as necessary the action scenes and there are plenty of them are necessary to the plot unlike the 2008 movie where action is inserted for the sake of action br br in his quest to turn it into a fugitive story ed norton loses focus on how bruce <UNK> feels about the hulk to him the hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment went awry and louis <UNK> the director picking up on ed <UNK> cue fails to add any emotional dimension to the <UNK> hulk relationship the story can be summed up as <UNK> is pursued and hulk kicks butt <UNK> is <UNK> and hulk kick butt repeat as necessary br br the only thing that went against the 2003 movie is that it is perhaps not as true to the comic books as the 2008 version however even as i am a fan of the comics i would prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a <UNK> dream but has heart over the comics loyal but <UNK> and soulless 2008 version any day br br perhaps ang lee should have read more comics iron man also released in 2008 is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic book roots and has heart
<START> man oh man i've been <UNK> <UNK> not the right term there's a long list to watch this film and finally had the chance to do so and news are marvellous <UNK> spectacle br br for any von <UNK> <UNK> both <UNK> element of crime <UNK> dancer in the dark the five <UNK> etc europa is probably the <UNK> for its greatness in visual terms everything is beautifully somber and claustrophobic you really get the feeling of being inside this imaginary nightmarish time <UNK> taking from the masters of surreal cinema like <UNK> bergman till noir films of the 40's with <UNK> drops of avant guard von trier leads the art film scene as the well intended <UNK> movie maker of nowadays his <UNK> way of dealing with very intricate issues without being irrational hits the nerve of the viewer with the intent to cure some of the deepest wounds we feed in our <UNK> world br br as <UNK> as it seems i do believe people like von trier could help society in many ways in a <UNK> aspect the day films and filmmakers that carry this sort of power are no longer necessary as a tool for reflection perhaps it could be the start of a new era the age of emotional control over our fears this is what he offers to us constantly through his work over and over br br bravo
<START> dear friends and family br br i guess if one teen wants to become biblical with another teen then that's their eternal <UNK> just remember kids birth control doesn't mean <UNK> sex i don't care what the honor student says on the other hand even if the <UNK> aid quotes himself as a bit of a romantic guy he's still only hitting on a high school girl if she was my sister i'd eat this guys <UNK> br br other than that i found out that <UNK> don't kiss the same way the french do and that baseball players named <UNK> like delicate <UNK> br br i think i'd almost rather watch <UNK> rich one more time than suffer the <UNK> of this slip slap <UNK> thank you and good night
<START> so this was an hbo made for tv movie eh is that an excuse for such a pathetic plot and terrible acting such a shame to see jim belushi reduced to a role so repetitive shot at survived lies beaten up survives shot at lies and so ad <UNK> call that a script as for the brits embarrassing to see timothy <UNK> pathetic or was he just taking the p depends how much he was paid i guess attempt at a southern sheriff as for that other brit the <UNK> blond one what a w er there is a trend towards <UNK> these english speaking <UNK> super violent thugs lately perhaps thanks to mr <UNK> two movies succeed in entertaining and justify the violence by <UNK> use of irony and humour like pulp fiction does however this movie <UNK> and <UNK> the genre <UNK> one to miss
<START> wonderful film that mixes documentary and fiction in a way that makes the <UNK> question what is the extent of truth in documentary films or is there such a thing as an objective documentary
<START> i saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from nyc after 30 minutes i said to him you've got to be kidding is this some sort of joke he thought it was good i told him that i thought it was probably one of the <UNK> movies ever made what was it supposed to be i asked a propaganda movie made for children the plot is stupid the acting is the worst ever for most of the principals and frankly people who look at this sort of tripe and think it has anything to do with life love or even <UNK> of which it offers an incredibly idiotic view need some psychiatric help please if someone tries to get you to stick this in your dvd or video player consider it like you would a virus introduced into your computer it won't destroy your player but it will destroy your evening if they had made <UNK> in the <UNK> this would have won in every category ps it also goes under the dubious <UNK> of <UNK> to heaven
<START> <UNK> deadly beauty and lethal kicks make the movie <UNK> than it'd be otherwise the story is so poor and <UNK> character dies in such a foolish way that you wonder if <UNK> the ending they had thought of for this movie i wish somebody could tell that an alternative ending exists but i fear it doesn't as for the rest of the <UNK> well i'd say they simply didn't act very well although the blame should be put on the poor script this movie reminds me of rush hour 2 where zhang <UNK> dies in absurd way since she had been the only one who had stolen the show during the whole movie i could give this movie 2 5
<START> the summary pretty much sums it all up this is nowhere near as good as the original with a script co written by both stallone and james cameron at the same time he was also writing aliens most of the action was written by cameron and the political aspects were written by stallone br br sly was in the best condition physically as he was making this and rocky 4 and he does look in great shape or <UNK> up to the <UNK> on <UNK> depending on your own viewpoint or opinion br br rambo starts off in prison and is visited by colonel <UNK> who asks him to go on a special mission that could earn him a presidential <UNK> he eventually agrees and goes off to the <UNK> camp run by charles <UNK> playing a washington suit trying to pass himself off as former ex forces to <UNK> rambo br br the mission is to find out if there are any missing <UNK> still alive in camps in vietnam rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking was somewhere he had previously been a prisoner himself he is told it's not a rescue mission and he is there to take <UNK> photos only br br after a bad attempt at <UNK> from a plane he loses most of his <UNK> meets his contact who turns out to be a cute woman and travels down river with pirates to the camp br br he finds there are still prisoners and <UNK> one as the 3 flee from half the <UNK> army on their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but rambo kills them all and they are forced to carry on to the pick up point on foot after their boat is <UNK> and blown up with rambo almost on board br br rambo is betrayed again and abandoned as <UNK> orders the recall of the rescue helicopter it is clear as <UNK> returns to base to <UNK> him that no survivors were expected to be found br br steven <UNK> turns up as a russian <UNK> colonel and rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be pursued by more <UNK> troops and <UNK> killing many of them rambo finally steals a <UNK> and <UNK> most of the prisoners to return to his base br br he <UNK> the urge to kill <UNK> for <UNK> him but destroys the <UNK> centre br br a weak plot and very weak ending as rambo walks off into the sunset as a free man
<START> i remember my parents not understanding saturday night live when i was 15 they also did not understand rock n roll and many other things now that i am approaching their age i still remember and find i understand many of the things my kids love but this is pathetic i cannot say i have seen any by sarah except for a few appearances here and there they were reasonable i do not see her as anything special but this show is just so far below what i expected from her the imdb write up made it sound like potential so just for that i started watching the first episode i turned it off half way through anything else is better that that jokes that are meant for a 5 year old presented on a supposed adult program well sarah this adult is <UNK> moved to turn you off i just cant believe that someone actually <UNK> this insult to comedy only good thing i can say is that there are <UNK> many bad jokes <UNK> here saving other shows from such an embarrassment
<START> i realize that living in the western <UNK> of <UNK> during the <UNK> was brutal in fact it probably is still brutal today but was it monumental enough to <UNK> into a seemingly made for tv movie also women's rights were still budding in this nation during this time so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory and still show the realism of the era  would it make for good viewing honestly i don't know i have thought about this film for the past two days and i still can't seem to <UNK> the strength to say that it was a horrible film yet i can <UNK> tell you that it wasn't the greatest i have ever seen from several <UNK> styles of acting to two <UNK> actors playing devoid of emotion character to some of the most gruesome pg rated scenes to ever come out of late 70s cinema it is hard to fully get a good grasp on <UNK> was it good was it bad that may be up for you to view and decide yourself but until then here are moments i enjoyed and desperately hated br br this film continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very interesting scenes scenes where i wasn't sure what the director was doing or which direction he was headed but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole i thought the story as a whole was a very interesting historical tale i do not know much about living in <UNK> especially during the early <UNK> so this film captured that image in my mind the thought of very cold winters no neighbors for miles upon miles and this <UNK> esquire view <UNK> by corporate america it was refreshing to witness and sheer breathtaking to experience though the television there were scenes that really stood out in my mind like the cattle <UNK> scene the pig <UNK> scene and the <UNK> <UNK> that didn't survive their journey that just brought a true sense of realism to this story director richard <UNK> did a great job of bringing the view of <UNK> to the viewers but i am not sure he brought decent players to <UNK> the view br br while i will constantly compliment the scenery of this film i had trouble <UNK> with the actors that seemingly walked on the set and read their lines from cards on the side rip torn seemed out of place in his role as clyde stewart a loner that somehow finds a connection with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> randall the two as actors have no chemistry at all their scenes that they share together are pointless and honestly void of any emotion the <UNK> scene nearly had me in <UNK> because of the way these two veteran actors portrayed it the brave <UNK> does what she has to do to get the child out of her while clyde gives an <UNK> nod when she is done this is love was it supposed to be love i don't know i think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond but with torn and ferrell it felt like two actors just playing their parts other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse knocks on the door for food or shelter the constantly <UNK> and growing compassion that clyde had for <UNK> daughter i just didn't believe it the lack of true winter struggle and the entire land scene the land scene especially because i needed more explanation on what <UNK> was doing why she was doing it and why clyde would build her a house if they were married it was these simple events that if taken the time to explore would have made for a stronger film br br overall i will go middle of the road with this feature there were definitely elements that should have been explored deeper such as the relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate <UNK> goals of <UNK> but they were <UNK> with some beautiful scenes of our nation these <UNK> scenes which in the span of 100 years have changes from vast mountains to enormous <UNK> while there were some brilliant scenes of realism starring cattle and pigs i just felt as if we needed more depth was a key element lacking in this film which was overshadowed by <UNK> acting and a <UNK> story <UNK> could have <UNK> deeper into this <UNK> world but instead left open <UNK> and clichéd western characters ferrell carried her own but torn was completely miscast decent for a viewing but will not be picked up again by me br br grade out of
<START> this show is possibly the biggest <UNK> most generic steam pile i've seen in children's programming that's actually become successful the lead character johnny while i understand he's supposed to represent an ordinary kid isn't likable or even tolerable the jokes are lame overdone i e the <UNK> didn't see that coming gag come on that wasn't even funny the first time it's not even cute and lack any form of primitive wit or inspiration and lastly it's just plain ugly to look at while kids aren't especially critical of artistic talent they still prefer eye candy i can't stand watching the show because in a way the art style is just gross hideous in fact just plain crummy br br i just can't stand that this is getting so much <UNK> while i understand that nostalgia can be a little irrational and i shouldn't be getting my hopes up on it coming back i really miss the old cartoons bring back <UNK> laboratory the <UNK> girls anything but this crap i guess it's just <UNK> thinking though br br simply put i advise you don't waste your time on this show i believe that truly good cartoons are able to be enjoyed by the big kids too and this doesn't cut it
<START> obviously i didn't care for things to come aka the shape of things to come as much as most viewers that means that there is a good chance that you'll enjoy it more than i did at any rate you might find it useful to hear the film described from another point of view br br directed by william cameron <UNK> who had as much experience as a production designer and even more as an art director this is a film adaptation by h g wells of his own novel by the same name in my eyes it helps demonstrate why a great novelist may not necessarily turn out to be a great screenwriter br br the film opens in 1940 in a london like <UNK> war is <UNK> and the citizens of <UNK> are worried that it might reach them it does and it turns into a decades long affair that basically destroys civilization wells and <UNK> keep jumping forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its aftermath we see two pilots one <UNK> coming to terms with the consequences of their fighting we meet a post apocalyptic community ruled over by a would be <UNK> we meet a man from a <UNK> futuristic society we see the way that technology is changing and finally we're taken to the full realization of that futuristic society circa <UNK> where the leaders are <UNK> the merits of sending man to the moon br br that might all sound potentially very exciting but it just does not work as a film <UNK> the film is far too episodic with little to dramatically tie it together by the third segment i completely lost interest in trying to keep track of the characters i had barely been able to sort them out in the first couple segments there's a constant parade of new faces we don't get to learn anything about any of them br br it doesn't help that the individual segments with a couple exceptions tend to be <UNK> directed and edited they are also occasionally manipulative it can almost begin to feel like a propaganda film but maybe <UNK> the segments are also a bit cold and dry emotionally br br in fact one overlong section is more like a music video industrial <UNK> video if features shots of building the futuristic city with lots of large <UNK> lots of <UNK> and so on at one point a guy who looks like an astronaut waves at the camera through some kind of futuristic glass the music for this section is somewhere between <UNK> and an overblown horror score i can't say that things to come consists of engaging material in terms of drama br br but the common cry in support of things to come is that it is a film about ideas that may be true but there are a couple problems with it if looked at that way one it still doesn't make it work as a film that is as a visual and <UNK> dramatic artwork and two there are far too many ideas presented here br br the principle idea is that of war and what it does to <UNK> that's a fine thing to make a film about it's also remarkably <UNK> of world war ii as the things to come was scripted and filmed in <UNK> released in 1936 wells has some interesting things to say about war some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film for example the ending seems to suggest that another war is breaking out or will at any moment the overall message seems a <UNK> <UNK> wells seems to be showing that war is simply a part of human nature that cannot be <UNK> although it doesn't <UNK> progress in fact maybe it <UNK> progress at least <UNK> br br that would certainly be enough for one film however there are many more ideas here the scene between the two pilots is one of the more poignant scenes of the film it deals with a complex dilemma one pilot has shot the other down but is now coming to assist him but the pilot who was shot down was carrying a <UNK> gas that is now <UNK> across the field they can't both breathe the gas without harm a girl comes along they only have two <UNK> gas masks between them the pilot who was shot down offers his mask as he says he's dying anyway what to do it's not that this scene itself could be stretched out to feature length but the ideas the bizarre complex of both helping and trying to hurt each other in the midst of a war are enough to build a film on br br another example during the scenes featuring the would be <UNK> in the post apocalyptic environment there is a nasty <UNK> disease called the wandering sickness going around it turns victims into something like drunken zombies the usual <UNK> is to shoot victims on site in an attempt to <UNK> off the disease this material is dealt with as if it were an <UNK> it's a great idea and deserved its own film br br similarly wells presents the future society as having controversial <UNK> ideas that was enough for its own film too it's just impossible to effectively deal with so much stuff in 100 minutes especially when it's supposed to be the <UNK> of the film in <UNK> of dramatic attraction br br still there are reasons to give things to come at least one viewing if you're at all a sci fi buff this is a historically important film given <UNK> background the production and set designs are interesting even if the cinematography seems extremely dated it's also interesting to see how wells was either <UNK> or <UNK> humorous in his <UNK> i particularly enjoyed the means of <UNK> to the moon which was strongly reminiscent of george <UNK> <UNK> a trip to the moon aka le voyage <UNK> la <UNK> just don't expect too much from things to come
<START> this film is terrible you don't really need to read this review further if you are planning on watching it suffice to say don't unless you are studying how not to make a good movie br br the acting is horrendous serious amateur hour throughout the movie i thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like michael madsen only to find out that it is actually him a new low even for him br br the plot is terrible people who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before even by the standard of hollywood action flicks this is a terrible movie br br don't watch it go for a <UNK> instead at least you won't feel like killing yourself
<START> antonio <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> aka castle of blood of 1964 is a beautiful and incredibly haunting masterpiece of italian gothic horror and after mario <UNK> la <UNK> del <UNK> aka black sunday of 1960 and roger <UNK> pit and the <UNK> of <UNK> starring the great vincent price another must see that earned the wonderful barbara steele her more than deserved fame as the most important female horror icon in the history of motion pictures but not only is the beautiful and brilliant barbara steele one of my favorite actresses of all time the screenplay to <UNK> <UNK> was co written by no one less than the cinematic genius sergio <UNK> who directed such ingenious spaghetti western <UNK> as <UNK> 1966 and the great silence 1968 <UNK> number 2 in the field right after mario <UNK> director antonio <UNK> is one of the all time masters of gothic horror and castle of blood is <UNK> his greatest achievement hardly another film works so brilliantly in creating an incredibly haunting yet beautiful atmosphere as it is the case with this creepy masterpiece br br when he encounters the famous writer of brilliant macabre stories edgar allen poe in a gloomy london <UNK> young journalist alan foster georges <UNK> accepts a bet from a <UNK> that he can not spend a night in his haunted castle in the night of all <UNK> eve as soon as foster enters the eerie castle mysterious things start to happen after a little while however he encounters an enchanting resident of the castle the stunningly beautiful <UNK> <UNK> barbara steele the mysterious events so far however have only been <UNK> of the <UNK> the castle bears however br br the eerie castle setting alone would be sufficient to create a gloomy mood the excellent black and white cinematography and a great score by <UNK> <UNK> create an incredibly haunting atmosphere that is eerie beyond comparison the wonderful barbara steele is fantastic as always i simply can not find enough words to praise this wonderful actress no other actress has ever been capable of <UNK> ravishing beauty with the uncanny as it is the case with steele and no actress ever will besides steele the movie's cast contains another stunning beauty <UNK> <UNK> and she also delivers a great performance george <UNK> performance as alan foster is great and the rest of the performances are also very good castle of blood is outstanding in many <UNK> barbara steele delivers one of her best performances the cinematography and locations are beautifully haunting beyond comparison the atmosphere is incredibly eerie the film simply is a perfect whole of atmosphere gothic beauty and the art of terror in short castle of blood is one of the most atmospheric and greatest gothic horror films ever made and must not be missed by anyone interested in the genre 10 10
<START> a very weak movie mainly because of a poor story but also poor acting in the case of robert downey jr and irrational behaviour by many of the characters if you are someone who likes to switch your mind off and simply watch a movie for it's creativity or acting <UNK> then you may like this movie personally i can't do that with a drama and found this too far fetched br br i'm particularly annoyed when a main character that is supposed to be an intelligent person continually acts like a complete <UNK> in this movie if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in these situations there would be no movie br br the first highly unlikely act is when the main character a successful attorney named <UNK> played by kenneth branagh is leaving a party and happens upon a girl <UNK> <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> who is screaming that her car has been stolen they are standing around in a <UNK> <UNK> as he <UNK> her into accepting a ride home br br she tells him about her weird father who belongs to some kind of weird <UNK> and does crazy things when they arrive at her <UNK> shack in the <UNK> part of town they notice that her car is in the <UNK> also the house lights are on and some objects in the house have been broken br br things are very odd she's weird looking like a tramp she <UNK> in front of him until she's completely naked  oh yeah also the father's strange the house is a wreck everything should have told <UNK> hey this is too weird for me i'm out of here ' but not <UNK> he sleeps with her and then motivated by her story and sex takes up the case of trying to have her father committed it all screams set up br br then being the top flight attorney that he is he arrives late at the office wearing the same shirt he had on the night before a fact that all of the women in the office notice is it likely that a successful attorney would act like a 16 year old <UNK> has upset the police in some of his cases so when he goes to the police claiming with ample evidence that the father is <UNK> them the police ignore him i could have believed <UNK> assistance but no help at all not likely br br it's just too unlikely
<START> i don't know who could find fault with a simply human and funny film like this with lots of <UNK> for your heart i enjoyed each minute of it and guessed the ending half way through the movie but that did not disappoint me at all it will not only touch your heart but it's such a good family friendly film we need many more like these
<START> what an unfortunate mess is <UNK> i wanted to like this over the top anti film <UNK> and in fact found a number of moments with powerful <UNK> sadly those moments are few and far between while i appreciate some of what <UNK> was attempting any advantage <UNK> to by bare bones no budget cinematography was destroyed with some truly atrocious editing that <UNK> the movie not at all br br while bad acting <UNK> in low budget and big budget cinema <UNK> has some remarkably bad performances that are nearly painful to watch in particular the straight couple linda and young guy these are the two most poorly written characters offering almost nothing to the story the acting is so abysmal and neither actor seems capable of <UNK> <UNK> or cracking up as they <UNK> drop their lines with an appalling lack of skill the choppy editing almost lends the feeling that these roles were entirely gratuitous and dropped in to avoid the films being <UNK> cast as an oddball gay film it would have been better off as such br br with all that is going wrong for it there are several performances that seem to capture what <UNK> was hoping to get in particular the story <UNK> on bob and tim these are the two most richly drawn characters and offer the most <UNK> with genuinely captivating performances by nicholas t king bob and david <UNK> tim tim is a boxer with some serious issues remarkably low self <UNK> is disguised by an almost cartoon like arrogance that he wears like <UNK> <UNK> obsessed with tim the seemingly harmless yet ultimately creepy bob stalks the boxer in classic cat and mouse fashion when the tables are turned and hunter becomes the hunted the resulting in the film's only genuine emotional <UNK> in a film so <UNK> hard edged that's a compliment one character must have that <UNK> break through or breakdown as the case proves here and the final confrontation between bob and tim provide <UNK> and king opportunity to display some real acting chops br br as played by scott <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> tony and danny seem to be the focus of the movie and despite some <UNK> moments of their own including one truly disturbing scene revealing the sex violence obsession but they can't seem to escape a cartoon like <UNK> and it's difficult to look at or beyond their seeming one note <UNK> and find anything other than the obvious br br ultimately this same raw material could and should be used to tell this story in better fashion alas there really isn't much to recommend this yet the performances by <UNK> king and <UNK> really do offer something special and a glimpse of what might have been and are ultimately worth seeing
<START> well what can i say having just watched this fantastic film when my nerves are still <UNK> jacques <UNK> the director must be making quite a name for himself in france and rightly so vince <UNK> is no tom cruise and <UNK> <UNK> is no penelope <UNK> either but these two are fantastic actors and this is a taut and compelling thriller which starts off slowly with some clever character building and then starts to put tension on tension to a wonderful climax others have written about the plot so i will not say more than everyone in this film plays their role to perfection the director the actors right down to the cameraman and everything seems so real no stupid gun play the fighting when it happens is so credible the expressions the emotions it is almost as you are there as a <UNK> do yourself a favour get the dvd a bottle of wine turn the lights low take the phone off the hook and <UNK> yourself in this <UNK> thriller
<START> if you're going to put on a play within the prison walls why not go for the top playwright william shakespeare and if you are going to choose your cast from a whole lot of criminals serving long sentences for the most <UNK> crimes you can be sure there will be plenty of time for <UNK> in a kentucky <UNK> prison a courageous project such as this was <UNK> with amazing results this film shows how it was all <UNK> the <UNK> the <UNK> the set and <UNK> the final presentation of shakespeare's play the <UNK> it had not occurred to me before but there is an <UNK> between the setting of the play and the <UNK> prison in the play the ship <UNK> characters are confined to an island with no contact with the outside world prison life too is much like that br br with a simple painted back drop of a surrounding <UNK> the characters in a most pleasing assortment of costumes <UNK> out their lines to an <UNK> audience may be not quite as shakespeare intended but with good heart and true sincerity for sure br br more interesting than the play itself were the little cameos of each man behind his character one <UNK> saw the play as a lesson in forgiveness another as a redemption of his sins it was quite moving to see the men wipe away a tear as they spoke of murder shooting and <UNK> one had the feeling that they would all like to wind back the clock and <UNK> their brutal actions however as someone said the past was past and the present was the beginning of a new future at least the play gave temporary relief from the depressing thoughts of past events br br the prison authorities should be <UNK> for allowing the play to take place such an event would put kentucky on the map and hopefully other <UNK> might follow their good example it seems to me that everyone stands to <UNK> only the kentucky prison but the prisoners themselves who need to find new confidence and self <UNK> and be prepared for the day when they go out on <UNK>
<START> having just watched this movie i almost feel like having wasted 2 hours of my life but i guess there is some good in everything br br if i was to rate this as any other movie it can only receive 1 or 2 tops but if i grade it like a low budget <UNK> movie it may get 3 or 4 that is a movie is supposed to be <UNK> and without too long <UNK> of boredom or waste of time this movie isn't but i guess a lot of independent movies are about showing movie skills and considering this this movie has a few highlights if i am to comment on what the directors should take with them to their next project i guess the distorted sound effects had some quality they also manage to build some characters this however takes me to what they should leave out in their next project because the character building takes too long since it is mostly irrelevant for the movie plot neither should the long spaces of time dedicated to walking around be continued in the next project whats the point i guess this movie tries to be a little bit of everything building characters suspense and a plot and ends up being nothing not a lot br br this movie tries too much and too hard and i guess it should have been cut to a short film i could easily manage to find one hour of walking around or pointless dialogue to cut from the movie br br there is too much irrelevant things going on in this movie the story should have been more <UNK> i know there is supposed to be some mystery in this movie but a slight surprise to who the killer is doesn't make a mystery the story behind the mystery receives almost no attention during the film which leaves the final point as a quick an unsatisfying wrap up br br therefore i would like to say this movie was a nice try but i cant i hope the directors learn from their mistakes and produce a better product next time br br if you don't have an interest in <UNK> learning from producing low budget movies there is no need to watch this not even too see why everyone thinks its bad br br as others have stated i am pretty sure the many <UNK> given to this movie are from people somehow involved in the movie this movie could not receive a 10 judging from any remotely objective standpoint
<START> brando plays the ace jet pilot just back from shooting <UNK> down in the korean war on leave he discovers his <UNK> <UNK> falls in love the lovers both see the <UNK> of racism and the cruelty which conservative cultural <UNK> can bring to human relations br br this film is an excellent romance with a nice twist which rejects the racist conservative standards <UNK> at the time it was made in 1957 <UNK> will make you laugh and cry beware though sometimes the musical background will make you wish it was not there although irving <UNK> title song will <UNK> your memory for a very long time after your theatre lights come on again
<START> what can i say about the first film ever br br you can't rate this because it's not supposed to be entertaining but if you have to rate it you should give it a 10 it is stunning to see moving images from the year <UNK> this was one of the most important movies in history i wonder how it was to be one of the people who saw the first movie ever br br
<START> <UNK> is <UNK> first fiction film before this he directed great documentaries as animal love or models <UNK> worked on this project for more than 3 years but it only cost around 2 million dollars the actors are very good especially the non professional actors who nearly played themselves the cinematography is good too the whole film is shocking disturbing and some scenes may be too much for ordinary viewers the film shows a lot of sex and violence but also that people are lonely and not able to communicate with each other finally i've to say that this is one of the best and most rewarding <UNK> films in the past years please excuse my bad english br br
<START> may i please have my 13 00 back i would have rather watched <UNK> electric power comes to north america again this is a movie with one voice the same voice which comes out of every characters mouth regardless of age or gender to listen to that voice again i would have to charge at least 150 an hour and i don't take insurance it was eerie watching will ferrell <UNK> into woody but i don't think imaginative casting is enough one should wait until they have a story before they bother making a movie unless he's just doing it for the money and if that's the case why not just <UNK> an all rap version of what's up tiger lily
<START> i'm surprised that no one yet has mentioned that there are two versions of this same film the <UNK> share of the footage in both is identical but here is where they <UNK> in one version the version i have seen most often on broadcast tv the group of <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> consists of the <UNK> of the <UNK> a fictional <UNK> group of priests and brothers <UNK> by the church in the other version which i've seen only once on tv the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> are depicted as priests of the official church meaning the <UNK> of new york or perhaps brooklyn also in the former version in most of the <UNK> scenes the <UNK> are referred to as brothers and in some scenes you can see where the lips say father so and so but the dubbed audio says brother so and so in the latter version i believe everyone is referred to as father br br in any event it seems that one of these two versions is more or less a partial re shooting of the other with all <UNK> of the <UNK> scenes re shot as <UNK> scenes or vice versa kind of reminds me of the raymond <UNK> <UNK> scenes in godzilla i have <UNK> both versions off broadcast tv so no i'm not imagining this can anyone shed some more light on the story behind these two versions of the film
<START> i'm here again in your local shopping mall of course 'cause that's where the high school kids hang out to demonstrate how awful <UNK> poo prom <UNK> really is to prove how bad this joke of a <UNK> this is br br we're going to take these four <UNK> <UNK> and stuff them into this photo booth how <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> uh br br how awful is it it's so bad disney channel <UNK> away its money yet again with those exciting yet <UNK> 10 second <UNK> keeping the viewers wondering when is this going to be on and then suddenly when it does come on for one this not only got a higher tv rating than usual but this was only seen once oh no one time everyone plus this movie is about high school and stuff and believe me i will not go any further with what else is in there br br say <UNK> smile snap br br avoid this one at all costs 0 10
<START> i can't believe i actually watched this but i guess i just wanted to know if this movie would get unintentionally funnier and funnier towards the end and it did the climax was the <UNK> performance ever given by the <UNK> lawyer so out of real life that even for a fictional story it was far too weird no way anyone on this planet can behave in front of a court like she did and probably the worst <UNK> on earth why was he in court anyway he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove her guilty a simple search of her house would have resulted in the find of the rings but no go he preferred to say <UNK> 2 or 3 times during the whole trial that was it the blonde lunatic was given a truth drug to prove her innocent but not brett the lunatic almost had an <UNK> of brett in her home that could have proved her sick obsession but again no go during the court scene i felt the silent urge to take the <UNK> out of her hand and bang it several times against her head even real <UNK> do not look that silly fake i am innocent like she did and what does this movie tell us never marry a woman with a life insurance as soon as she falls down the stairs her husband will be thrown into jail guilty or not evil evil men
<START> as a <UNK> fan of dickens i have <UNK> been disappointed by adaptations of his novels br br although his works presented an extremely accurate re telling of human life at every level in victorian britain throughout them all was a <UNK> thread of humour that could be both playful or sarcastic as the narrative <UNK> in a way he was a literary <UNK> and <UNK> he could be serious and hilarious in the same sentence he <UNK> pride <UNK> arrogance celebrated modesty and <UNK> with loneliness and poverty it may be a cliché but he was a people's writer br br and it is the comedy that is so often missing from his interpretations at the time of writing oliver twist is being <UNK> in serial form on bbc television all of the misery and cruelty is their but non of the humour irony and savage <UNK> the result is just a dark dismal experience the story penned by a journalist rather than a novelist it's not really dickens at all br br <UNK> ' on the other hand is much closer to the mark the mockery of <UNK> is perfectly interpreted from the <UNK> <UNK> to the drunken <UNK> the classic stand off between the <UNK> and mr <UNK> in which the law is described as 'a ass a <UNK> couldn't have been better done harry <UNK> is an ideal choice br br but the <UNK> cruelty is also there the <UNK> indifference of the state the cold <UNK> poverty and loneliness are all presented just as surely as the master would have wished br br and then there is crime ron moody is a treasure as the sleazy jewish fence whilst oliver reid has bill sykes to perfection br br perhaps not surprisingly lionel bart himself a jew from <UNK> east end takes a liberty with fagin by re <UNK> him as a much more <UNK> fellow than was <UNK> original in the novel he was utterly ruthless sending some of his own boys to the <UNK> in order to protect himself though he was also caught and <UNK> whereas in the movie he is presented as something of a <UNK> father figure a sort of <UNK> thief rather than a <UNK> of children the latter being a long standing anti <UNK> sentiment otherwise very few liberties are taken with <UNK> original all of the most memorable elements are included just enough menace and violence is <UNK> to ensure narrative <UNK> whilst at the same time allowing for <UNK> sensibilities nancy is still beaten to death <UNK> <UNK> escapes drowning and bill sykes gets a <UNK> graphic come <UNK> br br every song is excellent though they do <UNK> towards <UNK> mark lester <UNK> his wonderfully both his and my favourite scene is the one in which the world comes alive to <UNK> will <UNK> it's <UNK> but it's dickens through and through br br i could go on i could <UNK> the wonderful set pieces the contrast of the rich and poor there is top quality acting from more british <UNK> than you could shake a stick at br br i ought to give it 10 points but i'm feeling more like scrooge today <UNK> it up with your christmas dinner no original has been better realised
<START> when i was a kid it was lex <UNK> time as tarzan i often heard from older people that johnny <UNK> was tarzan and i wouldn't understand why since i saw a couple of <UNK> last films in the character and i thought he was sort of out of shape it wasn't after many years that i came across tarzan and his mate and then i understood <UNK> is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other <UNK> such as barker gordon scott jock <UNK> <UNK> miller miles <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br as for this film i was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful maureen <UNK> a strong self minded active and no <UNK> woman as jane way ahead of the times in which the film was made tarzan pushes her into a pond naked as she is amused one of the <UNK> kisses her by surprise and though she doesn't kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and makes no big deal out of it such <UNK> were <UNK> with the <UNK> to come such as brenda <UNK> vanessa brown virginia huston or dorothy hart all playing sort of too perfect sweet vulnerable women making it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the african jungle br br <UNK> character's <UNK> personality steals the show out of tarzan himself except of course when it comes to action and <UNK> takes the lead easily the combination is perfect another highlight in the movie is <UNK> secondary role and not as the main lead like in later tarzan pictures where she often saves the day br br tarzan and his mate stands as a fine product in its genre tarzan films and perhaps as the best though i have to admit that i also enjoyed <UNK> greatest adventure 1959 made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast and in spite of the just acceptable gordon scott in the leading role with his too perfect all <UNK> physical looks that doesn't fit for a <UNK> ape man br br good for jane and her mate
<START> i like jane austin novels i love pride and prejudice and sense and sensibility books and movies and i'm half way through <UNK> park but i couldn't stand emma i gave up on the book after 2 chapters and by the end of the movie i couldn't care less about emma she didn't seem to change at all maybe it was <UNK> acting which as excellent in <UNK> or my lack of interest for the movie <UNK> br br the costumes are nice but the dancing was clumsy compared to pride and prejudice dancing by colin <UNK> and jennifer <UNK> br br i gave it a 2 basically for the fact <UNK> is bloody gorgeous and although it as a rather <UNK> performance for ewan <UNK> i liked his singing
<START> channel surfing and caught this on <UNK> it was one of those i have to watch this because it's so horribly bad moments like <UNK> without the joy the writing is atrocious completely inane and the acting is throw up in your mouth bad br br there's low budget and then there is the <UNK> which is where this epic should be tossed and never seen from again i mean the main characters go to a <UNK> <UNK> in some rented house and the house is well ordinary which is no big deal but they choose to show all the <UNK> <UNK> over it like it was the <UNK> <UNK> i'm sorry but watching 6 guys stare into every <UNK> boring room with a <UNK> in it and <UNK> is lame i guess they didn't learn anything from the bad news bears in breaking training see hotel room check scene wow a toilet <UNK> i don't buy the its all over the top so anything goes routine if it <UNK> like and it looks like well you know the rest br br avoid like the plague br br edit apparently other more close minded reviewers believe that since i disliked this movie i am an obvious <UNK> which i can only assume means i am <UNK> which of course is not true i decided to do this wacky crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the film and not by its mere presence i e its refreshing to see br br sure it may be refreshing to see but that doesn't <UNK> into a great movie just give them some better material to work with and <UNK> direction in fact i applaud the effort frankly i'd rather go listen to my <UNK> of distinction <UNK> than watch this again
<START> the good <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> define <UNK> as the <UNK> of <UNK> i may just be <UNK> for no word combination scares me more than when at the beginning of a film credits contain the words produced written and directed by ' and are followed by a single <UNK> name think about it there are <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> but so few jack of all <UNK> even the most seasoned of directors like <UNK> and scorsese rarely take such control of their films but there i was all <UNK> in my theatre seat popcorn in hand and about to watch the order when <UNK> at me like a nolan ryan <UNK> were the words produced written and directed by brian <UNK> <UNK> br br being a film buff i knew of brian <UNK> as a writer his <UNK> over the past 10 years would be <UNK> like a <UNK> <UNK> stock price in 1998 there were as many theatrical <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> conspiracy theory as there were critical and award winning <UNK> l a <UNK> <UNK> river they seemed to alternate  one good one bad so knowing that his last film <UNK> was one of the most wasted efforts in clint eastwood's career i took a breath and hoped for the best in retrospect i should not have <UNK> br br the order stars heath ledger <UNK> a knights tale as alex <UNK> a priest in an order known as the <UNK> who is <UNK> to rome when a fellow priest is killed under circumstances that the arch bishop <UNK> <UNK> meeting up with father thomas also of the order and played wonderfully by still <UNK> mark <UNK> they set out to piece together the <UNK> left behind in the wake of the <UNK> <UNK> death br br <UNK> matters is a sub plot involving <UNK> <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> who has escaped from an institution that was the result of her attempts to kill alex during an <UNK> alex has feelings towards <UNK> and for some reason <UNK> to the audience they travel to rome together br br <UNK> a good nights sleep goes by and alex is confronted by william <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who claims to be a centuries old sin eater a sin eater as we are told are those that eat the sins of a dying individual when the church does not thus allowing entrance into heaven william as luck would have it is tired of a life of healing and looks for alex to take over his role and free him from his <UNK> duties alex is reluctant but after the death of his new love <UNK> alex <UNK> to the ritual of the sin eater to save her and the transformation is complete alex then <UNK> for answers to his many <UNK> while father thomas <UNK> the <UNK> plot behind the passing of authority to his fellow investigator br br the order is not a terrible film but it is terribly boring there were ridiculous special effects and no connection with any of the characters even in the most dramatic scene that of alex walking in on the dying <UNK> is pale and bland and leaves us with no emotional response towards the <UNK> plight everybody seems to talk so quietly and <UNK> that the film flat lines and <UNK> <UNK> could have been <UNK> to keep me from trying to grab a quick <UNK> in the middle of the film br br so mr <UNK> i <UNK> with you not to try this again share your vision with others and allow those more experienced to help direct you in directions that are not so narrow minded and self serving until then there is nothing <UNK> that shows you are capable of anything more than a failing grade two stars br br
<START> what i like about spoilers teenager holly tyler amanda <UNK> goes to live with older sister valerie <UNK> <UNK> to avoid moving to japan with her father but she doesn't know the half of the wacky things that will happen to her from now on and not only to her but to her sister her friends gary wesley jonathan and tina alison <UNK> boyfriend henry michael <UNK> crush vince nick <UNK> <UNK> boyfriend jeff simon rex first boss then <UNK> then husband <UNK> dan <UNK> annoying colleague lauren leslie <UNK> and second boss peter if you don't have a funny bone in your body please skip this if you like only <UNK> sophisticated comedy this isn't for you if you like a funny sometimes touching show with two hot chicks who can act in the lead and none other than the fabulous <UNK> <UNK> from popular leslie <UNK> in the main cast then what the hell are you waiting for you're welcome to <UNK> de tyler what i like about you 2002 2006 8
<START> i just saw this movie on <UNK> after <UNK> <UNK> it i grew up watching f <UNK> and had a major hard for <UNK> jane so i was shocked literally shocked to find out after seeing this film that the <UNK> homicidal nurse was melody <UNK> who looks pretty good but also looks completely different and is unfortunately poorly photographed i would never have guessed it was her in a million years what the hell is she doing in a picture like this i agree with the guys here that the movie lacks what it's pushing no sex no gore no <UNK> it's also a remake of the atomic brain aka monstrosity 1964 or <UNK> most of the action is tedious the main character spends enormous amounts of time running around the crazed doctor's house and basement and the neighborhood in general or being <UNK> up by the cop all of it boring and time filling now if the italians would have made this half the film would have been the <UNK> uncle ernest jack <UNK> henchman <UNK> the unconscious nude girls but you only get that for 20 seconds
<START> one more of those brilliant young men who went all out and <UNK> to make a teen romance film can i actually call it that it would <UNK> the devil out of its fans on a <UNK> budget but packed with such taste <UNK> and maturity peter <UNK> you deserve more admiration and respect thanks once again for <UNK> to the powers that be in the industry that stereotypes can be <UNK> down the toilet one location a handful of rich characters low budget good acting and that too amateurs decent lighting <UNK> of true indie cinema should watch more of this and stop watching well you know what
<START> i don't know what it is about this movie director sam <UNK> somehow messed up just about every little aspect in this movie i would normally say that this is a movie that should not exist but this movie may be the most important of all time this movie should exist for the sole purpose of being without a doubt 'the worst movie ever <UNK> i've seen bad movies in my lifetime but this somehow breaks what i considered bad into something much more hard to imagine br br everything in this movie is hilarious but the single funniest thing is that <UNK> himself considers this to be a great movie br br oh wow
<START> ok so i rented this clown like chainsaw massacre esquire film not expected much but i did like the novel approach to a serial killer film from the back of the box is the following synopsis at first it was just a joke a myth around the <UNK> for five friends staying at a remote cabin in the texas woods but when they began to disappear one by one replaced by scattered <UNK> body parts and voodoo <UNK> the remaining few <UNK> for their lives but he's out there and he's sick and all he wants is blood so obviously from the get go it doesn't make sense why is this clown in the woods to begin with why a clown why are their dolls with the word food drawn on them why why why hardly anything gets answered in this 1 hour 30 min bore fest except where this clown lives the characters are dumb guys dumb girls and a hell of a lot of <UNK> one in particular is a girl whom they brought from a restaurant up the road whom they thought they should help because she was getting <UNK> by some guy she knew what <UNK> that as an excuse to bring a girl into your circle of friends or their cabin she of course begins <UNK> <UNK> of jealousy having the men have sex with her by feeding their dumb minds everything they want to hear br br the music was an average affair standard frantic keyboard music like in every horror film without differences the actors seemed to be brought from some soap opera the way they complained and <UNK> about everything the idea that the main guy in the film takes this girl to the cabin as their first date makes for a horrible date but of course she <UNK> gives herself to him on the first night of getting to know him there was hardly a budget spent of anything it seems but there was a clown outfit and plenty of cheap 1 store dolls lying around in the woods which was a horribly bland place to shoot this whole movie been done too many times i was also waiting for the clown to jump into the house to kill the remaining 4 characters of the film in through the glass maybe but nothing exciting like that ever entered the film i guess you were just supposed to like the clown being a killer or something br br i had to give the film a 3 it was an interesting premise clown as the texas chainsaw massacre character essentially and i'll give them a star for acting serious all the way through when the movie could've totally been a b movie style video but they <UNK> for the more legitimate style of video but ultimately i probably would've felt like renting the killer <UNK> from mars video again before going back to check this out ah but that cover art pretty awesome drawing
<START> although i love this movie i can barely watch it it is so real so i put it on tonight and <UNK> behind my bank of computers i remembered it vividly but just wanted to see if i could find something i hadn't seen before i didn't that's because it's so real to me br br another user wrote the ages of the <UNK> should be shown with their summary i'm all for that it's absolutely obvious that most of these people who've made comments about midnight cowboy may not have been born when it was released they are mentioning other movies jon voight and dustin hoffman have appeared in at a later time i'll be just as <UNK> frank i am <UNK> years old if you're familiar with some of my other comments you'll be aware that i was a professional female <UNK> for 60 of those years and also have appeared in film you'd never recognize me even if you were familiar with my night club persona do you think i know a lot about the characters in this film you bet i do br br and am not the least bit ashamed if you haven't run into some of them it's your loss but there's a huge chance you have but just didn't know it so many <UNK> <UNK> sons and daughters could surprise you it should be no secret many actors actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of midnight cowboy who is to judge i can name several current big time stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities and weren't the least bit damaged by their time spent there i make no judgment because these are humans just as we all are love courage kindness compassion intelligence <UNK> you name the attributes they are all there no matter what the package looks like br br the trivia about hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of <UNK> is a gem he can be seen driving his auto all around los angeles how do you think he gets his <UNK> i can also name lots of male stars who have stood on the streets and <UNK> the bars for money although the nightclub i last worked in for 26 years was world famous and <UNK> i can also name some huge stars that had to be constantly chased out our back street looking to make a pick up br br this should be no surprise today although it's definitely action in hollywood and other cities large and small wake up and smell the <UNK> they smell no less sweet because they are of a different <UNK> br br some of the users thought joe buck had been <UNK> by his grandma although i saw him in her bed with a boyfriend i didn't find any <UNK> of that believe it or not kids haven't always had their own rooms because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be going on in the master bedroom whose business hoffman may have <UNK> for change on the streets but some of the users point out that jon voight was not a major star for the filming of midnight cowboy his actual <UNK> would surprise you i think he was robbed no one can doubt the clarity he put into his role nor that it made him a star for such great work as deliverance he defined a potent man who had <UNK> his <UNK> and was the better for it few people commented he had been <UNK> in this movie the end of the 60s may have been one of the first films to be so open but society has always been hip br br i also did not find any homosexuality between <UNK> and joe they were clearly <UNK> unappealing to one another they found a much purely higher relationship true friendship if you didn't understand that at the end of the movie then you've wasted your time <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> devotion was apparent yes voight deserved an oscar for this role one that john wayne could never pull off and he was as handsome in his youth br br hoffman is hoffman you expect fireworks he gave them superbly wayne got his oscar every character in this film was beautifully defined if you don't think they are still around you are mistaken the party attend some of the <UNK> younger people attend if you can get in look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot <UNK> you'll see every outrageous personality br br brenda <UNK> was the epitome of <UNK> <UNK> women who have to get down to the <UNK> gritty at times if you were shocked by her brilliant acting thinking this isn't real look at today's ladies who live on the brink of <UNK> and are admired for it br br the brutality joe displayed in robbing the old guy unfortunately is also a part of life you don't have to <UNK> it but it's not too much different than any violence joe <UNK> named his purpose in that situation i'd have handed over the money <UNK> than he asked for it that's one of the scenes that makes this movie a break through one which i do not watch i get <UNK> for both br br john <UNK> certainly must have been familiar with this <UNK> to direct this <UNK> beautiful eye opener <UNK> salt didn't write from <UNK> anyone who had any part of getting it to the screen must have realized they were making history and should be proud for the honesty of it perhaps only in america can we close our eyes to unpleasant situations while other movie makers make no <UNK> in presenting it to the public not looking doesn't mean it isn't there give me the truth every time bravo to all
<START> i guess this goes to prove that joe don baker will do anything for a buck the concept of the film wasn't very good to start with this movie has so many bad things about it i don't know where to start the acting is horrible the cinematography is <UNK> at best the soundtrack was pretty bad the score is terrible there's a reason why this movie ended up on mystery science theater 3000 i voted before i wrote this and i cannot believe that 9 people actually thought this film is excellent they must have liked the two go go dancers final justice would be if they locked this stinker in the film vault outside <UNK> and never let anyone see it again a 1 out of 10 rating is far better than this deserves
<START> i was <UNK> into seeing this movie after reading a positive review from another website and man was i p <UNK> it took me at least 15 minutes to pick it up off the shelf b c i didn't want anyone to see me then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use real money to rent it i thought that all my stress would pay off by the time i got home to and watching the movie b c the review i read said the movie was a pleasant surprise what a joke if you can make it through the first hour of the movie then your in luck b c it's not until then the movie <UNK> into a horror don't bother with this one folks your better off watching <UNK> falls
<START> due to reading bad reviews and being told by friends that they couldn't believe how bad it was i didn't go and see this film at the cinema after watching it on dvd i have to say i regret that now i'm not saying it is brilliant but i would venture to say that it is a good movie i enjoyed it br br people have <UNK> <UNK> than <UNK> helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary if you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal i don't think <UNK> <UNK> has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact what kind of man ned kelly actually was is a matter of debate and quite passionate it seems in spite of the efforts of <UNK> and some historians ned kelly has become a legend legends are stories and stories say as much about those who tell and listen to them as they do about the actual figure himself ned kelly has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of australian culture that doesn't trust or accept authority a society in which there is no <UNK> or challenge to authority is <UNK> and more dangerous than any <UNK> br br so not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical kelly gang i actually found it a surprisingly <UNK> and refreshing movie it was sentimental and romantic but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been for my fellow <UNK> watch 'the <UNK> and you will see what i mean it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly perhaps the love affair business could have been <UNK> for a bit more detail in other areas such as the shooting of the troopers ironically i actually enjoyed the movie because of that because it would be those details that most of the focus on <UNK> story would <UNK> and they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different <UNK> given by the various historians br br this movie was always going to have a hard time having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market to pay the <UNK> and the legend as it means to <UNK> perhaps a little of <UNK> spirit is in this movie because i think it <UNK> against people's expectations and unfortunately missed both targets fortunately it made for an enjoyable <UNK> of a film for me it was an unexpected kind of movie about ned and that is why i liked it orlando <UNK> performance did a lot for the movie too he really added something i think he would have enjoyed being the monster instead of the pretty <UNK> for a change br br when you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one your opinion of this movie should be <UNK> send me this on dvd for christmas rather than croc <UNK> or the man from snowy river anytime
<START> there's a certain <UNK> i've always found in discovering the great semi unknown film these <UNK> have nearly always been dramatic films in my experience unknown sci fi action and horror are unknown for very very good reasons i found high tide on video at a junk store mixed in amongst countless dozens of tapes of varying quality of course that's the only place i would find it as it is still not on dvd br br while i was watching judy davis as <UNK> throughout the course of this film i was somehow certain i was watching a great <UNK> performance yes i had previously seen davis in several small parts and one starring role in a passage to india but although she was superb in the aforementioned film high tide is a different animal entirely since recently watching gillian <UNK> later film charlotte gray i was <UNK> aware of the sort of actress which <UNK> her davis draws much more than a passing resemblance to <UNK> <UNK> in both manner and sensibility br br judy <UNK> performance is stunning i cannot say enough good things about it she shares an amazing on screen relationship with young <UNK> <UNK> as ally this film's other great actress there's a lot of drama and quiet humanity they share together the details of which i won't presume to reveal here see it for yourself there's too much good in high tide to cover in one review indeed i would hardly care to the film speaks well enough for itself in conclusion i would like to praise screenwriter laura jones for her stunning dialogue director gillian armstrong for her understanding of actors and the great russell <UNK> for his brilliant understated cinematography please see his work in tender <UNK>
<START> i <UNK> for imdb just to comment on this movie br br i just got done sitting through this movie and the only thing that impressed me was that i somehow had the will power to not stop it br br i've seen a pretty decent number of action movies and what not but princess blade has some of the worst fights i've ever seen in a movie most of the sword fighting involves <UNK> swinging the swords back and fourth and hoping the <UNK> isn't doing the same i've seen a good many student films with better action and stronger plots br br so now we have a futuristic action movie with poor action and virtually no sign of the future br br most of the movie doesn't even have any action and shows the developing relationship with the princess and the <UNK> terrorist and his disturbed sister the movie has multiple plot lines and none of them really pan out to be worth anything br br part of the problem may have been that i watched the dub which was quite bad the entire cast <UNK> all their lines so it was hard to follow what was going on but i got the general idea knowing exactly what was said would not have saved the movie in my eyes br br if you've heard about this being a futuristic action ninja flick then you've heard wrong thats what i thought it was when i heard about it and now i've lost 90 minutes of my life don't let this happen to you steer well clear of it
<START> the most horrible retelling of a great series it should not have been named battlestar galactica because it's only the same in name alone too many changes to just have changes you have characters turned from male to female black to asian to <UNK> all in a way to attract female audiences when there was already strong female characters that could have just been made stronger gone are the egyptian feeling gone are the quest for earth the lack of <UNK> to go to terminator rejects takes away from the film especially when one is made a <UNK> granted the original show had a lot of cheese to it but it had a large following they tried to hold onto this following but give the fans nothing to work with and basically spit in their face as they make it their own story changes are good when they make something better not to just make them
<START> party girl <UNK> on the tremendous charm of parker posey in fact at times the movie seems to be a vehicle in which ms posey is allow to play herself as she normally is in real life br br the film directed by daisy von <UNK> <UNK> is a treat for ms <UNK> fans ms von <UNK> <UNK> takes us on a wild trip into lower manhattan to show us this <UNK> soul whose life is dedicated to have fun in the different <UNK> she constantly <UNK> this is an era that still was more naive than what that area and the <UNK> meat market <UNK> became at least there are no <UNK> in the films and we see down to earth people going about their lives in a normal way if we can call it that way br br parker posey makes an amazing mary it's because of parker posey we enjoy the movie more than if another actress would have played mary she is the whole picture the rest of the cast is good
<START> i'm watching this on the sci fi channel right now it's so horrible i can't stop watching it i'm a <UNK> and this movie makes me sad i feel bad for anyone associated with this movie some of the camera work is good most is very questionable there are a few decent actors in the flick too bad they're surrounded by what must have been the director's relatives that's the only way they could have been <UNK> to be in a movie music was a little better than the acting if you get around to watching this i hope it's because there was absolutely no other option the sequel yes sequel is coming on now i think i'll skip it jason
<START> while many unfortunately passed on the ballroom scene is still very much alive and carrying on their legacy some are still very much alive and quite well <UNK> is more <UNK> and beautiful than ever <UNK> ninja is very accomplished and gives a great deal of support to the gay community as a whole pepper <UNK> just passed on last year of natural cause may she rest in peace after <UNK> passing carmen became the mother of the house of <UNK> she was in the beach scene and she is looking more and more lovely as well some balls have categories dedicated to those who have passed may they all rest in peace there is currently another project <UNK> known as how do i look you can check out the website at www <UNK> <UNK>
<START> t <UNK> <UNK> made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s but he seems to be a filmmaker who cannot mature with the changing times styles and fashions he's like stuck with the same old fashioned film making style br br actors are not bad not good either anil kapoor generally acts convincingly his two roles of a father and his son but the flawed script often makes him look funny and pathetic <UNK> is good but then she's always good and here she's nothing more than such she makes the best of what she is given but she always does that in conclusion nothing great at all <UNK> is ok which means ordinary not bad not good nothing br br this film is melodramatic occasionally stupid maybe it's a <UNK> film well even then it still would be below standard the script is terrible the film is overdone and the story goes nowhere it feels like a film made in the early 1990s but the script makes it look even older the style is like from the 1950s br br don't recommend unless you're a big fan one of the starring actors
<START> perhaps in an attempt to find another hot property for adaptation the brothers <UNK> thought back to their highly successful <UNK> into the world of the newspaper comic strip with their production of <UNK> <UNK> the sailor <UNK> studios paramount although it was a part of the betty <UNK> series miss b only made a brief appearance in the short leaving the rest as a pilot episode for the possible <UNK> of a full blown series br br as is now common knowledge the gruff <UNK> eyed <UNK> <UNK> became perhaps the most successful cartoon series ever <UNK> and literally <UNK> the <UNK> and their studio lasting to this day br br returning to king features for another try at luck was no doubt the reason for trying out the very popular henry comic strip character in a betty <UNK> outing objective being the seeking of another series the reasoning then surely seemed sound henry was a most popular feature in the <UNK> <UNK> line up appearing as both a daily and on <UNK> color comics <UNK> <UNK> the comics weekly you know what fools these <UNK> be remember that one <UNK> in viewing the <UNK> little bald boy comic strip <UNK> and his on screen antics both solo and in <UNK> with miss betty we were pleasantly surprised in seeing just how well the character was handled the story and director dave <UNK> both <UNK> a <UNK> of comic strip like situations and sight gags that seemed most appropriate for the character of little henry these mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in remaining faithful to the <UNK> page as the henry feature was mostly done in a sort of 4 color <UNK> br br in the cartoon titled betty <UNK> with henry the funniest living american <UNK> studios paramount pictures corporation <UNK> we see what is basically being a one <UNK> exercise being <UNK> with the usual array of dave <UNK> rapid fire machine gun like gags in short henry spots a puppy in the window of betty <UNK> pet shop it is a sort of love at first sight as henry attempts to purchase the little <UNK> dog with the only money he had to <UNK> in his pocket he is in formed by miss <UNK> that it would be 2 00 in depression era money to make the purchase tears appear as the little guy leaves <UNK> br br but a <UNK> is soon on the horizon as betty asks the boy to mind the store while she leaves on <UNK> business in return for his services miss betty promises him the little dog in return of course they have a deal and betty leaves br br getting to the work of cleaning <UNK> and feeding the <UNK> <UNK> the opportunity for the <UNK> crew to fire up a whole new string of gags this time featuring bird seed <UNK> bald <UNK> and push <UNK> but not all at once of course <UNK> <UNK> enthusiasm for mass feeding of the <UNK> <UNK> population by first literally <UNK> his head soon leads to a mass <UNK> of the birds out of the store to the open street in a mass jail break br br betty returns to this sight and expresses her disappointment and anger with <UNK> temporary <UNK> care all <UNK> were off no <UNK> for henry he begins to leave <UNK> but soon convinces the <UNK> to give him another shot at <UNK> things up his head covered with bird seed he manages to <UNK> all of the little <UNK> creatures returning them to their pet store coop happily the little <UNK> leaves but this time he has his own <UNK> little face <UNK> puppy br br <UNK> this was a winning combination we have the <UNK> energy filled free <UNK> of the boy the kindness of betty and the emotions of the situation and <UNK> outcome of the <UNK> and his <UNK> situation max and dave <UNK> had given us a sort of almost minor mini masterpiece of a surreal comedy short br br we were quite surprised that no henry series followed judging by the fairly faithful treatment of the character it certainly could have been <UNK> for some time at any rate this <UNK> was in many ways the best of the betty <UNK> try out pictures although the first <UNK> the sailor <UNK> paramount 1933 was the most successful and barely had any betty <UNK> in it save for a cameo as a carnival <UNK> dancer the henry short was much better than the two following king features <UNK> betty <UNK> and the little king and betty <UNK> and little jimmy both 1936 br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the superb star quality of gerard <UNK> who died way too young leaps from the screen in this witty funny sly <UNK> comedy with plenty of sword <UNK> and <UNK> antics <UNK> <UNK> in its' storytelling impossible to resist a sweet romantic comedy with a very young gina <UNK> as the love interest a movie one will remember with great affection
<START> a sentimental story with a sentimental sound track it's about a little girl with a voice <UNK> who <UNK> her green parrot paulie the parrot thinks and talks like a human being and gives help and advice to his constant companion br br the parrot is definitely the star of the film at times mischievous and at times in fits of depression the bird captures the mood in a most remarkable and <UNK> way the <UNK> voice too is very well done and within a minute or two you can actually believe that this intelligent little bird exists br br early in the film her father gives the bird to a <UNK> and the subsequent scenes tell the story of <UNK> constant struggle over many years to be re united with his mistress one of the many memorable scenes is when he falls into bad company and is encouraged to spy on people using the automatic <UNK> machines paulie it seems has a phenomenal memory br br the ending is predictable but who would want it otherwise children will love this film and anybody who keeps a bird as a pet will delight in <UNK> antics
<START> first of all if <UNK> a fan of the comic well you'll be very disappointed i'm sure low budget movie <UNK> is supposed to be serbian in the comic now suddenly he becomes <UNK> <UNK> chicken producers it gave some spice and guts to the comic by the way in the film his father speaks serbian and he speaks <UNK> lol the striking n y <UNK> building becomes a common average small <UNK> in h k the good looking <UNK> becomes some <UNK> <UNK> turkish looking guy freddy the cool <UNK> pilot becomes some fat out of shape sad average guy simon <UNK> good buddy does not exist at all he gave some pepper <UNK> doesn't throw <UNK> at all but just some snake stares the whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious tv film french directors and producers if you don't have the money the ability or the technology to adapt correctly the comic please stick to some romance <UNK> in paris very very bad film good thing i just rented it don't count on me to watch the sequel if there is any
<START> i saw this on cable recently and kinda enjoyed it i've been reading the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half more than the first half personally i enjoyed the first story too bad that wasn't extended the second story i thought was cliched and that california dreaming if i hear that one more time <UNK> express is alright but it's not something that mainstream audiences will catch on to see like <UNK> tiger
<START> this is one of the best movies out there and that's saying a lot being that it was for television i really wish it was on d v d br br helen hunt gave such a raw performance she played a rookie cop thrown into serial killer case perfectly when she falls apart because he kills another kid it was amazing she is so alone so he gets to her when she talks about her mother wow br br steven <UNK> as the serial killer was so shocking he really brought her into his dark world it was oscar worthy when he talks about killing the kids scary when he realizes who she really is what a scene br br they really don't make them like that anymore it was a real thriller without being gory
<START> a little nonsense now and then is <UNK> by the <UNK> men br br if you are too smart to watch this movie then you are too smart to be alive br br wonderful romp wonderful premise period piece done with <UNK> eye for detail br br walter matthau meg ryan tim robbins et al just wonderful br br rent it sit down relax take it in smile a little enjoy yourself br br then thank me
<START> de palma's technique had hit its high maturity by the time of this film which is a wonderful showcase of his classic techniques though unfortunately as with many of the films written by de palma himself the story serves the <UNK> more than the interests of putting forth an emotionally compelling tale br br the story opens with a crazy scene in which angie dickinson <UNK> in a shower while she looks at her husband she is then grabbed and raped while he husband stands <UNK> <UNK> and the whole thing is revealed to be <UNK> fantasy as he husband is <UNK> <UNK> away at her in bed she has a short scene with her son a dead <UNK> for harry potter which concludes with a joke that she'll tell grandma that he is playing with his peter she then goes to her therapy session where she complains about her dead marriage before attempting to seduce her <UNK> michael caine he refuses and she is hurt and feeling unattractive and <UNK> br br then begins a <UNK> 22 minute nearly <UNK> sequence that is perhaps the highlight of the film among the many things de palma <UNK> from hitchcock is the understanding of film as a purely visual medium of telling <UNK> and in typical de palma fashion he turns this into a way to show off his <UNK> skill the problem for me is that in this instance one begins to feel that scenes are being needlessly <UNK> simply to further show off the director's skill br br the sequence begins with angie at an art museum she watches strangers all involved in sexual or family activities then begins to get turned on to a man sitting next to her de palma very <UNK> tells an extremely complicated narrative without a single word about <UNK> attraction embarrassment <UNK> and finally finding and <UNK> to the stranger in the back of a taxi cab all set to a wonderfully lush score by <UNK> <UNK> who also scored carrie br br in the second part of the sequence angie has slept with the guy and gets up to return to her husband again de palma <UNK> a ton of narrative in without a word of dialogue <UNK> as angie realizes that she doesn't have her <UNK> that her husband is already home and no doubt wondering where she is that she has probably <UNK> a <UNK> disease and that she has lost her engagement ring somewhere in the <UNK> it's all very admirable but one begins to feel a little strung along as we are forced to do things like take a long elevator ride down from the seventh floor then up again almost in real time br br spoilers from here on out when angie reaches the seventh floor again she is killed by a big woman with blond hair the woman <UNK> away at her until she reaches the ground floor when the door opens and nancy allen sees her there there is a wonderful slow motion sequence as nancy reaches into the elevator angie reaches up toward her and the killer's blade is held <UNK> to slash <UNK> hands then follow some <UNK> shots as nancy looks up and sees the killer in the <UNK> <UNK> mirror it's all good and by the time we have some dialogue again you think <UNK> that was just 22 straight minutes of purely visual narrative or maybe you don't but i do br br a younger dennis <UNK> has a great part as a sleazy and tough new york detective who would rather that everyone else do his work for him he interviews michael caine making the outrageous <UNK> though it passes as <UNK> that angie wanted to be killed <UNK> son is there as well and he <UNK> up with nancy and they set about to spy on <UNK> <UNK> and find out who the killer is br br once again there is a strong tie to a hitchcock film in this case psycho just as obsession is a re working of vertigo you have a woman who we are supposed to understand is secretly a slut who gets killed in the first 30 minutes in an <UNK> space in this case an elevator rather than a shower then the relatives of the deceased conduct an investigation which reveals that the killer is a man who dresses as a woman to kill de palma even throws in a doctor at the end who explains the psychology of the whole thing br br it is very interesting but at the same time a viewer can begin to feel a bit <UNK> around and that is my primary <UNK> about this film it is definitely essential viewing and showcases some of de palma's greatest <UNK> but that feeling that the story is running a solid third behind the need for de palma to show off and his somewhat <UNK> sexual fantasies makes it hard to look back on this one with whole hearted affection br br check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies cinema de <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> i have to hand it to the creative team behind these american pie movies direct to dvd typically is <UNK> with cheap incompetent film making yet last year i was pleasantly surprised when i found myself thoroughly enjoying the dvd sequel the naked mile the filmmakers took advantage of the opportunity to deliver a raunchy yet funny little film this year they offer up the <UNK> <UNK> house this is the honest truth <UNK> house makes the first few american pie movies look like the little mermaid br br this is no holds <UNK> tasteless laugh out loud fun sure the story is a bit thin but that's the beauty of the whole thing within the first 10 minutes we're introduced to the all the main characters the new supporting characters get a handful of raunchy gags meet the villains and establish the general plot line with all that out of the way the movie becomes a no limits ride the gags are a plenty and they did not hold back in this one i'm talking male <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> chicks with <UNK> sex with sheep female <UNK> <UNK> and plenty more not to mention the fact that not a minute goes by without boobs or a sex scene br br returning from the naked mile are john white jake <UNK> steve <UNK> and eugene levy in a similar supporting role as the last few films the entire cast does fine work steve <UNK> dwight <UNK> in particular has a great energy and screen presence i predict good things for him the film is also loaded with great movie references for those who keep their eyes open by far the biggest laugh of the film for me was the <UNK> parody classic br br the bottom line is if you're a fan of the series you'll feel right at home with <UNK> house it really pushes the limits of good taste but in the end is pretty damn funny
<START> i am a very big jim carrey fan i laughed my ass off during liar liar and ace <UNK> i also like him in his serious movies especially truman show this one is a cross between his very funny side and his serious side he is of course very funny in this movie but there are parts that are very serious and he pulls it off with a lot of ease he is <UNK> a multi function actor br br as for the rest of the cast i was happy with jennifer <UNK> acting i think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass morgan freeman makes a very cool god as for steven carell his limited scenes are very funny especially in the anchor scene br br overall i would have to rate this a 9 good acting funny script and some very serious situations make this a very good film
<START> i can understand those who dislike this movie cause of a lack of knowledge br br first of all those girls are not geisha but <UNK> <UNK> and one that don't know the difference will not understand half of the movie and certainly not the end this is a complete art work about the women's life and needs in this era everything is important and certainly the way they dress all over the movie means more than words to those who thought it was a boring geisha movie i'll suggest you to read a bit about this society before making a conclusion that is so out of the reality this is <UNK> work of is life and i'm sure that the director understood the silent meaning of <UNK> piece to the right intellectual range
<START> it really is a shame that films like this never <UNK> best picture nominations because this one is simply a winner this is by far the most consistently hilarious comedy i have ever seen its screenplay and design are impeccable not to mention the incredible cast i can quote this movie for hours on end watch it
<START> <UNK> was a memorable movie that bring to the celluloid a great director like <UNK> kumar the movie followed with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> all of whom were superb br br but then every successful director gives a few horrible movies <UNK> some hits too <UNK> <UNK> is one such movie br br though the comedies are told nicely but then they fail the viewer to laugh comparing with the kind of comedy movies being made today this is a dumb br br if you really want to watch a movie and laugh please don't watch this because the pathetic comedy will make you cry only br br in short the movie is worth a miss
<START> as long as there's been 3d technology 1950's i think there's been animation made for it i remember specifically a donald duck cartoon with chip and <UNK> in it i don't remember the name at the moment but the plot was that donald worked at a circus was feeding an elephant <UNK> and chip and <UNK> were stealing the <UNK> this was made to watch in 3d probably 1960's if you happened to watch meet the <UNK> in 3d in theaters they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of it's origin there are probably somewhere around 100 cartoons made specifically to be viewed through 3d glasses this claim was a bad move because it's not difficult to prove them wrong on top of that this just looks like a bad movie
<START> have not watched kids films for some years so i missed here come the <UNK> when it first came out never even saw bad news bears even though in the '70s i worked for the guys who arranged <UNK> for that movie warriors man who would be king and rocky horror picture show among others now i like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on just minutes into this movie i could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things at least watching for his her appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting weren't doing the job lo and behold i <UNK> wes craven's name in the credits as an <UNK> <UNK> he'd already made two or three of his early <UNK> but had not yet created <UNK> krueger or made the scream movies maybe he <UNK> a favor and helped out on this <UNK> more surprising was fred j lincoln in the cast credits as <UNK> a wacky character in the movie f j lincoln from the '70s to just a few years ago appeared in and produced adult films he was associated with the adult spoof the <UNK> and just that title is funnier than all of <UNK> attempts at humor combined let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel
<START> while traveling in the mountains a man is attached by a mysterious creature that promptly <UNK> leaving no trace of its presence <UNK> to the man he has been attacked by a werewolf and now he's inherited the curse associated with such creatures now our hero must race against time to rid himself of this dreadful <UNK> before the next full moon according to the dvd <UNK> synopsis br br <UNK> re produced from the original spanish the fury of the wolf man loses whatever charms it may have possessed in its original form <UNK> paul <UNK> werewolf characterization is uneven and <UNK> <UNK> scientist <UNK> <UNK> and sexy assistant <UNK> <UNK> never get close enough to truly <UNK> the often incoherent storyline isn't even <UNK> amusing
<START> this movie has to be my favorite of all time its not supposed to have a plot because its makers wanted people charlie sheen i think to believe it was a real snuff film this was an exercise in visual effects and doesn't cut away when the action happens like every other film does movies these days are now all about sound effects leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with cgi blood there still are movie makers who still can't get fake blood to look like the real thing there is no rape scene because that wasn't the point of making the film have you seen the hills have eyes 2 the rape scene was funny instead of shocking although i'm sure there are some <UNK> porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror but since they probably suck at making films they probably wouldn't be able to pull it off the movie <UNK> <UNK> has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks br br its too bad that a movie can't be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all especially when talking about an <UNK> or <UNK> 17 rating i'm sure eli roth has the ability talent to make his hostel film series much much better but he has too tame it down to get an r rating or at least i hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations br br watch <UNK> of death or more than <UNK> <UNK> if you want no <UNK> real footage accident crime scenes footage don't forget that this movie was made in 1985 the fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film that would be like someone saying the <UNK> super mario brothers sucks because the <UNK> has better graphics
<START> having been a fan of <UNK> i was sorely disappointed in <UNK> <UNK> while certainly a funny movie <UNK> mob boss character was a far cry from the lovable lieutenant he's played for so many years especially with the offensive language he used after <UNK> <UNK> i was honestly both surprised by and <UNK> on mr peter falk however having just seen <UNK> john <UNK> and its predecessor 'a town without <UNK> for the first time within a week of each other i have to say that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> delightful character in both movies is surely as memorable and lovable as <UNK> while parts of the movie are quite predictable such scenes in no way take away from the enjoyment of seeing the story played out i too wish i had recorded both of these heartwarming christmas movies and i highly recommend them whether you're a falk fan a christmas nut or simply someone who enjoys the occasional feel good movie of the week this movie may end up lost among the <UNK> of made for tv holiday flicks so be sure to find <UNK> john <UNK> before it's too late
<START> yes this movie is bad what's worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title in the entire movie zombies and vampires fight each other once or twice on top of that we're never really sure if the main character in the movie is definitely a vampire one might argue they were trying to tone it down or make it realistic but it ends up just boring more than half of this movie takes place in a car the scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to <UNK> about either also there's no clear antagonist and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie br br however i will say that for a film this low in production value the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and <UNK> with either an <UNK> score or <UNK> music from elsewhere br br i'm all for independent films but it doesn't look like this was ever intended for a mass audience if any br br worse than scarecrow <UNK>
<START> <UNK> films of this nature come across as a mixed bag of great work along with slight drivel to fill the runtime whether it be the big name support or the project itself paris je t'aime never falls into this realm i believe i can truly say that the movie as a whole is better than its parts between the wonderful transitions and the fantastic ending sequence <UNK> characters together in one last view of love in paris i think the film would have suffered if any <UNK> was removed true there are definitely a few <UNK> that <UNK> the rest but in the end i have a lasting image even if just a split second of each short <UNK> love takes many forms and the talent here rises to the occasion to surprise and move the audience through <UNK> poetry and <UNK> of the <UNK> many <UNK> br br <UNK> des <UNK> <UNK> maggie <UNK> surprises as a drug <UNK> actress shooting in paris and meeting with her dealer the reveal at its conclusion leaves you a bit off balance as the <UNK> between the two changes hands br br <UNK> latin ben <UNK> and gena rowlands <UNK> a relationship from an old <UNK> film bring some great sharp wit and sarcasm as they meet to discuss their impending divorce what of

<START> gordon parks the prolific black life magazine photographer made a true <UNK> <UNK> of a movie here one that does not mess around based upon the true story of two nyc cops later dubbed batman and robin who <UNK> employed radical tactics to clean up their <UNK> neighborhood of drugs this is a cop buddy movie before that term became a repetitive formula lightning paced there is not one <UNK> throwaway scene here br br man early '70s nyc must have been a terrible place to be a police officer from the looks of movies like this and <UNK> these two cops start out as safety division <UNK> <UNK> dealers in <UNK> in their spare time but instead of receiving applause from the city police department they receive nothing but resistance and <UNK> from their peers they have to <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> of police and legal corruption <UNK> <UNK> meant to keep them from their work on the streets ruthless drug <UNK> and a nasty ghetto neighborhood br br both david <UNK> and ron <UNK> are fantastic in the leads part of the entertainment is watching <UNK> eyes <UNK> around <UNK> in every scene in what is a flawless comic performance and <UNK> acting is low key and <UNK> these two make all the comedy aspects of the story work displaying a <UNK> frustration mixed with <UNK> determination director parks who was already known for his coverage of controversial subjects in his photography does not shy away from the <UNK> of the story rather the movie is <UNK> in portrayal of the <UNK> of the world of police and streets criminals that these two men inhabit adding to this realism is the fact that the real <UNK> and <UNK> acted as technical <UNK> for the film and even appear in surreal cameo roles as two fellow officers who <UNK> the protagonists it is a real tribute to the <UNK> of <UNK> direction that he manages to perfectly balance this depressing <UNK> with bright comedy br br why has mgm <UNK> let this sit on the shelf for 30 years barely giving it a home video or dvd release in the u s it is a minor masterpiece from the 1970s
<START> late great grade z drive in exploitation filmmaker par excellence al <UNK> really <UNK> himself with this <UNK> ghastly sci fi soft core musical comedy atrocity which <UNK> deliciously dismal and dopey depths in sheer celluloid silliness and jaw dropping stupidity in the grim <UNK> future of <UNK> sex has been deemed an illegal act by the big brother like <UNK> bumbling idiot the <UNK> an <UNK> goofy <UNK> fuller however <UNK> cinderella <UNK> blonde <UNK> pie catherine <UNK> remains determined to change things for the better with the help of her <UNK> fairy godfather a <UNK> campy jay b <UNK> cinderella <UNK> a grand <UNK> ball with the specific plan of <UNK> handsome stud tom prince the <UNK> vaughn armstrong and teaching everyone that making love is a positive <UNK> and wholly acceptable activity br br <UNK> directs this ridiculous yarn with his <UNK> all thumbs incompetence staging the incredibly <UNK> song and dance sequences with a totally <UNK> lack of skill and flair the <UNK> abysmal we all need love number with people in absurd animal costumes <UNK> <UNK> about the forest is a hilariously horrendous marvel <UNK> the equally <UNK> <UNK> man routine featuring a bunch of clumsily <UNK> robots louis <UNK> crude static cinematography the tacky plastic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> disco score the <UNK> gratuitous nudity ravishing brunette <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> special praise in this particular department the brain numbingly <UNK> attempts at <UNK> <UNK> humor <UNK> the robot law <UNK> is especially irritating and the uniformly terrible performances <UNK> <UNK> outrageously hammy portrayal of <UNK> wicked overbearing stepmother cops the big <UNK> prize here further enhance the strikingly <UNK> cheesiness to be <UNK> in this <UNK> dreadful <UNK>
<START> this could be a 10 if it wasn't for the quite predictable and hollywood ish scenario daniel day lewis <UNK> its position as one of the leading actors of our time why not the leading may i ask and the rest of the cast stand in a very high level i personally was impressed with hugh <UNK> connor who played christy brown as a child the very first scene i watched him was really strong wow
<START> without wishing to be a <UNK> brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films i've ever seen this being one of them and camp blood being another br br the acting is terrible the print is shoddy and everything about this film screams seriously you could do better yourself maybe this is a challenge to everyone to <UNK> youtube with our own zombie related crap br br i bought this for <UNK> but remember you can't put a price on <UNK> minutes of your life you'd do well to avoid this turkey even at a bargain basement price
<START> oh man i know what your thinking with a title like that i can't go wrong uh yes you can i too loved the title but man i hated the stupid kid that played <UNK> little <UNK> i hated the mom too and the sister daughter and her boyfriend i hated all those people man it was agony watching this sometimes the only reason this doesn't get 1 10 is <UNK> <UNK> the low budget they did ok but oh man did i hate those actors so stupid i knew it was going to be bad i guess they saved a lot of money on just using halloween masks for the killer and the jesus costume at the end was really stupid too oh the agony do not watch
<START> so what's in those missing 10 minutes that were so horrible they had to cut them out from the original film we were three years into the film production code barbara stanwyck had starred in the original play but here carole lombard plays maggie king co star fred macmurray is probably best known for double <UNK> with stanwyck as well as his hit tv show my three sons keep an eye out for a young dorothy <UNK> bob hope movies and the too fabulous franklin <UNK> who <UNK> up just about every film put on tape of course he works in the beauty <UNK> on the ship add the sublime charles <UNK> and anthony quinn good timing and clever banter at the beginning <UNK> buddy ella is played by jean dixon who was the best friend in holiday and my man <UNK> in swing high maggie the tourist meets a soldier who is leaving the army maggie misses her boat when it leaves <UNK> and gets <UNK> up with the soldier the dashing 20 something quinn has a small scene at the local bar in <UNK> where johnson macmurray has been playing the <UNK> maggie harry <UNK> and <UNK> band together and try to figure out how to get back to the states some good singing by <UNK> good but brief acting performance by cecil cunningham as <UNK> the wise helpful owner of the local saloon in <UNK> while others have <UNK> at how bad it is it wasn't so awful and is even a little exotic with the fake central america locale setting for the first half of the film
<START> it aired on tv yesterday so i decided to check it out this was one of the last bruce <UNK> paul <UNK> <UNK> projects related to their old 1992 batman the animated series after that jeff <UNK> came along and re imagined batman with his new the batman series but anyway the story of this new batman movie centers around the appearance of a new vigilante known as batwoman however batman feels the need to stop her because of her extreme methods and also in the meantime take down the <UNK> and <UNK> thorn who both are secretly working with <UNK> <UNK> who's having family troubles and another villain which is later revealed in the movie on a weapons <UNK> operation they also put a bounty on the batwoman the question is who is this mysterious batwoman and is it possible that they could be more then one it's up to batman to solve this mystery and stop <UNK> latest operation for an animated movie it has a fairly complex plot and a serious tone which is good another plus was the complete <UNK> of the penguin who looks much more like the sophisticated mob boss we're used to seeing in the comics unlike his previous designs that borrowed elements from tim burton vision of <UNK> <UNK> rat and circus freak even though the movie contains a love subplot it's never carried that far and doesn't <UNK> the movie like say batman forever the voice acting is standard quality for these direct to video projects if only batman mask of phantasm took this route kevin <UNK> still shines as batman bruce wayne and like i said despite running for some very short 80 minutes it manages to make a pretty good and complex storyline complete with a few minor twists and bucket loads of action there are a few <UNK> however <UNK> is nowhere to be seen and i'm sure barbara gordon and bruce wayne don't click as a couple even though is just <UNK> tim drake aka robin does very little in the movie and to be quite frank i was never a big fan of paul <UNK> and bruce <UNK> batman character design especially in their batman shows post <UNK> this the new adventures of batman and robin well it kinda makes batman look fat then rather a well built <UNK> up individual kinda like the jeff <UNK> character model from the batman bruce wayne seems a bit awkward those blue eyes make him look more like clark kent then bruce though it's true they do look very much alike another downside is rupert throne no explanation as to why he is in this deal but it's safe to say he's has <UNK> and what's a cut of the deal which does very little more then hang out with the <UNK> or get himself hurt every time he points a gun at someone count how many times this happens in the movie and you'll be surprised overall a good batman animated movie worth at least a rental
<START> this movie is just plain silly almost every scene has some bit of humor running gags slapstick and great jokes the acting isn't that great and the plot is cliche but the jokes more than make up for that if you have a chance to see this movie i recommend that you do
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a movie that has a title that sounds so familiar i thought i had seen it more than once now that i finally i have seen it i am very glad this is one of the better italian movies i know with one of the most wonderful performances by <UNK> mastroianni who stars in other masterpieces such as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> 1 <UNK> both from the great <UNK> fellini directed by <UNK> <UNK> this is a movie that takes the time to introduce the characters and slowly develops a story on a special day the day <UNK> hitler visited rome br br <UNK> mastroianni plays <UNK> the neighbor of <UNK> sophia loren she is a member of <UNK> party pretty fanatic in her thoughts and he is a member no more the reason for that i will not reveal on the day every person from their building including her husband and children is out to see hitler they are still in the building <UNK> bird escapes and flies to <UNK> apartment and this is how the two meet right before <UNK> went to <UNK> he thought of killing himself again for reasons i will not reveal how the story develops from here i will not reveal but it is what happens between the two that makes this such a special day not the fact that hitler is in rome br br like i said mastroianni has a wonderful performance you see he is a man who desperately wants someone around him although at first we don't know why may be he likes <UNK> may be he is in love with her may be there are other reasons <UNK> feels what we feel what does this man want from her she likes the attention anyway we see how she does her hair to look attractive for the man loren plays the scenes very good as well we understand her questions although we can't be sure what her intentions are the moments where we find out both their secrets if that is what you can call it is a great moment how the story develops from there is even more interesting but i don't want to spoil it for you this is a movie you should see great performances and a beautiful cinematography and the message it gives us still stands today
<START> what a load of <UNK> hollywood <UNK> this movie <UNK> <UNK> as brave and noble if it be for <UNK> principles the fairytale ends with the <UNK> character played by <UNK> washington actually getting promoted for his <UNK> what is it with these hollywood tools is this still <UNK> for <UNK> br br if i sound cynical it's because i am fed up with movies <UNK> a political agenda the military <UNK> in this movie are portrayed as what else <UNK> ho war <UNK> sound familiar ever see a movie where the cia or any government agency is not evil think about it yet again <UNK> tide <UNK> the point the hackman character u boat captain <UNK> comes across like a raving lunatic until the very end when of course he comes to his senses does a complete <UNK> <UNK> his blood lust suggests a promotion for the <UNK> ron hunter and <UNK> by <UNK> from the service a guy <UNK> takes command of your boat puts the u s at grave risk of receiving a nuclear first strike and you promote him what <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> cia fbi <UNK> and all other <UNK> agency in the world should watch this movie to gain information as to how to spy on people as mst3k commentary states it <UNK> has the dirt on every <UNK> <UNK> reach far and wide there is no hiding from the <UNK> organization br br from <UNK> that can spy over millions of miles to ears that can hear everything its amazing that the cia doesn't have santa on the <UNK> br br <UNK> dance routine is hilarious pitch he is so useless br br the cheese factor in of this movie is tremendous very low budget but so fun to watch i recommend watching the mystery science theatre 3000 version for even more laughs br br you even get a laugh at the <UNK> of the good kids br br i give this a 1 for production quality and a 10 for pure cheese and fun factor
<START> i never watched the <UNK> action <UNK> show and until reading the other comments here did not know that this movie was the <UNK> from that competition i was just flipping channels and came across this and found myself watching dare eagerly all the way to the end br br yes the <UNK> been done the most dangerous game etc but i was hoping for and almost received the <UNK> how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end i think the high tech was overdone <UNK> and gave me cold sweat flashbacks of night rider but it nevertheless was not too overdone br br the basic problem i had with this movie was the degree of <UNK> suspension of disbelief that was required of the viewer do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could <UNK> countless <UNK> <UNK> at a public bridge and no cops show up to investigate could a <UNK> do countless <UNK> in a las vegas <UNK> and no cops show up <UNK> way too much of that type of thing fun to watch but keep it at least plausible thank you very much br br the final solution was good but the ending was disappointing with the after taste of a bad star trek episode at least now i understand why the acting was so cheesy except for zane who doesn't get near as much work as he deserves imho they were winners from a reality show br br knock me out
<START> midnight cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969 drawing an x rating by today's standards it would be hard pressed to pull an r rating jon voight who has been better is competent in his role as joe buck an out of town <UNK> wanting to make it big with the ladies in new york city he meets a seedy street hustler named ratso rizzo who tries to <UNK> buck for his own purposes the two eventually <UNK> a bond that is both touching and pathetic as ratso dustin hoffman simply shines hoffman has often been brilliant but never more so than in this portrayal he is so into character that all else around him <UNK> in comparison losing the academy award to john wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the academy of motion picture arts and <UNK> director <UNK> has a <UNK> hand with his production but this film has a <UNK> <UNK> that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer worth seeing for <UNK> performance alone
<START> van damme what else can i say bill goldberg there we go now we know this movie is going to be really horrible br br i saw the first five minutes of this movie on <UNK> knowing it would be bad but not even i thought it would be this bad the plot is awful van damme is getting old finally but unlike arnold his movies are as well br br forget this movie don't see it ever i wouldn't even be paid to see this film br br 1 5 stars at its heart lies a wonderful action packed thrill ride br br well maybe not but the <UNK> would sure like us to think so wouldn't they br br john <UNK>
<START> i don't think any player in hollywood history lasted as long as david niven did given most of the weak films he had to carry by <UNK> of his incredible charm he could act got an oscar for it but most of the material he did was as light as one <UNK> of two <UNK> <UNK> paper br br happy go lovely is a case in point it's a musical and for the most part you'll remember vera <UNK> dancing you'll remember that they are in <UNK> costume as the film is set in <UNK> during their festival but if you can recall a single song from it you must have a <UNK> memory br br the plot is light vera ellen is the american lead in a musical that apparently is getting its out of town <UNK> in <UNK> she starts in the chorus and runs late one day she gets a lift from the <UNK> of a millionaire <UNK> card king everybody now assumes she's the main squeeze of the millionaire doors open up as they've never opened before br br the millionaire is david niven and he goes along with it and the various situations that are <UNK> by the mistake <UNK> romero has some good moments here as the frantic producer of this musical br br in the end though happy go lovely is light and harmless fluff which david niven did so much of and got so tired of
<START> really it's nothing much i only recommend watching it if 1 you're a big fan of any of the main stars 2 if you really want to check out the first time lucille ball was seen with red hair br br 4 out of 10 stars
<START> i was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers i saw it one late night on tv and it hit the spot i actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared yet i remember it pretty well with a nice twist or two and an interesting ambiance on a <UNK> farm michael <UNK> looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the <UNK> early promise of his career and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead i definitely recommend it as a rental although some of the themes which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989 now may seem tame which is a shame considering that contemporary <UNK> is often just used as a necessary marketing tool sort of like <UNK> just to get noticed
<START> john van <UNK> bell book and candle is a delightful and unexpected fantasy about a <UNK> of modern day witches living in new york city it was obviously an attractive movie property it had a stellar part for gillian <UNK> for her <UNK> book <UNK> <UNK> sweetheart shepherd henderson and her <UNK> family and circle including <UNK> <UNK> fiancée the hateful <UNK> <UNK> against whose chances with <UNK> gillian begins her magical spell casting it even had <UNK> a <UNK> cat familiar with well timed <UNK> sidney <UNK> a fake witch expert with atrocious <UNK> and bad manners in short it seemed to its producer perhaps box office magic and so it proved to be so many things were right about its production it only had one element not perfect but i found the rest to be amusing charming and very consistently entertaining to begin with the screenplay by daniel <UNK> kept the best qualities of the fine theatrical play but opened out its scenes to include <UNK> village and other areas of new <UNK> scene the technical production was beautiful with cinematography by the legendary james wong <UNK> a fine score by george <UNK> more than clever sets by louis <UNK> and <UNK> by jean louis in the attractive cast were <UNK> <UNK> howard <UNK> <UNK> rule as <UNK> ernie <UNK> as <UNK> jack lemmon as <UNK> mischievous brother wonderful <UNK> elsa <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as fellow witches and lovely kim novak in one of her most touching parts as gillian jimmy stewart was the <UNK> element in my judgment he did well with the comedic portions of his part but he was never convincing as a new york book <UNK> and a bit too old for the part of henderson anyhow but director richard <UNK> used subtle lighting pace changes and unusually composed shots to indicate the <UNK> of the witch portions of the film keeping the other portions very <UNK> but straightforward in their presentation the <UNK> main crisis in the film comes to pass when in reality gillian falls for henderson who does not believe in witches at all she started out merely to alienate him from his fiancée her stuck up college rival later when henderson tries to walk out he keeps coming back to her and realizes he is under a spell as she has <UNK> tried to explain to him meanwhile sidney <UNK> has been <UNK> by <UNK> spell to come to new york to sell his book to henderson of course he knows nothing at all of magic but is quite puzzled and interested to find out why he had come anywhere at all but <UNK> brother <UNK> him all comes out right in the end in this romantic satire as gillian proves her love to henderson by losing her powers which is what happens to witches when they truly love a mortal of course he never really wanted to resist her anyhow the film has <UNK> dialogue charm and a little magic of its own in the <UNK> charm of the witches and the <UNK> gillian must <UNK> in her battle with herself and to win the man she loves a lovely ending to this beautifully photographed and unusual romance makes its amazing realism though a fantasy just about complete in my view <UNK> delightful
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> reign supreme in the <UNK> <UNK> hamlet of <UNK> hills the town <UNK> <UNK> tough <UNK> vietnam veteran aaron a wonderfully <UNK> and engaging performance by kris kristofferson and several of his fellow vet buddies to clean up the place the plan goes sour when aaron and his cruel <UNK> decide to take over <UNK> hills after they get rid of all the bad elements it's up to <UNK> decent do <UNK> brother ben <UNK> played by jan michael vincent to put a stop to him before things get too out of hand writer director george miami blues gross <UNK> blank <UNK> <UNK> up a delightfully amoral cynical and <UNK> <UNK> redneck drive in exploitation contemporary western winner he expertly creates a gritty no nonsense tone keeps the pace <UNK> and <UNK> throughout and stages the <UNK> action scenes with considerable muscular <UNK> the rousing explosive climax is especially strong and stirring the first rate cast of familiar b feature faces <UNK> as a major asset victoria principal as ben's sweet <UNK> girlfriend linda the fabulous <UNK> peters as <UNK> saloon singer little dee brad <UNK> as the <UNK> mayor david doyle as a slimy bank president andrew stevens as an <UNK> gas station attendant john carpenter movie regular charles <UNK> as one of the <UNK> vets anthony <UNK> as a smarmy casino manager john <UNK> as a <UNK> old diner owner paul <UNK> as a mean strong arm <UNK> bully and dick miller as a talentless piano player moral don't hire other people to do your dirty work william <UNK> slick cinematography <UNK> <UNK> lively <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> score and the <UNK> raw violence further add to the overall trashy fun of this <UNK> neglected little <UNK>
<START> i watched this movie every chance i got back in the seventies when it came out on cable it was my introduction to harlem which has fascinated me and bill <UNK> ever since i was still very young and the movie made a big impression on me it was great to see a movie about other young girls growing up trying to decide whom they wanted to be and making some bad choices as well as good ones i was <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> beauty the great dresses they eventually got to wear and the snappy dialogue as someone being raised by a single mother as well i could really identify with these girls and their lives it's funny these characters seem almost more real to me than <UNK> <UNK>
<START> <UNK> was great with million hotel i don't know how he came up with this film the idea of giving the situation after <UNK> and the view of american society is hopeful that makes it 2 out of ten but this is not a movie is that the best someone can do with a great idea the west east clash there are important things going on in middle east and it is just <UNK> on the screen of a mac with the fingers of an <UNK> girl who is actually at the level of stupidity because she is just ignorant about the facts the characters are not well shaped and the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me at the ending scene <UNK> says lets just be quiet and try to listen and the background music says i will pray the thing is not about religion actually but it ends up with this how you are gonna see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray the lights are already shining on the truth its just that nobody wants to see it ps my home is not a place it is people the only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence but it is wasted behind this film making by the way as someone mentioned below <UNK> finest young man are not finest they are just the poor and the hopeless ones who sign up for the army in need of good <UNK> which is not provided by the government
<START> <UNK> early film noir won an oscar some of the reviews here go into extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism and rate it very highly i can almost see where they are coming from but i prefer to take a more toned down approach to a long forgotten film that appears to have been shot on practically no budget and in quasi documentary fashion <UNK> plague is loose in the streets of new orleans and it is up to a military doctor widmark and a city detective douglas to <UNK> the main <UNK> palance the film is moody shot in stark black and white and makes very good use of locations widmark is wonderful as usual forget the symbolism crime equals disease and disease equals crime and just enjoy the chase it is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century as it is of a particular style that was very short lived post wwii through the early 1950s and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher for those who will be watching this for the first time sit tight for the big chase at the end it is something else and frankly i don't know how they filmed some of it i can say it probably took as long to film the finale as it did the first 90 percent of the movie
<START> i tend to love everything the great late paul naschy r i p ever was in while not all films starring naschy are great they all have a specific charm that can be found nowhere but in naschy flicks and they are always entertaining there is no rule without exception however as el <UNK> del <UNK> aka the devil's possessed 1974 proves while the film does have the specific naschy flick charm it sadly drags far too much and gets really really dull in between naschy stars as the evil baron <UNK> de <UNK> who <UNK> the people and uses black magic and bloody <UNK> to stay in power when <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who fought side by side with <UNK> de <UNK> against the british learns about the <UNK> evil behavior he decides to turn against his former <UNK> in arms and help the people free themselves from the satanic <UNK> <UNK> br br directed by <UNK> <UNK> who is best known for directing naschy in la <UNK> de <UNK> the werewolf vs the vampire woman 1971 the film was scripted by naschy himself naschy often scripted his own films and one must say that he mostly did a better more original job than it is the case here el <UNK> del <UNK> is mostly built up as a historical adventure rather than a horror film and it gets quite boring throughout the middle it often resembles the sword and <UNK> films from the 50s only that this film is set in medieval times the satanic part was probably only added because the great paul <UNK> name is linked to the horror genre the film has its good parts paul naschy giving weird speeches paul naschy looking weird paul naschy doing satanic stuff paul naschy torturing innocent victims etc but sadly most of the film concentrates on the boring hero and the good guys and these moments are boring the female cast members are nice to look at but unlike most naschy films this one features no nudity and sleaze there is some gore but it mostly looks clumsy and isn't as fun too look at as it is the case with most other naschy films overall el <UNK> del <UNK> is only worth a look for my fellow naschy <UNK> there are dozens of films starring the spanish horror <UNK> which should be seen before this one such as el <UNK> de la <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> 1973 la <UNK> de los <UNK> the hanging woman 1973 el <UNK> <UNK> de la <UNK> horror rises from the tomb 1973 <UNK> de <UNK> panic beats 1983 <UNK> <UNK> 2004 or any of the <UNK> <UNK> werewolf films r i p paul naschy legends never die
<START> i participate in a <UNK> <UNK> and this film was shown after we had already seen a not so great film and <UNK> in a 40 minute discussion even though it was incredibly late and we were weary the entire audience really enjoyed it br br personally i thought the film was hilarious in all the right spots and i loved the quirky cast of characters they really grow on you in the film
<START> i absolutely despise this movie no wonder jose <UNK> <UNK> it at one point and refuses to discuss it i admire <UNK> work especially his more obscure slasher sex maniac thrillers like savage lust or scream and die his work has a kind of <UNK> <UNK> about it that he can't seem to switch off <UNK> in part to his secondary career as a painter <UNK> it's too bad he never made a western his vision would have been perfect br br black <UNK> is easily his most notorious film and probably his best known after the masterpiece <UNK> and it's <UNK> revolves around one scene where a satanic <UNK> <UNK> a bizarre <UNK> involving <UNK> the <UNK> fluid of a goat <UNK> the beast as some kind of nauseating <UNK> to be used in preparing the <UNK> like sister of a murdered man for her role as the bride of satan the scene in question is staged in a way that looks rather convincing even without the display of any <UNK> <UNK> the goat may have been <UNK> with relying upon the <UNK> of the actress <UNK> to play the <UNK> in the ritual and lots of <UNK> <UNK> on the film's recycled musical score heard in a half dozen films attributed to <UNK> <UNK> the perverse nature of the scene is more implied than shown in graphic detail <UNK> somewhat by the knowledge that said <UNK> is actually the teen aged daughter of the satanic priest my but they had fun <UNK> this movie br br the problem with it is that there isn't much to <UNK> or contemplate aside from the paper thin rosemary's baby derived story of a woman being <UNK> into her role as <UNK> bride by a sophisticated <UNK> of <UNK> living in the <UNK> <UNK> of a very sinister britain led by <UNK> sensation <UNK> line these <UNK> are comprised of doctors lawyers land <UNK> <UNK> and other upper <UNK> <UNK> who actually owe their professional success to their worship of the devil all you have to do is sell your soul and the world can be yours only watch out whom you may sell out to pay back petty personal conflict or you may end up being <UNK> with a sword br br the film attempts to combine this <UNK> satanic trip with <UNK> or borderline graphic sex and should correctly be regarded as a kind of <UNK> or <UNK> of the sex and horror spanish thriller traditions <UNK> in part by mr <UNK> ms line and which had amazingly <UNK> under the <UNK> eye of one <UNK> franco the dictator who controlled spain up until 1976 while he lived his <UNK> was that spanish cinema was to be free of graphic depictions of on screen sex spanish directors often made two versions of their films one with the sex <UNK> for their own screens and one with the <UNK> on display for <UNK> as difficult as it was for the filmmakers to express themselves the result was a sort of interesting tension that usually results when artists <UNK> with the forbidden spanish horror from the 1970s has a very special flavor to it that is somewhat of an acquired taste it's not for everyone br br but in a bizarre turn of events without <UNK> influence on their culture spanish horror sort of <UNK> up in the late 1970s when their gothic <UNK> and demonic <UNK> suddenly found themselves <UNK> when compared to new <UNK> like jaws and the star wars phenomenon and without <UNK> constraints their were suddenly a <UNK> of overtly graphic thrillers that came <UNK> out of the <UNK> in the very late 70s early 80s of which black <UNK> is perhaps the best known due to it's emphasis on sexual <UNK> with a <UNK> animal <UNK> major horror films have always <UNK> around sexual <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> the incest of scream and die <UNK> but here the effect of the <UNK> is to <UNK> the rest of the production nobody cares about anything else but the <UNK> <UNK> trip to the goat <UNK> and watching a cut version without the scene in the <UNK> is almost an exercise in <UNK> the sex isn't graphic enough to rate as porn and the chills aren't chilling enough to rate as horror br br so black <UNK> is essentially a behavior study here is how high society british <UNK> might behave in their secluded <UNK> out in the west <UNK> or whatever between sex scenes the actors actresses sit around and have lots of discussions the best thing the film has going for it is an undeniably oppressive atmosphere of <UNK> with most of it's action taking place in the tightly confined interiors of ms <UNK> character's mansion nearly every <UNK> of <UNK> is hinted at so fans of soft core sex <UNK> with a <UNK> of supernatural horror will be amused and of course the <UNK> sex criminals amongst us will enjoy <UNK> their <UNK> to the goat <UNK> scene but the ultimate conclusion of the film is silly pretentious intelligence insulting and probably perfect for such an otherwise forgettable exercise in applied sleaze br br 2 10 without the goat <UNK> this movie just isn't the same and with the scene it's probably a bit too much for most viewers <UNK> was correct to <UNK> it
<START> i am a fan of the nightmare series but this one is horrible the deaths are so trendy if you were to watch this 20 years later the whole <UNK> scene is outdated i did like the flashbacks i think they should have just made a prequel about when he was still alive that would have been more interesting this is a movie you can take or leave depends on how much spare time you have
<START> it's really annoying when good movies like this one go <UNK> but i'm glad i did not miss it br br they should re release it with a lot more publicity i do not think they did anything to promote it great work paxton br br
<START> i have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the <UNK> worst attempts at one a lot of the scenes work in a plug and play manner inserted strictly to <UNK> to the romantic comedy genre usually this is okay because we're dealing with a genre but the challenge generally <UNK> in making it original new and inventive this movie fails to do so br br there is no sense of who the characters really are apart from <UNK> <UNK> who is the real star of this movie not isabelle <UNK> they fit into this one dimensional cliché and they become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrative br br the pacing of the movie can become annoying rhythm lacks and the editing is filled with unnecessary close ups i should also mention the overly stylized <UNK> making some scenes devoid of any naturally or rather making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious of course along with that you have the right on cue sappy music which unfortunately often sounds <UNK> br br i can't believe that a movie who makes obvious woody allen <UNK> ends up being this <UNK> if you expect a good light hearted romantic comedy this is not it or rather this a poor attempt at it you will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been getting such praise when cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are far superior <UNK> directors making better flicks br br les <UNK> is a good movie for what it is but it's a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as <UNK>
<START> i found it hard to like anyone in this film the central characters lindy and michael chamberlain whose daughter disappears during a night out in the australian <UNK> are not bad people but then surely not all or even most of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better but though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the <UNK> from the start of their life's tragic <UNK> the film takes on a more or less <UNK> perspective <UNK> to <UNK> news media crowds <UNK> and <UNK> it's not a movie about the <UNK> society of australia in particular it's merely an account of a true story that happened there society en <UNK> is much less evolved than the individual feels <UNK> that we are br br when a warden insists upon killing all of an <UNK> dogs because of the <UNK> action of a single wild dog when a randomly ruined life <UNK> even further out of control <UNK> to the majority of magazines <UNK> and tv programs <UNK> the tragic truth to a level of drama that <UNK> its <UNK> into a frenzy there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of one's own unaware <UNK> influenced left and right by the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of those who surround one's life the reason i appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out from the victims to the masses br br the evidence against lindy chamberlain aside suspicion was jet <UNK> mostly by a virtue of hers to the public eye she did not seem <UNK> <UNK> by the death of her baby daughter why was she able to keep her cool even a sort of <UNK> let alone holding her head up for tv and the press how much of the <UNK> spiral could've been prevented had she <UNK> more to the <UNK> liking in the media meryl streep one of if not the greatest actress working today may not give a performance that particularly stands out and frankly neither does any other actor or department of film making but she and the screenwriters do understand lindy what is <UNK> is that it's not that difficult apparently she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case whether or not she is <UNK> as a lovable character in the immediate sense we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation br br whether or not her performance is as immediately <UNK> as <UNK> choice the devil wears <UNK> angels in america or other such work it is a triumph it is difficult <UNK> an audience when you <UNK> deny them insights into yourself she <UNK> us because we don't know what she's thinking or feeling it took me awhile to feel <UNK> toward her but this is the movie's way of suggesting the reaction of the <UNK> attention br br she is married to a <UNK> and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus <UNK> by most initially they react to their loss as if to be <UNK> themselves to god's will kick starting a <UNK> mill <UNK> the notion that their daughter's death was some sort of ritual killing on their part whatever happened to the little girl her parents were part of a <UNK> with whom most of the <UNK> <UNK> didn't immediately identify so the first <UNK> was to go after them like a pack of hungry well br br meryl streep and sam <UNK> are constantly on screen but the australian public plays the real leads here like <UNK> for each plot advance director fred <UNK> cuts away from restaurant to <UNK> court to dinner party to saloon to office where the public tries lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate <UNK> br br this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is not particularly memorable the <UNK> atmosphere doesn't give a <UNK> enough <UNK> for the fact that no performance or <UNK> of production stands out but it is very successful as an <UNK> of the collective conscious of the public
<START> god i am so sick of the crap that comes out of america called cartoons br br since anime became popular the usa animators either produce a cartoon with a 5 year old lazy ass style of drawing <UNK> <UNK> or some <UNK> japanese animation rip off usually messing up classic characters no wonder anime is beating american cartoons br br they are not even trying anymore br br oh i just heard of this last night i live in the uk and when i found out this show first came out in 2005 well i never knew the uk was so up to date with current shows
<START> why oh why won't they learn when you've got a nice <UNK> exploitation gimmick use it don't go messing around trying to get all deep and thoughtful you're only gonna wind up looking foolish br br christmas evil is the story of harry <UNK> who saw a little bit too much of <UNK> kissing daddy dressed as santa claus back when he was a kid so of course harry grows up obsessed with christmas and finally when his <UNK> becomes too great he <UNK> out dresses as santa and wanders the city giving out toys to good little children and <UNK> killing anyone he <UNK> naughty br br simple enough and not a bad place to start after all how many other holiday themed horror flicks use the same <UNK> unfortunately this film wants to be more santa portrait of a serial killer than silent night deadly night two thirds of the film are spent <UNK> harry's slow but inevitable breakdown when i would have been willing to buy the premise by the time the opening titles were rolling you know a slasher film is in trouble when you find yourself <UNK> the killer to just get on with it already br br perhaps harry's descent into madness could have been compelling in the hands of a competent director but alas we've got some guy named lewis jackson apparently this is his only film and it shows the action jumps <UNK> from scene to scene without establishing shots or clear views of the actors to let us know where we are and who we are seeing br br even once the film gets rolling we're still treated to <UNK> <UNK> of harry's self pity <UNK> and neurotic behavior more depressing than frightening christmas evil is one to avoid
<START> great fun i went with 8 friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film we came to see different one but after 10 minutes wondering what the heck we got ourselves into this time the jokes became funny and they stayed funny throughout the movie in the first part you just keep asking yourself about this <UNK> and <UNK> stuff there are many more examples of this <UNK> and because they keep repeating the same jokes with different twists they get funnier and funnier in search for this <UNK> all the main characters are introduced the first one even <UNK> than the next until half of the film was over we didn't even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing but we sure had a good time the house was loaded <UNK> 250 people and i think about half of them didn't like it and the other half loved the film if you like weird comical movies with great dialogue you will love it apart from clooney this movie deserves a lot better than the 5 6 imdb rating it has at the time i write this but when more <UNK> have seen it i am sure it will go up 7 0 is reasonable i guess i would give it an 8 out of 10 10 out of 10 after a few beers br br
<START> <UNK> maria <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 2005 br br the <UNK> maria <UNK> plays anna a woman in her thirties who finds out her husband <UNK> van <UNK> is cheating on her but she doesn't dare to confront him she painfully avoids any confrontation with human beings her parents as well as her sister so we have a main character in a feature film that doesn't do much at all we barely know anything about her background or her motivations just a woman who seems to be stuck in a blind alley not just during this difficult episode of her life she obviously suffers from something but why do we in the audience have to suffer as well br br i almost gave up on cinema after seeing this unwatchable mess these were a very dull and painful 90 minutes normally i try to avoid wasting energy on bad film making i'll take the beating and roll with the punches but in this case a fair warning is in place how on earth did <UNK> leopold get funding in large part from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for this turkey obviously there was no script to speak off it could be <UNK> by an ingenious filmmaker with cinematographic ideas or a cast with only a little more appeal none whatsoever just a vaguely defined concept i want to do something from a woman's point of view the result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective on life br br to make things worse there's not an interesting shot to be found in the entire film i cannot think of a cast who could have <UNK> this one up but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a small light in the dark if possible with this dire lack of material i'm trying to imagine how leopold tried directing maria <UNK> maria look at the horizon we'll film you for three minutes just express sadness a perfect cure for insomnia get a copy and watch this late at night guaranteed too put you to sleep br br camera <UNK> 1 10
<START> this film show peoples in the middle of the <UNK> 2 days in <UNK> it shows people <UNK> other peoples and being cruel to other peoples it show the inability of people to communicate or talk with others br br in the screening i have attended people were leaving in the middle because they could no longer watch the film and rightly so because the film is not and easy one to watch it has a very depressing message and there isn't any moment of mercy in the film it is a very cruel movie not for everyone's taste you can not speak of terms of enjoyment from this film it grips you in your throat and never let go and in the end you simply feels breathless because of its intensity br br i can not recommend or not recommend this film you should make your own mind based on what i have said earlier just be aware that this is not a regular film and it is not for everyone's taste
<START> i enjoyed watching cliffhanger at the beginning when that woman sarah was full of terror when she was <UNK> i thought that was a terrifying scene as i would think that when you see that see your nerves in your body get to you because it makes you get full of fright and your heart beats faster i did like watching cliffhanger i think <UNK> stallone is a great actor and i think he'll be known as playing rambo and rocky
<START> <UNK> br br aspect ratio 1 33 1 br br sound format <UNK> br br <UNK> though <UNK> fair account of the life and times of champion boxer mike <UNK> given his conviction on a rape charge the film is careful not to portray him as hero or villain but paints a <UNK> and all portrait of his rise to fame the <UNK> of success and the people who shaped his destiny for good or bad <UNK> by time limits the script <UNK> through a succession of relevant details <UNK> briefly on significant events culminating with <UNK> temporary downfall in 1995 <UNK> will be <UNK> by the <UNK> while boxing fans will be entertained by director <UNK> <UNK> straight arrow approach to the material he portrays <UNK> life as a circus in which he was ultimately led <UNK> by the circumstances of his own success in fact the script <UNK> most of its <UNK> for <UNK> ex wife robin <UNK> <UNK> her as an <UNK> gold <UNK> who took advantage of his <UNK> production values are uniformly solid and the cast is superb michael <UNK> white does a fair imitation of the title character george c scott plays <UNK> mentor <UNK> <UNK> through <UNK> of <UNK> teeth and paul <UNK> was surely born to play don king
<START> br br back in his youth the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin but his family <UNK> it many decades later the old man has raised three children two boys and one girl and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children soon the sister is bored with brother 1 and jumps in the bed of brother 2 br br one might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island but no they are upper class europeans going to college and busy in the social world br br never do we see a <UNK> moment between any non related female and the two brothers never do we see any <UNK> moment between any non related male and the one sister all <UNK> moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister br br the weakest part of gladiator was the incest thing the young emperor <UNK> would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage minded girls all over him but no he only wanted his sister if movie incest is your cup of tea then sunshine will slowly thrill you to no end
<START> i had fun watching this movie mainly due to simon pegg who has quickly become a solid box office draw for comedy films br br he is hired from his dead end london <UNK> job by big shot nyc media <UNK> jeff bridges as a writer for one of his celebrity <UNK> br br after paying his <UNK> he makes it into the higher <UNK> of celebrity writing <UNK> the seventh room where he gets to be a minor celebrity himself the storyline is very funny and gillian anderson puts in an impressive supporting role as a <UNK> publicity agent br br along the way to success he finds the true meaning of love etc br br the formulaic plot aside the movie was very funny mainly due to simon pegg jeff bridges and gillian anderson kirsten dunst was good as the love interest the rest of the supporting cast did its job well br br this was a good comedy well worth checking out at the theaters
<START> finally a thriller which <UNK> the car chases explosions and other eye catching effects the movie combines a simple plot <UNK> of a french president with an excellent background it takes a look behind mans behavior with authorities and explains why we would <UNK> almost every order even murder which would be given to us br br furthermore it shows us how secret services can manipulate the run of history and how hardly they can be controlled the best thing on this movie is that there is no classic hollywood end which can easily be predicted
<START> although it's most certainly politically incorrect to be entertained by a drunk there's such a charm to dudley moore's portrayal of lovable lush arthur bach one can't help but feel for this unique and wonderful character how can you not be entertained by that <UNK> laugh and giggle and utter silliness although i'm not really a <UNK> minnelli fan she was really excellent as linda <UNK> and i couldn't picture anyone else in that role sir john gielgud was the heart of the film and deserved his oscar the rest of the cast also excellent and that great tune <UNK> theme wow truly this was one of the best comedies of the 1980s great films get better with each viewing and that is the case with arthur
<START> ron howard directed this the 1966 cartoon is charming teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot in this movie howard gives us a <UNK> filled with greedy manipulative self centered <UNK> jim carrey is terrible but i'm sure it's not his fault i imagine the script called for the <UNK> person imaginable so carrey <UNK> tom green and the result is movie magic much like danny <UNK> penguin in batman returns <UNK> grinch is so thoroughly unlikeable that any degree of comedy that might be <UNK> from his character simply <UNK> where the 1966 cartoon featured a grinch that we could all identify with <UNK> grinch is that angry soulless old man that we've all seen at one time or another sitting in a <UNK> car <UNK> to himself or <UNK> <UNK> at the supermarket with his <UNK> this grinch is thoroughly <UNK> of any degree of humanity humor or insight whatsoever and his redemption at the end of the movie rings false the whole movie rings false there is some stupid christmas lighting competition a failed attempt at explaining why the grinch is such a jerk by digging into his childhood and an <UNK> mystery as to why some of the <UNK> have that weird lip <UNK> and some of them don't contrary to the 1966 cartoon i would imagine children would find this movie tiresome irritating and filled with <UNK> messages did we really need to see <UNK> <UNK> aka christine <UNK> as martha may <UNK> in addition ron howard filled the cast with his <UNK> relatives throw in the requisite butt jokes fart jokes sex jokes and other obligatory <UNK> low brow humor and you have a movie that is about as far from the 1966 cartoon or book that inspired it as george w bush is from rational <UNK> thought thumbs down on this big fat turkey
<START> i've just watch 2 films of <UNK> brothers the eye and one take only when i watched the eye i was kind of disappointed about this two guys who i had heard good words about them before that film the eye has a really bad script especially the ending childish cliche and too <UNK> in my opinion but its still good in photography and experimental images so i decided to see one take only and i didn't disappointed again still great photography stunning image mtv style editing cool music and this time the story has a lot of indie spirit logical and beautiful you'll see some tiny plot holes but it doesn't cause any trouble with the storyline the only problem about this film is i get a bad dvd
<START> 1 vampires vs humans br br 2 military reject <UNK> squad as first <UNK> to dangerous unknown vampire <UNK> br br 3 sexy female vampire on the side of the good guys br br 4 plenty of gore and action br br there are four 4 major plot devices that may help you decide if you want to watch this movie if you want all four then the next plot device may not <UNK> you br br 5 in outer space br br that last one almost got me too but i'm glad i watched in a pile of terrible direct to video horror that is the sci fi channel halloween marathon this movie is a breath of fresh air it will stand up against any of the other sci fi channel offerings and even against the other vampire movie <UNK> starred in who keeps giving uwe boll money
<START> i <UNK> into this movie after watching the <UNK> minute <UNK> tonight and left quite disappointed i was a huge fan of wallace and <UNK> and <UNK> go to see animated films that being said i found myself <UNK> off and at one point nearly walked out but stayed waiting for this film to get better never happened br br the visuals are stunning and the voice work is top notch especially in my opinion that of kate <UNK> and ian <UNK> i had to remind myself a few times the <UNK> headed lizard villain was <UNK> and <UNK> the problem with this movie for me is it's one of those animated features for the add set it <UNK> after the fact as one zany slapstick routine after another <UNK> down by a <UNK> filled plot that pulls out every stop in an attempt to convey an important message it looks a lot like <UNK> oscar bait for the animated category and considering the way it's <UNK> with critics i wouldn't be surprised if the academy gets it wrong and offers up its <UNK> but if you're looking for an enjoyable animated feature about rats take my advice and wait for <UNK>
<START> it's so rare to find a film that provides a plot that can't be figured out at every turn surprises throughout <UNK> throughout br br a couple of things i could not quite understand though is that here you have the lead female character who plays the good girl hard worker and yet in the end she ends up being an anti social risk taker that was not enough to make me not like it though but it did give me pause br br the other thing i could not get was the old man who was being <UNK> away by the police at the very end of the film i never did get who he was or what his issues were if anyone has any ideas i'd like to hear what they might be br br the film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing very much worth seeing
<START> the usual cat and mouse antics abound until jerry jumps into a bottle of invisible <UNK> he gets the bright idea of torturing tom without him knowing the cat gets wise and tries to do stuff to make him <UNK> jerry even if it's not fool proof of course jerry gets butch aka killer aka spike the dog into the act even if it's late in the short and his contribution is minimal indeed brilliant animated short which kind of reminded me of the one with the white mouse who scares tom so badly most of the gags work and all violent as any good tom and jerry short should truly be this hilarious cartoon can be found on disc one of the spotlight collection dvd of tom jerry br br my grade b
<START> i saw this movie once and i thought it was ok then my friends at work said watch it again it's better so i did and to my surprise it was worse on the second time there's a word limit so i'm going to get the ball rolling here br br the bombing scenes were all so stupid why on earth would anyone wait to trigger the explosion none of the characters here are even remotely likable not on the first time not even the second br br oh and last time i checked a car does not explode from a single gun shot nor can a fire that huge be put out with a tiny fire <UNK> did the above 3 10 viewers actually watch the movie the camera is so shaky i can barely tell what is going on that opening scene with the robot had my stomach off put the rest of the movie was not much better br br the sniper scene the <UNK> brothers from the <UNK> saints would roll their eyes it was so stupid first off why did the guy plant his gun where one person had gotten shot furthermore why would he spend that much time cleaning the bullets <UNK> aiming and not get shot when there was so much chaos going on around him <UNK> types running instead of staying and fighting back huh are the soldiers gay i didn't mean to sound <UNK> but honestly that scene was so ridiculous br br too long for its own good yet too short for the amount of material <UNK> into it <UNK> seems to think that the more action the better looks like she is wrong the movie is full of superfluous action scenes thrown in there to distract you from the lack of a central plot i know <UNK> is longer at <UNK> minutes but at least that movie didn't drag this movie on the other hand does and for it feels longer br br the only good thing was <UNK> who was satisfactory at best but do yourself a favour just skip this and don't give into the hype
<START> my take a tired formula christmas comedy the laughs are tired and the talents behind it seem to be too br br i love the holidays as much as the next guy even if i often have a bad case of the holiday blues but it seems it's just being a <UNK> ground for a bunch of holiday comedies that would be bad movies on any day of the year but that doesn't make them any less painful during the season as if we already had enough santa <UNK> movies three and <UNK> still counting who wants to see a movie about his brother in a plot that would be at home with disney's santa <UNK> franchise save the occasionally crude humor and <UNK> little <UNK> wearing a short <UNK> fred claus is a one joke premise that goes on for <UNK> minutes sure jolly ol' saint nick has a brother but where does it go from there br br it's a shame really fred claus is blessed with a cast that could have made it an enjoyable <UNK> comedy that will probably melt away along with the snow but it would have been so much better than this vince vaughn is your typical <UNK> but we are led to believe he's really the long lost brother of the never aging santa paul <UNK> who invites his good ol' brother to visit mrs claus miranda richardson is reluctant and worse an <UNK> expert kevin spacey has come to keep a <UNK> eye on father christmas and his this close to being shut down <UNK> and guess who plays <UNK> mother kathy bates of course elizabeth banks is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> john michael <UNK> is one of the <UNK> and rachel <UNK> plays <UNK> girlfriend <UNK> don't know if i'd praise the casting or to bash it here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality but they're given way too little to work with br br as for humor the best that fred claus could possibly come up with is <UNK> brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a dj <UNK> i have to admit i had a few <UNK> involving fred attending a group <UNK> for celebrity brothers where he is joined by stephen baldwin roger <UNK> and frank stallone but the <UNK> begin and end there worse still the movie even <UNK> into sentimentality that's supposed to make us feel good and teach us a lesson about what christmas really means apparently what christmas means to hollywood is getting as much of our <UNK> christmas shopping money as they can br br rating out of 5
<START> i just saw this movie today with my children son 10 and daughter 4 5 at the 3rd <UNK> roger ebert overlooked film festival after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director <UNK> <UNK> wu he through a <UNK> told several stories about his life and the making of the film br br all <UNK> aside both of my children really enjoyed this movie of course i had to <UNK> many of the subtitles for my daughter but much of the film is visually self <UNK> br br i won't give anything away but the bottom line is that this film is so much better than 95 of the hollywood crap especially children's films out there br br cheers br br p s there is a real original king of masks who can could do 12 masks at once the actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to 4 masks at a time then they would cut and change to 4 new masks
<START> the plot character development and gags in this movie are all extremely weak quite a waste of time the conclusion of saving grace is supposed to make one feel warm and fuzzy as though the characters have grown through their struggles there was no such development to make such warm fuzzy feelings possible the drug gags are cliched and much of the movie doesn't ring true to life the plot builds what is supposed to be tension but the characters aren't developed enough to care then it rushes through a resolution of all the outstanding problems in about a minute of screen time leaving the viewer feeling like they have just wasted their time
<START> if you haven't seen the <UNK> show tv series then you won't like this movie much at all not that knowing the series makes this a great movie br br i give it a 5 out of 10 because a few things make it kind of amusing that help make up for its obvious problems br br 1 it's a funny <UNK> of the era it was made in the late 1970's and early 1980's 2 you get a lot of funny cameos of people you've seen on the show 3 it's interesting to see chuck the host when he isn't doing his on air tv personality 4 you get to see a lot of bizarre people doing all sorts of weirdness just like you see on the tv show br br i won't list all the bad things because there's a lot of them but here's a few of the most prominent br br 1 the <UNK> show movie has a lot of the actual tv show clips which gets tired at movie length 2 the movie's story line outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically is made up of just one plot point 3 chuck is actually halfway decent as an actor but most of the rest of the actors are doing typical way over the top 1970's <UNK> br br it's a good movie to watch when you don't have an hour and a half you want to watch all at once watch 20 minutes at a time and it's not so bad but even then it's not so good either
<START> in one of her first movies <UNK> schneider shines as young queen victoria of britain as she is suddenly put into the throne at the age of 18 learns to <UNK> despite the <UNK> of the politicians and eventually romances and marries prince albert of <UNK> <UNK> and campy though surprisingly faithful to the real events this romantic piece is irresistible seeing this movie about british <UNK> spoken in german adds to its quaint charm on that front one wonders why an <UNK> movie was made about an english queen but then one remembers that in 1954 <UNK> was still under <UNK> by allied troops including british ones maybe this was one of the reasons for the existence of this film
<START> i saw <UNK> on dvd while i was watching it i thought this is a really bad porn flick without the porn i also thought whoever wrote this has some real issues then i watched the director writer <UNK> explain his process as a special feature yeah it was real special br br the emphasis of the film is placed on two alcoholic losers who hit each other to get off they are <UNK> attractive there is frontal and full nudity these factors probably account for the film being seen at all br br the most <UNK> element of the film is the gay bashing and the subsequent further gay bashing of the same victim who tries <UNK> to exact revenge from his <UNK> the two drunken losers not only is the subject handled <UNK> and badly from a technical point of view but the acting is <UNK> bad br br then there's the boxer stalker theme this is really insane not just absurd this hunky boxer is somehow traumatized by the <UNK> <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> boy who works at his <UNK> parking lot this is in la mind you the boxer is so traumatized that he turns up at the <UNK> house <UNK> in front of him and gets excited in the process br br well all i can say is why would a boxer who is at heart an <UNK> be so traumatized by the attention of a stalker it simply makes no sense and i'm afraid some psycho dynamics actually do make sense if you take the time to read about them however bad scripts seldom make sense at all br br the director writer seems to have thought that this film represents a considerable minority within the gay community well he may be correct i suppose we may never know since that minority would be so dysfunctional they would hardly be able to get organized enough to ever get to an obscure gay film festival or dvd store the only two places they could possibly find this turkey thank goodness for that
<START> for the initial 20 minutes or so i was watching it on a <UNK> so i've really no idea how long it took <UNK> sets up an interesting premise i don't think i've seen a slasher movie with an alien from another planet as the baddie before however interest soon turns into stunned disbelief as you realise the <UNK> is a huge body <UNK> woman in a steel bikini yes <UNK> is <UNK> ridiculous br br don't think i hold that against it in the world of <UNK> horror <UNK> ridiculous can often be a good sign however the blatant stupidity of its premise is all the movie really has going for it <UNK> is funny as hell but it is also a <UNK> <UNK> of the highest order actors heap on failed attempts at seriousness potentially genius lines of pure cheese dialogue are stumbled over with unnerving incompetence and the direction fails to sum up even one or two decent set pieces by the time the movie's finished you can barely see the original concept through the <UNK> of total tripe the team <UNK> on it br br add to this the fact that the <UNK> just kills people by <UNK> them as opposed to doing any <UNK> as such and you have a giant <UNK> heap of good ideas being left to <UNK> you'll laugh at <UNK> but at it not with it if that's your thing then go ahead and check it out
<START> considering that this movie had a serious and quite successful <UNK> campaign i would have expected something to be worth the <UNK> from the opening scene on in which the two brothers <UNK> <UNK> each other laying naked in a bed it goes rapidly <UNK> nothing to get the attention not a mind catching thing in the whole plot <UNK> <UNK> acting a few minor exceptions but <UNK> is at its best incest and <UNK> are promising themes but the script <UNK> none of the two in depth mind that a possible excuse of the makers saying that they aimed for a subtle movie would be hilarious unless subtle and superficial mean the same thing the too curious viewers will not get any interesting scene at this point that could have saved some of the movie so you can imagine how bad it is many other things could be said but please watch the movie yourselves i am an <UNK> and i would like as many people as possible to waste about 1 1 <UNK> of their lives like i did
<START> in a movie that follows a struggling actor played evidently by a struggling actor this does no <UNK> for chris <UNK> he struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and <UNK> on through the shallow script managing to display what could only be described as a bland leading man the story exists but that is all and fails to show any basic start middle and end and the viewer is left <UNK> his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really happened br br one bright light in the midst of this is fred <UNK> who manages to stand out above his seemingly <UNK> talented co stars and does a semi decent job of bringing the <UNK> character of <UNK> to life whether fred can re create this when working with a higher <UNK> of cast remains to be seen but <UNK> be watching out for him in future
<START> somebody needs to send this <UNK> <UNK> guy back to movie school who ever told him he knew how to make a movie can just anybody make movies these days in the past it always required talent before someone could make a movie after watching this lame btk movie and the others he's made it seems blatantly obvious that the poor guy has about as much business making movies as i do actually i think even i could make better movies than <UNK> lame all this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the btk killer other than the names of the victims and the killer that's it where did this guy get the big idea that btk killed people with <UNK> and all the other preposterous crap that's in the movie this is a classic example of someone trying to lure people into watching their movie based on the term btk because of the fame it has achieved absolutely pitiful the only serial killer movie i would consider worse is that lame dahmer movie that kid <UNK> so many <UNK> it made me <UNK> whoever made that one needs to be shot
<START> i found myself at <UNK> and <UNK> while watching this one altman's touch with <UNK> in and out were there and i expected those devices to comment on characters and situations unfortunately as far as i could see they sometimes were gratuitous sometimes witty often <UNK> for failing to point out some ironic or other connection in particular two zoom outs from the <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> merely <UNK> to be fair though a few <UNK> outs and ins to branagh <UNK> his character's increasing <UNK> a la <UNK> <UNK> or philip <UNK> on the whole the <UNK> were well inconsistent and sometimes even trite br br other <UNK> devices such as multiple <UNK> of glass between camera and subject succeeded in suggesting characters' <UNK> or <UNK> or <UNK> states of knowledge car <UNK> house windows and other screens were used effectively and fairly consistently i felt <UNK> back to the player and even the long goodbye a few catchy jump cuts especially to a suggestive tv commercial reminded me of such usage in short cuts to <UNK> effect br br but finally the <UNK> between altman's very personal style and the sheer weight of the <UNK> genre momentum failed to <UNK> me this director's 1970s masterpieces <UNK> and <UNK> various classic genres including the chandler detective film which this <UNK> in some ways this time around the director seemed to have too few <UNK> in his <UNK> <UNK> to strike any meaningful blow to the soft <UNK> of this <UNK> genre was he <UNK> in by <UNK> producers perhaps or am i missing something due to my feeble knowledge of the genre he takes on here br br nonetheless the casting was excellent all around tom berenger for his terrifying <UNK> branagh for his <UNK> <UNK> robert downey <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> robert <UNK> method of trash and <UNK> lurking femme <UNK> were near perfect choices all and except for a few slips out of georgia into chicago on the part of brunette <UNK> hannah accents were convincingly southern br br suspense and mood were engrossing even if the story didn't quite <UNK> viewers the <UNK> of a <UNK> pre <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> <UNK> rendered i felt like yelling at the <UNK> to turn on the swamp <UNK> <UNK> br br torn in the end i judged it a 7 br br
<START> this was a very entertaining movie and i really enjoyed it i don't normally rent movies like these ie indie flicks however i was attracted to the film because it had an incredible cast which included jamie kennedy whom i have loved since the scream trilogy the movie director took a risk and it is a <UNK> risk in telling the lives of many and i mean many different people and having the <UNK> at various <UNK> taking that risk was a good idea because it's end result is an exceedingly good film br br the film has a few main characters dwight jamie kennedy a disgruntled fortune cookie writer whose relationship with his girlfriend is on the rocks because of an argument wallace gregory john <UNK> lynch an airplane <UNK> <UNK> who has a love for all living things except perhaps <UNK> <UNK> and who despite his good heart has an increasing amount of bad luck <UNK> brian cox the owner of a chinese restaurant <UNK> shop who is a <UNK> and because of is his fear of <UNK> places his assistant cook sung <UNK> <UNK> under pressure to keep up with his <UNK> ernie christopher bauer is married to <UNK> christina kirk who he is convinced is trying to stop him have fun look ridiculous go insane and not live a normal life they begin to have petty and almost crazy arguments and <UNK> seriously begins to have doubts about ernie gordon grant <UNK> is a man whose life isn't going very well as bad things begin to add up in his life he decides to take it in hand <UNK> jon <UNK> is convinced that <UNK> alexandra <UNK> is the girl of his dreams and that they are destined for each other though she is more skeptical he attempts to woo her every chance he gets and he certainly makes attempts <UNK> michael hitchcock has just been fired from his job and has doubts about his role as <UNK> he takes another job that he just isn't suited for his wife <UNK> <UNK> field is <UNK> through out his job loss experience until she learns that <UNK> wasn't quite the loving husband she thought he was br br all in all i definitely suggest this movie br br <UNK>
<START> any time a movie is so <UNK> in its desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint that it simply doesn't bother with an actual story it's annoying those are the types of movies where the ending or viewpoint is conceived first and the story simply tacked on for this reason we often talk of the story jumping through <UNK> as it twists about trying in vain to progress to the <UNK> ending in a logical fashion br br the story in <UNK> over broadway doesn't just jump through <UNK> it's a three ring circus it's so ludicrous so ill conceived so <UNK> that if you are prone to speaking <UNK> to the screen you will be carrying on quite a rant before it's through br br the central theme of this screenplay <UNK> is that of a woman choosing between family and profession since it's all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion so in the end there's no point to the story the theme becomes irrelevant and as is often the case with poor screenplays the acting doesn't save a thing
<START> this is not horror as the first part was this is campy light and humorous entertainment like in so many sequels the action starts right away with no explanations but there's boobs so i don't complain and real boobs that is if i understand correctly those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in u s of a which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is pamela <UNK> sister <UNK> br br this cannot be thought without the first movie so i compare this to it again there is too small clothing mainly pants and funny hair it's not hard to tell what decade this film is made in again there is really strange characters this time even more <UNK> <UNK> ones especially the <UNK> of the camp it's like some mental <UNK> summer camp people are older most of the actors must be at least 25 but i think they're supposed to be 16 or something some methods used by the evil dyke are quite unpleasant actually this movie don't have much in common with the first part and this is worse than it in every way
<START> im watching it now on pink <UNK> tv station and i must say this is a crap shallow no acting effects too sloppy i mean who made this series br br this was a stupid attempt of the studios to make some more money on the success of the film ok the film was great in 1994 when it came out but the series br br some times you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters i mean did they actually pay someone to write that was that <UNK> relative at the studio this is no scifi br br the film was the bomb the series suck
<START> this is one a most famous movies of the french sexual <UNK> of the seventies starring gerard depardieu and patrick <UNK> in extremely sarcastic roles it is also one of the many dark psychological dramas of the seventies eighties such as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> beau <UNK> all realized by <UNK> br br however i would like to correct the previous comment that was posted on the movie the translated title in english is very far from the french version it is true that both protagonists are going places but the title in french could be literally translated by the <UNK> dancers which is a metaphor for the movement of the <UNK>
<START> i thought the movie especially the plot needs a lot of work the elements of the movie remains <UNK> and untrue to the attempt of trying to produce an eastern feel in the movie i'll give three out of many of the flaws of the movie br br first when <UNK> told wendy that he would help her study the history of china i was really happy that the audience would receive some information about chinese history but it turns out that the movie did not exactly show wendy actually studying chinese history yet instead the movie only shows wendy practicing the method of remembering what she had studied which frustrated and put me in <UNK> br br second which really bothered me is how the characters kept mentioning about moon <UNK> moon <UNK> this and moon <UNK> that and how good it tastes yet they didn't really mention the real significance of it the only they they talked about that had any relevance to the moon cake was the <UNK> festival which they did not explain or go in depth they could have mentioned the myth that <UNK> with the moon cake the moon lady the myth starts of with how there once exists ten <UNK> and each would <UNK> rising but one day all ten <UNK> rose up <UNK> up the land with the rising intense heat so the divine archer <UNK> <UNK> shot nine of the ten <UNK> leaving only one sun there are different versions where the <UNK> <UNK> shot the eight out of nine <UNK> because of his heroic contribution he was given the <UNK> of <UNK> so he could live on forever in case the ten <UNK> do rise up again but his wife chang o stole it after stealing it she <UNK> to the moon where she met a <UNK> she then came upon an idea and told the <UNK> to pound the <UNK> into many piece so she could spread the <UNK> all over earth giving everyone <UNK> there are a few variations of this story but throughout my childhood i most of the time heard about this version i thought details such as this would make the plot more <UNK> chinese oriented br br the last thing i would point out is the last battle scene of the movie the teachers that were possessed by the monks were fighting the <UNK> <UNK> warriors the life like <UNK> of the soldiers went against the idea of how important chinese history is to the chinese the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> serves as a connection of <UNK> past and it was very <UNK> where evil must be killed in anyway possible that the monks in the movies were willing to destroy that connection it would be understandable if wendy considering she is chinese american and doesn't have full chinese knowledge had no problem destroying these priceless <UNK> br br the whole movie was <UNK> because it seemed that all the monks and <UNK> want to do is fight i mean it's rated <UNK> due to violence which goes against the <UNK> thinking of <UNK> and harmony it would seem more accurate that the monks try to avoid violence and try to work things out <UNK> before having to resort to violence br br all in all all of or either of the producer writer or director did not do their research thoroughly and did a messy and <UNK> job instead i would suggest that they either stop airing this movie or that they re shoot the movie so it contains more accurate information however i would give it credit 2 stars for <UNK> one stereotype of <UNK> and asian americans of being smart and quiet
<START> slow but beautifully <UNK> story of the american revolution <UNK> story telling seems a lot less heavy handed than in his earlier historical epics and his <UNK> work is fully integrated into the action lionel barrymore is an utter <UNK> neil hamilton is poor but dashing and carol <UNK> is well carol <UNK> is most of what is wrong with griffith in this period but she doesn't show up often enough to slow the pace and drama br br note that the trivia for this movie says it came in originally at slightly more than 2 hours when first released but that no cut exists that runs longer than 90 minutes however the dvd release has been presented at a slower <UNK> rate that <UNK> the tension and brings it back to a bit over two hours br br far better in terms of story telling than sound versions such as the <UNK> while not quite in the league of <UNK> best such as way down east and broken <UNK> an excellent way to spend a couple of hours
<START> i enjoyed every moment of this movie even though i knew they could never really be together with the life <UNK> of a <UNK> pilot being only six weeks it made me feel for all of those women and men back in the 1940's who must have lived this story
<START> excellent pre code amoral tale with barbara stanwyck as the newly inspired by <UNK> of <UNK> to drive out her <UNK> and exploit herself use men to her advantage not really fair on the german <UNK> but interesting that this was the year hitler came to power stanwyck even in this young version doesn't do a lot for me but she certainly performs well here ever driving herself and the film forward not as much flesh on display here as one might have expected but plenty of <UNK> situations and astonishing <UNK> and innuendo great fun if not a particularly attractive presentation of men and i suppose in all honesty not a very attractive view of the gold digging female still that's life
<START> this film <UNK> and <UNK> at a small movie theater in town and the word of mouth buzz got me to see it a comedy about disabled people the subject matter keeps lots of people away from a funny and heart warming film
<START> the good earth follows the life a slave girl and a poor farmer in china the movie is based on the novel by pearl s buck the story is great but i hated that they decided to cast <UNK> in the lead roles walter connolly is laughable as the <UNK> father he has such a heavy american accent as do most of the lead actors that i could not bear listening to him speak br br it is a shame that hollywood could not get past their racist beliefs to cast <UNK> in the lead roles to take <UNK> and make them look like chinese is akin to <UNK> putting shoe polish on their faces to play african americans
<START> it is enjoyable and fast paced br br there is no way on earth that the actor playing <UNK> could be <UNK> however the main thing is that he does act <UNK> very convincingly it must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him i quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boy br br while his was the best performance most of the others were also very engaging in particular the interplay between the policemen was natural and well balanced and worked very well br br it is only about 45 minutes long so the plot is not complex more key is the style of the whole thing it is very slick and vibrant and the backdrops are atmospheric especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich the <UNK> is <UNK> to foreign audiences but still manages to be distinctly australian
<START> i really liked this film when it was released and i still do because the storyline makes you feel hopeful about life in general and people too one of the things i like about the films of lawrence <UNK> in addition to the positive <UNK> from the film there are other reasons to like grand canyon for one thing it has an outstanding cast kevin kline and danny glover for example in my opinion crash the highly acclaimed film that won the oscar for best picture was very similar to this film the difference is that grand canyon leaves you feeling positive crash had the opposite effect with me it was very dark i would choose grand canyon over crash any day
<START> lion king 1 1 2 is a very fun and <UNK> sequel don't expect the production values of a theatrical release but do expect the highest quality of direct to video release br br it is set up as timon <UNK> begin watching the original lion king in a <UNK> theater and abruptly switch tracks and begin <UNK> their own story this is done with frequent comedic <UNK> for example during one particular tense moment a home shopping commercial pops on and a <UNK> <UNK> realizes he has sat on the remote these little moments pepper the movie and whether you find them entertaining or not will greatly depend on your sense of humor if you are particularly bothered by movies that deliberately remind the viewer is watching a movie than this may not be your cup of tea br br animation is the best they've invested in the disney <UNK> line and is integrated almost <UNK> with the original material the newer independent material uses a lot of the artistic style of the original the voice talents are all well performed though i couldn't help thinking of <UNK> simpson every time i heard julie <UNK> br br many of the jokes in the movie will be well recognized by viewers as recycled over the generations but are presented more with the <UNK> of comfortable quirks of old friends than annoyingly repetitive br br the music has made me realize how much i enjoyed and miss a good musical integrated with a disney feature the toe <UNK> opening feature of <UNK> a <UNK> is well choreographed and hilarious timon and <UNK> take on the lion king's opening sequence and their introduction to paradise are also amusing the only problem was the <UNK> of the <UNK> a <UNK> at the end of the movie switching its lyrics and tune from <UNK> to uplifting br br story line is pretty well done and the <UNK> of new plot elements is done almost perfectly though the final bit during the <UNK> chased stretched the storyline credibility a little the new story doesn't seem to handle <UNK> or emotionally charged moments to well and does better when it is <UNK> to full comedy br br overall worth <UNK> if you like all the bonus features that come with a typical 2 disc set then go for it for the penny <UNK> who still is willing to <UNK> on a good flick wait until it drops four or more dollars and go rent it right away br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> in time book series is my favorite series from childhood i have read and re read them more times than i can count over the last 35 years the characters with all their virtues and flaws are near and dear to my heart this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful magical spiritual story that i love so much to say i was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement br br if you have never read the book s i imagine you will enjoy the movie the acting is passable the special effects are well done for a made for tv movie and the story is interesting however if you love the books avoid this movie at all costs br br i found this statement at the <UNK> page of the novel in an interview with <UNK> <UNK> said of the film 'i expected it to be bad and it is ' br br i like another reviewer here feel the need to read the book again to <UNK> this movie from my mind
<START> seven young people go to the forest looking for a bear soon they are all stalked and <UNK> murdered by a crazy vietnam veteran <UNK> <UNK> is a pretty entertaining mexican slasher that reminds me a lot the zero boys the film is fast paced and there are some good death scenes like throat <UNK> or axe in the neck unfortunately there is not much gore so fans of grand <UNK> will be disappointed however if you are a fan of slasher movies give this <UNK> a look mexican horror flicks are quite obscure i have seen only <UNK> and don't panic so this should be another reason to see this enjoyable slasher my rating 7 out of 10 highly recommended
<START> man's castle is set in one of those jerry built <UNK> on <UNK> land and parks that during these times were called <UNK> named after our unfortunate <UNK> president who got stuck with the great depression occurring in his administration the <UNK> of this film is that a man's home is still his castle even when it's just a shack in a <UNK> br br spencer tracy has such a shack and truth be told this guy even in good times would not be working all that much but in a part very typical for tracy before he was cast as a priest in san francisco the start of a slew of classic roles he's playing a tough good natured <UNK> who takes in loretta young br br one of the things about man's castle is that it shows the effects of the depression on women as well as men women had some additional <UNK> put on them if men had trouble finding work women had it twice as hard and they were sexually <UNK> and some <UNK> to prostitution just for a square meal <UNK> takes loretta young in who's facing those kind of problems and makes no demands on her in his castle pretty soon though they're in love though tracy is not the kind to settle down br br the love scenes had some extra <UNK> to them because tracy and young were having a <UNK> affair during the shooting of man's castle and both were catholic and married and in those days that was an <UNK> <UNK> to marriage both tracy and young took the catholic faith quite seriously br br also in the cast are walter connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole camp <UNK> <UNK> who's been through all the <UNK> young might encounter and tries to steer her clear and arthur <UNK> a really <UNK> creep who has his eye on young as well <UNK> brings the plot of man's castle to its climax through his scheming br br man's castle is grim look at the great depression not the usual movie <UNK> fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment
<START> helena bonham carter is the center of this movie she plays her role almost <UNK> in a wheelchair but still brings across her traditional intensity kenneth branagh was tolerable the movie itself was good not exceptional if you are a helena bonham carter fan it is worth seeing
<START> and yet we were told there was another hour and 20 minutes left to go br br why oh why wasn't there an editor to tell the writer director to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> apparently that writer director has previously done shorts as a short this would have been okay but the lack of dialogue starts to <UNK> after twenty minutes the lack of much music <UNK> the background noises talking traffic and especially a <UNK> helicopter get old really fast but the worst failure is in story there is precious little beyond a short br br after an hour we saw variations of the same scene over and over again i nearly screamed at the screen we get it we get it it's amazing that after that left the theatre we could drive home watch the daily show and parts of the <UNK> report get ready for bed and know that the audience was still trapped in the theatre br br it's not enough to <UNK> your vision you have to give the audience enough to share your vision
<START> first of all <UNK> is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft br br secondly the <UNK> and <UNK> cannot change their appearances they are not transformers br br <UNK> the <UNK> has only one <UNK> cannon not two br br last but not the least at the end of the film <UNK> selected <UNK> missile but somehow when he pulled the trigger the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick as i have the experience of seeing <UNK> and <UNK> being mysteriously transformed into <UNK> this small transformation of <UNK> is not a big surprise to me however there is still one question i have to ask how did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying <UNK> br br when students hand in really bad work teachers <UNK> <UNK> now i think for the sake of properly <UNK> this film imdb should seriously consider adding a <UNK> <UNK> option otherwise it is not fair for those who receive 1 out of 10
<START> <UNK> bogart clearly did not want to be in this film and be forced to play a part mexican or he would have been suspended believe me he made the wrong choice presumably after the success of dodge city <UNK> tried a follow up with errol flynn and his usual list of buddies like alan hale <UNK> big boy williams frank <UNK> hugh and the ever present john <UNK> but they made the huge mistake of trying to present <UNK> hopkins as a love interest for flynn v randolph scott and as a singer to really make things bad because she proved one thing and that is she cannot sing the story was not too bad but with <UNK> clearly miscast also it turned out to be a poor western that was overlong and on a low budget but in fairness color would not have helped
<START> wasn't sure what to expect from this film i love watching brosnan in any movie he's always good but this was totally different he's a mess and plays being a mess very well in fact he reminded me of myself a few times back in <UNK> so yes there's not a lot of violence there's not a lot of action but the dialogue is cracking the acting is superb and very refreshing and it's pretty funny too i don't think you'll come out of the cinema going wow i was blown away but you'll come out smiling having enjoyed a good film can't ask for more than that br br oh and if you're lucky some moron will put the <UNK> reel in wrong and you'll get <UNK> upside down <UNK> with <UNK> audio <UNK> brilliant nothing like watching a jack daniels ad where the drink goes back into the bottle from the glass with a gruff american twin peaks commentary
<START> i wont take too much time here just wanted to state that darkman 3 is awesome i have all 3 on dvd added these to my collection of dvd movie sets darkman ranks up there with the best like indiana jones aliens star wars die hard you get the point there isn't too many good horror thriller sets out there many thanks to the whole crew and set for giving us the darkman trilogy by the way if your wondering how i came across this one on dvd i purchased it through the internet it is however region 4 as you know most us dvd players are region 1 if you own a <UNK> <UNK> 2 you have the best dvd player since it is an all region player just go to set up then choose witch region setting you want 1 9
<START> i would never have thought i would almost cry viewing one minute <UNK> from a <UNK> black and white movie without sound thanks to martin scorsese i did the movie was from f <UNK> you will start to understand if it's not already the case what makes a good movie
<START> another british cinema flag <UNK> real garbage on offer here once again i cannot understand and i am british why this over the top patriotic nonsense was ever made eight years mark you from when the second world war had actually ended other <UNK> here have <UNK> on the editing and apparent <UNK> use of archive footage this is extremely poorly observed the archive footage is in abundance model aircraft swing from <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> like so many children's <UNK> in the wind the usual map room sequences <UNK> the movie to make us supposedly drawn into the whole <UNK> event guinness must have his worst acting performance ever the shocking back drop dog fight scenes are laughable <UNK> <UNK> us all to death in the map room area ealing made many great movies this clearly is not one of them they should have stayed away from such unconvincing <UNK>
<START> the 40 year old virgin is about andy <UNK> a forty year old man who works in an electronic store and doesn't have much of a social life and is very awkward around women some of his co workers at the store invite him out one night and they discover that andy is still a virgin so they plan to help him lose his virginity one day in the store andy meets a woman named <UNK> who gives him her phone number and eventually andy works up enough courage to go on a date with her and they start to really like each other but andy is still very awkward when it comes to sex and he is going to have to tell this to <UNK> much to his embarrassment if he can actually get up enough courage to tell her before things get awkward the 40 year old virgin has good direction a good script good comedic performances by the whole cast good cinematography and good film editing the film stars and is co written by steve carell who does a very good comedic breakthrough performance and his writing for the film is very good too i was very pleasantly surprised with this film it is sweet funny entertaining fun enjoyable clever good natured and a good time this film is just as good as this year's wedding <UNK> and both films are two of the best comedies i have seen in awhile the 40 year old virgin really showcases a lot of talent and it is put to good use and it works as a comedy and a romance and it is sweet and a lot of fun one of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year
<START> the story and the characters were some of the best i've ever seen the graphics were good for the ps and the cut scenes and voice overs were amazing i beat the game at least 3 times and loved every second of it i felt the problems the protagonist faced were believable and realistic and i believe it deserves a sequel or at least a remake if they remade it for the <UNK> i would buy the system for just that game and maybe <UNK> its amazing also the idea and execution of the <UNK> system is enough to warrant a rental and on top of that ad the inventive although sometimes cheating stupid buster <UNK> combat addition system and the plot makes this game a definite buy
<START> even though this was a made for tv production there's absolutely no excuse for the rock bottom results of the finished product this movie did have a budget and it had a casting department so if you're going to make a movie about a true life story and actually put the true story in the title shouldn't some effort be put forward to try and capture some realism first of all this movie is <UNK> cast these actors belong in daytime television <UNK> or in those ridiculous lifetime channel movies and not in a real life gangster criminal tale everything about them from their looks to their mannerisms just screams of the 90's shopping mall <UNK> rock listening generation what about the script two words describes it stupid and insulting and again it's way too <UNK> sounding i don't think the real clyde <UNK> ever <UNK> the words i'm outta here it's as if a bunch of new kids on the block fans got together and decided to make a really <UNK> flick about bonnie and clyde you know one that would be totally <UNK> and <UNK> well this <UNK> doesn't even rank on the <UNK> and <UNK> scale everything that can be wrong with any kind of film is wrong here from the casting and acting to the editing and music every single thing is grossly wrong and it's <UNK> that the parties responsible for this atrocious turkey had the nerve to put the true story in the title it's certainly not the true story but even worse it's not even remotely entertaining as a mindless popcorn flick that's accepted on its own terms like i stated in my heading it's simply horrible beyond words on every level imaginable trust me on this or watch at your own risk
<START> another one of those films you hear about from friends or read about on imdb not many false notes in this one i could see just about everything here actually happening to a young girl fleeing from a dead end home town in <UNK> to florida with all her <UNK> <UNK> in an old beaten up car br br the heroine ruby makes some false starts but learns from them i found myself wondering why why didn't she lean a bit more on <UNK> shoulder but she has her reasons as it turns out br br just a fine film the only thing i don't much like about it i think is the title
<START> a priest who has abandoned his <UNK> meets a young man who has just been <UNK> br br this movie is about the cruel dilemma between a life dedicated to god and faith and a life of more <UNK> pleasures in post war france it is also about the mortal aspect of faith itself br br this may not be the movie of a lifetime but it is a sin to have allowed it to fall in oblivion besides pierre <UNK> is sublime
<START> hatred of a minute is a <UNK> beautiful film a psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer eric <UNK> strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film a must see for any film student or horror fan the <UNK> of the story and the human side of eric separate this film from other psycho killer movies some shout outs to the film's producer bruce campbell as well as to the film the evil dead add some humor for anyone that knows the genre
<START> i've gotta say i usually like horror movies that i've never seen however this one was just to pathetic for my gory taste i'm used to the gory gut wrenching types but this particular movie was lame the acting was horrible yet the corny no pun intended one liners were cute and the sequel to it scarecrow <UNK> was even worse yes probably when it first came out there was a huge rave about it and people liked it but when movies like the ring and the exorcist of emily rose come out movies like these make movies like scarecrow seem childish if you want a movie to just pass the time pick this one the special effects are cheesy as heck but seeing that it was a low budget movie i can kind of see where that would come in this will kind of remind you of the movie children of the corn independent movies rock most of the time so if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with <UNK> or in the sequel 2 scarecrows going at it then these movies would be for you
<START> this film was so bad i had to fast forward most of it to get to the good bits <UNK> what good bits the only bit that was worth it was the ending those who have seen the film will know what i mean i expected a lot from this film like a underworld meets dawn of the dead meets freddy vs jason but what i got was this crap story was forgettable the cast was used badly and what was the director thinking when he made this this could have been a great but i turned out to be the most boring film i have ever watched ok so what if there was a nice bit of t and a i was after the gore and i was <UNK> disappointed don't expect a film thats good but if you want a bad cheesy horror then by all means watch this and see how a horror movie shouldn't be done
<START> really touching story of a <UNK> camp in america where young men are prepared for the vietnam war the human study always <UNK> to me when it comes to war movies because it <UNK> personal <UNK> opinions on war opposed war action movies where action and technical data are being <UNK> to the prejudice of the human factor br br the movie manages to put a new spin on an already ancient subject and manages to distance itself from usual war movies especially by focusing on an anti hero from the view point of traditional standard the movie focuses on the tragic character of <UNK> who <UNK> avoids being sucked in by the <UNK> war machine and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fight for something he doesn't believe in spends his energy in searching ways to avoid being sent overseas both for himself and <UNK> and ironically ends up finding his own just reason for finally going to war perfect irony br br the acting is truly exceptional and the documentary style shooting almost makes you feel <UNK> into the movie also the movie will provide food for thought for those <UNK> by the action in usual war movies or war games <UNK> hopefully awakening some minds of a generation which luckily escaped the terror of being <UNK>
<START> this is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues that is no exaggeration you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it br br i sincerely thought fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does <UNK> elvira <UNK> at the end but instead of this in every scene somebody is trying to explain when he was young this happened and he just came back from casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there etc br br soon in the movie <UNK> elvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat and while telling her the story of <UNK> life fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other it is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the <UNK> is saying of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of i have suffered much in my life and am about to die br br in one of the sparse moments where actually happens something <UNK> elvira encounters a former lover that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality is that he <UNK> elvira br br there are some interesting shots and ideas i must admit such as when the nun tells the story of the young <UNK> but everything on the movie is wasted due to <UNK> self <UNK>
<START> when i took my seat in the cinema i was in a cool mood and didn't plan on changing it but this movie is a dramatic <UNK> i was all in sweat and needed a shower afterward so what have we <UNK> a coming of age story of a teenage turkish girl living in <UNK> <UNK> it came to my mind soon that the plot seemed pretty much completely borrowed from bend it like beckham where we had an indian girl playing football and spoiling the wedding of her sister here we have it transferred to a turkish girl spoiling her brother's wedding by doing kung fu and we have a love story and a competition of course too after i accepted this this really turned out to be a gripping emotional drama and it shows off some beautiful kung fu i'm not an expert though the lead actress <UNK> <UNK> is not only <UNK> female champion but she also delivers an excellent performance so that it appears to be safe to assume that we have quite some <UNK> impressions here taking into account that this is her first movie and that she has no education as an actress rest of the supporting cast is okay camera good kung fu intense <UNK> the male turkish audience showed respect so that they must have done something right the audience burst into cheers when our heroine finally fought back and attacked the boys who were <UNK> beating up her brother in revenge <UNK> <UNK> a chinese cinematic kung fu <UNK> actor hidden tiger <UNK> dragon played the lead <UNK> master br br if you get the chance to see this in cinema do it you'll probably have a good and intense experience and i don't know if this works on small screen as well
<START> i'm allowed to write 1000 words about this film but one word could suffice bizarre <UNK> and i didn't laugh so much as <UNK> at this truly dreadful movie we kept looking at each other with our best what the expressions there is no way to adequately describe this movie killer tomatoes were funny but this is just sick what kind of mind produces images like these and then puts them on film for others to see what kind of mind includes innocent children in this weird weird movie and then <UNK> it as if it is appropriate for children parents whatever you do if your child still believes in santa don't let him her see this movie <UNK> can watch it probably with what the expressions on their faces if you decide to <UNK> this movie on others you might want to spike their <UNK> br br quite possibly the worst film ever made
<START> after watching about half of this i was ready to give up and turn it off but i endured to the end this is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails the acting is poor much worse than the acting in 80s t a movies br br there are several attempts at humour that fail miserably and the movie is 100 predictable perhaps if you are a teenager this movie will hold some appeal but for those that have seen many movies you will know how the film turns out after the first 10 minutes the rest of your time will be spent in agony waiting for the ending credits to roll br br don't waste your time watching this
<START> i cheer for films that fill in subject matter gaps in world cinema so after watching the trailer for water <UNK> i expected to like this film because i thought i'd stumbled on something unique a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love sort of a female version of beautiful thing br br the main characters are young french women 15 years old marie is <UNK> <UNK> and pretty in a <UNK> way floriane is <UNK> athletic and beautiful and anne is loyal <UNK> and <UNK> immature the erotic <UNK> between marie and floriane is always <UNK> in this movie if not at the surface then just below it br br water <UNK> however is not about the <UNK> of lesbian love upon two teens it is about sexual frustration suffering <UNK> teens working at cross purposes and in at least two instances <UNK> mechanical sex it also proves that screenwriters and film makers <UNK> their own creations when they become too manipulative br br in the extra features on the lord of the flies dvd director peter <UNK> says french cynicism starts with the <UNK> of sex meaning the french regard children as angels while they regard <UNK> and adults with a <UNK> cynicism part of the downfall of this film is film maker celine <UNK> has <UNK> a mighty dose of this cynicism br br where is the joy i asked myself while watching this film yes first love can be painful and frustrating but it can also be <UNK> and <UNK> erotic in a fresh life <UNK> way these positive aspects are missing from this movie there is no balance br br <UNK> this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love but <UNK> is too impressed with her own cynicism and <UNK> and ruins the film first what is the point of showing only the <UNK> girl nude i know there is an established tradition of <UNK> teen nudity in european cinema as <UNK> by films like the <UNK> the <UNK> the devil probably the little thief <UNK> of the heart friends beau <UNK> and europa europa but this instance is a petty <UNK> <UNK> see audience i can make a film where i show only the unattractive person nude either no nudity or <UNK> distributed nudity would've been an honest way to go br br there is a scene in a club where floriane and marie are dancing what follows next is not just floriane <UNK> <UNK> marie it is film maker <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her audience br br perhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and <UNK> honesty takes place when floriane warns marie she's about to request something that is not normal marie understandably asks who cares about being normal then <UNK> plays false with her audience and the <UNK> momentum of the movie because <UNK> request is a phony derivative and substitute question not the authentic heartfelt question the movie <UNK> character and the viewers who've invested their time deserve br br here are also two moments which <UNK> <UNK> on the viewer's nerves 1 since when do the french of all people take <UNK> wearing bathing suits and with a turtle to boot 2 what teen of any <UNK> would <UNK> down on an apple core that's been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the <UNK> mouth br br the three main actresses are promising and if they find better vehicles for their talents may become excellent actors louise <UNK> anne is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles adele <UNK> floriane could become a leading lady or a <UNK> or both pauline <UNK> marie possesses an intensity and <UNK> which are <UNK> in the future she could play everything from an emotionally crippled <UNK> to a mysteriously sensual <UNK> to a reluctant politician riding a <UNK> rise in acclaim br br all in all water <UNK> was very disappointing will an honest film maker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love no not necessarily for the sake of this middle aged guy but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality they can watch and identify with and yes to fill a subject matter gap in world cinema
<START> for your own good it would be best to disregard any positive reviews concerning this movie this flick stinks now i like at least in theory low budget horror movies but this one makes the worst mistake a low budget flick can make it takes itself way too seriously and unfortunately that's not it's only problem br br it's the story of the murderous <UNK> clan of the british <UNK> <UNK> to modern times an interesting premise but there are two things that are immediately <UNK> about this film once you start watching it br br 1 why is the biggest name on the cd box jenna jameson she's a below average looking woman who can't act and she has a minor role answer she's apparently a well known porn star as you no doubt read in other reviews so i guess this is a cameo appearance for her she's giving the film much needed name recognition it seems her top billing isn't any indication of her talent though it's an indication of how <UNK> the rest of the cast is br br 2 how can film makers be so stupid to think canada can be passed off as ireland it doesn't even remotely look like ireland and the house that the guests victims stay in is this great big north american wood frame <UNK> thing they should have <UNK> the whole <UNK> theme and developed a story that took place in n a also if you're going to make a movie that takes place in ireland it's probably best to have more than one character with an irish accent and that was a really really really bad irish accent now this wouldn't have been so bad if the director wasn't trying to make the next night of the living dead but it seems he was too bad he could have had some fun with it in fact some of the scenes weren't far from being unintentionally comedic as they were br br like the infamous <UNK> scene were the woman is <UNK> to the table stripped naked and then <UNK> open and <UNK> that's funny you ask well in the deleted scene version the mutant killer pulls out mile after mile after mile of intestines it's actually funny after awhile and what self <UNK> cannibal eats intestines anyway do we eat the intestines of <UNK> and <UNK> heck no we eat <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> oh well br br some of the other cast who were annoying the whiny creepy howard <UNK> i'm not sure but i think he was supposed to be cast as a stud in fact he's as big a loser and goof ball as his name would imply which would explain why the character played by the equally annoying gillian leigh fell for him br br i checked gillian leigh on her link on imdb and apparently it's important to know that she <UNK> high school with <UNK> i can't decide if it's more amusing or pathetic to know that only a couple years after <UNK> the honor student is doing nude soft core porn scenes in a shower with a guy named howard <UNK> wonder if her former classmates have seen this movie if they have hopefully they'll get the message avoid this fate go to college i could go on and on but why if you like gore you'll find something redeeming in this flick but not much more
<START> given the nature and origin of the 11 <UNK> it is not surprising that this film is at best neutral in its stance towards america probably the most <UNK> segment comes from ken <UNK> who is definitely not <UNK> the british new <UNK> party line although those events of a year ago are shocking and painful to most americans and most <UNK> who saw them unfold live through <UNK> etc the majority of the writers and directors choose to show that tragedy is not an american <UNK> should anybody be surprised that these 3000 deaths are given the same weight elsewhere as the west gives to thousands <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> need we go on victims if this was a <UNK> <UNK> call for the states then it is equally tragic that in the subsequent 12 months the israel <UNK> <UNK> is further from a solution while george bush <UNK> would rather <UNK> revenge than make the world a <UNK> place i think many of the <UNK> wonder where the <UNK> of the <UNK> fathers went and why america <UNK> built as a <UNK> of freedom justice and tolerance now sees its self interest paramount while the third world wonders where the next drink meal or bullet is coming from
<START> synopsis the future as seen from 1939 england as war <UNK> over europe the salvation of mankind will not be found in the politics of the past it is up to the brave new world of science to overcome man's past mistakes br br concept in relation to the viewer beware your leaders and what you are told thinking outside the box can lead to a <UNK> tomorrow there will always be descent and fear and learning to overcome it is our only hope br br pros and cons i had seen this film long ago and recently <UNK> it off of the internet it is in the public <UNK> this is a fascinating work on numerous levels since it is a story about the future as seen from 1939 it has obvious flaws this vision of the future is both terrifying and whimsical this film was cutting edge for its day the special effects are very good as is the story line the acting suffers a bit in the british theatrical sense in that it can lean a bit toward shakespeare br br one of the underlying themes of the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems which we now know is not always true the films other plot line is that charismatic leaders are a curse of human existence and will probably always be with us br br the <UNK> of almost all later science fiction movies can be seen in this film the set design and wardrobe of forbidden planet the <UNK> of technology in 2001 a space <UNK> even the lush landscapes <UNK> of star wars owe some amount of inspiration to this film br br the ending of the film leaves the viewer a bit <UNK> while it is optimistic in its ending sequence of reaching for the stars we are left to wonder if mankind will ever be able to make it even as we reach there are those that are trying to hold us back this films vision of the future while interesting is also a bit humorous by todays standards huge flying machines and guns that could shoot people into space never <UNK> in the real world but in 1939 they were considered the next logical step br br many great british actors are in this film as young men cedric <UNK> and ralph richardson are the most recognized and their <UNK> skills are evident here raymond massey is a curious choice to play the lead character <UNK> his character almost comes across as the new christ sent to save the world from its own destruction with the new religion of science br br this is a good piece of cinema history whose themes are still relevant today even if its vision of the future missed the mark
<START> i like many people saw this film in the theatre when it first came out in <UNK> it was a below average film at best <UNK> not the masterpiece that all these titanic <UNK> like to make it out as first off <UNK> is a terrible actor no matter which way you look at it people just like him because of his looks his acting skills essentially consist of saying a lot of cheesy lines and trying to act sexy second the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot girl falls in love with guy ship they're on sinks lots of crappy love scenes thereafter anyone with an iq above 50 will realize this isn't ingenious in any way whatsoever nor is it original plus the director felt the need to drag it out for 3 hours i could <UNK> it into a 1 hour block without losing any of the plot in conclusion titanic is the most overrated movie to date why it got so much attention and money is beyond me
<START> passionate dramatic riveting as flamenco itself the film is simply amazing it is set on the immortal <UNK> music the original music is written and performed by one of the greatest classical <UNK> leading <UNK> of the modern flamenco style <UNK> de <UNK> who plays a musician with the same name legendary flamenco dancer and choreographer antonio <UNK> co wrote the script and choreographed this fabulous version of the celebrated georges <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> opera he plays a main character antonio the famous dancer choreographer who works on retelling the story of carmen in the flamenco style that combines dances with singing and <UNK> hand <UNK> and has a highly charged level of dynamics that appeals enormously to the viewers br br brilliant and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whose technical excellence matches the elegant artistry of her dancing shines in the supporting role <UNK> had been the first dancer in <UNK> company for twenty years 1968 1988 and she was the protagonist of three films that carlos <UNK> made of <UNK> three great shows <UNK> de <UNK> 1978 carmen 1983 and el <UNK> <UNK> 1985 gorgeous laura del <UNK> is a young dancer named carmen in whom <UNK> sees from the first sight another carmen who was <UNK> by two <UNK> the writer <UNK> <UNK> in his most famous <UNK> written in <UNK> that had inspired george <UNK> world famous <UNK> <UNK> version from <UNK> br br as in the opera and in the <UNK> carmen in <UNK> film is <UNK> and deadly the ultimate femme fatale who has to be free above anything else she could not tolerate the <UNK> love of any man and would prefer death to <UNK> there some 50 movie adaptations of the story and the opera to the screen and as different as they are they all have in common the only possible tragic end <UNK> <UNK> film is unique as the most sensual of all and truly spanish i fell in love with it from the first time i saw it over twenty years ago and it is as special and beautiful today as it was back then highly recommended
<START> first and foremost i would like to say that i'm a huge sarah silverman fan and having other people say that and then <UNK> on the pilot is beyond me everything in the pilot was in typical sarah silverman form maybe not directly funny but the situation and the delivery are what counts br br if you liked jesus is magic then i don't see how you wouldn't like this it has that same flow and that same rhythm true it's only for the true fans but if you are you'll be pleased br br again only for the true fans there's no way around that if you're not used to her style then you wouldn't get why this is funny however it is and i hope you think so too
<START> definitely the worst movie i have ever seen can somebody tell me where should have i laughed there's not a single hint or shadow of an idea the three leading actors are <UNK> especially the one i think it's <UNK> from <UNK> who can't make a <UNK> accent not to say about the dream like <UNK> about dracula just another <UNK> drawn from the worst <UNK> tradition to make this film last a little longer <UNK> and <UNK> do what they can but this so called movie was really too too hard to rescue i would have given it 0 10 but the lowest mark was 1 10 and so i had to <UNK> it by one mark
<START> i think that if i went to a first school somewhere deep in the countryside and asked the bottom set of english to come up with a script it would make more sense than this i could then go to the first year drama group and they would act it out better than the <UNK> in this film this sounds really mean but i'm certain that they made this as a joke and are entirely aware that they possess see what i did there neither the skills to act or to write anything ever br br watch this only if you're incredibly drunk high or in need of a good excuse as to why your <UNK> corpse was found with <UNK> <UNK> i will now go to my fish bowl and collect all of the poo at the bottom after that i will <UNK> it into the shape of a disc and put it into my dvd player fully expecting it to produce something far better than this <UNK> br br acting 0 10 plot lol 10 breasts 9 10
<START> this is one of my all time favorite movies period i can't think of another movie that combines so many nice movie qualities like this one does this flick has it all action adventure science fiction good vs bad and even some romance without even an innocent peck on the cheek between the <UNK> and <UNK> maybe best of all you don't have to be in <UNK> to get it and enjoy the movie like you do with some of miyazaki's other movies i don't know about you but i watch movies to take a break from thinking this is just a flat out enjoyable movie that everyone will like so do yourself a favor and go buy it the only sour note is the american dubbing i found <UNK> geek to be just plain annoying but all is not lost the original japanese version is on the two disc set and it rocks who cares if you can't understand spoken japanese if you can read at a second grade level then watch the original japanese recording with english subtitles you won't regret it
<START> this movie is up there with the all time classics the music camera shots and acting are excellent showing the movie in black and white gave it a much better appearance and <UNK> the music perfectly like psycho its surprising how so few people have commented on this movie my guess is that its a hard movie to find i gave the film a 9 see the movie and you'll know what i'm talking about
<START> imagine a woman alone in a house for forty five minutes in which absolutely nothing happens then this goes on twice more the writing is flat and lifeless and jokes unfunny and the bad acting keeps you from caring about any of the characters even when they battle wolf packs and get beaten up by <UNK> <UNK> anyone that <UNK> this movie higher than a two is not fully sane
<START> take rambo mix in some miami vice slice the budget about 80 and you've got something that a few ten year old boys could come up with if they have a big enough backyard too much access to <UNK> cop and ex <UNK> <UNK> busey and with a name like <UNK> you know he's as gritty as they come is <UNK> to retrieve an american <UNK> that has been stolen hidden in mexico captured with the tank were <UNK> sgt major <UNK> jones <UNK> former love <UNK> <UNK> the officer in command now meat for the <UNK> terrorists spies drug <UNK> who have no sense of decency blah blah blah for an action movie with <UNK> sex there's a <UNK> of action and not much sex the running joke is that <UNK> gets shot all the time survives keeping the bullets as <UNK> apparently the writers didn't see the magnificent seven the man for us is the one who gave him that face nor thought to give <UNK> even a <UNK> of intelligence even for a budget <UNK> the production values are poor with distant shots during dialog and very little movement the main prop the tank is silly enough for an ed wood production <UNK> who might have been a blonde julia roberts she had a far bigger role in crime story than julia has to go from <UNK> to frightened to butt kicking back again on an <UNK> notice jones who's been in an amazing array of films pretty much hits bottom right here both he busey were probably just out for some easy money a couple of laughs look for talented future character actor danny <UNK> heat once upon a time in mexico in a stereotyped menacing bit part much too dull even for a guilty pleasure <UNK> is still <UNK> enough to play when you leave your house but want people to think there's someone home
<START> okay as you can see this is one of my favorite if not favorite films this is a character drama which is absolutely hilarious the main character is a business man who is stuck in a same thing different day mentality he sees a woman looking melancholy out a window of a dance studio from his train everyday and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her he decides to join the dance class only to find out she is not the <UNK> from there he bonds with four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing as well as finding out about the mysterious woman br br there is no gratuitous or any sex involved just how a small group of people learn how friendships are formed and developed br br this film was remade with richard gere and jennifer lopez and the new one while appealing is nowhere as enjoyable as the original the movie never made it big in america because it was not <UNK> for the oscars since it was broadcast on television in japan movies cannot be released on tv or they are <UNK> for oscar nominations it did win numerous awards in japan for best film cast director etc for their oscar awards
<START> i caught this film on <UNK> on cable it sounded like it would be a good film a japanese green card i can't say i've ever disliked an asian film quite the contrary some of the most incredible horror films of all time are japanese and korean and i am a huge fan of john <UNK> hong kong films i an not <UNK> to a light hearted films like <UNK> or <UNK> king express two of my favourites so i thought i would like this well i would rather <UNK> my <UNK> and drink my own blood than watch this <UNK> badly acted film ever again br br i think the director steven <UNK> must have <UNK> the water with <UNK> because no one in this film had a personality and when any of the characters did try to act as opposed to <UNK> a line or two their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake i honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before the only person who sounded genuine was brenda <UNK> i find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy because i didn't laugh once even more surprising is that cbs morning news called this a refreshing breath of comedy it was neither refreshing nor a breath of comedy and the ending was very predictable the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things br br avoid this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting i actually think that spike of <UNK> is a better acted film than this and i walked out half way through that film
<START> this is perhaps the <UNK> display of santa claus ever committed to any medium whether it be a book a picture or a movie santa looks like a <UNK> looking down on the children and the twisted story of bringing <UNK> in to help him defeat one of <UNK> <UNK> pitch doesn't make things any better it's laughable to say the least with bad effects even for 1959 standards if a kid were to watch this movie he'd have nightmares and never want santa to visit they'd be <UNK> for life imagine the kid's in a christmas story when they start screaming after being put on <UNK> lap that's how this would turn out if kid's see this movie
<START> in the comic modesty is strong alexandra <UNK> who plays modesty blaise looks more like an <UNK> fashion model she does not either have the moral or personality that modesty have in the comics modesty would never give a woman an advice to show more skin to earn more money i cannot see any similarities with my comic books with modesty and this movie its like a mission impossible movie would be about ethan hunt locked in the <UNK> room in high school talking with the janitor about when he went to junior high school and hunt would have been played by dj <UNK> in road trip <UNK> if you are an modesty fan do not see the movie you will just get angry if do not know much about the modesty comics rent an other movie do not <UNK> your time with this one i cannot understand how quentin tarantino can put his name on it i will ask for a <UNK> at my dvd rent store tomorrow
<START> this is a great documentary film any fan of car racing should own a copy of this outstanding film director stephen low did a great job as well as the main stars of the film father son mario michael <UNK> the dvd looks sounds amazing and best of all it's <UNK> great home theater test disc
<START> david duchovny plays the lead role in this film now a lot of people upon finding that fact out wouldn't even bother watching it very unfair to say the least david made his name on the x files and is a decent actor dr eugene <UNK> duchovny is a drug addicted doctor struck off for <UNK> by sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire raymond <UNK> however the fbi take an interest in using eugene to <UNK> <UNK> angelina jolie is cast in the supporting role of <UNK> the gangsters <UNK> she puts in a solid performance timothy <UNK> playing <UNK> is superb and immersed himself deeply into his character duchovny himself isn't as bad as many people would think and in the end i would rate his performance his credible his familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present but <UNK> detract too much from the film
<START> this was what black society was like before the crack <UNK> <UNK> rap and aids that <UNK> the <UNK> in the eighties decent <UNK> families that <UNK> to get by and all the <UNK> and <UNK> they faced black america was a different group of people in the seventies still full of hope and flying high on the civil rights movements of the sixties times were hard but still worth fighting for <UNK> your head above water making a wave when you can this show showed how black society <UNK> to work together as people and families before they started to prey on each other and everyone else in order to survive the horrors of the <UNK> it is heart breaking to see what the black <UNK> were like then and what they have become now
<START> i absolutely loved this film i was <UNK> to watch it at first because i thought it would be too painful i remember how hard it was when john was shot however watching the two of us took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility i think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what might have been <UNK> quinn was adorable as paul and met the challenge head on i was impressed with his accent and mannerisms jared harris is also very talented and was quite believable as john my favorite parts were the scene in the park and the <UNK> scene which was so poignant the film left me with both sadness and satisfaction both of which i feel are appropriate given the circumstances
<START> i love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the <UNK> i like <UNK> because they are scary my favorite parts are the ones where the <UNK> looks behind the <UNK> because it reminds me of a scene from the friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana br br i really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but it's okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and i think it's got a good ending even though i didn't really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings i figured it out over time and that's the important part the other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you're watching it the first time br br this is best movie
<START> hidden frontier has been talked about and reported on by several news <UNK> for their long commitment to creating the best star trek stories and to providing an example of the <UNK> that was gene <UNK> mission their focus on homosexuality depression war and acceptance of different races is on par or <UNK> those of the other trek series and movies the production value started off as smaller and choppy but over the 7 seasons of production the acting has improved the stories are more complex and the visual graphics have gotten <UNK> and more impressive in season 6 episode 1 <UNK> there is one of the biggest space battles in trek history the ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting the real draw to frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds but it is the people and the interplay and growth of characters there are also <UNK> to other trek series and movies with places and characters we all know i recommend any trek fan to check out <UNK> and you will be hooked
<START> hi may be because i am not a theater major or a sophisticated movie watcher i think this movie is boring and dumb br br i rented this movie because of charles bronson and it's title but boy what a waste of time just watching 2 guys sitting in a vault and talking br br the movie on this dvd was so dark i had hard time watching the darn movie i realize it is a 1968 movie but they are putting it on a dvd then they should do some digital <UNK> br br also i was totally surprised to see these high marks on imdb for this movie like i said before i am not as sophisticated as the other folks who commented on this movie earlier
<START> i believe shakespeare explained what i just read beautifully me thinks he the lady <UNK> protest too much the whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself he sites <UNK> literature <UNK> from the same time period but not connected with the bible a number of times however i can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible anyone can <UNK> data prove anything they like but it doesn't make it true customs change word <UNK> change over time look at english german where it is very obviously a common root nothing stays the same it's always growing and changing the bible has many different <UNK> but the king james version is the one i've found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research in the king james version you will notice there are certain words written in <UNK> these words have been added by the <UNK> and can be dropped the mean of the entire <UNK> changes <UNK> from around the time of christ were written without spaces without <UNK> without <UNK> without <UNK> <UNK> these <UNK> look like one long word the <UNK> added all of the above for example how would you read this <UNK> do you read it as god is nowhere or do you read it as god is now here same string of letters two entirely different meanings this is why many biblical <UNK> use a <UNK> to assist them in translation as it provides a word for word translation from the original <UNK> greek or <UNK> depending on the language in which the <UNK> was originally written it's also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove god exists but you can not prove he doesn't exist in the end i just love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are <UNK> to judge the almighty talk about ego putting <UNK> away god bless <UNK>
<START> north africa in the 1930's to a small arab town on the edge of the <UNK> comes a beautiful woman looking for meaning to her life a handsome <UNK> monk fleeing from his crisis of faith they will meet and passions will be <UNK> but not even the sand <UNK> knows if they will find happiness or sorrow here in the garden of <UNK> br br the plot is pure <UNK> but the film is still great fun beautiful to look at marlene <UNK> charles boyer are a superb screen couple she is to put it simply gorgeous and boyer gives a most effective understated performance letting his sensitive face do much of his acting for him br br the supporting cast is excellent basil <UNK> in a sympathetic role as a count who loves the desert joseph <UNK> as a friendly <UNK> guide all the <UNK> he others speak in the film is pure <UNK> <UNK> watson as a gentle mother superior alan <UNK> as an honorable young french officer <UNK> <UNK> as a dangerous dancer henry brandon as a comic porter john carradine as the mysterious sand <UNK> and magnificent sir c <UNK> smith as a wise old priest br br movie <UNK> will recognize helen <UNK> eddy as a nun <UNK> mae jones <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> over the <UNK> shoulder as convent girls <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> as a monastery <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as a hotel clerk all uncredited br br color films of the 1930's are both rare lovely to look at and this movie is no exception the cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself the garden of <UNK> was the first technicolor film to be shot on location <UNK> arizona gave the film makers all the sand <UNK> they could desire but <UNK> drinking water <UNK> degree heat soon had the company in revolt when the daily rushes showed <UNK> face had burned a bright <UNK> red producer david o <UNK> finally gave in the remainder of the film was shot on a hollywood sound stage
<START> this move actually had me jumping out of my chair in anticipation of what the actors were going to do the acting was the best farrah should have gotten a oscar for this she was fabulous james russo was so good i hated him he was the villain and played it wonderful there aren't many movies that have <UNK> me as this one the cast was great <UNK> looking shocked with those big eyes farrah looking like a victim and you re lived her horror as she went through it farrah made you feel like you were there and feeling the same anger she felt you wanted her to hurt him yet you also knew it was the wrong thing to do the movie had you on a roller coaster ride and you went up and down with each scene
<START> all i can say about the <UNK> <UNK> 2 series is if you are even remotely pc or don't have a seriously messed up sense of humor then you probably wont get it as sick and disgusting as this movie is it really is a comedy and not a horror movie at all if you can appreciate somebody who pushes the <UNK> of good taste and political correctness to the most extreme limits imaginable to the point where is becomes so out of hand that it's comical then you must see this to believe it this movie is so out of control that a major film studio couldn't touch this with a 10 foot pole with a <UNK> on the end in my opinion though the best most extreme pieces of art come from way underground if you don't stick to the same old formula that people are used to seeing then they reject it br br i have seen <UNK> of terrible boring z grade <UNK> movies that were just a waste of a perfectly good vhs tape or dvd r i have also seen <UNK> of stink bombs coming from the big named studios that were a complete waste of millions of dollars when a no budget film like these two from ron <UNK> john <UNK> come out and blow all of the other shock films completely out of the water you really have to take a second look at the whole <UNK> movie scene after seeing this you can really see how much freedom an <UNK> film maker can have when they work on their own br br the funny thing is even the other people who saw this movie and hated it admit to the fact that they laughed all the way through it i don't think that is is possible for anybody to get bored watching either of these two so if don't take everything that you seen in the mainstream media too seriously and are able to laugh at a <UNK> puppet wielding psychopath who has finally <UNK> you have to see this you may just be able to see it for the stand alone cult classic that it is both <UNK> <UNK> 2 are among the favorites in my collection of well over 1000 dvds
<START> this isn't as violent as i was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effective br br there are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know who's side a particular character is on br br the plot is <UNK> with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the <UNK> of the <UNK> gang it follows br br the violence when it comes is brutal no guns or martial art scenes with special effects this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the <UNK> is a violent criminal <UNK> br br the ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable
<START> the problems with this film are many but i will try to mention the most glaring and <UNK> ones first of all while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about manhattan life the reality was that everything as usual in movies and tv was about something bizarre usually of a sexual nature the story lines were thin or nonexistent and virtually every scene camera shot line of dialog and expressed emotion was absolutely and totally fake it finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that i walked out something no <UNK> for me in recent years i would have guessed the <UNK> was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program but i believe the at one time pre <UNK> talented director mira <UNK> took part in this disgusting travesty so perhaps the directorial talent in america has <UNK> en <UNK> into the <UNK>
<START> a female vampire kills young women and paints with their blood she has an assistant who doesn't want to be a vampire so he has to do what she orders or be turned into a blood sucker after a few kills the assistant gets <UNK> and falls in love with a homeless girl br br what can i say about this movie that its pacing is over slow that it has some strange sound effects never a bite sounded so strange and ambiance new jazz here i come and that lights don't seem to be included on the set it looks like an auteur horror movie with all the self <UNK> inside br br the plot is completely stupid and as you can guess it's the female vampire who explains how to kill her even if she doesn't have to do it of course crosses light <UNK> and sticks don't work br br it's not even a funny lousy movie perhaps with some friends and a lot of beers it can't have its funny sides to be honest it's funny during 10 15 minutes near the end of the movie don't be fooled by the troma <UNK> it's one the bad movie they present
<START> billed as the story of steve biko played excellently by denzel washington as you'd expect this was actually more the story of donald woods played by kevin kline br br this was undoubtedly the making of kline as a serious actor and he was surprisingly good in the role br br attenborough gave this the sort of direction you'd expect and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were those of the sort that only he can get across br br the remainder of the cast was competent enough and did a good job in what ends up as an ultimately sad tale of a south africa that is still nowhere near the distant past
<START> <UNK> is a serious look at the consequences of growing up too fast in the 1980s and unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it <UNK> fast times at <UNK> high the movie holds up well against time br br its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and jodie foster and <UNK> <UNK> scott <UNK> remember him lead a fine young cast that's well worth watching br br the film follows four southern california girls as they move through a <UNK> existence of sex and drugs and devoid of parents the teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties <UNK> or out on the street seldom are they home because instant <UNK> is a <UNK> party or boy away br br but rather than <UNK> them the film is sympathetic <UNK> absent <UNK> adults for forcing the teens to grow up alone and the charismatic cast is impossible to dislike br br the film's opening  a long and loving pan sets the tone for what follows we see the girls asleep at <UNK> amid the objects that define teen <UNK> from <UNK> to a picture of a young john <UNK> while donna <UNK> on the radio is scored beneath br br from there the movie picks up speed as the girls head off to school and to life annie runaway rocker <UNK> <UNK> is the wild child who lives for the next party or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the boy crazy drama queen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the shy girl in over her head and foster is the one with the plan it's her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while also holding her divorced and desperate man hunting mother in line sally <UNK> br br it's an almost impossible job and one that foster ultimately fails at br br despite its age <UNK> remains a pleasure to watch dated hair clothes and references to olympic <UNK> dorothy <UNK> haven't hurt the movie br br the cinematography is simply stunning with breathtaking <UNK> shots of the l a <UNK> at dawn <UNK> and at night <UNK> <UNK> adds a 80s soundtrack featuring the likes of donna summer and <UNK> ian br br perhaps the movie's biggest disappointment is that the young stars around foster never broke out like the casts of st <UNK> fire 1985 or empire records 1995 <UNK> shows why they should have but perhaps like <UNK> for <UNK> song 1985 they just hit a wall
<START> one of the many vigilante epics that <UNK> the market by the mid 80s the routine plot has echoes of the magnificent seven believe it or not the action scenes are <UNK> handled and the special effects are non existent you could do worse but the film is still just a waste of time 1 2
<START> this movie is about a cop <UNK> wan <UNK> trying to catch a super clever thief <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> an insurance company headed by a kelly lin basically whatever plans the cop tries the thief somehow knows them beforehand this movie covered by handsome lead actors beautiful lead actress and good camera shots of hong kong scenes really has no substance at all it's all flash and the flash quickly becomes dull too i lost all interests a third of the way into the movie and there is no redeeming quality after that except for the cinematography which looks good only consider seeing this movie if you can do so for free also consider stopping watching the movie 20 minutes into the movie because it's all the same to the end boring 6 10
<START> knights was just a beginning of a series a pilot one might say the plot i really shouldn't call it that there wasn't any plot wasn't logical at all and there were many mistakes like warning i'm <UNK> the plot br br in the beginning of the movie someone said that there was only a couple of those <UNK> the bad guys but after the climax <UNK> found out that there were many many more left of them and it was told that <UNK> were hard to kill but after a <UNK> training <UNK> could kill them with a single blow br br the movie was just pure kicking i wasn't surprised at all when i found out that the leading star was a kick boxer br br there was one positive thing in the whole movie it really gave a great deal of laughter when watching it and talking about it with my friends i recommend watching it if you are in need of laughter
<START> i thought the children in the show did a very good job i especially enjoyed the performance of the emma character well done the stunts were pretty good for a low budget show i was able to follow the movie and enjoy it without having to look at my watch every 5 minutes i enjoyed the scenes with the tooth fairy and the burning of her the ghostly <UNK> of the children's souls being released was also good another good point of the movie is that it kept moving along there wasn't a lot of slow scenes the adult leads were also believable and therefore helped to keep the show entertaining all in all an enjoyable night of movie watching
<START> the golden era of disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the 90s this show <UNK> pack shouldn't even be considered a <UNK> spin off because the show barely had anything to do with <UNK> it's about a teen aged <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> as they make trouble for their uncle donald and talk in hip hop <UNK> and they are fully dressed unlike in <UNK> i prefer the little adventurous <UNK> from <UNK> there are humans in <UNK> and the <UNK> are the only animals living in <UNK> there's no references of scrooge <UNK> the stories are repetitive the plot is boring but the animation is good if you want lots of slapstick humor i recommend this to you if you want a better disney show watch <UNK> duck or <UNK>
<START> a <UNK> social condition <UNK> off the catastrophe an <UNK> giovanna has ended up in the <UNK> but still has an ace up her <UNK> beauty and youth <UNK> a fat <UNK> gas station tenant who has been getting on in years picks her up from the street and offers her bed and home together with his clumsy affection but the physical contact that giovanna is now exposed to only gives her feelings of disgust and consequently she does not see a <UNK> in him but a <UNK> whom she has to get rid of br br the arrival of gino a young <UNK> worker finally provides her the <UNK> for opportunity and you don't have to ask her twice at the very first encounter she gives him the feeling of being physically desired and a little later she lets him seduce her without offering any resistance br br the <UNK> <UNK> has to submit to the strict rules drawn up by giovanna though <UNK> yearning for freedom is <UNK> his desire to leave the place with giovanna and start a new life far away from the <UNK> is pushed aside giovanna aims at another goal to get <UNK> killed to <UNK> and in addition to that to collect the insurance <UNK> in her hands gino <UNK> into a self <UNK> tool being completely at the mercy of this woman he turns into a cold blooded killer br br but in contrast to giovanna he questions the committed crime on a moral level the very taking over of <UNK> place which includes the sleeping in the bed of a dead man causes a deep loathing of himself and later after he has found out about the <UNK> <UNK> of the insurance money and seems to see through <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> plan he also <UNK> a physical <UNK> from his lover and finds comfort in the arms of a prostitute br br if <UNK> film ended at this point it could easily be classified as a <UNK> portrait of a cool <UNK> and <UNK> woman with a slight touch of social criticism but then the last sequences make this carefully built <UNK> of ideas collapse at last giovanna feels <UNK> about what she has done and by the <UNK> revelation of her <UNK> feelings she succeeds in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> love her violent death by an absurd road accident then does not only leave him helpless at the mercy of an <UNK> fate it also affects us while we realize that none of the acting characters is to be made responsible for their disaster the <UNK> is just the state of a society that <UNK> the way of the individual <UNK> right from the start br br
<START> immediately after renting and watching this movie several years ago a friend and i decided that it defined the absolute zero on the movie scale there was nothing about the movie that could have been done worse than it was to this day we still rate movies even very bad ones by how much better than the lonely lady they are br br a long time ago i saw an interview with <UNK> perry who wrote the screenplays for among other things last summer and diary of a mad housewife and she related that she had been asked to write a screenplay for the harold <UNK> book the lonely lady she said that she sent in a treatment and it was rejected because they didn't think she understood the difficulties of a female screenwriter in hollywood she then said i think they got someone else to write it the interview was filmed before the movie was released she died in 1981 and i bet the first thing she did on arrival in heaven was personally thank god for saving her from involvement in the result
<START> the history of the fbi as told from the point of view of agent stewart via flashbacks <UNK> with his personal life story stewart and miles as his wife are pretty good as is hamilton as an earnest agent the problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved it's like watching bits and pieces of a dozen different movies as we get glimpses of a who's who cast of gangsters some of the episodes are too long some too short and some just look out of place stewart's daughter's school sequence overall it goes on way too long nevertheless it's worth a look for its handsome production values
<START> the film school <UNK> can <UNK> all they want about the important imagined meaning of this film but it's just that intellectual <UNK> this film is <UNK> <UNK> and some mistake it's endless self indulgent <UNK> as substance yeah br br obviously godard wasn't a stones fan too bad because this could have been great he's capturing the birth of this timeless song and he chooses instead to cover the music with some guy reading out of a true detective <UNK> or some such crap br br then there's the endless shots of what looks like 60's <UNK> <UNK> painting words on people's cars and then there's the seemingly <UNK> interview where the actress was brilliantly <UNK> to answer only yes or no to all the really deep and intellectual questions there's some dude in a purple suit is reading more crap from a book which goes on for oh only about 20 minutes and black <UNK> or something in a <UNK> br br it almost sounds intriguing well it's not br br but for <UNK> film school <UNK> who don't care <UNK> about the lost opportunities of having full access to the stones bringing sympathy for the devil into the world and would rather hear some english guy reading instead whilst <UNK> at the covers of <UNK> <UNK> this film's a real winner br br more accurately maybe godard just blows
<START> first of all excuse my bad english of course only a movie starring jessica simpson can include serious goofs like this i'm a norwegian and i felt offended and shocked the makers of this movie did not take the time to do their research upon making this american norwegian movie even <UNK> is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country br br so i'm <UNK> my <UNK> out of my frustration the country is named <UNK> not <UNK> da is russian not norwegian norwegian priests never use those black <UNK> with that white paper by the neck as the <UNK> church is the <UNK> by far it's true we have a native traditional folk outfit that we only use like twice a year but the outfit in this movie is more like a german outfit i could not understand the so called norwegian in this movie jessica was not making any sense <UNK> did the norwegian priests br br the only thing i <UNK> is the norwegian flag and the <UNK> hats but that's so <UNK> what people think about <UNK> <UNK> o gosh br br well i guess the people who made this film will never read this comment but at least i <UNK> some things up and got rid of some of that frustration br br i'm proud of my country and i'd love if people in the us were less <UNK> and more accurate when they talk about this country br br that was all <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> p
<START> this is possibly the worst of all the columbo movies andrew <UNK> acting is poor as the villain and the plot is weak in fact none of the cast seem able to act other than peter falk who puts in a <UNK> performance as the lieutenant
<START> <UNK> tend to fall under the <UNK> of a low budget and a <UNK> shooting schedule which is why this film always tends to buck the trend br br george c scott <UNK> <UNK> scrooge perfectly fully <UNK> all of his cold <UNK> and still makes him a <UNK> character the production value for this film was exceptional never relying on <UNK> special effects or <UNK> set ups yet relying on the depth and clarity of on site shooting and strong backdrops a movie that certainly stands alone
<START> deranged and <UNK> gory japanese film about little beings taking people over and turning them into <UNK> zombie like machines which beat and hack each other apart so that the winner can eat the loser in the middle of this a pair of lovers become infected br br technically superb horror comedy is only for those with strong <UNK> as blood and body parts go flying good taste <UNK> me from describing what happens here but lets just say its pretty gruesome if you like this sort of thing with form several steps above <UNK> content by all means see this film personally i'm not normally one to enjoy films like this on anything but the how sick and twisted do they go level here i was intrigued enough that i can suggest it to people i know who like really gory movies its also a film with enough going on in the details that i want to see it again since now that i know what was going on as revealed in the end i want to go back and see what it was i didn't catch on to there is an internal logic rare in these films br br <UNK> out of 10 for those who like blood and severed limbs its a zero or more precisely a run and hide alert for everyone else
<START> seriously can you imagine such a spread of talent in one film without a huge budget daniel day lewis ray <UNK> brenda <UNK> hugh <UNK> and <UNK> shaw there's no <UNK> that <UNK> and day lewis deserved their awards but it would have been entirely <UNK> to have seen <UNK> as young christie and <UNK> awarded the cliché is true here they don't perform the roles they inhabit them day <UNK> performance is a tour de force such a transformation that it is awe inducing but it was truly a mark of the <UNK> intelligence that alongside this performance they also <UNK> brenda <UNK> beautifully restrained still and heart wrenching work as <UNK> mother by the way if you haven't seen this magnificent actress in <UNK> that's another film well worth checking out for her contribution and the sublime miranda richardson
<START> show me your <UNK> is not funny and certainly not on a channel that shows cartoons if you understand where i'm coming from i don't want my 6 and 7 years old daughters thinking like that or hearing that i find it sad that nick hyped this crap that much and then that's what we get stupid little kids acting like stupid adults i know it's meant to be humorous but consider we out there that have sweet little innocent girls in k and 1st grade who can't wait to see this i had to comment on how disappointed i was when i saw it my daughters won't be watching it i'd love to block nick but don't have the heart at this point but if nick keeps putting out this kind of crap i'll have to
<START> i try to watch it everyday most of the time and even though i have watched it for the past 4 years i have not seen every episode br br the show is about danny <UNK> who is guy who does news for sports his wife is killed by a car accident from a drunk driver and he asks jesse an elvis maniac with a motorcycle and has an obsession of his hair joey an adult kid who does comedy and does voices of cartoons all the time to take care of his three girls donna joe they call her d j <UNK> who is the second oldest and michelle the youngest br br they all live under one roof with no one to help them out br br later in the show jesse gets a girl friend and later is married to her and have twins <UNK> and alex this starts to happen in the new seasons this show is awesome if you like the <UNK> life of <UNK> and cody that's so <UNK> boy meets world and <UNK> woman you will love this it starts to get better in the ending seasons watch it you will love it
<START> sure this was a remake of a 70's film but it had the suspense and action of a current film say breakdown he's running desperate to be with his <UNK> wife the police are the least concern the chases were very good the part with him being br br <UNK> at a rest stop was well done the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger this is better than <UNK> a boring movie with what a muscle car chase that was filmed badly <UNK> character knew what he had to do to escape johnny law few movies had the effects night vision <UNK> radio okay i forgot the name of the movie guy has <UNK> <UNK> up toys with guy he upset the ending is great you can't tell if he <UNK> his suicide or not a very good did he make it or not
<START> oh my god please for the love of all that is holy do not watch this movie it it <UNK> minutes of my life i will never get back sure i could have stopped watching half way through but i thought it might get better it didn't anyone who actually enjoyed this movie is one seriously sick and twisted individual no wonder us <UNK> new <UNK> have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies everything about this movie is horrible from the acting to the editing i don't even normally write reviews on here but in this case i'll make an exception i only wish someone had of warned me before i hired this catastrophe
<START> i saw this film with a special screening of the work of owen <UNK> <UNK> it is so interesting where did this guy come from now he is probably the key independent african filmmaker in the world and i am not talking about black filmmakers i am talking about filmmakers who are <UNK> in culture the idea if anything <UNK> to the diversity and range of african themes with his film 500 years later it is a african issue but the idea doesn't fit that mold showing the artistic diversity the film is an all african cast but the topic is a human topic which most of us could relate to i just love the mild comedy in it and the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> is just amazing it is really a art house gem
<START> this is a great movie in the same genre of the <UNK> belle seen it about 10 years ago and would like to see it again there is a link with the history of the <UNK> angels how the pilot crew fight the germans in <UNK> and most changes form pilots to <UNK> <UNK> cycle <UNK> the movie is in a way really happened see the movie and reed the history of the <UNK> angels at <UNK> at <UNK> angels com regards <UNK> br br cast crew john <UNK> john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kris <UNK> directed by graham baker more <UNK> synopsis the story of a <UNK> backwoods rebel biker who joins the army to avoid a stiff prison sentence after a minor brush with the law though he <UNK> at army discipline he soon proves himself under fire as a daring and charismatic leader of men in a motorcycle <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> world war ii spain more <UNK> mpaa rating pg runtime <UNK> minutes
<START> i did watch all of the film through to the <UNK> ending even though i felt so angry at what i saw i felt that the director was screaming for attention and the only way he could achieve this was to be as repulsive as possible since i have lived in the uk i have come to love this country but this film depicts british young people in the worst way imaginable there is nothing to be said but avoid it it will make you angry and sick the people involved should be ashamed
<START> at two and a quarter hours this is a sometimes slow moving thoughtful film interrupted by vast sword battles the battle between darkness and light is <UNK> by the constant <UNK> of the blazing sun and is superbly demonstrated by a three way fight between <UNK> <UNK> and soldiers in a forest during an <UNK> br br be prepared following a stunning sword fight under lightning filled <UNK> the end of this picture will have you scratching your head in <UNK>
<START> style but no substance not as funny as it should be not as deep as it wants to be br br this is another in the genre of films about the difficulties of filmmaking a young <UNK> is hired to finish a campy 60s sci fi movie called <UNK> <UNK> think <UNK> or danger <UNK> br br but jeremy davies is an angst ridden filmmaker he's no hack he's an artist the movie he wants to make is a diary of his life hardly original br br all the characters outside of jeremy davies filmmaker are as thin as rice paper characters that might be interesting such as his father his <UNK> or jason <UNK> as a hack director are introduced and then shown the door without adding a thing br br this movie is full of eye candy but when compared to other films about filmmakers such as stardust memories or 8 1 2 it <UNK> in comparison those movies are funny provocative with well developed characters those movies have lessons that apply outside br br the movie wants to be comic and campy but its just derivative and there is not one funny scene the filmmakers describe it as a send up but what's the satirical target the actors say it's an homage but i think i would rather a full length version of <UNK> <UNK> br br coppola is clearly amused by the setting as is evident by the visual humor of the sci fi movie within a movie but he fails to share why we should be amused br br outside of the sci fi movie its just a mess there are continuity errors the filmmaker chooses a sci fi weapon after its already been chosen what br br just because he has a scene were the filmmaker is confronted by the critics complaining about the lack of story lack of a point a scene where he admits empty <UNK> does not mean that he has addressed those criticisms br br i guess if your roman coppola you can get away with making a movie about an angst ridden idealistic filmmaker who doesn't know what he wants to say and so ends up saying nothing in that sense it may be considered <UNK> br br i would watch it at circuit city on a wall full of <UNK> if i had a choice watch the 15 minute <UNK> <UNK> movies included on the dvd as extras and then send it back
<START> ben arthur could have been a 10 sam <UNK> wrote directed <UNK> and produced this movie sam should have given his idea to a good writer director and left the acting to somebody who could act this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production there was nobody to tell him sam this is bad really bad br br jamie brett <UNK> acting was the only good point but he could have been so much better with a good director and better actors to work with br br this movie is so bad i think sam <UNK> should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie twice the acting and direction was so bad this movie was turned into a comedy you just had to laugh and in the wrong places br br a second good point this would make a great date movie after the first two minutes you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date
<START> this movie scared heck out of me when i was just a kid it's no citizen kane but it has its moments the arm ripping scene is good the plot is good even if characters aren't could have something to do with the acting put some top name people in the roles and then see what you get this was one of those shoot edit what little there was and <UNK> in a couple of months type of movies this is classic low budget sci fi and deserves it just due i rated it a 9 based other films of this genre and age
<START> for such films like anchors <UNK> few have been <UNK> with as many academy award <UNK> in a warm up for happy hour either 1945 was a <UNK> year for good film or they were still suffering advance shock by billy <UNK> the lost <UNK> that they wrote anything starting with a on the <UNK> for best picture to please the still musical picture faithful public since gene kelly was nominated for this performance instead of his role in <UNK> in the <UNK> then there had to be something wrong with the behind the scenes <UNK> systems at mgm of course the studio is on its best behaviour during this much <UNK> tour of the great studios and of hollywood itself handy for those stuck on the other side of the world br br yet a sailor suit musical with the brilliant talents of gene and frank sinatra is certainly an enjoyable farce despite the need for more people to yawn at the previews for the musical so today's audiences wouldn't be slapped with an unnecessary runtime there have been many longer pieces before and since but in this case all of the charming kathryn <UNK> scenes could have been eliminated until the viewing of kiss me <UNK> it may have been necessary non opera <UNK> to watch any of her films with remote control in hand br br if there was a need to practice picking up women for <UNK> on the <UNK> then perhaps the shore leave lucky sailors did not have to promise an audition with jose iturbi and strike up the piano for a whole hearted <UNK> rendition few are lucky to get a screen test at the golden studios of mgm then few are even <UNK> to be attended to there are no regrets to be had about the successful screen <UNK> of susan <UNK> or kathryn grayson but it makes the <UNK> non opera <UNK> hope for the eventual pink slip to be handed out to both br br but for all the star talents are good shape and an above average score thrown in with a slight but fun great navy story <UNK> with young ambitious navy boys good for late bursts of wartime <UNK> makes <UNK> at least doesn't question picking the wrong mgm film the direction holds up as the cast carries the story in lovely colour cinematography whenever anyone bursts into music or song the film makes for a <UNK> occasion br br the natural highlight of the film is gene kelly's cartoon adventures in a <UNK> <UNK> in a brilliant dance with jerry the mouse this is a well deserved masterpiece number of kelly's career and it's nice to know he thought of it before fred astaire started taking to dancing on walls and <UNK> br br it's not exactly sitting down to a triple <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> chocolate <UNK> cream and <UNK> and banana split <UNK> but it is a square solid <UNK> of sugar that somehow eventually <UNK> in your mouth and despite the guilt is still a pleasant feeling br br rating 7 10
<START> what a terrible movie the acting was bad the pacing was bad the cinematography was bad the directing was bad the special effects were bad you expect a certain degree of badness in a slasher but even the killings were bad br br first of all the past event that set up the motive for the slaughter went on for 15 or 20 minutes i thought it would never end they could have removed 80 of it and explained what happened well enough br br then the victims were invited to the reunion in an abandoned school which still had all the <UNK> turned on one of the victims thought this was a little odd but they <UNK> it and decided to break in anyway br br finally the killings were so fake as to be virtually unwatchable br br there is no reason to watch this movie unless you want to see some breasts and not very good breasts at that this movie makes <UNK> virtually <UNK> from citizen kane
<START> contains spoilers br br timon and pumbaa are watching the lion king timon decides to go back before the beginning to when the story really began so they go back way back back even before <UNK> was born back to <UNK> old home which was miles away from pride rock a clan of <UNK> <UNK> underground to hide from <UNK> the worst <UNK> in the clan was a pompous self centered <UNK> named timon his mother took pity on him but uncle max just <UNK> his head mother suggested putting timon on <UNK> duty timon had dreams of a bigger and better place out there somewhere just then <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and ed arrived and nearly killed poor uncle max that did it the other <UNK> just wanted timon to go away while timon took it upon himself to leave so he <UNK> his mom goodbye and started off he didn't get very far before he started getting <UNK> just then he met <UNK> who taught him to look beyond what he sees timon had no clue what that meant so he continued on and met a <UNK> named pumbaa who was all alone due to a <UNK> problem timon and pumbaa join up then but timon <UNK> them <UNK> rather than friends br br they soon arrive at pride rock where all the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> elephants and many other plain animals had gathered what was going on timon didn't care they pressed on timon then saw <UNK> <UNK> pride rock <UNK> into the air something he couldn't see just then all the animals took a bow was this to honor the birth of the new king no pumbaa had passed gas and the animals were <UNK> to cover their <UNK> timon and pumbaa try an assortment of new homes but each are <UNK> due to <UNK> singing or <UNK> or a large <UNK> of <UNK> pumbaa and timon suddenly find themselves heading down stream when they reach land timon decides to give up but then they <UNK> around at their <UNK> paradise it was beautiful trees and water falls as far as the eye could see timon named the place after a strange phrase he learned from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> timon and pumbaa go out <UNK> for <UNK> one afternoon when they suddenly run into <UNK> they take him under their wing and become father figures they teach him the arts of bug eating and <UNK> <UNK> pretty soon a teenage <UNK> takes on timon in a <UNK> <UNK> contest <UNK> won leaving timon <UNK> ill br br then one day <UNK> childhood friend <UNK> arrived timon and pumbaa just knew she'd break up the friendship suddenly <UNK> runs away <UNK> and pumbaa race after him but not timon he chose to stay at <UNK> <UNK> by himself until <UNK> talked some sense into him so he joins his friends at pride rock <UNK> mother and uncle max arrive then while <UNK> battles <UNK> mother and max dig a large hole to trap <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and ed in it worked <UNK> is soon <UNK> down the same hole where he is <UNK> by the <UNK> then all is well mother uncle max and the rest of the <UNK> go live with timon and pumbaa in the paradise that is <UNK> <UNK> back to the present timon and pumbaa finish the movie when suddenly mother uncle max <UNK> and <UNK> want to watch it again so do mickey mouse donald duck goofy snow white the seven <UNK> <UNK> peter pan the lost boys mad <UNK> march <UNK> genie <UNK> and <UNK> br br well i must say that the lion king 1 1 2 wasn't as good as i had hoped it was too ridiculous and silly the original lion king was a masterpiece it had a serious story with light comedy thrown in this one was just silly and made a mockery of it i swear sometimes timon and pumbaa are just way too <UNK> they're <UNK> to the point of no longer being funny just annoying the original voice cast is back nathan lane as timon ernie <UNK> as pumbaa matthew <UNK> as adult <UNK> whoopi goldberg as <UNK> cheech <UNK> as <UNK> jim <UNK> as ed robert <UNK> as <UNK> new to the cast are julie <UNK> of tv's too long running series the simpsons as <UNK> mom and jerry stiller as uncle max so anyway this movie isn't the lion king iii and it isn't ii because there already is a ii it takes place right after part i and part ii is a ways away hence it's 1 1 2 in conclusion i don't recommend this to die hard lion king fans because it's far too ridiculous and <UNK> however the kids will love it so i recommend it to them i hope this will also be the last lion king movie two is enough the lion king 1 1 2 what we've come to expect from disney sequel makers br br
<START> mario lanza of course is the great caruso in this 1951 film also starring ann <UNK> dorothy kirsten <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> this is a highly <UNK> biography of the legendary world renowned <UNK> whose name is known even today br br the film is <UNK> produced and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by lanza kirsten <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and other opera stars who appeared in the film if you're a <UNK> seeing people on stage smiling during the <UNK> from <UNK> will strike you as odd even if <UNK> wife dorothy just had a baby girl also it's highly unlikely that caruso ever sang <UNK> in <UNK> the role lay too high for him br br in taking dramatic license the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of <UNK> life what was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard <UNK> yet this is never mentioned in the film these roles include <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> and dick johnson in girl of the golden west there is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a <UNK> the reason for that photo his only shirt was in the <UNK> he was one of the <UNK> of recorded music and had a long <UNK> with the victor talking machine company later <UNK> victor he was singing jose in carmen in san francisco the night of the <UNK> br br instead the mgm story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of martha which never happened he had a <UNK> during <UNK> <UNK> at the met and could not finish the performance he only sang three more times at the met his last role as <UNK> in la <UNK> what killed him the same thing that killed <UNK> <UNK> his first role at the met was not <UNK> in <UNK> as <UNK> in the film but the duke in <UNK> so when it says on the screen suggested by dorothy <UNK> biography of her husband that's what it was suggested what is true is that <UNK> father <UNK> her after her marriage and left her 1 of his massive estate they also did have a daughter gloria together who died at the age of <UNK> on 10 7 2007 however caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married dorothy br br some people say that <UNK> voice is remarkably like <UNK> but just listen to caruso sing in the film match point <UNK> voice is remarkably unlike <UNK> in fact from his sound had he wanted to caruso could have sung as a <UNK> he is thought to have had some trouble with high notes further evidence of <UNK> <UNK> and the role he was preparing when he died was othello a dramatic <UNK> role which lanza definitely was not <UNK> voice deserved not to be compared with another he made a unique contribution to film history <UNK> operatic music he sings the music in the great caruso with a <UNK> energy he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career his acting is natural and genuine ann <UNK> is lovely as dorothy and gets to sing a little herself br br really a film for opera lovers and lanza fans which are probably one and the same
<START> this version of <UNK> dick insults the audience by claiming it is based on <UNK> novel even going so far as to show a phony first chapter sentence rather than the famous call me <UNK> in addition to having atrocious acting even from john barrymore this is perhaps the greatest example of how far hollywood especially early hollywood would go to <UNK> and change a famous novel just to <UNK> up its chances at the box office all of the <UNK> beautiful poetic language has been absolutely <UNK> and <UNK> has been changed from a brooding <UNK> obsessive madman to a dashing misunderstood hero who only wants to kill <UNK> dick after his <UNK> turns away from him after seeing his wooden leg to this is added the standard evil brother who wants the <UNK> for himself and a different ending
<START> this film is not even worth walking to the movie theatre no jokes but stupid and boring laughing on repeated disgusting stuff the music and the girls are great unfortunately you have to watch the whole movie to enjoy them it was weak very very weak
<START> val kilmer and dylan mcdermott are terrific i have seen kilmer on the doors however his interpretation of john holmes is superb nothing compared to boogie nights which was kind of slow wonderland is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who is just <UNK> in his drug vice and <UNK> of what ever happens around at the same time the john holmes character shows a very clever hustler who is able to pass through the <UNK> and <UNK> situations almost <UNK> the movie deserves being watched more than once the seventies ambiance sensual and full of drugs is amazing
<START> a lot of other reviewers here including many whose opinions i respect hold this slice of european sleaze horror in high regard personally i didn't like it at all its an incoherent attempt at a atmospheric period cross between sex and violence jess franco at his best makes these kinds of films very well unfortunately the infamous exploitation filmmaker joe <UNK> does not <UNK> most well known films are infamous for their high gross out <UNK> this an early film by him doesn't have the constant disgusting scenes that his more notorious <UNK> and beyond the darkness did ultimately its an incoherent film that doesn't manage to involve the viewer in any way without the sleaze factor either it becomes very boring as i said others have enjoyed this film but i just found it to be a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing br br there are a few <UNK> for the film <UNK> <UNK> from candy is in it and she looks pretty hot and is often naked however cult film icon <UNK> kinski is completely wasted in a subplot with no connection to the main film he seems bored with the role and doesn't have the manic intensity he does at his finest the music score is nice and there are some brief moments of unintentionally funny gore still this is a pretentious and pointless film that manages to be incredibly boring 3 10
<START> i enjoyed this movie granted it is mainly because i enjoy seeing sean connery act and this one has the added bonus of having ed harris and lawrence fishburne in it too the story has a grandma seeking out <UNK> assistance because her <UNK> is in prison and she says he was wrongly convicted at first it seems there may have been some racist aspects of the case however it later turns out the main officer on the case was black himself and it seems he did some rather bad things to <UNK> a confession out of the boy well the boy tries to point to another killer locked up in the same prison one who is about to be put to death he is a particularly nasty person too as he takes a lot of joy in what he did writing the relatives of his victims and trying to get people to mail them a lot of twists and turns in this one with some of it being somewhat unexpected me i just enjoyed sean <UNK> character trying to make sense of the whole ordeal the movie also made me mad in areas especially when you find out what ultimately happened you get very good interplay between connery and harris and connery and fishburne as they all shine rather well in this one in the end this one makes for a rather good suspense thriller
<START> this centers on <UNK> notions of coming to grips with guilt br br <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> boy to stop his <UNK> about <UNK> death old style real men in action here br br the crashing model plane and car crash must have been impressive on the big screen br br the storytelling itself despite the flashback sequences plays it straight all the <UNK> are trusted by us regardless of the <UNK> or <UNK> of the dialogue so there's no game with the viewer about narrative structure this would become a rough <UNK> for future <UNK> such as <UNK> br br so all we're left with is individual performance and at that level it's best for <UNK> <UNK> a virtual one man show
<START> this is one of the best bollywood movies i have seen up until now family and friends feel the same way about it this movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time in my opinion we need more films or movies like this to keep the south asian culture alive shahid kapoor and amrita <UNK> acted extremely well in this also their couple <UNK> a lot of people to the movies this is a must see movie it's a family and romantic movie this movie is also from the makers of hum <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and hum <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this movie is their best right now the setting of the movie was beautiful which also is a huge attraction this movie is must see recommended to everyone
<START> based on the idea from gackt moon child took place in a poverty stricken country called <UNK> in a futuristic <UNK> the story followed the lives of the two main characters <UNK> hyde and sho gackt and their friends growing up together br br despite some actions might be overly done or perhaps humorous i strongly believed that this is a movie about friendship even amongst all the <UNK> between each character in the end each of them wanted to have someone on their side to have friends br br unlike most vampire characters <UNK> portrayed a vampire that <UNK> the idea of having to kill in order to live a vampire found friendship in the hand of a young boy sho who's not afraid of <UNK> regardless of what some <UNK> thought i see <UNK> as a <UNK> figure to sho <UNK> was there throughout the earlier life of sho he took care of him and taught him to live in a world where power between gangs controls their lives on the other hand sho who perhaps can be seen as an innocent enthusiastic style young man he grew up to be a man who realised that life isn't all about fun and games that death exists and able to take away his loved ones br br i love the part where lee <UNK> the actor who played son first appeared on the screen the way they met up was quite cool indeed son also has a big part within this movie the fact that he's from a different race a <UNK> made quite an impact to the friendship theme within the movie the way how friendships were developed despite background differences was portrayed excellently in this movie br br i believed that each actor did a great job considering that this was their first time to appear in such big screen movie both hyde and gackt managed to act quite well and created quite believable characters unlike movies that had musician turned actors and filled the movie with songs they've done great acting jobs moon child really made an impact for me it has given friendships a new meaning and consideration that we have to appreciate every friendship in our <UNK> the movie shows a lot of hope despite all the bad things that happen in their lives that there's always hope life can be cruel that it seems hope doesn't exist anymore it also shows a very strong sense of friendships between each other even when son became the enemy sho did have some sort of fun at their last battle every single one of them desired peace in the end no matter how far apart they've become the ending scene showed it to us
<START> there is a lot of talk of torture these days that's all this movie is it's about a good person who makes a bad decision because of his kindness he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women from then on its a just for kicks assault on him i don't know at what point you do something about it there is a wife and child out there somewhere he has great feelings of guilt and fear but there should have been some times when he could have acted the movie seems to be <UNK> joke i suppose in the wake of the <UNK> murders we had a bit of a <UNK> on the likes of these two nevertheless why would someone make a film like this what appeals does it have except for <UNK> the conclusion is totally unsatisfying but that could have been <UNK> with an obvious plot twist oh well another hour and a half of my life
<START> i read reviews on this movie and decided to give it a shot i'm an open minded guy after all and <UNK> given good reviews to some pretty bad flicks as the end credits rolled on this one i searched for meaning and something nice to say here goes this film was mercifully short that's all i got br br okay okay the sets and visuals were well done and the music helped lend to the mood of asylum life but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue took away from the good bits i did find myself laughing at this film but the way you laugh at your best friend who just embarrassed himself in front of a large crowd br br by the time of the chicken dance at the finale i had just decided to <UNK> and roll with the film and let the bodies fall where they fall i don't know what could have <UNK> this film the acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget but there just wasn't any way to make it watchable not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts maybe i should have <UNK> a <UNK> or <UNK> a lot of beer to get the full experience of the film either way i'm not watching this film again unless i'm really depressed then i can tell myself <UNK> least i <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> torture <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> better than those guys
<START> jimmy cagney races by your eyes constantly in this story of a stage producer who is <UNK> struggling against the upcoming talking movies br br this story of love <UNK> women and dancing is presented in such a manner that as a viewer you are never treated to a dull moment the direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was enormously well done the story never really got lost in this frantic pace br br some parts of the material presented here have become a little dated but that doesn't matter because when you look at this in a 1933 time frame it is fabulous to watch this next to a lot of the other drags of movies that were released during that time br br jimmy cagney is a sight for sore eyes in this film never <UNK> his <UNK> as the ever working producer of previews made for the movie theaters as <UNK> in this way he tries to save his ass from going out of business he was a broadway producer before he started this joan blondell is fabulous as the neglected love interest <UNK> she gives such a spirited performance that is so unusual for movies of that time so cool to watch a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for a change br br the only problem i had with the film were the enormous productions at the end these were magnificent in itself beautifully choreographed and wonderfully produced but they just didn't seem to fit in the story the only link they have to the main story is that cagney had to put on 3 previews in 3 days to get a contract and that's what he did i had a hard time believing that this was what the girls had been <UNK> during the entire movie and that these sets could fit in a movie theater in this way the sitting on a backyard fence was much more appropriate to the story br br the productions at the end seemed to drag this <UNK> paced story to a halt and that was not a good thing i was tired after seeing the first musical sequence and then i realized there were another two coming up these sequences got a lot a chuckles from the audience as well br br all in all a great film with a sour ending br br 9 10
<START> excellent film the whole picture was filmed in <UNK> so i feel proud my little problem was that the trains in the film <UNK> to the hungarian state <UNK> <UNK> and it is plain to see that they were used in big train not in the local <UNK> according to the story <UNK> picked up his victims in local <UNK> stations apart from this the film is superb
<START> good funny straightforward story excellent nicole kidman i almost always like the movies she's in this was a good vehicle for someone <UNK> at comedy and drama since there are elements of both a romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories great closing lines chaplin very good here was also good in another good but <UNK> romantic comedy truth about cats dogs maybe they're too implausible ebert didn't even post a review for this the great screwball comedies obviously were totally implausible bringing up baby etc if you've seen one implausible comedy you've seen them all or maybe people are ready to move on from the 1930s weird birthday girl is a movie i've enjoyed several times nicole kidman may be the killer <UNK> for home video
<START> this is so to say a sequel to batman the animated and it is pretty much as good as it to and for all the same reasons it has lots of action in it the storyline to it is good the voice over actors are really good such as kevin <UNK> as batman mark <UNK> as the joker etc the villains are really good such as the joker two face <UNK> <UNK> etc so i am sure you will not be disappointed with the new adventures of batman because it is really good so make sure that you watch it on tv or rent or buy the <UNK> edition because it is really good br br overall score out of br br out of
<START> when childhood memory tells you this was a scary movie it's touch and go whether you should <UNK> it anyway i remembered a scary scene involving a homeless person and a cool villain played by jeff <UNK> br br the first power is not a very good movie sad to say it's chock full of those cop clichés and a very poor script with holes a truck could drive through along with countless convenient twists that help the story run along lou diamond phillips is the over confident bad ass cop who sends baddie serial killer <UNK> to the gas chamber only to find out he was a <UNK> of satan himself and now has the power of <UNK> along with the power of <UNK> every weak minded person who he comes across through in the mix a very poorly realized psychic who helps with the case br br <UNK> this is trash but enjoyable as such especially if you have fond memories of it it scared me as a kid and that scene with the homeless person is still pretty good as for any kind of logic here forget it just about every scenario is thrown in for good measure and you end up with a cross between a steven segal action flick and a 70's demonic flick and who on earth thought it was a good idea to cast lou diamond phillips in the lead here needless to say he's not convincing at all but he tries his best and i've never had the problem with the guy so many reviewers here seem to have as for tracy griffith as the psychic the less said the better but <UNK> is pretty good as the killer always liked that actor br br the first power may be just what the doctor ordered after a hard day's work and a brain switch off is needed beer will most likely enhance the viewing experience and i'll definitely have loads of it the next time i give this movie a spin all in all not a good flick but a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily scared as kids see you around buddy boy
<START> director jonathan <UNK> has made some underrated comedies in the past like <UNK> and <UNK> this isn't one of them more akin to a <UNK> <UNK> film than its inspiration it stars steve martin in the old phil <UNK> role as an army sergeant forever pulling <UNK> under the nose of his superiors but the <UNK> life of <UNK> and his lazy platoon looks shaky when an old enemy visits the base determined to catch <UNK> in the act nothing much happens really it's all quite dull it's not very funny martin dan <UNK> and phil <UNK> squeeze a couple of laughs out through sheer effort but they're all better than this and it's quite painful watching them work with such thin material
<START> i did not expect much from this film but boy o boy i did not expect the movie to be this bad chris rock is not showing a good act here you can't get the feeling that his <UNK> is real i think the movie would have been a bit better if it's drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and more better humor was involved the movie is like the film makers were having a bad <UNK> making it in the making of they don't show a single smile this is a very bad film i gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me but i did never laugh
<START> god i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot i had been expecting a lot from it as i'm a huge fan of james cameron and not just since titanic i might add and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality then again he also wrote the <UNK> strange days but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration in all that time it barely went beyond its two line synopsis and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of <UNK> that went nowhere on top of that i don't think the <UNK> <UNK> even those of any regular a team episode as for alba yes she is gorgeous of course but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie <UNK> and <UNK> makes me also get bored of her gal wit an attitude <UNK> pretty soon you can count me out of this one mr cameron

<START> was flipping around the tv and hbo was showing a double <UNK> of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions so i turned to my twin sister and said hey this looks like fun truly i love documentaries so we started watching it at first i thought <UNK> kennedy was a young man but then it was explained that due to his condition he never went through <UNK> thus the high voice and smaller body he was on a <UNK> to raise money for his cause he had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of <UNK> i cried watched some more laughed got up to get another <UNK> then cried some more once <UNK> <UNK> time was up he flew to heaven to be with the angels he was more than ready he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free i highly recommend this if you do not fall in love with this guy you have no heart
<START> <UNK> has it that around the time that <UNK>  the multi award winning swedish disco favourites <UNK> star had reached its <UNK> the band grew <UNK> with singing in english and <UNK> to

its most celebrated artists although they have never admitted that there's any truth in those <UNK> the fact remains that <UNK> would never have been so successful had they only recorded in their native tongue if you want to appeal to the largest money making media market in the entire world then you must <UNK> for english speaking audiences br br it's amazing for me how such a small island that's located a stone throw away from the european continent could have created perhaps the most <UNK> although not most widely spoken language in the world everyone speaks a little bit of english whether it be simply <UNK> or a common swear word you'll find an english <UNK> almost everywhere <UNK> <UNK> obviously didn't agree because <UNK> <UNK> was never subtitled for global <UNK> until it was released recently on budget dvd that's a real shame because it's actually a decent slasher movie that's a lot better than many of its english speaking genre <UNK> br br the film <UNK> in the somewhat unfamiliar territory of a pistol duel two <UNK> characters are shown <UNK> around a <UNK> complex searching out one another for the inevitable final showdown after some suspense and a couple of near misses one of the <UNK> emerges <UNK> next we learn that they were only <UNK> guns and the two <UNK> are actually youngsters from the local town <UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> rivals and <UNK> is always trying to prove himself to be better than his soft spoken <UNK> but as of yet he hasn't succeeded br br later that night whilst the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his triumph with his girlfriend <UNK> and

morally superior partner br br they plan to head out to the remote region of <UNK> de <UNK> because recent press coverage has reported that numerous people have been butchered by what locals believe

visiting the <UNK> to stock up on weapons and ignoring the <UNK> of the elderly store keeper the group set out to the <UNK> of the secluded <UNK> hunters become hunted as they learn that the <UNK> is actually a homicidal vietnam vet who is still unaware that the war has ended and considers all humans as his enemy what started as a <UNK> adventure suddenly becomes a battle for survival as they are stalked and slaughtered by the <UNK> assassin br br i picked up <UNK> whilst studying in <UNK> from a mexican student who lived in the <UNK> room next door to me i remember that the copy i watched was <UNK> and the tape ended about 10 minutes before the final credits rolled which meant i never got to see the final scenes thankfully i came across the budget dvd recently on amazon and immediately added it to my collection br br <UNK> slasher is a surprisingly good effort that excels from its <UNK> direction and enthusiastic plot which attempts to cover areas not usually approached by slasher movies it is in fact so good that it reminded me on more than one occasion of the arnold <UNK> classic predator this is especially evident in the scenes that show the <UNK> masked assassin <UNK> through the forest and stalking the panic stricken <UNK> as they struggle to escape the <UNK> <UNK> br br despite <UNK> obvious awareness of genre <UNK> the <UNK> even uses a claw <UNK> <UNK> a la freddy <UNK> <UNK> also attempts to add something different to the standard <UNK> whilst the majority of the runtime plays by the <UNK> rules of the category the final third <UNK> a significant step in <UNK> as the maniac arms himself with a machine gun and <UNK> the hero to his <UNK> for the final showdown from here on the film rapidly <UNK> genres and becomes almost an action film which depending on your taste will either <UNK> or disappoint you the last slasher that tried to <UNK> the two styles was that shoddy eighties entry 'the <UNK> which is not necessarily a good thing br br as is the case with many latin films especially spanish flicks by <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> has a subtle <UNK> of a moral to its story which is conveyed successfully without being <UNK> down the viewer's throat over <UNK> in the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and you may not always be the winner it's a sugar <UNK> point but it's handled <UNK> enough not to detract from the fun of the feature br br <UNK> may be cheesy but it deserves to be seen and <UNK> as one of the better late slashers the killer looks great in creepy army <UNK> and white valentine style mask and the attempts at originality just about work it may lack the gore that most sincere horror fans enjoy but it has enough in terms of suspense and creativity to warrant at least one viewing
<START> why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st century with great acting directing effects music and generally everything this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didn't like it any more so most of the world decided to agree there is nothing wrong with this movie all i can say is that this movie not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies i've ever seen apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james <UNK> masterpiece titanic
<START> if you have not seen this excellent movie about life in the 90s in l a then you've missed a special treat this is one of the most amazingly and most powerful movies ever made about life for americans in the 90s and it even carries over into today's world in which we live in it covers everything from raising a child prejudice more than one way love adultery empty nest syndrome <UNK> etc and the list goes on this story builds up to an ultimate climax and then when nothing else matters it always goes back to love with friends and family and love of life it helps us dig deep within ourselves and to make us search for what we want out of life makes us ask questions of ourselves have we done enough for others are we like this etc sit back and enjoy a wonderfully done and emotional movie that i'm sure others will enjoy for a lifetime br br take note of mary <UNK> kevin kline and danny <UNK> wonderful performance through this whole film these actors are amazing and really show the true glow and meaning of what message is being sent to all of us these are 3 of my favorite actors for life after seeing this film over 10 years ago now i still enjoy it again and again also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with it and don't forget to count how many times you see the helicopter fly by and try to figure out it's symbolism for the movie hmmm i almost forgot this is probably steve <UNK> very first serious acting role in any film he has ever done he too does an excellent job in this movie this may come as a surprise to most of you sit back relax and enjoy truly good film making
<START> have previously enjoyed wesley snipes in several action flicks and i had expected a lot more even from a score of 5 8 imdb the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to <UNK> a worst case scenario of playing strong feelings accompanied by some bad acting don't <UNK> your time this movie <UNK> entertaining if you wanna cry it might suffice though even though your tears will be <UNK> due to seeing wesley snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy br br i give this 2 10 it really was awful if you wanna see a decent movie go see <UNK> or rent it its all the good things this movie isn't
<START> the young victoria is a beautiful film and has presented queen victoria in a different light to what everyone thinks about her the films <UNK> away the i am not amused impression of queen victoria and shows she was a cheerful young woman br br as i love history particularly victorian history you can imagine my reaction when i first saw this film advertised i was so so so excited and counted down the days until it came to the cinemas i was a little worried that it wouldn't be historically accurate but it was and i loved it i found out new facts about queen victoria that didn't know before and it interested me greatly br br queen victoria in many lights was one of our all time greatest <UNK> and this film paints a picture of her real personality and what her life was like she was treated so badly by her mothers <UNK> sir john <UNK> because he wanted britain to have a <UNK> this was what inspired victoria to be a fantastic queen which she was the romance between her and albert was so deep and this was very well done by emily blunt and rupert friend who were both brilliant the young victoria is a heart felt love story but at the same time a great look into a major part of british history i love it 10 10 no doubt
<START> this movie is a good example of how to ruin a book in <UNK> minutes except for the names of the characters the movie bears very little resemblance to the book a book full of strong latino characters and they are represent for the most part by non <UNK> there is no character development in the movie and we have no reason to love or hate the characters and to <UNK> a complete generation is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has written a powerful book and the book is what should be read
<START> this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen jessica simpson not only lacks any acting skill but the script is incredibly shallow and lame you actually hear serious dialogue that goes i love you more no i love you more i stopped watching the movie online after the first half hour i couldn't take it anymore her southern girl charm just doesn't work and is really quite annoying her attempts at slapstick humor fall flat and she delivers lines like she is reading the script right off the page br br poor luke wilson did he not read the script before <UNK> to do this or did he fall for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dad and also the producer of the movie promise of big <UNK> hopefully he now knows better than to sign on to another movie like this luke wilson is actually a good actor i hate seeing the <UNK> look on his face as he suffers through the bad dialogue br br also i think the previous <UNK> giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie somehow or hired by <UNK> joe to give the movie a better rating no one in their right mind would actually find this movie engaging br br jessica has lots of money right maybe buy some acting lessons
<START> kim basinger stars as della a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband who gets into trouble while she's out at the local mall doing some last minute christmas shopping after placing a <UNK> <UNK> hateful note on a piece of paper and sticking said paper in the <UNK> of a car that took up two parking spaces she finds out the owners of the car are the <UNK> <UNK> of villains <UNK> of a white guy a mexican a chinese guy a black they confront her about the note cap a helpless security guard and the chase is on during the course of the film della will go for hunted to hunter as she <UNK> her inner bronson br br i found this to be a somewhat tense little thriller the acting was good enough except for a few scenes the why god why bit was cringe worthy in it's badness though it comes <UNK> a bit due to the sheer fact that the villains della chases from after are mind numbingly stupid if they hadn't had the intellect of any given home alone baddie perhaps their eventual defeat would be something to <UNK> instead of the <UNK> reaction it evokes the <UNK> factor i'm willing to overlook as both the director one of the producers had part in bringing shoot em up to the screen a film which while throwing credibility out the window was immensely fun this film while never <UNK> the heights of that film was good in it's own rights br br my grade c br br anchor bay dvd extras commentary with writer director susan <UNK> and producer don murphy a 25 and a half minute <UNK> <UNK> a trailer two tv spots for this film and trailer for lower learning
<START> both my friend and i thought this movie was well done we expected a light hearted comedy but got a full blown action movie with comic <UNK> we both thought that this movie may have not done so well at the box office as the previews lead us to believe it was a comedy i was impressed with the supporting actors and of course dave morse always puts in a terrific acting job most of the supporting cast are veterans not first <UNK> and they were solid we both felt that the writing and direction were first rate and made comments to each other about buying this movie if you don't buy rent it for a good time
<START> was this a comedy or was it a drama i begin this review by asking this question because the film that i just witnessed hollywood <UNK> was neither funny or rather dramatic while it tried so hard to make a point because of this lack of definition comedy or drama the clever themes and pointed remarks were lost while i am a strong believer that there is too much racial <UNK> happening in hollywood even today i do not believe that <UNK> directorial debut did much to stop it instead i feel it only added more fuel to the fire <UNK> comic timing in this film was disastrous due to the fact that the elements he was supposed to be making fun of he was instead promoting and vice versa the parts that were supposed to be serious were somehow destroyed by the poor lack of funny comedy <UNK> had a decent concept with this film but sadly the execution is what ultimately hurt this film if you watch the preview before the film which i constantly do you will immediately get the wrong impression of what you are going to see the preview gives the impression of a very intelligent comic film that <UNK> itself on the intelligence of the viewers but the actually film could not be further from the truth br br the main problem with hollywood <UNK> is not story itself because it is lacking in <UNK> it is <UNK> direction he had a wonderful concept with this film exploit the hollywood that exploits our race decent idea but why couldn't he <UNK> it very well the first reason is that his ideas are too random and <UNK> the structure of this film was like watching a heart attack on a <UNK> at the hospital we are literally everywhere without any warning or map it was obvious that <UNK> had quite a bit to say but only a short amount of time to do it in so instead of defining his characters developing his themes and actually creating a smart film he just throws it all together and <UNK> that it works sadly it doesn't instead of a smart comedy we have a <UNK> of so many ideas comedic skits and underused actors that this film goes from decent to nearly unwatchable what hurts <UNK> the most are his brief attempt to be funny <UNK> throughout the film from battling a villain known as jerry <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> ebert <UNK> attempt to poke fun while speak a message about the film industry <UNK> this is because these small <UNK> skits actually distract from the central focus of the film and actually destroy <UNK> while <UNK> seems to be trying to make a joke about life in hollywood he actually is simply connecting to every stereotype and cliché in the book what could have been beautiful satire transforms into simply generic humor that never quite stands apart from the rest br br so if you find yourself not laughing at the humor of this story perhaps there is some comfort in knowing that some of the wayans brothers are around to help spice up this dull story wrong the wayans are in this film but <UNK> demonstrates that he has the ability to even bring the worst out even in this entertaining family definitely in their pre in living color moments we see that comedy was something that all needed to constantly improve upon perhaps it was <UNK> direction or just maybe this atrocious story but these typically funny comedians were obviously underused and ignored when it came to critics of this film i just thought that with the talent pool that <UNK> had to pull from that hollywood <UNK> would have been funny bright and a true stab at this obvious hollywood dilemma sadly it was none of the above br br finally i would like to say that this was a <UNK> film there were some moments while they were few and way far between that had a smile on my face the final product just didn't settle well with me <UNK> can be funny but in this film it just felt like he was playing against himself instead of through his personal experiences and troubles i realize that he was probably speaking the truth but it never came through as that instead we are <UNK> through a weak story which supports itself with idiotic flash clips that may have worked for a sitcom but surely didn't work for this film even for those that comment that this was his directorial debut and that he was learning from this film i would have to disagree if you are starting fresh either have a tight script or defined themes <UNK> had neither of these and combined with the inability to control his actors he just failed in a ball of flames br br overall this was rather disappointing to watch it reminded me of a grade school spelling <UNK> where it is finally your child's time to spell the word is tough but as the first two to three letters come out you think that it is going to work perfectly but then there is that random p and silent r that forces your excitement to come <UNK> down that is how i felt with hollywood <UNK> at first i saw the potential i saw the theme and the motive behind the picture but through fuzzy and inexperienced technique and after the first couple of scenes i experienced that deep fall feeling <UNK> <UNK> his own ship on this one and i don't think hollywood <UNK> will ever re <UNK> as a pivotal moment of hollywood cinema br br grade out of
<START> this 1953 sam fuller movie contains some of his best work and its sad that he couldn't continue to get the backing of major hollywood studios to do his stuff the story line goes something like this a tough hard broad read prostitute is riding the subway one hot summer day and gets her <UNK> picked by skip mccoy what skip and the dame don't realize is that she is also carrying some <UNK> to be passed to <UNK> spies this opening shot without dialogue and mostly in tight close ups is a <UNK> one of the many that fuller uses throughout the movie playing the babe known as candy is jean peters who was never better nor better looking one forgets how beautiful she was and she handles this role very well the <UNK> is played by richard widmark who had already made his mark and set his style with <UNK> kiss of death as the crazy creep with the creepy laugh and although he's a little <UNK> here he's still scary these hard edged characters do have soft spots here and there but its noir and nasty all the way the standout performance belongs to the wonderful thelma ritter who plays moe the <UNK> saving up her <UNK> to pay for her own funeral ritter received a well deserved oscar nomination for her performance but lost out to the boring but popular performance of donna reed as the b girl read prostitute in from here to eternity hollywood loves it when a good girl goes bad and loves to oscar them even though their performance is usually awful see for instance shirley jones in elmer <UNK> set among the <UNK> and <UNK> of new york city with crisp black and white photography by the great joe macdonald and some very good art direction especially good is the set representing the new york city <UNK> and <UNK> shack near the river made at the height of the cold war and red scare the <UNK> of the piece is the ordinary looking <UNK> played by richard <UNK> who is much more dangerous than the <UNK> who is a criminal but is just trying to make a living and above all is a loyal american
<START> an uninteresting addition to the stalk <UNK> slash cycle which dominated the horror genre in the 1980's this was filmed as pranks but released as the <UNK> that <UNK> blood which is an obvious steal from the 1970 horror anthology the house that <UNK> blood daphne <UNK> is the only <UNK> face in the cast and this was her first horror movie she has also appeared in the <UNK> and the fly ii
<START> i had no expectations i'd never heard of jamie foxx all i knew was that the film has some strong character actors in it i thought it was highly entertaining it was fun the plot was different and unpredictable enough to hold my interest to me foxx is an original david morse is terrific true this is not his finest role i thought the chases and <UNK> contributed to the film and were well done i didn't expect a lot and i was happily surprised
<START> <UNK> i sincerely wonder why all the acclaimed and supposedly profound movie critics hold such a grudge against director michael winner surely he isn't the <UNK> of subtlety as his films are practically always hard handed and confronting but so what they're <UNK> entertaining his most famous action movies like the first three entries in the death wish series for example are easy targets to <UNK> down because they allegedly <UNK> violence and the personal use of <UNK> but even when winner takes on far more mature cinema genres  like the religious horrors of the sentinel for example  he doesn't stand a chance with any of the critics the sentinel generated some controversy and <UNK> several people upon its release when it <UNK> that michael winner cast genuinely <UNK> and handicapped people to portray the creatures attempting to cross the <UNK> between hell and earth pretty much the exact same controversy caused <UNK> <UNK> masterpiece and landmark in horror cinema freaks to remain banned and unseen for over thirty years and why just because certain <UNK> and easily offended people who shouldn't watch the movie in the first place claim it's an <UNK> thing to do i don't suppose michael winner or todd <UNK> held these people at <UNK> or forced them to appear in their films so what gives us the right to feel embarrassed in their place another major reason why critics didn't <UNK> welcome the sentinel is because jeffrey <UNK> novel  and thus michael <UNK> screenplay  is hugely derivative of other contemporary but far more successful <UNK> themed horror stories and thus according to the <UNK> <UNK> of horror critics little more than pure <UNK> admittedly the sentinel borrows multiple substantial elements from rosemary's baby the omen and the exorcist but let's face it 70's cinema largely <UNK> on stolen <UNK> and imitating success stories if you overlook the slightly unoriginal concept and in all fairness a handful of thoroughly confusing and unnecessary sub plots the sentinel honestly still remains a uniquely atmospheric and often downright <UNK> 70's horror highlight with an impressive ensemble cast and nightmarish imagery you're not likely to forget easy br br alison parker a ravishing model with some <UNK> mental <UNK> moves into a stunning <UNK> apartment in brooklyn deeply against the will of her boyfriend michael who <UNK> to <UNK> her several times already <UNK> physical existence and especially her mental condition drastically alter shortly after and the ominous apartment appears to be the root of all misery she meets eccentric neighbors and <UNK> birthday parties for their cats even though the <UNK> claims she and a blind priest are the only <UNK> she frequently <UNK> during her work <UNK> and has truly creepy visions of her bastard father and the night she attempted to commit suicide it slowly becomes clear that alison got chosen to serve a higher supernatural purpose inside this apartment building but simultaneously <UNK> forces try and prevent this it's truly <UNK> how the <UNK> <UNK> and even brief synopsis on the back of the dvd immediately reveal that <UNK> <UNK> apartment is the <UNK> <UNK> to hell itself and she's the chosen one to guard it because the film's script only slowly builds up towards this shocking revelation for nearly 75 minutes and throughout some sadly tedious and overlong sequences michael winner successfully maintains the impression that <UNK> own mind is playing tricks with her and that the involvement of the catholic church and her <UNK> odd behavior are strictly red herrings multiple of the horrific scenes come pretty close to being genius like <UNK> flashback or her first <UNK> with the priest upstairs the whole climax with the controversial guest appearances mentioned here above is a literally <UNK> showcase of pure terror and easily one of the most unforgettable and nail biting <UNK> i ever witnessed br br the cast michael winner managed to gather is deeply impressive especially considering the sentinel still remains a legitimate horror movie and this genre isn't the most popular among prominent actors but of course you also have to put the cast listing a little into perspective with such an extended cast obviously several of the roles in the film are little more than cameos martin <UNK> and john carradine for example only appear on screen for a couple of minutes all together several others like christopher walken jeff goldblum beverly <UNK> and tom berenger perhaps add a lot of fame to the movie nowadays but back when it was released they were still too unknown in order to attract curious viewers my personal pick for best performances go to burgess meredith as the uncanny neighbor and eli <UNK> as the satirical police inspector the relatively unknown <UNK> raines does an admirable job carrying the film and chris sarandon neatly back her up even though he sports a ridiculous mustache in my humble opinion the sentinel is a <UNK> entertaining and frightening horror movie and most definitely a must see for true genre fanatics
<START> plot synopsis when his wife a news reporter is kidnapped replaced with an <UNK> double secret service agent eric phillips tracks her down <UNK> a plan by an arms dealer to create an army of <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> world leaders br br i wasn't expecting much when i first saw this sequel to richard <UNK> low budget sci fi action hybrid <UNK> <UNK> that film was nothing special not to mention a blatant rip off of both the terminator <UNK> this sequel is the same as before with an all out action sequence opening the film there are plenty of explosions heavy <UNK> a huge <UNK> as well as some martial arts moves courtesy of the film's star don the dragon wilson the whole film seems like a series of action scenes strung together with minimal plot on the acting front wilson is a bad actor he really needs a personality transplant
<START> good folks i stumbled on this film on evening while i was <UNK> papers my academic <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> literature and i can say that no one has ever done the genre the honor it deserves the <UNK> beowulf and grendel is the least offensive i have seen and i did pay 3 00 for my copy this sci fi version ranks with the christopher <UNK> version <UNK> br br what didn't i like cgi for one amazingly bad more importantly is the <UNK> to the storyline not to mention the stilted acting i am used to both with all the versions i have seen br br delighted regardless peter
<START> i don't want to spend to long here rambling about the plot you've seen the trailer and if you haven't its online i don't recommend seeing it though it was poorly crafted and didn't pack any of the laughs or magic from the film so those avoiding this film due to its lousy trailer should give this one a chance it's really funny i was blown away by the <UNK> and originality in this film the first 40 minutes had me on the floor in <UNK> my only problem was that it unnecessarily evolved into a bad austin powers film in the final 20 this however is one of the few films where the campy ending didn't make me dislike the rest of the film which is normally the case everyone gives a great performance especially joan cusack and there are some really great moments throughout i personally plan on seeing it again when it comes out only to catch all the details which i was laughing over during the first viewing
<START> how this has not become a cult film i do not know i think it has been sadly overlooked as a truly ingenious comedy br br runaway car attempts to pass itself off as a fast paced thriller but taking the quality of acting good god it's bad the storyline the <UNK> of the <UNK> demonic possession and the baby <UNK> scene into account there is nothing you can really do but laugh and laugh you will films are made to entertain us and the degree to which they do this can be an indication of a film's worth this film is the <UNK> in entertainment i laughed from beginning to end at one point i got short of breath and nearly <UNK> it really is that funny at some points when the baby was <UNK> out of the <UNK> in a <UNK> by a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant <UNK> identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plain that meant the <UNK> hook didn't rip the car roof to pieces i was laughing hysterically but when the baby starting swinging around in the air nearly hit a bridge and almost got <UNK> up in a tree tears were running down my face br br it also occurred to me that the black cop was the guy who played jesus in <UNK> like a <UNK> video he seems to get everywhere
<START> how could i possibly pass up the chance to see orlando bloom and heath ledger together well i couldn't and so i rented this mess of a movie br br i had never heard of ned kelly and was surprised by what i found out about this young man's legend i was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was perhaps the fact that it was very very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow i found this story difficult to follow not because the story is complicated but because it is slow even with a slow story ledger and bloom managed to create interesting dimensional characters br br though i <UNK> to recommend this as a must see it is a great story of australian history considering how young the country is this is very rare and should be appreciated and the film does have some good actions sequences br br 6 10 see it for historical value yeah right and that's the only reason to see it
<START> one of the great things about many of the superb chinese movies you can find if you are lucky in the video stores is they are very accurate <UNK> of actual true stories farewell my <UNK> the emperor and the assassin and this movie are perfect examples the film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without <UNK> the facts for dramatic or commercial <UNK> the hallmark of much hollywood and especially disney films br br in this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the king of masks for his <UNK> of <UNK> change art along an having lost his only son many years earlier he <UNK> to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that <UNK> females to have such work master wang is sold a son by a slave <UNK> all is well as he <UNK> <UNK> to pass down his art but the son eventually is found out to be a girl from there the story get very interesting with a good performance by master <UNK> of the <UNK> opera a <UNK> operatic style related to <UNK> opera fans of farewell my <UNK> should look carefully at master <UNK> portrayal of a male playing the female role in chinese opera it may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not <UNK> or <UNK> but people who have be so psychologically <UNK> as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality
<START> <UNK> directed witless comedy that supposedly spoofs the classic 50s alien invasion films but really is no better than them except of course in the purely technical department good makeup effects and any spoof that is worse than its target is doomed to fail casino <UNK> our man <UNK> are worse than almost any james bond movie after two hours of hearing the <UNK> voices of the aliens you'll be begging for some peace and quiet 1 2
<START> i loved the batman tv series and was really looking forward to this but they tried to do too much br br why they had the story of adam west and burt ward trying to recover the <UNK> was beyond me i don't want to knock burt or adam for the way they look now it's been 35 years since they appeared at batman and robin but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting <UNK> was kinda sad i would rather of just seen the ex stars do commentary the <UNK> side story was stupid br br as for the flashback movie i think it was too short and left out way too much it was really just a quick <UNK> in my opinion i'd like more background they showed the penguin and joker for about a minute each just to tell the same stuff i already knew the joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an ex <UNK> that was it on those 2 br br i'd love to read the book i am sure it has more in it that this showed like why was there 2 <UNK> or why 3 <UNK> or 3 mister <UNK> where was <UNK> gordon <UNK> <UNK> alfred mister freeze king <UNK> etc the list goes on like i said even the ones that were in this one were barely in it br br very disappointing and really corny
<START> bad bad bad those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema and its 1 movie in america what is this country thinking mike myers looking more like micheal jackson some <UNK> lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes a lame plot with dirty jokes it's <UNK> and awful when green eggs and ham comes out in 2005 i'll be so happy not eddie murphy and tracy morgan will probably play two <UNK> trying to find the lost green eggs and ham they'll try to chase sam i am and that mean guy who are running away with it i hope they don't ruin the classic book don't waste time and money by seeing this
<START> having set the sitcom world <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> arthur <UNK> and graham <UNK> next creation was a forgotten gem for the bbc called <UNK> although created by the pair the six scripts were written by arthur <UNK> alone br br set in london in 1969 ray <UNK> a <UNK> is the editor of an <UNK> magazine his friends are his flat mate the very laid back and <UNK> smoking alex his <UNK> is feminist jill and the none too bright hugo br br simon pegg was superb as ray but he is superb in everything he is in this sitcom had a feel of <UNK> <UNK> about it ray was very much like <UNK> smith trying to beat society but failing miserably at last this sitcom is going to be released on dvd in march i can't wait to buy it as it was on in 1999 and has yet been repeated on <UNK> television my memories aren't too good of the sitcom yet i remember two episodes really clearly the first being the opener <UNK> <UNK> which i thought was a great start where ray goes on a protest against <UNK> and the other episode was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which i think was episode 4 again quite a clear memory about the police sadly the sitcom got a negative reaction from viewers i can't think why the bbc <UNK> another series but arthur <UNK> decided against it because of the negative reaction oh well i can't wait for the dvd br br best episode <UNK> <UNK> hippies series 1 episode 4
<START> <UNK> and again i say <UNK> the original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through <UNK> the original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it and it had a naked chick on a motorcycle br br this version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of <UNK> it looks as if a group of individuals <UNK> decided to fit it to the nineties and changed <UNK> and <UNK> just to be cute the movie is not about a <UNK> about to commit suicide in a last act of <UNK> it is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife br br there was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry
<START> clara <UNK> beauty and wonderful appeal are the chief reason to watch this film <UNK> is not quite up to par with <UNK> best films but it is still enjoyable she dances she rides her horse and <UNK> the man that she loves this film is just over an hour in length and was directed by future oscar winner victor <UNK> gone with the wind the film moves quickly and clara bow has lots of screen time if you like clara i would <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i frequently comment on the utter <UNK> of truly scary movies on the market and sadly white noise only served to <UNK> my faith that the film industry remains capable of such an <UNK> i was surprised to find myself <UNK> increasingly <UNK> as the plot wore on and my static induced headache <UNK> i found white noise to be preposterous beyond our best efforts of suspension of disbelief even after witnessing the harrowing ordeal <UNK> by michael keaton i was totally <UNK> by his demise up until the credits i <UNK> <UNK> for something anything of substance to connect me to the characters' story but such relief never came sure there were the occasional heart <UNK> moments but only because loud noises tend to do that to the <UNK> viewer br br while the acting was lame michael keaton may have played his <UNK> role to date perhaps the only redeeming quality that white noise has to offer is the stunning <UNK> in both of keaton's <UNK> overall white noise leaves one with the <UNK> depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world <UNK> by three <UNK> shadows <UNK> to trick the living into following the dead to their own graves
<START> but i want to say i cannot agree more with <UNK> br br what a wonderful film br br i was thinking about it just this morning wanting to give advice to some dopey <UNK> who'd lost money on his <UNK> card through fraud and wanted to say <UNK> <UNK> money in <UNK> <UNK> and realised i was talking like james mason br br even tho he didn't say those words i still think he would i've never forgotten <UNK> <UNK> carrying ' in his <UNK> with his son <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> have money in <UNK> pocket ' good advice br br not enough kids have fathers with such <UNK> but well meant attitudes any more or any father at all br br it would be a good thing for us to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in our language to show we care it is only the same as <UNK> in french or <UNK> in german br br <UNK> i just realised that a lot of my remarks were about james mason in the family way br br i think it's because i mixed up susan george with <UNK> mills well easy mistake br br i stand by the comments <UNK> br br and spring and <UNK> wine is so very similar to the family way br br when you took a girlfriend to the pictures in those days you really had something to say and talk about afterwards something that affected your knowledge of the world and your personal development br br theatrical experiences are almost real and they are important in helping young people to grow up br br it doesn't happen now i think that teenagers can just go to the <UNK> like we did
<START> i first saw this film over 25 years ago on british tv and have only just caught up with it again last week on a dvd copy bought off ebay i had remembered the musical sequences the colour and the gorgeous fashion plate poses and clothes but the plot is weaker than the earlier anna <UNK> michael <UNK> film spring in park lane and <UNK> doesn't stand up so well to the passage of the years but michael <UNK> is a joy in the film charming funny <UNK> appears to be having great fun and on top of his form worth watching for him alone anna <UNK> appears a little <UNK> beside him and a little too old for the part she plays but by the end of the 1940's their film <UNK> was well established with the cinema going public spring in park lane had been a top hit for <UNK> and a big money maker in his autobiography <UNK> wrote at length of his great regard for herbert <UNK> the director and <UNK> of this london series of films
<START> this film is <UNK> boring and pretentious there is only one good moment when a sailor <UNK> mr <UNK> think the purple dinosaur less <UNK> <UNK> the music is relentlessly <UNK> it is sad that <UNK> someone with so much inner beauty has been brought down to pretentious <UNK> in her art the <UNK> of the tea service makes a beautiful ritual seem vapid the mythology and culture are not respected in this film they are lifted not just from japanese culture but from another filmmaker stay tuned in a perfect art <UNK> life moment the crew of the ship finds a giant piece of sh t which is what the audience found in the theatre there are some set pieces which are very composed and arty without heart <UNK> for spoilers i'm talking to you mr barney br br the emperor has no clothes mr barney you have been <UNK> i have seen <UNK> holy mountain and your thin fake <UNK> of <UNK> has been lifted you have stolen your images your style and your entire art <UNK> from this man now that holy mountain has been released finally let's hope the powers that be at the art <UNK> of the world stop <UNK> you poor <UNK> lost in a financial battle with the beatles lawyer when he is the lennon <UNK> of film making and btw while <UNK> is the <UNK> you are the <UNK> a cheap thin soulless rip off only liked by <UNK> <UNK> college <UNK> and btw i am a filmmaker if you are interested in making a reality film i will <UNK> fight you in a ring defending <UNK> you defending outright <UNK>
<START> chuck <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a fast paced often hilarious cartoon <UNK> bugs bunny against a strange yellow skinned apartment store manager who wants to have him stuffed <UNK> <UNK> takes full advantage of its multi purpose setting the chase takes bugs and his <UNK> through a variety of <UNK> leading to an inspired gag in which they quickly emerge from various <UNK> wearing whatever clothes are associated with that part of the store this great gag is <UNK> however by a truly inspired sequence involving <UNK> in which bugs disguised as an elevator boy tricks the store manager into relentlessly getting on or off <UNK> at the wrong time it's a brilliant climactic set piece which unfortunately gives way to a not very funny final gag by that time however <UNK> <UNK> has made its mark as one of the great chase films <UNK> with wild energy as bugs was becoming more <UNK> in some of the other cartoons from this period <UNK> <UNK> showed that he could still be just as appealing as a more <UNK> character
<START> this piece of crap since i can't call it a movie can be summed up by the following br br stereotypical black criminal with black midget partner get in trouble black midget pretends to be a baby with a fully developed adult face body hair and <UNK> black midget is mistaken somehow by man and woman who happen to want a baby black midget than goes on to commit acts of physical and sexual violence <UNK> white people wherever he sees them and commit more crimes happy ending br br honestly it could have been a good satire if it hadn't been directed so <UNK> and had such talentless <UNK> star in it
<START> somewhere out there there must be a list of the all time worst gay films every made one's that have overlong camera shots of the stars sitting and staring <UNK> into space or one's where they focus <UNK> long on kitty <UNK> eating spaghetti this motion sickness picture is a story of a boy and a boy and they live and love and swim and get stuck in <UNK> and one of them has a depressed mother and another has no mother and they talk and walk and swim and have sex and get drunk and then break up and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then gets out and there is a lot of fast forward and <UNK> and there are long <UNK> shots of one of them looking into space or just sitting and doing nothing i think it's some sort of <UNK> film making technique or maybe it's that the film is so bad they have to fill it up with long wasted shots because otherwise if they had to rely on plot or story the film would be about 14 minutes don't get me wrong this is about the <UNK> gay film i <UNK> watched in the past 6 months and some of them most of them have been very <UNK> predictable and boring but this is one is really a terrible waste of time the best one so far was beautiful thing so i watched this and after the very first opening shot which <UNK> and <UNK> i thought oh no its going to be creative <UNK> <UNK> but i gave it a chance and watched it and then when it ended i tossed the dvd in the trash sorry i didn't like it and if you did sorry if i offend
<START> ralph and <UNK> <UNK> in their own land get <UNK> into being <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> twice upon a time is the story of them the characters they meet and their struggle to set things right with a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and wonderful voice acting by some of the best in the business this offbeat movie hits the mark br br the animation process while similar to that of the cut out south park style is much <UNK> and far more three dimensional if i didn't know that the animation was this style i would swear that is was traditional pen and <UNK> if you can watch this film in <UNK> surround or <UNK> please do you won't really miss anything if you don't but if you do you will get much more out of the experience
<START> this was a cute movie at first then then got too sappy and featured mediocre songs at best br br there is too much king james english spoken with is not only annoying in today's world but not always easy to interpret can you imagine young people of today trying to listen to this film forget it br br bing crosby has some good lines in here and is likable as hank martin <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> was too in addition to her good looks and beautiful long red hair br br it's a nice movie with a feel good ending and i can't knock that maybe this is worthy of a rental for historical sake or if you're a big crosby fan but overall it's not that much
<START> i rented this on dvd yesterday and did not realize it was a character study type of movie so i <UNK> to watch about an hour of it before hitting the stop button br br even with a character study theme i just could not get into this film at all perhaps it was my mood in wanting to watch something else or maybe i had other expectations but setting that aside i tried my best to move on to finish watching but gave up the actors played their roles well but the global combination did not come together to keep my interest about the only interesting thing was the <UNK> gun being stolen and he <UNK> to buy another one and <UNK> painted it black to appear as police issue i think this movie should have been entitled who stole the <UNK> gun scenes were well done but putting them together i once again felt robbed for anything cohesive to keep me viewing br br since i didn't finish watching it i'd say there is some merit to renting this film maybe to me it was a waste of good viewing effort and time i'll leave it up to you to try it but it's not one i'd strongly recommend
<START> wow i mean wow this has got to be one of the best story's i've ever had the chance to read watch we all know this famous story two martial artist a man and his son go to train in the forbidden cursed springs and while ignoring their <UNK> they both fall in a spring each the dad <UNK> the spring of drowned <UNK> and 16 year old <UNK> the spring of drowned girl now with every <UNK> of cold water they turn into the very being titled to the spring they landed in crazy enough yet no thats just the beginning as if being one of the strongest teenagers to ever exist who turns into a female wasn't enough <UNK> has to deal with crazed martial arts teachers and hundreds of insane art styles an insane high school principle opponents right and left who have a score to settle with <UNK> <UNK> it be for messing up their life early on somehow or for <UNK> their loved ones and speaking of loved ones i've lost track of how many times a boy or a girl has fallen in love with <UNK> and not once has it been his fiancée <UNK> and thats just from the first few chapters episodes of the series br br the story itself is amazing i have never come across something so crazy so bizarre so so out of this world and yet its so down to earth and believable i can't even describe it to its <UNK> its just a charming story thats so easy to get into what i like about it is the humor not once have i laughed out loud this much from a manga and it doesn't have to try any of the stunts you would catch in <UNK> or something of the sort i could read any part of the comic and i would be laughing from beginning to end another thing is the characters <UNK> you would think making him too strong would be a set back but <UNK> with every little problem the story throws at him he's doing his best just to survive half the time and his personality is that of a foolish young boy it would seem but when worst comes to worst he can be a <UNK> genius and to think of the hundreds of <UNK> in the show <UNK> who hates the idea of <UNK> all together is considered by everyone in his town more so by <UNK> the worst <UNK> to ever live his father <UNK> you would think the father character would blend in to the background right correct but whenever he does have some spotlight he just gives you more reasons to hate him yet at the same love him you think you know the worst dad ever from an anime you haven't met <UNK> <UNK> probably one of <UNK> greatest rivals and my favorite character next to <UNK> and probably one of the only people he can actually stand most likely the strongest character in the series but has two faults one is his curse that turns him into a baby pig but his worst fault is his lack of sense in direction then we have you know i could spend hours at the computer explaining all the characters the story's everything positive about it but that would be just pointless br br check out the series if you haven't now you will not regret it though i would advise checking the comic out first i like the anime but i've had some trouble getting the series at a good price and a small <UNK> the humor doesn't seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga i think partly because the comic seems more cartoonish to me but either way its a win win 10 out of 10
<START> i won't try to <UNK> as to what brando was attempting at his best he turns in such oddball performances <UNK> so many things at once that it doesn't seem he does anything so much as play by <UNK> instinct often it seems he is calling attention to some <UNK> aspect of his character over all others a concentration which if followed turns out something of a red <UNK> as he turns out <UNK> <UNK> than at first appeared this is a <UNK> of <UNK> not <UNK> as might be associated with the method the role of sky masterson as <UNK> so wonderfully realized seems <UNK> for him which is to begin with odd and odd still at the end because whatever it is brando has done he has managed a grace maybe all his own but a <UNK> grace nonetheless again odd coming from an actor with limited musical ability not ever before or after associated with the musical comedy jean simmons also oddly cast is not quite as impressive but certainly above just adequate really delightful in the <UNK> sequence and never less than enjoyable throughout br br and yet perhaps because actors are both so concentrated on what it is they are doing and characters on what it is they intend of each other there doesn't seem to be the <UNK> chemistry brought up so <UNK> more than once brando sky masterson and simmons sister sarah respectively feed off one another well enough but i for one don't see more beyond that in a movie this <UNK> dazzling and entertaining and most everything about it craft wise is just that dazzling that lack would seem something <UNK> and easily overlooked but so much would depend upon true chemistry an at least partial transformation of the characters through such chemistry would lend something positively moving to the final scene as it is one leaves this film certainly delighted but not really moved except in a way as to <UNK> the <UNK> of the union note sister sarah marries in her <UNK> uniform sky masterson in his same <UNK> man about town <UNK> rather than wedding <UNK> and they have changed back to those from their previous scene br br <UNK> enough that is <UNK> the most touching and most serious scene is i think between brando and vivian <UNK> as sinatra nathan <UNK> doll <UNK> the only scene where these two are exclusively together not least because there is just no hint of <UNK> between them even though it takes place in <UNK> dressing room while <UNK> is about to change though one may submit there is no place for that sky really is the type to check out <UNK> in this sort of <UNK> he is even there to tell <UNK> nathan will not be meeting her to <UNK> <UNK> and sky are both true in their respective ways to nathan even <UNK> of him as is demonstrated through a tone in their exchange <UNK> is of course also frustrated and disappointed but her anger is <UNK> by her deeper feeling for nathan as sky is <UNK> her that she can't love a man and then wish him to be someone else br br guys and dolls is another turn at the battle of the <UNK> around the themes of gambling and salvation since both the <UNK> <UNK> and the salvation <UNK> are more or less <UNK> <UNK> despair there just may be a dark secret deliberately behind <UNK> and <UNK> lack of chemistry after all that lack may well <UNK> an excess of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by the sinatra <UNK> pairing though with considerably less self deception involved which might explain <UNK> and <UNK> odd rather provoking interpretations of sky masterson and sister sarah i realize simmons may be mostly depicting <UNK> and <UNK> but brando though playing to confront her isn't exactly <UNK> and eager and is more than keeping his distance he's also <UNK> it keeping his balance through it his <UNK> consists in merely playing against her the trip to cuba a kiss whatever it takes but he is not actually set on winning through <UNK> her so much as beating her then in her own <UNK> this may be <UNK> as playing to <UNK> may be the only way to get to the <UNK> and through but it makes <UNK> transition from merely trying to win a bet to actually wanting sarah brown a little less than <UNK> yet why does he want her what does falling in love mean to sky i find the only way to get around this is by indeed accepting his humanity has kicked in and that he does not want to end up a mere <UNK> toward sister sarah so he does as he's promised her need to deliver the <UNK> to her <UNK> meeting make good by his <UNK> as he puts it as a way of winning her back when it seems he had already won only to lose her but this still <UNK> self concern more than anything however it also allows for sarah <UNK> own self concern as sky will <UNK> the <UNK> in her in order to get back the lover neither at least it seems will change much by their union except perhaps in the acceptance of the other yet that would seem an all but <UNK> uneasy <UNK> acceptance of is still quite a cry away from achieving happiness in the other let alone the <UNK> they each seem to imply by chemistry and behind all this i suspect is <UNK> full knowing br br for all those who might say in defense of guys and dolls yet that not much can be expected from musicals by way of depth i need only remind them <UNK> the three penny opera <UNK> a star is born even the sound of music which i don't care for as much and one can keep adding to this list without even reaching forward toward post <UNK> musicals all wrap gorgeous music and dance around dire <UNK>
<START> i mean i thought i heard this dialog in the movie but it was so bad and out of place that i can't really believe it i was laughing so hard at what must have been the worst writing and acting in human history i was seriously worried that i might have a heart attack and die right there in the theater br br so this is the scene i am talking about the hero just watched his brother crash and his brothers car <UNK> right there just feet away from him the hero the hero was throwing the expected fit at seeing something so tragic and people were trying to hold him back from running into the burning car br br in the middle of his fit and his <UNK> rage emotional break down he says i am so sad he said that right am i crazy
<START> something to sing about was produced at grand national studios where james cagney was working while under a contract <UNK> with the brothers warner he did two films for this b studio neither of which rank high in the cagney credits br br one of the great <UNK> to cinema is the fact that jimmy cagney did so few films that <UNK> his terrific dancing abilities the two that come to mind immediately are <UNK> <UNK> dandy and <UNK> parade two lesser films are the west point story and never steal anything small cagney himself said he never used to watch anything but his musicals in retirement so why did he make so few of them br br well this one was all wrong the plot of something to sing about concerns a <UNK> who <UNK> for a band who's discovered and given a movie contract there are the usual complications of a conniving studio boss and a conniving press agent played respectively and well by gene <UNK> and william <UNK> his contract calls for a no marriage <UNK> so cagney and band girl singer lady evelyn <UNK> marry in secret then we get the <UNK> of a publicity driven studio romance with screen leading lady <UNK> <UNK> i think you can figure where this is going br br the most disappointing thing about something to sing about is the lack of dance numbers for cagney he dances briefly at the beginning and the end of the film and nothing in the middle evelyn <UNK> had a nice singing voice and the charisma of a ham <UNK> she got the musical numbers such as they were i'm sure the movie going public was paying their tickets to see cagney dance br br also in addition to giving him some dance numbers a female dance partner would have been nice he <UNK> well with ruby keeler in <UNK> parade and with virginia <UNK> and doris day in the west point story weren't ginger rogers <UNK> powell or ruby keeler available br br no memorable songs came out of this and <UNK> voice is <UNK> as well she has a <UNK> macdonald soprano voice which was so out of place with a swing band br br no wonder cagney went running back to warner brothers but they should have given him some decent musicals
<START> this was the first <UNK> in a new era for the wwe as hulk hogan the ultimate warrior <UNK> flair and <UNK> <UNK> had all left a new crop of talent needed to be pushed and this all started with lex <UNK> a former <UNK> world <UNK> champion being given a title shot against <UNK> lex <UNK> all over the us in a bus called the lex express to inspire americans into <UNK> behind him in his <UNK> to beat the japanese monster who was actually <UNK> and get the wwe championship back into american hands as such there was much anticipation for this match br br but every good <UNK> needs an <UNK> and this had some good stuff br br the night started off with razor <UNK> <UNK> ted <UNK> in a good match the story going into this was that <UNK> had picked on <UNK> and even offered him a job as a slave after his shock loss to the 1 2 3 kid on raw in july <UNK> angry had then teamed with the 1 2 3 kid against the money inc tag team of ted <UNK> and irwin r <UNK> to settle their differences they were both given one on one matches <UNK> vs <UNK> and <UNK> vs the kid razor was able to settle his side of the deal after hitting a <UNK> edge br br next up came the <UNK> brothers putting the wwe tag team titles on the line against the heavenly bodies <UNK> the <UNK> of the bodies manager jim <UNK> who hit scott <UNK> in the throat with a <UNK> <UNK> they were able to pull out the win in a decent match br br shawn michaels and mr perfect had been <UNK> since <UNK> <UNK> when shawn michaels confronted perfect after his loss to lex <UNK> perfect had then cost michaels the <UNK> championship when he distracted him in a title match against marty <UNK> michaels had won the title back and was putting it on the line against mr perfect but michaels now had a powerful ally in his corner in his 7 foot bodyguard <UNK> <UNK> and perfect had an excellent match here but it was <UNK> who proved the difference maker pulling perfect out of the ring and throwing him into the steel steps for shawn to win by count out br br irwin r <UNK> <UNK> the loss of his tag team partner earlier in the night easily <UNK> for the 1 2 3 kid br br next came one of the big matches of the night as <UNK> hart prepared to battle jerry <UNK> for the title of <UNK> king of the wwe but <UNK> came out with <UNK> saying he'd been injured in a car accident earlier that day and that he'd arranged another <UNK> for hart <UNK> the clown hart and <UNK> had a passable match which hart won with a <UNK> he was then jumped from behind by <UNK> this bought wwe president jack <UNK> to the ring who told <UNK> that he would receive a lifetime <UNK> if he didn't <UNK> hart hart then destroyed <UNK> winning with the <UNK> but hart refused to let go of the hold and the <UNK> <UNK> his decision so after all that <UNK> was named the <UNK> king of the wwe this match was followed by <UNK> <UNK> destroying marty <UNK> in a short match br br the undertaker finished his long rivalry with harvey <UNK> which had started in 1992 when the undertaker had defeated <UNK> client <UNK> at <UNK> and continued when <UNK> latest monster the giant <UNK> had destroyed taker at the <UNK> and then again at <UNK> with a <UNK> victory over <UNK> here <UNK> then turned on <UNK> <UNK> him after a poor match br br next it was time for six man tag action as the smoking <UNK> bart and billy and <UNK> defeated the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br this brings us to the main event with <UNK> <UNK> by jim <UNK> and mr <UNK> putting the wwe title on the line against lex <UNK> and it was all on board the lex express lex came out attacking but <UNK> took control lex came back though as he was able to avoid a <UNK> drop and then body slam <UNK> before knocking him out of the ring <UNK> then attacked <UNK> and <UNK> as <UNK> was counted out <UNK> had won a fine match <UNK> fell from the ceiling the heroes all came out to <UNK> him on his win <UNK> may have <UNK> the title but <UNK> had proved he could be beaten the only question was who could beat him in the ring and get that title off him
<START> this is a movie i had never even thought of seeing until my 3 year old spotted it at the video store and grabbed it after liking the cover picture of the animals on <UNK> island we got it and have watched it repeatedly since in fact we've rented it several times since there are very few non animated movies that my son will watch and pay attention to what a nice change from <UNK> and the little mermaid the acting is outstanding the songs are compelling they get deep into your head and you can't help but singing along the storyline while specifically about ww2 is timeless in it's own way and there is something new to see every time you watch i've heard it compared to mary <UNK> but i think they are two very different movies both excellent but somehow my son has no interest at all in mary <UNK> this is one of those movies that kids will want to watch over and over again and one that parents won't mind <UNK> with there are days we watch it before <UNK> time and bed time and i don't feel that <UNK> coming that comes when he wants to repeat any other movie
<START> unless you are geeky film student who has to see everything this film will not only be a waste of your time and money and a huge disappointment but it will also make you angry beyond belief br br there might be a story worth telling somewhere inside but hopkins decided to hide it and <UNK> under so many <UNK> chaotic layers of apparently random audio video <UNK> making the viewer's patience run thin after a very short while br br why would someone like hopkins choose such a heavy most difficult and highly unstable project as his first script first score and third film can by <UNK> guess maybe he played with it in his mind for such a long time until it became <UNK> as what it became not even for himself the result proves that he has by far not enough experience or skill to achieve the desired result br br even the <UNK> carpenter and lynch films to name just two <UNK> filmmakers had 90 more <UNK> 95 less characters and 99 more story flow br br sir anthony you aimed for the stars but unfortunately missed by a couple of light years please stick to acting in that department you are a <UNK> giant and nobody should ask more from you not even yourself
<START> first off this really is my favorite film ever i don't need to give anyone a description because every a hole does that i am literally obsessed with this practically <UNK> cheesy lame effects <UNK> boom stick <UNK> badly edited 80's metal horror masterpiece the director i heard had hoped for a hit at the box office so that he could do sequels and have a freddy jason type of deal for himself damn i wish that could've went down like that the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> good check this <UNK> out and any die hard fans out there feel free to email and chat sometime <UNK> i can be found at <UNK>
<START> in this film made just as the production code was being <UNK> jean harlow is <UNK> and <UNK> kelly is the <UNK> man chasing sidekick kitty girl from <UNK> starts out with the girls getting on a train with <UNK> making a promise to herself to earn money while looking for a millionaire husband staying whole some in the process it doesn't take her long to meet up with frank cousins lewis stone was the kindly doctor in grand hotel as well as judge hardy in the andy hardy films but all is not as it seems the censors must have loved <UNK> line a girl couldn't accept an expensive gift like that from a gentleman unless she was engaged later someone says you know we've never been alone together and <UNK> replies yeah and we're not going to be lionel barrymore is t r <UNK> another rich <UNK> who comes to her rescue when trouble comes looking for <UNK> at one point <UNK> declares you <UNK> scratch me off your list i'm not a ladies man i wonder what that line would have been just a couple years earlier before the hayes code came rolling into town what was he really saying carol <UNK> seems to be the high pitched baby <UNK> as listed in the credits on imdb looks like she was only in <UNK> from 1931 1939 with <UNK> in wizard of oz being the last part she played fun <UNK> romp as the girls chase men around the country look for <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> who was an olympic wrestler <UNK> silver <UNK> winner turned film star he was in many of the dr <UNK> and would appear in four of <UNK> films mistaken identity plot twists a young <UNK> tone love stories even jean harlow in a bathing suit in palm beach although the <UNK> scenes of downtown appear to be a backdrop
<START> back in the days before the toxic <UNK> the low camp kings at troma films tried to take the high ok somewhat less low road of producing straight slasher <UNK> i'd like to think that viewing the results here is what convinced them to give up all <UNK> and go for self conscious parody br br splatter university is another film for the <UNK> in the audience as it <UNK> about through two separate casts and <UNK> pointless subplots it actually becomes painful to watch let's see if i can <UNK> br br after learning that a dangerous psychopath has escaped from a local hospital the action moves to a catholic university i don't recall the name but in honor of the title let's call it st splatter the students are <UNK> and <UNK> and argue <UNK> with each other <UNK> ahead of their time meanwhile the new professor julie parker proves utterly incompetent at her job the kids deal with relationships infidelity <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> priests and how to avoid doing any work in class julie deals with a creepy boyfriend the <UNK> administration at st splatter <UNK> <UNK> mothers and the blank <UNK> looks of her students none of it means a darn thing or gets resolved in any meaningful way oh and every once in a while a <UNK> shot comes along and stabs one of the girls to death but don't hold your breath waiting for it there's a red <UNK> killer and then a sadly <UNK> confrontation with the real killer then it's back to the asylum and roll credits br br the slow pace and numerous inane subplots seem almost <UNK> to produce a <UNK> sense of frustration in the viewer which is helped along by choppy editing coffee can sound quality and dialog that just doesn't make any sense and the most <UNK> thing about this movie is the killer's <UNK> on women the men in this movie are just so deserving <UNK> paid good money to see someone off the jerk with the pregnant girlfriend or the <UNK> <UNK> who was <UNK> around with his <UNK> roommate or any of the creepy priests there ain't no justice
<START> a <UNK> wonderful movie you are held in a death grip once you let yourself get involved with the story a successful dentist alan johnson don cheadle is torn in a life crisis of <UNK> his career with his family he notices his former college roommate charlie <UNK> adam sandler and wants to touch base he finds that charlie who lost his wife and family in the 9 11 attack on america is no longer in touch with reality choosing to involve his mind with his favorite music from the past and video games the former roommates <UNK> their friendship and <UNK> their former bond johnson has his friend angela <UNK> <UNK> tyler a psychiatrist to try and bring charlie out of his grief but it is alan that <UNK> in getting his friend to emerge from his deep darkness <UNK> <UNK> smith plays <UNK> wife writer and director mike <UNK> plays the role of charlie's attorney guardian also in the cast <UNK> <UNK> donald sutherland <UNK> <UNK> and robert <UNK> outstanding soundtrack featuring the likes of bruce <UNK> graham <UNK> <UNK> jam and the <UNK> br br note i have never been a sandler fan but i found him outstanding in this role in some of the scenes i thought out loud why has he never been approached to play singer <UNK> bob dylan in a biopic
<START> this movie in away was super clever it's theme <UNK> with every single horror movie ever made valentine makes zero attempt to be original what is valentine anyway it's a bunch of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier there is nothing original in valentine br br i only saw it once and in that one viewing here are some of the films it ripped off 1 prom night 2 carrie 3 scream 4 any other horror movie in which somebody is killing somebody br br i know there is more but my mind was slowly turning into a <UNK> of <UNK> so it couldn't grab them as fast as they came br br valentine had no chance of being a good movie how come every horror movie has to have a <UNK> killer people you don't care about because their emotions take a turn every other scene one minute a nice girl turns into an evil b <UNK> then she's an insecure woman and so on and son on br br normally any horror movie in my book can be saved by gore once again valentine doesn't have this it was as if they tried to make it pg 13 but failed so they left the edit br br do not see this overly inspired rip off unless you hate yourself and you want to die br br 1 2 3 j leonard <UNK>
<START> this film had my heart <UNK> the acting was great the erotic music and the beautiful women add up to make this one a winner the lead actress decides to join an <UNK> service when she realizes that her husband has no time for her she <UNK> into a whole new world her first client being another woman this is a film you definitely don't want to pass up
<START> the <UNK> cover title and very small hidden print of power of <UNK> tricked me into renting this movie br br it started out really well and pulled me in i really liked it between 1 3 and 3 <UNK> of it the film started throwing in things that were not set up and made no sense my first thought was this is not written by someone who knows how to tell a story i ended up re watching parts of the movie thinking i had missed something br br by the time i reached the last 1 5 of the movie it was all boring annoying religion <UNK> dialog that made no sense said nothing and was annoying to listen to i turned off the sound and did a fast forward to the end br br don't waste your time with this flick br br beware of dvds labeled <UNK> films and level path productions br br and i'm a practicing catholic
<START> i really enjoyed the reunion a lot i would have rated it a 10 if they had had <UNK> and little luke there wasn't even a mention of where they are today or why they didn't participate in the reunion they were very popular characters and i think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of appearance br br anyway i was glad that <UNK> ran the series again i had been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to tape the whole series i may have missed a few episodes jenny <UNK>
<START> an unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are violently and horribly <UNK> by a group of two dimensional psycho thugs during a night time encounter on a forest road in <UNK> england the man and woman who were <UNK> plan and carry out a revenge attack on their <UNK> br br utterly <UNK> piece of <UNK> trash somehow <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> drama whilst actually coming across as sub michael winner <UNK> p you just know that oliver reed and susan george would have been cast had it so easily have been made in the 1970s what happens to alice gillian anderson and adam danny <UNK> is appalling and devastating yet dan reed somehow manages to rub the viewer's nose in every last <UNK> of its sexual <UNK> his camera <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> naked body both during and after the assault whilst the script leaves almost all the characters <UNK> in a turgid sea of two dimensional cliché his script forces his characters to behave in such a way as to alienate the viewer further from the <UNK> by <UNK> more ghastly situations into their faces <UNK> attempted post incident <UNK> on both sophie and alice <UNK> assault on <UNK> after his suicide attempt confession br br the <UNK> comes from the central <UNK> performances <UNK> is a horrible actor incapable of light and <UNK> as the young male victim of the initial assault he'll end up in <UNK> mark my words but anderson is extraordinary even as the atrocious script forces her character to behave in <UNK> and ludicrous ways she somehow delivers an extraordinarily compelling and complicated characterisation as a self indulgent arrogant <UNK> who encounters such horrors and needs to <UNK> br br a vile and pointless film then almost but not quite rescued by a compelling central female performance
<START> no doubt when madonna and guy ritchie married it was because they both thought it would help their movie careers if you've been through the ordeal of watching swept away then you know at that level it was a match made in hell after nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress or <UNK> as she might have <UNK> it in the next best thing she still can't get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent and that's the thing that makes people dislike her so much on the screen that gut feeling that her ego is so <UNK> that it <UNK> her from being able to just let go and connect with her audience if there's any justice in this universe she just blew her last chance
<START> this is the only david <UNK> movie that does not spoof anything the first of its kind the funniest movie of 98 with night at the <UNK> right behind but i did not think <UNK> something about mary was funny so that <UNK> count except for the frank and <UNK> thing he he dont listen to the critics especially roger ebert he does not know solid entertainment just look at his reviews anyway see it you wont be <UNK>
<START> this is an awesome <UNK> horror anthology with 3 great stories and fantastic performances only the last story disappoints all the characters are awesome and the film is quite chilling and suspenseful plus peter cushing and christopher lee are simply amazing in this it's very underrated and my favorite story has to be the 3rd one <UNK> to the sweet plus all the characters are very likable some of it's predictable and the last story was incredibly disappointing and rather bland however the ending was really cool this is an awesome <UNK> horror anthology with 3 great stories and fantastic performances only the last story disappoints i say it's must see br br 1st story method for murder this is an awesome story with plenty of suspense and the killer dominic is really creepy and it's very well acted as well this was the perfect way to start off with a story and for the most part it's unpredictable plus the double twist ending is shocking and quite creepy grade a br br 2nd story <UNK> this is a solid story all around with wonderful performances however the ending is quite predictable but it's still creepy and has quite a bit of suspense peter cushing did an amazing job and i couldn't believe how young <UNK> <UNK> was i really enjoyed this story grade b br br 3rd story <UNK> to the sweet this is the best story here as it's extremely creepy and unpredictable throughout it also has a nice twist as well christopher lee did an amazing job and chloe <UNK> did a wonderful job as the young daughter plus the ending is quite shocking i don't want to spoil it for you but it's one of the best horror stories i have seen grade a br br 4th story the cloak this is a terrible story that's really weak and unfunny jon pertwee annoyed me however the ending surprised me a little bit and ingrid pitt was great as always however it's just dull and has been done before many times plus where was the creativity grade d br br the direction is great peter <UNK> does a great job here with awesome camera work great angles adding some creepy atmosphere and keeping the film at a very fast pace br br the acting is awesome john <UNK> is great here as the narrator he had some great lines i just wished he had more screen time john bennett is very good as the <UNK> and was quite intense he was especially good at the end i liked him lots <UNK> elliott is excellent as charles he was vulnerable showed fear was very likable and i loved his facial expressions he <UNK> joanna <UNK> is stunningly gorgeous and did great with what she had to do as the wife she also had great chemistry with <UNK> elliott tom adams is incredibly creepy as dominic he was creepy looking and got the job done extremely well peter cushing is amazing as always and is amazing here he is likable focused charming and as always had a ton of class cushing rules <UNK> <UNK> is fantastic as always and looked so young here i barely recognized him his accent wasn't so thick and played a different role i loved it <UNK> rules <UNK> morris is creepy here and did what he had to do well christopher lee is amazing as always and is amazing here he is incredibly intense very focused and as always had that great intense look on his face he was especially amazing at the end lee rules chloe <UNK> is adorable as the daughter she is somewhat creepy and gave one of the best child performances i have ever seen i loved her <UNK> dawn porter is beautiful and was excellent as the babysitter i liked her lots jon pertwee annoyed me here and was quite bland and completely unfunny he also had no chemistry with ingrid pitt ingrid pitt is beautiful and does her usual vampire thing and does it well br br rest of the cast do fine overall a must see out of 5
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this film for its humor and pathos i especially like the way the characters welcomed <UNK> various <UNK> with friends and family like these anyone would feel <UNK> and loved i found the writing witty and natural and the actors made the material come alive
<START> this movie had mediocrity <UNK> and <UNK> written all over it if you are going to do a movie about vampires that has been done thousands of times already then you better do a damn good job i'll be the first to say that this movie just did not cut it some scary horror movies just fail to break the mold of the lets do something forbidden and <UNK> for the sake of fun because all the stories are just lies cliché this one sadly was no different and like all scary movies once you venture down that road there is no going back br br and the ending how do the heroes do the same job over and over throughout the movie but then mysteriously they get wrapped up in the moment and cannot do the job in the end the ending was very anti climatic and spelled part 3 which i will never watch terrible movie
<START> being a person who does not usually enjoy boxing movies feeling they only focus on the boxing and not the characters themselves this movie truly moved me i loved being able to see the main character diana michelle rodriguez go through so many things in such a short while it was amazing to me michelle rodriguez did such a wonderful job playing diana especially since this was her first acting experience she showed true emotion and portrayed diana wonderfully all actors had chemistry on screen and made this movie even more amazing i highly recommend this movie even to those who do not usually watch boxing movies 10 10
<START> what a shame it is when a potentially captivating and <UNK> low key story manages to <UNK> onto your interest at the start and then gradually lets you down further and further until you're left scratching your <UNK> head by the time it reaches its overdone conclusion unfortunately this is what happened to me by the end of white noise br br it wasn't michael keaton's fault it was a pleasure to see him return as the star of a brand new movie once again looking a bit <UNK> perhaps but still managing to give a strong and sincere performance as a man whose wife has recently died he becomes obsessed with her wandering spirit in the <UNK> not a new idea apparently getting <UNK> by her through that funky <UNK> <UNK> business you see on your television screen when there's nothing being broadcast br br the idea of spirits <UNK> via the <UNK> is called <UNK> electronic voice <UNK> and there are a lot of people who actually believe in it for real so i'm not going to make any comments about what i think of that or them let me just say that i'm all for suspension of disbelief when it comes to buying into fantastic films like this but what i can't tolerate is not understanding what the hell was supposed to be taking place which is about where i was left stranded when the credits finally began to roll much static indeed br br there are occasionally movies like this that have me completely <UNK> but if a film fails to make itself clear for me i tend to consider that to be the fault of the filmmaker not my own unless i watched it while i was too tired to focus or something well for white noise i was wide awake bright eyed and <UNK> <UNK> so guess who's to blame
<START> a scientist discovers <UNK> from space that appear to carry information concerning a series of seemingly unrelated natural disasters occurring across the globe hoping to discover the source of these <UNK> and who's behind them the scientist and his wife set out on a trek to locate the intended <UNK> of the <UNK> what the couple eventually discovers is a small remote convent with <UNK> who are not really who they appear to be according to the dvd <UNK> synopsis br br kirk scott as andrew <UNK> is the scientist who <UNK> alien messages on his computer he suspects a series of large earth <UNK> may be connected to the weird space static mr scott and pretty blonde wife sue <UNK> as sylvia <UNK> investigate the mysterious <UNK> from outer space they discover <UNK> but creepy christopher lee as father <UNK> and other silliness given that end of the world is remarkably dull br br end of the world 1977 john hayes kirk scott sue <UNK> christopher lee
<START> where to start oh <UNK> message to the bad guys when you first find the person you have been tracking in order to kill that witnessed a crime you committed don't spend time talking to her so that she has yet another opportunity to get away message to the victim when the thugs are talking amongst themselves and arguing take that opportunity to run away don't sit there and watch them until you make a noise they hear message to the director if someone has a 5 or 10 minute head start in a vehicle or on foot you can't have the bad guys on their heels or <UNK> right away time and motion doesn't work that way it would also be nice to think that a woman doesn't have to brutally kill 4 men in order to <UNK> herself to leave an abusive relationship at home
<START> i would not like to comment on how good the movie was or what were the flaws as i am not a professional film critic and i do not have enough knowledge of making movies what i do know is that making this kind of a movie in your very first shot is a big achievement and i would like to <UNK> the director for that however in some reviews that i have read critics have complained that <UNK> relationship with his brothers was not <UNK> and his siblings were completely <UNK> from the story now i would really like to raise a point here that as the name of the movie suggests it is not a movie about <UNK> brothers it is a movie on the relationship of <UNK> gandhi and his son <UNK> gandhi nothing more nothing less if we start complaining about some characters being kept out of action in the movie it would be a bit unfair because these characters don't fit in the picture no matter how relevant they were in real life so i think it would be better if we stick to the main idea and stop satisfy a critic in ourselves br br enjoy
<START> i gave this film 2 stars only because dominic <UNK> actually put effort through in his acting everything else about this film is extremely amateur everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed not only should the director <UNK> what she is doing for a life career but maybe she should watch a few films as dominic <UNK> is a very credible actor placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful <UNK> the actor was that played jack's best friend should never have stepped in front of the camera i didn't expect much from such a small film but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings don't waste your time or money on this film like i did you will be sorely disappointed
<START> i am a huge fan of warrior movies some of my favorites are braveheart <UNK> the last samurai and gladiator and after watching <UNK> which is absolutely awesome and which i strongly recommend i had high expectations from a <UNK> <UNK> movie but it was terrible awful even pathetic is not a strong word in this case the whole movie i was waiting for something exciting to happen but it didn't then i was at least expecting a big epic battle at the end but even that was a huge disappointment just some random running around waving with the swords there are so many good warrior movies this one is not one of them
<START> john <UNK> son wrote a high school drama wow i thought as i checked the <UNK> info here on imdb late on a saturday night having found myself watching the opening credits on <UNK> br br i've just finished watching it and sadly it was downhill from there on arguably you can't spoil a film this poor but i'll leave the spoilers out of this review br br there's an awful lot of style over very little substance unfortunately the style hasn't dated too well in the eight years since its release as for the substance the film tries to pose an interesting look at the nature of control in society through the <UNK> of school life but beneath the shiny <UNK> a remotely meaningful or relevant argument fails to <UNK> characters are painted in <UNK> broad <UNK> falling into the kind of generic stereotypes the writer's father sought to question in breakfast club br br director kyle cooper does a decent job keeping the pace up perhaps relying a little too much on montages of information which soon becomes a tiresome device but at least pushes the story along but his efforts don't <UNK> detract from the poor script and bizarre casting how anyone is supposed to side with <UNK> when blake <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> his way through the part i just can't understand not to mention the numerous <UNK> plot holes i'm all for creative license but when the bad guys know the identities of the good guys making their lives a misery but fail to act in any way to stop them you really have to wonder why this script didn't <UNK> another few re <UNK> before production did daddy even read it br br i'm sure a younger audience might get some enjoyment from this film and all power to them but they're really better off sticking with hughes sr 's high school <UNK> and if the idea of school time rebellion is what really appeals the 1968 classic if is a much more satisfying examination of the subject
<START> this film contains more action before the opening credits than are in entire hollywood films of this sort this film is produced by tsui <UNK> and stars jet li this team has brought you many worthy hong kong cinema productions including the once upon a time in china series the action was fast and furious with amazing wire work i only saw the <UNK> in two shots aside from the action the story itself was strong and not just used as filler to find any other action films to rival this you must look for a hong kong cinema <UNK> in your area they are really worth checking out and usually never disappoint
<START> when tsui <UNK> experiments nothing and no one can <UNK> him legend of zu is possibly <UNK> <UNK> into <UNK> one does not understand all but like at 2001 a space odyssey you also don't have to but one feels the power of the film to every second every picture an extraordinary vision of the future of the <UNK> art and the one of the most <UNK> astounding <UNK> in the recent years vital severe masterpiece it's absolutely perfect as it is br br when tsui <UNK> experiments nothing and no one can <UNK> him legend of zu is possibly <UNK> <UNK> into <UNK> one does not understand all but one feels the power of the film to every second every picture an extraordinary vision of the future of the <UNK> art and the one of the most <UNK> astounding <UNK> in the recent years vital severe masterpiece it's absolutely perfect as it is <UNK> <UNK>
