<START> hey this <UNK> seems to knows a lot about people we have nine women and nine men taking part in a speed dating event each person has five minutes to talk to each opposite a good idea to make a movie out of these conversations and even better it works very very well the dialog is witty original and authentic each person is subtly <UNK> without falling into the cliché trap something that is unusual for german movies remember all these years we germans were tormented with silly <UNK> comedies such as <UNK> or br br but now the time has come for young german directors to do their own thing and take the risk of producing movies which are entertaining and funny and intelligent and sensitive at the same time the timing of is good too although it presents mainly dialog it keeps the tension and interest after a while you actually become curious to see how this man and that woman would do some of the participants meet later on for a two some it's fun to see them <UNK> together in real life of course the film has a few <UNK> it's not very cinematic but can such a movie be the musical soundtrack could have been better but all this is only <UNK> br br the most important thing about this movie we have some damn good actors here imagine this all of them are still pretty unknown even here in germany most were derived from the <UNK> or <UNK> theater scene but i predict that out of the 18 main actors at least 11 will quickly become very well known in the movie and tv scene over here it's great to see so many fresh and at the same time talented faces well done br br for those who want to read more here's a <UNK> of all 18 actors spoilers br br sebastian <UNK> silent waters are deep <UNK> his flower garden monologue you can win any woman's heart with this one br br anna a hell of a woman every time she opens her mouth you can't help but laugh and feel good listen how she <UNK> <UNK> and calls the pink shirt guy a br br felix the from above is fun to watch the <UNK> truth is that there are too many of those guys around his looks somewhat reminded me of <UNK> <UNK> of stiller br br <UNK> <UNK> this woman has everything love hope despair beauty her do you want children scene is a classic a great actress of whom we will hear again no doubt br br david now is this guy a loser or not almost as authentic as paul <UNK> in <UNK> i hope this is not method acting br br julia the good looking woman in the circle julia used to play theater in my hometown kudos i think she will appear in many tv series to come br br martin the revolutionary guy catches the <UNK> and most conventional woman in the end would you like to share a taxi with this guy br br von she gave a stunning performance in last year her <UNK> like performance in this movie is no less see her beautiful face and hear her dirty laugh the best scene in the movie belongs to her br br <UNK> i know these write down everything guys back from school i'm not sure whether the hot blond got her <UNK> reaction because of him or his cat portrayal of such a chicken is outstanding br br the sister in law of my ex girl friend was the same <UNK> like her the day i met her was the only day in my life i needed <UNK> so bad here br br thomas the nice and desperate guy in the circle has a comical talent that is way better than most so called comedians on tv br br lisa wagner the victim of <UNK> flower garden metaphor <UNK> face is funny and full of melancholy her story made me feel good and sad at the same time wow br br oliver the good looking man in the circle no wonder he catches julia in the end these two really fit together i think he will appear in many tv series to come br br julia the cute conventional woman i hope she won't be underrated <UNK> face changes from naive to hurt to furious are great br br <UNK> the nature boy from likes cooking eating  and good sex watch the body language between him and the hot blond usually plays politician on stage br br <UNK> the bargain girl has some good moments but beg your <UNK> fails like most actors in playing a drunk on screen br br christian plays the arrogant and <UNK> guy couldn't believe that this very actor owns two art house cinemas in <UNK> br br plays the girl who sleeps with every man around i'm sure many male <UNK> will go for her i have heard she can do dramatic roles as well so i'm curious
<START> rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion what makes this film so unsettling is that the drama feels so real it's almost hard to remember that it's only a movie this is by far <UNK> <UNK> and alan performance of their careers the film almost feels like a theatrical production the way it is staged and lit the only bad thing about this movie is that it's very difficult to get a copy of it i have yet to see it other than on <UNK> this truly powerful film deserves a <UNK> <UNK> transfer and special edition treatment on dvd it really is that good
<START> southern cross written and directed by james is a waste of good celluloid and actor's efforts a formula film is not necessarily bad if it pays off on it's promise which this film does not it is a tiresome <UNK> of movie cliches that can be <UNK> to a thousand different films from the past it is full of random and empty plot twists that add nothing but <UNK> action such as a trip by the protagonists to a ghost town where the villains follow them this was obviously <UNK> as an excuse for a shoot out and escape scene <UNK> on the preposterous with people popping in and out of <UNK> and running past windows while firing <UNK> at each other it makes one believe that somebody told there was a ghost town in the <UNK> <UNK> and he said oh great lets do a shoot out scene there br br don't even waste your rental money on this it is a bunch of random bits and pieces from a hundred different films thrown together to call an action drama
<START> i admit i have been a fan of harrison ford for many many years now so it didn't surprise me that i enjoyed his performance here but i also enjoyed the way the storyline developed and thought the casting was well done i don't know whether i buy into <UNK> scott thomas as a <UNK> but she is a fine actress and a beautiful woman i took notice of her in the first mission impossible although her part was small she stuck out on the screen br br here her and ford play people whose <UNK> are killed in an airplane crash they are <UNK> together and this is where the plot takes off apparently ford a police detective in wash d c discovers that his wife was having an affair he further discovers that the affair was with the husband of a new england <UNK> br br the story takes on many subplots as ford and thomas find themselves drawn together by revelations of their <UNK> the <UNK> of and the pure grief and anger over the loss of a loved one br br i think the movie is worthwhile either renting or catching on cable
<START> for all the viewers who have seen 'the <UNK> would agree with me on this comment that it is a superb movie and is very heartwarming joseph and brad prove their star quality in this movie along with <UNK> mother <UNK> <UNK> br br when i first watched the cure on tv i didn't know what to expect but as i watched this masterpiece it soon became clear what it was about <UNK> an 11 year old boy who is plagued with aids sits around his backyard playing with his toys when one day he meets his next door <UNK> eric which at first is a little awkward for the 2 boys but they soon became good friends br br during the film i kept wondering what would happen to the two boys as they kept me wondering i wondered how the heck they would get to new orleans sitting a door with a sea <UNK> under it pulling an crocodile behind it there were other great scenes throughout the movie br br but the part that reached out to me was the part when <UNK> health started to <UNK> you just couldn't help but wonder if he was going to make it but towards the end you find out i thought at the first prank they played that <UNK> was really dead he obviously wasn't silly me but when they play the third something is very wrong <UNK> doesn't get up to laugh nor does he show any kind of laughter at that point the victim of their prank soon <UNK> that poor <UNK> had died at that part i lost it i <UNK> my eyes out and from that scene <UNK> i was crying you just have to as the end <UNK> you start to understand <UNK> loss and then the movie ends on a nice note with <UNK> shoe floating ever so slowly down the river br br overall this movie was excellent it has laughter adventure emotion and sadness etc when you put that in a <UNK> you get an excellent must watch film peter <UNK> has done a great job directing this film and i believe its certainly one of his best but for now i will try to search for this movie on dvd if it exists that is once again a superb movie that will take you on an emotional
<START> journey to the far side of the sun aka <UNK> is an entertaining twilight zone style sci fi offering from <UNK> and sylvia anderson the team behind space 1999 <UNK> thunderbirds <UNK> 5 and others in the film roy <UNK> of the <UNK> tv show and ian <UNK> star as <UNK> sent on a flight to a planet which shares an exact <UNK> of the earth but on the opposite side of the sun hence previously hidden from view a <UNK> european space flight director over acted by the late patrick gets the flight fast <UNK> and after <UNK> training the <UNK> are good to go thus begins the best sequences in the film the launch flight and landing on the <UNK> earth dazzling rocket <UNK> work by derek <UNK> and a dream like elegant <UNK> somewhat reminiscent of the best moments of 2001 a space odyssey are easy highlights of the movie the landing on the <UNK> earth is both exciting and eerie after this the twilight zone aspect of the film kicks in with a plot lifted almost whole from the classic <UNK> episode the parallel that aside the film is still solid sci fi with some intriguing <UNK> stuff to chew on backwards writing and left handed <UNK> for example less successful are the scenes depicting a mid 21st century earth where all the men wear and <UNK> <UNK> and all the women wear mini <UNK> some of the relationships with women in the film are very <UNK> by today's standards as well and in the most consistent failing of most 20th century sci fi the computers <UNK> and other <UNK> are all big colorful and clunky right out of patrick the prisoner no one the digital age if one can accept these <UNK> in <UNK> the movie is very interesting with a solid lead performance by <UNK> as the troubled astronaut and with a nice 1960s early '70s style <UNK> ending for fans of retro sci fi like myself this is a journey worth taking
<START> it just goes to show how wrong you can be i had not expected to like this film i was disappointed by both the kill bill films although i preferred the second and death proof although it was better in the shorter cut of the double bill release i love <UNK> dogs admire pulp fiction and think that jackie brown is <UNK> most mature piece of film making technically his most superior including the last great performance <UNK> from robert de niro since then it seems to me while his films have been okay i haven't hated them he has been <UNK> water in <UNK> <UNK> self indulgent <UNK> br br then i read the script last year for <UNK> and i hated it sure it had some typical <UNK> <UNK> and the opening scene was undeniably powerful there were a couple of great characters but on page it was more juvenile rubbish largely ruined by the <UNK> of the uninteresting <UNK> of the title it made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film the trailers did nothing to convince me i only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a tarantino q a following in london i figured it would be worth enduring to hear him in q a as i know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person br br so little was i prepared for the sheer <UNK> fun and brilliance of <UNK> br br easily mr <UNK> best work since jackie brown it is a triumph br br yes the references are there but they do not <UNK> with the story they are not the driving force yes eli roth is stunt casting but he works fine with little to do but look aggressive and does nothing to hurt the film as i had feared while i admired mr tarantino for using <UNK> <UNK> bell as herself in death proof in order to <UNK> up the <UNK> of the major stunt scene her lack of any acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film the same could be said of <UNK> own appearances in several films especially robert from <UNK> till dawn which tarantino wrote br br what really makes this work is how big it is the spaghetti western vibe to much of the style dialogue and performances is wonderfully over the top without <UNK> too far into the cartoon quality of kill bill the violence is so big the <UNK> so big brad pitt is so big in the trailers the hitler moment and <UNK> performance bothered me but in the context of the film they are hilarious pitt is actually brilliant here exactly what he needs to be he is <UNK> samurai in <UNK> he is <UNK> <UNK> from once upon a time in the west there is a very james coburn vibe to him and of course a suitably lee marvin edge br br <UNK> <UNK> who i did not previously known and <UNK> <UNK> who i first noticed in a brilliant french language british short film by sean <UNK> are sensational and i expect to see both used a lot more in the future tarantino has clearly not lost his eye for casting which seemed to desert him in death proof <UNK> is equally large in his performance chilling yet theatrical he is fonda from van <UNK> from good the bad the ugly and <UNK> is suitably <UNK> innocence but tough a fighter they both <UNK> here br br that every member of the cast gets the fun to be had from what they are doing while not <UNK> themselves in just having fun and trying to get laughs helps tremendously the laughs and there are loads come <UNK> only mike myers comes close to <UNK> the <UNK> and pushing it too far but his scene is <UNK> in just enough with the help of a fantastic michael who seems pulled directly from the mold of <UNK> great escape leader br br all the actors shine and tarantino throws in wonderful <UNK> but ones that work with the story the introduction of hugo is a riot after a sensational slow burn opening and a glorious intro to those <UNK> the pace never lets up and over two and half hours flies by br br it also looks beautiful <UNK> this as a return to real film making rather than just self indulgent silliness the musical choices as always are inspired from <UNK> on br br the film is <UNK> and hilarious after a summer when nearly every film has disappointed me it came as a huge surprise that the real fun and entertaining but also involving and impressive film should be this one when i would never have believed it from script form welcome back <UNK>
<START> all in all an excellent movie from that time and source coming from warner brothers as it was <UNK> in <UNK> and style just before wwii provided you don't take it at all seriously the movie really makes no claim to being historically accurate and is certainly no more or less accurate or believable than say <UNK> this one may actually be more honest about it though as it essentially admits along the way that it's not to be taken as particularly fact based but more of a <UNK> semi heroic portrayal it's worth noting that audiences of the time were no more naive about the story than we are today the ny times review <UNK> that audiences would dismiss factual inaccuracies <UNK> throughout the film described the <UNK> account of <UNK> life as <UNK> and pointed out that the presentation of <UNK> motivations regarding the final events were at odds with various historical accounts they could have really gone overboard in building up <UNK> one <UNK> but they succeed admirably in depicting him as not necessarily the <UNK> or most <UNK> guy around but appropriately determined <UNK> and inspirational br br flynn and <UNK> doing their <UNK> movie together in 7 years and their last are so comfortable together and play off each other so easily at this point that it's not too difficult to overlook how <UNK> their <UNK> is written here with a first time pairing it would be hard to imagine what could really draw elizabeth to <UNK> but these two make it work the movie is also missing their director from their previous seven films together the greatly underrated michael <UNK> but given that he had worked with them on the previous year's similar themed santa <UNK> trail it's understandable if he chose to <UNK> out of this one they all started together with captain blood and the charge of the light <UNK> both terrific so we can't really blame them if they started having a tough time keeping it all fresh br br <UNK> walsh the director here is certainly more comfortable with the action sequences which are outstanding and everything else <UNK> the interior scenes are a little more uneven but the studio <UNK> succeed in <UNK> for that very well as does warner <UNK> outstanding cast of usual suspects and new faces <UNK> gene <UNK> anthony quinn arthur kennedy etc i would have liked it better if <UNK> character had been a bit less standard i generally like his work but here he seems to be hitting roughly the same notes in every scene the part could have been better written and i suppose they might have been unsure of what he could handle as he'd only been in films for one year walsh probably took him for this after doing high <UNK> together br br various highlights include the depiction probably imagined of the <UNK> of as the <UNK> theme the last half hour is particularly outstanding especially with the <UNK> of the leads <UNK> the end of their screen <UNK> followed by the final battle scenes a thoroughly rousing adventure br br 8 of 10
<START> i was lucky enough to grow up surfing in san diego not the biggest waves in the world but it was a hell of childhood i'll tell you that and i have seen a lot of so called <UNK> flicks in my life after watching north shore for the first time just now all i can say is thank god i never saw this as a kid if i had seen this and <UNK> thought that this was a realistic portrayal of the surf scene i would sold my board and totally gotten into i don't know <UNK> or something br br seriously this movie has a as much in common with real surfing as top gun has was real military life the acting is terrible the music is worse the cinematography is <UNK> at best and oh my god what was <UNK> thinking wow do not see this movie it sucks if you want a real surf flick see riding giants hell watch <UNK> up instead of this seriously sucks sucks bad sucks real bad br br ps had to change my <UNK> from wtf to wtf because apparently we are supposed to <UNK> on this site no yelling d
<START> usually i have a lot of luck with these small scale movies i looked at the cast <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> how bad could it be unfortunately the answer was pretty bad i have a hard time remembering a movie that had such poor execution of a plot that had potential
<START> martin lawrence is not a funny man i he just has too much on his mind and he is too mad which <UNK> his <UNK> pretty early in the game he tries to make fun of critics which <UNK> down to f them then he goes on to rather primitive sexual jokes on <UNK> with throat cancer and it just goes downhill from there 3 10
<START> i saw this movie with very low expectations i didn't know a lot about it so i wasn't sure if it was going to be worth it br br the story did an ok job of getting you curious about these ruins they travel to the suspense continues when the <UNK> show up and force them to stay at the ruins br br then the movie turns from somewhat suspenseful to pointless the amount of gore found in this movie did not balance out compared to whether it was truly necessary or used more for shock value br br the fact that they didn't make any attempt to fight the <UNK> from hell they had fire and didn't try to burn it nor did they try to cut it with a knife to see if they could destroy it or not they quickly jumped into a victim role and their helpless attitude was not real it reminded me of the old horror movies where the people just scream and yell and don't have half a brain to try to fight back
<START> that was one of the lines in a trailer about this film and for once the <UNK> did not <UNK> all six of the featured players here are on the screen 99 of the time so they have to be good br br it's always fascinating how certain plot premises can be worked for either comedy to a deadly serious situation mary <UNK> of the <UNK> and charlie of the <UNK> play their usual characters who are planning to <UNK> all the way to california to share <UNK> they <UNK> for someone to share the ride they get burns and allen and a monster of a dog that same premise was a deadly serious one several generations later in kalifornia br br of course if you're traveling with <UNK> allen you know you're going to be going absolutely nuts trying to figure her monty reasoning about the whole world and if that ain't enough you get to run into w c fields part time sheriff and full time pool hustler who's living in sin with alison but back then we didn't delve into such things br br a real classic comedy from the thirties not to be missed
<START> i watched this film recently for the first time in over 30 years and was very pleasantly surprised i remembered a film that caught the mood and feel of britain in the mid 1960s without falling into the <UNK> clichés that so many other films thought they had to <UNK> my memory proved correct those who feel that this is like a tv play are not entirely wrong but while <UNK> newman was to become famous for <UNK> tv drama this film is more in the tradition of the <UNK> such as <UNK> night and sunday <UNK> but with an emphasis on middle class rather than working class life rod <UNK> is excellent as the middle aged angst ridden lead <UNK> married to a repressed and apparently <UNK> wife claire bloom the <UNK> of the is the the backdrop for the drama in which old values and are challenged this is the stage for the central character played by judy <UNK> a role which at the time was a shocking departure from the typical <UNK> behaviour of contemporary <UNK> the <UNK> of roles with the girl rating her <UNK> in a little black book was a <UNK> to the feminist movement and was <UNK> at the time for promoting <UNK> among young girls the irony of these criticisms is to be seen in both claire <UNK> and peggy characters who are both <UNK> peter hall made few films and on this evidence that is a great shame <UNK> is <UNK> and wholly credible showing why he was so highly regarded
<START> a bland title <UNK> this <UNK> example of old fashioned hollywood entertainment this film proves a largely successful <UNK> of several <UNK> elements a period piece a romantic drama a crime movie and a political thriller interestingly though made by fox its protagonists  robert taylor and barbara stanwyck  were both usually associated with other studios their on screen chemistry here is <UNK> and eventually led to marriage in a couple of <UNK> time while a bit too young taylor is a dashing hero a marine personally <UNK> by president <UNK> to <UNK> the <UNK> behind an organized clean up of numerous banks <UNK> no sooner has he <UNK> them down led by smooth brian <UNK> and <UNK> victor mclaglen that he falls for a <UNK> naturally stanwyck who has thrown her lot with the gang  although truth be told singing is far from being the <UNK> <UNK> similarly apart from having to prove his worth to make it into their <UNK> he has to <UNK> with mclaglen for <UNK> <UNK> by the way the practical joker persona of the former reminded me a lot of <UNK> chase in sons of the desert 1933 which incidentally was likewise directed by william a later on taylor is in two minds about involving stanwyck in the impending bait and tries to offer his <UNK> to the president while <UNK> with the girl  but the jealous rival <UNK> his plans the robbery gone awry we find <UNK> dead and the other two in jail <UNK> hopes for <UNK>  having meanwhile learned the identity of the <UNK> and obviously prominent <UNK> man'  are seemingly <UNK> when the president winds up <UNK> himself a great plot twist though the resulting <UNK> hour suspense feels contrived to get back to the film's <UNK> of styles even if the vaudeville sequences are a matter of taste the romantic triangle slows things up and it somewhat on the thriller aspect this emerges a handsome production indeed  with the actors already mentioned <UNK> supported by the likes of john carradine who <UNK> disappears after just one scene douglas <UNK> and as two american <UNK> sidney the <UNK> theodore <UNK> and frank <UNK> <UNK>
<START> being warner <UNK> second historical drama featuring civil war and battle of the little big horn general george armstrong <UNK> they died with their boots on warner brothers 1941 was the far more accurate of the two especially when <UNK> with santa <UNK> trail warner brothers 1940 which really didn't set the bar very high br br although both pictures were starring vehicles for errol flynn there was a change in the casting the part of general <UNK> whereas it was dutch himself ronald reagan portraying the flamboyant <UNK> <UNK> in the earlier picture with mr flynn playing and later <UNK> hero general j e b or <UNK> stuart errol took on the <UNK> part for they died with their boots on br br once again the warner <UNK> <UNK> for using a large number of reliable character actors from the <UNK> <UNK> company are employed in giving the film a sort of authenticity and all is really happening right before our very own eyes major roles are taken by some better known actors and actresses such as elizabeth bacon mrs <UNK> co star olivia de <UNK> ned <UNK> arthur kennedy samuel bacon gene <UNK> chief crazy horse anthony quinn charlie major stanley general phillip sheridan john <UNK> the <UNK> maid <UNK> <UNK> br br the rest of the cast is just chock full of uncredited though skilled players such as joe <UNK> <UNK> parker minor watson <UNK> andrews irving bacon roy lane chandler spencer <UNK> frank <UNK> francis ford william forrest george russell <UNK> william hopper hooper eddie <UNK> fred <UNK> sam <UNK> patrick <UNK> frank eddie parker <UNK> richards ray <UNK> jim all american himself <UNK> <UNK> dick <UNK> gig young and many many more br br the film moves very quickly particularly in the early goings then sort of slows down out of necessity as the story moves along to the post civil war years the assignment of <UNK> as a colonel in the <UNK> <UNK> and the ultimate destiny at the little big horn in montana under the <UNK> of director griffith veteran <UNK> walsh the film hits a greatly varied array of emotions from the very serious exciting battle scenes and convincing historical scenes looking as if they were matthew brady civil war photos as with most any of mr <UNK> films he <UNK> and the end of many a scene with a little humor but not going overboard and thus <UNK> the chance of turning the film into a comedy farce actually br br as previously mentioned this is much more factual than its predecessor santa <UNK> trail last time we'll mention it honest <UNK> honor however that is not to say that it wasn't without a few little bits of artistic and literary license as indeed just about any biopic will have it would be impossible to make any similar type of film if indeed every fact and incident were to be tried to be included in the screenplay perhaps the most <UNK> inclusion as well as the most obvious of literary license is that business about <UNK> being accidentally promoted to the rank of <UNK> general it just didn't happen that way yet the gag both helped the film to move along while it <UNK> the whole light <UNK> feeling that <UNK> the early part of the film br br director walsh and mr flynn <UNK> in giving us what would seem to be a characterization of this legendary civil war hero that was very close to the real life man and they did this on top of the recreation of an incident being the massacre by the <UNK> the <UNK> and the of <UNK> and his <UNK> <UNK> at the little big horn at the time of its <UNK> june 25 <UNK> <UNK> last stand was as big an incident and shock to the <UNK> national psyche as were the japanese attack on pearl harbor december 7 1941 or the atrocities <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> to new <UNK> twin trade towers and the united <UNK> armed <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> virginia on september 11 2002 br br just as so many films of that period of world war ii and the years immediately before there were so many incidents in it that were if not intentionally done were <UNK> of virtues that would be needed in time of another global conflict such as we were in by the time of they died with their boots on was finishing up its original theatrical release period br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i hate this movie i have never seen such utter complete trash in my life i live in france so it turned out that i was in the front line to watch this awful movie at first it seemed cool kind of like something about a cursed forest that <UNK> people unfortunately it turned out it was something quite different a good start with a girl that meets a guy and all that <UNK> then the girl gets threatening messages in the form of <UNK> shut up in her bathroom closet ludicrous from that bit and on the movie starts to slide downhill very quickly with a lot of desperate <UNK> in the process the movie ends with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and ancient ugly <UNK> creatures coming back from the past to kill a few people many questions were <UNK> around my head by then why the heck did they bring back that <UNK> monster do <UNK> look like <UNK> dressed in <UNK> why did they even bother making this movie the climax of the movie was so goofy i laughed all the way through it the awful <UNK> monster does battle with the two young women who appear to be expert kung fu masters and the professor gets <UNK> in two or something what surprised me was that the monster was so slow and <UNK> in battle wasn't it supposed to be a god of war or something anyway the movie in it's death throws was a pitiful sight a brief of the <UNK> of this movie kung fu mayhem <UNK> stones mysterious murders <UNK> la thriller ancient <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> old clumsy war god nutty professor complete and utter <UNK> worm eaten <UNK> <UNK> recycled fake wannabe ludicrous sh t things i learned from this movie ancient war gods are lousy at kung fu all young women who study <UNK> at university in france are kung fu experts <UNK> are so <UNK> they can survive being <UNK> in two by a saw mass without any <UNK>
<START> this is my first comment on a movie in here i have to say that of all the bad films i ever seen including <UNK> for an example this is really worse i promise don't even look at it it is boring bad acting bad script and plot bad effects the whole movie is one big piece of crap if i could i would give 0 stars out of 10 but since the lowest is 1 which is awful i need to vote that but i would say the movie is worse than awful br br don't pain yourself by seeing this movie and hoping it will get better because i can tell you already now it wont i hoped that there might would come one single scene which would be worth watching there didn't came any good scene at all br br what an excellent piece of crap br br and <UNK> as a vampire lol <UNK>

<START> eight teen <UNK> are brought to the abandoned <UNK> hotel to clean it out as community service they soon discover that it's the <UNK> of a <UNK> psychopath kane who has a thing for pulling out and collecting <UNK> it doesn't help that the guard watching over them steven has had a previous run in with the beast four years earlier br br a guilty pleasure of mine are slasher films most of them are poorly directed and acted but they still hold some appeal and entertainment value see no evil is a good example of this it features atrocious writing and acting but the death scenes are pretty good and the movie proves to be entertaining the premise sounds like a mixture between friday the 13th saw 2 and halloween <UNK> i really liked the idea but it didn't work out too well it was really just a bunch of clichés and everything was predictable screenwriter dan <UNK> just focused on the death scenes and nothing else apparently the death scenes themselves are pretty good and gruesome director gregory dark did a good job with them and he came up with some creative kills br br the acting is pretty bland and <UNK> this is because all of the characters are one dimensional and we don't know much about them it was hard to feel for these people because they were pretty unlikable kane is surprisingly mediocre i was expecting his on screen presence to be scarier but he didn't do that good of a job a second rate jason <UNK> if you will the rest of the actors are relatively unknown and this film will probably neither help nor hurt their careers br br while the death scenes are gory they aren't necessary scary there's really no suspense just some gory death scenes because of this the movie doesn't hold much of a repeat value also if you don't like slasher films then don't waste your time with this one it will do little to change your opinion in the end see no evil is a decent slasher film but it is generic and forgettable so it's not exactly worth watching rating 6 10
<START> i'm <UNK> and <UNK> by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of black snake <UNK> it's not about black white relationships or old young relationships though i think director craig <UNK> deliberately threw in both elements to <UNK> imagined <UNK> it's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction though christina <UNK> character <UNK> <UNK> those it's not about folk religion in the black community though religion plays a large role it's not a love story though there are not one but two happy couples at the end and it's certainly not about the south where everything is <UNK> though it's set in the south and it's undeniably hot holy <UNK> even the tag line writers didn't get the point br br black snake <UNK> is a <UNK> about <UNK> <UNK> blues who feels them who writes them who plays them what they're playing about how it <UNK> them br br it's as though the film producers sat down with a blank <UNK> and asked ok if we were going to help people understand what the blues are really about what would it look like so they set it in the rural south then they dream up two characters one whose wife left him to live with his best friend the other who goes off to war and his badly abused girl sleeps with everybody in town then we throw in <UNK> <UNK> touched just a little by folk religion they know jesus wants their lives and though they respect him they know they can't give him that some violence between men and women and lots and lots of steamy sexual images including ready to go over the top a black man in a <UNK> holding a half naked white girl captive on the end of a 40 <UNK> chain fill it with authentic <UNK> blues sounds make it about a genuine blues <UNK> use music as the main healing element in the plot slap clips of blues man son house on both ends and <UNK> you have a modern <UNK> about what the blues are all about even the film's climax is not character conflict but the whole town dancing steamy dances to hot raunchy blues br br of course there's a bit of a dilemma here <UNK> <UNK> is being destroyed by <UNK> lust and is being <UNK> by jackson's <UNK> religion and and don't forget the chain but then we're shown the restored <UNK> dancing <UNK> to blues at the end is this an expression of a restored healthy life force or just more of the same trashy behavior that ruined her in the first place <UNK> wants it both ways but blues really is about sex and violence not to mention depression i suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both sex and violence without <UNK> either i have my doubts br br not for the first time samuel l jackson plays so well that we forget we're watching samuel l jackson the man is unbelievably good he even picks some of his own tunes in the film and his playing is authentic dirty and hot christina <UNK> isn't usually this good either granted half her job is done by the costume that wasn't there and her <UNK> figure but she's a marvelous combination of cynical lust rebellion and vulnerability bravo to her she's arrived i was impressed by the country preacher john jr i had to check the <UNK> to assure myself that he's a professional actor and not a genuine country minister br br parents need to be aware of what they're getting if their kids bring this one home the language is pretty far off the <UNK> the first half hour is full of graphic sex and women are <UNK> in a dozen ways during the course of the film <UNK> means well and is decent but honestly <UNK> a woman to the <UNK> plus <UNK> spends half the movie dressed for sex if you've got teenage boys they'll be <UNK> the screen halfway into the film i don't recommend this for kids of any age adults only please br br that being said black snake <UNK> is informative and accurate about blues folk religion and sexual abuse and tells a tale that's <UNK> in lots of ways it's <UNK> but well worth the time and my goodness is the sound track hot
<START> while i understood that this show is too weird to please everybody i don't get where all these bad reviews come from and i'm most surprised over the bad reviews that it has gotten from fans of the movies i liked it and got hooked on it since the first episode i watched it's a little messed up though that was put into school and it seems to be high school rather than college but i guess he's only <UNK> right so it's not like he's too old to get educated and haven't the <UNK> always had to get the best education to them so the has to graduate or he won't become emperor thing doesn't sound too weird for me and i guess his education was neglected before so that's why he has to be educated now
<START> this is a very amazing movie the characters seemed so realistic to me it was hard to believe they weren't real people being from the south i thought <UNK> character seemed especially real and as everyone else has mentioned she does an outstanding acting job the characters are not beautiful and look nothing like the average hollywood stars their <UNK> bodies and personalities seem so much more natural and real br br one reviewer mentioned that the main character alice had no good reason to run away from home which is true she didn't have any moral or <UNK> reason to run away such as escaping child abuse etc i thought that she was just fed up with dead end jobs in a working class life and wanted to flee down to florida where her friend lived the appealing and <UNK> life of a college student in miami the actress shows <UNK> confusion <UNK> and questioning turn into and <UNK> to take control of her life with impressive <UNK> the film also shows how alice is trapped in situations with seemingly no <UNK> causing her to panic take action and reach out for help br br at first the grainy filming style put me off and made me think that it was a very low budget or <UNK> movie but in <UNK> it is very well done the home movie quality really makes you feel like you are there with the characters a part of their <UNK> trip across the country this is definitely a film worth seeing although i don't quite understand all the <UNK> of it as a heart warming coming of age tale it is rather vulgar and disturbing at times even if it is not completely sad in the end
<START> first i have to say that i don't like since fiction movies at all so much but there are some movies i liked really this is one of the others i've the same opinion like some most others here the film is still going on in my back but the few effects are really not enough to watch the whole time i think what they have done well are the animated <UNK> with 3 <UNK> and 4 <UNK> but its the only i liked there are no intelligent dialogs are there but its a great film for everybody who loves lara <UNK> or some other girls in hot pants br br for the directors stop to try again please
<START> this is one for the golden turkey book it's another of those putting on a show flicks the dialogue is turgid the music is terrible the costumes may be the worst ever and the nick castle choreography is hilariously dreadful check it out oh <UNK> who love bad flicks only perry <UNK> is tolerable
<START> not finding the right words is everybody's problem in this vaudeville type urban comedy they don't know what to say and they don't know how to say it which is why they <UNK> on the potentially <UNK> enterprise of pre arranged speed dating unfortunately they all come across as cardboard characters rather than real people the story follows a conventional three act structure getting to know the <UNK> cast in their sorry single lives the actual dating circuit and a final stretch of romantic <UNK> <UNK> some of the new found <UNK> <UNK> because it's all so predictable i'd say that as a narrative is a failure as a comedy most of the time it's too goofy to be really funny thumbs up to von she stands out from the soap opera crowd as the <UNK> <UNK> wealthy <UNK> great makeup on her too heavy eye shadow meets skin tone lip <UNK> creating a brooding and <UNK> yet <UNK> effect thumbs up also to <UNK> as the <UNK> love machine and as the hot they <UNK> the communication challenge by way of the timeless body language of <UNK>
<START> i love this movie i know some people might say that it was not a great movie but i really disagree the comedy is classic mel brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen this was my first exposure to cary <UNK> and dave and what a first impression they made cary <UNK> shines as robin hood the only british robin hood mind you he has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film dave is obviously much bigger now but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as the characters were all very well planned out and all added their own little quirks to the movie i highly recommend that you rent this movie and enjoy it with a nice bowl of popcorn and some close friends
<START> or better yet watch <UNK> if you want to see a really intelligent and funny male college age road flick rolling kansas sounded promising in fact the program guide gave it 2 5 out of 4 stars which usually means it's fairly watchable but i pretty much fast <UNK> through it usually road trip movies have great music but i can't even recall whether there was music the only high point was a small role with rip torn as a wise old <UNK> guru otherwise the jokes and timing missed all along the way the four main characters are unknown actors and i don't remember seeing any of them in another movie oh yeah i see that hayden church was in it but he's in everything good bad or indifferent this movie is about as funny as watching someone else stoned when you're not
<START> as many of today's movies are guilty of the plot isn't exactly stellar the movie doesn't move anyone and certainly this won't warrant any award outside of perhaps but then again who really cares br br eddie murphy and robert de niro team up to produce a very funny at times hilarious movie that i really enjoyed russo and shatner played their small parts well as well man i hope in the future my wife ages as well as miss <UNK> has br br moving along this buddy cop flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time the movie is enjoyable enough to avoid the wait for video dvd release and instead to go ahead and check it out br br eddie murphy is at his usual top form and is downright enjoyable to watch de niro has <UNK> into this type of role perfectly br br i really enjoyed this movie and think that any true movie fan in need for a good movie or just a good laugh will really enjoy showtime br br top performance murphy hilarious enough said directing job nice nice action scenes used murphy and de niro together like a charm russo fed off in a nice supporting job br br my rating 7 out 10 it's not going to move you or anything but it's an extremely enjoyable movie br br it's showtime was a great success
<START> paranoid park is about alex a 16 year old <UNK> who causes the death even if accidentally of a security guard as the movie goes on alex deals with little issues like his <UNK> divorce and the sexual heat of his girlfriend jennifer played by taylor <UNK> who you can currently see in <UNK> girl while he's consumed by guilt i had seen just one movie by gus van <UNK> so far elephant and i can assure you that he kept all his mannerisms while doing this one once again he crosses time lines once again he uses weird filming techniques like the never ending shots of people walking maybe you like these filming techniques i know i don't the plot feels <UNK> to me its almost to simple to be explored for such a long time the feeling i get same with elephant is that gus van <UNK> tries too hard to make an artistic movie which causes the movie itself to loose substance also <UNK> was pretty bad as alex there's a difference between looking <UNK> or detached and looking like a robot if you're a fan of mr van <UNK> then watch this otherwise skip it br br 3 10
<START> lets get one thing out of the way i am a huge bruce campbell fan i have the evil dead series have the action figures and have seen <UNK> ho <UNK> i am a fan of cheesy laughable horror flicks and know how to appreciate the whole it's so bad it's good deal br br i wish i could say the same about this movie i watched this movie with high expectations i wanted it to be good campy something from the <UNK> we have all come to know and love it started out promising enough but after the first 20 minutes i <UNK> to watching the rest of this sorry excuse of a movie as if i had just been shot with <UNK> <UNK> br br the idea itself isn't a bad one two men don't get along both killed by the same psycho woman half of one man's brain is <UNK> into the other's head they argue disagree and the comedy ensues br br what killed me is how extremely <UNK> and boring it was it had potential even as a camp flick to be so much better than it was the plot was boring even <UNK> zany physical slap stick couldn't make it work br br <UNK> cannot even properly express the ridiculous robot that <UNK> wife's brain ends up getting put into easily the worst looking robot i have ever seen anywhere even for a b movie the whole idea is dumb br br what the hell was going through <UNK> mind when he made this steaming pile is beyond me why ted <UNK> didn't go running to his big brother asking him to slap some sense into bruce and not to mention some lessons about making an enjoyable movie on a budget is beyond me br br shame on you bruce
<START> finally third time lucky this film has been always been on my mind but my first viewing i forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film then only a couple months later i had the my second chance of watching of it so i decided i would record it only to discover that my <UNK> went off late and again i missed the first half of the flick i wasn't going to allow that to happen again so when it came on tv again i thought <UNK> it i'll wait until it comes on then i will record it and it was a good choice i would have just watched the film but they always put on around midnight br br after discovering a hole in their crowded cell nine prisoners escape their <UNK> to track down the key of the universe which a fellow prisoner known as the <UNK> king said he had hidden they think that this key could be an opening for a hidden <UNK> of <UNK> bills on this journey they naturally see this as an opportunity to pick up their lives before they were although things don't turn out the way that they intended to with most of the criminals plans going <UNK> br br 9 souls is an <UNK> spiritual journey from japanese director which <UNK> it's viewers into a film of two totally different <UNK> the first half of the story plays out more like a <UNK> comedy with the criminals bonds and the situations they find themselves being the selling point but all that makes way to a <UNK> and consequence drama packed second half where the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments replacing the <UNK> tone it started off with while the first half is quite amusing with its on the road screwball <UNK> and offbeat banter but it's really the genuinely haunting latter half with it's peculiar turn of events that hit you so hard with some surprising touches that make you really <UNK> for these very human characters even though they are not truly innocent from their crimes you just become <UNK> by these flesh out characters in the first half that when you see them spiral into their downfall you know it's an effective drama when you become shell shocked in the dramatic change the nine characters get enough screen time to truly understand their personal story and what weakness would eventually bring them down the way the plot works out is that and are the lead characters and we mostly see it from their perspectives the <UNK> tale is an <UNK> engaging character study that's clear in it's goal and puts to you many questions on society and the path you choice to take to escape life and free yourself from these <UNK> br br while the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly told the visual element doesn't go by <UNK> because there's just a dreamy and <UNK> like vibe that channels itself into the unique atmosphere what highly contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift was the <UNK> moody <UNK> rock soundtrack the <UNK> atmospheric <UNK> it was able to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the <UNK> emotions it was able to <UNK> simply beautiful and downright powerful control on that front the pacing for such an long film 2 hours seems to <UNK> by and editing is <UNK> done because we are just so wrapped up in it all the hypnotic photography is crisp in detail while the performances by the cast as a odd bunch of criminals are that of high quality with each one providing enough personality and features to separate themselves br br i found 9 souls to be a pleasing and quite an amazing surreal film that <UNK> up the emotions and then it <UNK> you with an almighty <UNK> when it changes direction highly recommended
<START> family guy has been hilarious for so long but i feel like it lost it's sharp and random humor at the start of season 6 although i enjoyed blue <UNK> it felt like the remaining episodes were <UNK> up episodes where the producers made little attempt to fulfill family guy's reputation of american social satire br br i have seen all the episodes from season 7 and i was utterly surprised and happy that family guy has found their true colors again season 7 delivers a lot of fantastic episodes and with a lot of jokes about the current situations in america which is exactly what we need right now more fun br br i feel that the simpsons has lost its spark all together this show however has made a terrific <UNK> from going down to proving how perfectly satirical they can be great job
<START> this is the worst film i've seen in a long long time never mind the fact that so many useful things keep appearing on this island how convenient the acting is beyond poor from the outset its like one of those really badly scripted soft porn films on channel 5 a complete waste of time and i cant remember the lead actors name but i cant believe he still gets work i've never seen him act i've seen him in lots of films but i've never seen him act here are a few of the <UNK> obvious errors apparently <UNK> <UNK> still work even when they've been <UNK> in sea water also according to this film you can walk into the sea naked but come out wearing bikini <UNK> i'm guessing the camera man and editor were students there are plenty more errors but i'm <UNK> now besides its no so much the errors as the cast the script and the whole film avoid at all costs
<START> this comment <UNK> north and south book i dealing with <UNK> period br br the 19th century history of the usa is mostly identified by people with the civil war <UNK> <UNK> this is a reasonable opinion because that was civil war which put the union under the severe test that was the civil war which made americans realize how precious it is to live in peace finally that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery br br from the birth of motion pictures there were people who adapted that time onto screen d w griffith in the early <UNK> made his unforgettable birth of a nation yet the most famous film about the north south clash is still i suppose gone with the wind 1938 unfortunately fewer people know the magnificent tv series based on john novel north and south it is the very best tv series ever made and the time spent on watching it is really precious i taped it on my video from polish tv many years ago and have come back to it with great pleasure many times since then why br br firstly the entire story is deeply <UNK> in historical reality the two families the from south <UNK> and the <UNK> from <UNK> represent two entirely different ways of life in spite of that friendship <UNK> them yet what they experience is the struggle all people do friendship attacked by truth of political correctness love attacked by hatred of legal <UNK> <UNK> by strength of social heroes <UNK> <UNK> patrick <UNK> is my beloved character someone who finds love and who is quickly <UNK> of her someone who cares for friends but political fanatics step in the way and ruin much finally he is someone who can see the tragic future for his land but there is nothing he can do about the <UNK> fate his friend george <UNK> is similar in most aspects but sometimes he appears to have a stronger character it is him who shows <UNK> that although there are <UNK> he must get up from despair and live since life is the most precious thing we have although they represent two different <UNK> their friendship occurs to be stronger than any prejudice politics or conflicts br br other characters are also particularly well developed there are villains like justin or <UNK> jones who are really wicked but most of the people are ambiguous as the nature of humanity has always been charles <UNK> is at first full of rebellion prone to fighting later however he learns to be a true southern gentleman for whom southern pride is not courageous words but foremost courageous deeds <UNK> represents the most <UNK> side of movement <UNK> to <UNK> slavery and <UNK> the owners of black <UNK> <UNK> her marriage with grady appears to be a symbol of <UNK> but also a symbol of saying no to the politics of the south two interesting characters are sisters brett and <UNK> sisters in whose <UNK> runs entirely opposite blood brett in her <UNK> but also <UNK> believes in absolute <UNK> she marries billy even though he is a because she truly loves him brett is the representation of all that is precious in any young woman <UNK> however is a <UNK> a <UNK> a woman who does not hesitate to do the most wicked things the clear picture of their world views clash is their chat about men and family unforgettable moment and how universal most characters head for their values yet war breaks out and they'll have to put aside a lot br br secondly the performances someone said that not all people act naturally i wouldn't say that i'd rather say that all cast do very good jobs in their parts from the main characters who are portrayed by younger staff to the guests that consist of famous stars including liz taylor robert mitchum and others patrick <UNK> as <UNK> does a great job i consider this role one of his best ones <UNK> anne down as madeleine is also very memorable her part perhaps <UNK> too much suffering but she manages to express all sorts of feelings really well <UNK> alley is very appealing and truly memorable as the <UNK> phillip <UNK> is worth consideration as horribly ambitious bent as well as david carradine as a monster husband disgusting justin and in contrast to him a mention must be made of jean simmons who is truly excellent as mother whose heart beats for the glory of family life and of union br br <UNK> memorable moments of north and south leave an trace in one's mind who can forget the first meeting of <UNK> and madeleine what charm what <UNK> there is in this scene or is it possible to skip the moment when <UNK> father dies i found it really powerful there is a real drama in this moment a drama of a woman being left by someone who really loved her i also liked sequence and george <UNK> so worried about the life of his <UNK> friend <UNK> then his <UNK> with <UNK> are terrific speech in philadelphia is a masterpiece of performance and the final moment of the first part although north and south may separate their friendship will never die <UNK> and george <UNK> join hands as the train moves on simply there are so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it's impossible to mention even half of them here and these gorgeous tunes by bill <UNK> and shot in brilliant landscapes the music in north and south is very touching and memorable br br what to say in the end north and south is a real must have on dvd simply an amazing tv series about the victory of all that is precious in us love friendship loyalty honor <UNK> absolute <UNK> 9 10
<START> this movie is one of my all time favorites i have watched it probably 100 times literally and it is still funny to me it seems that every time i watch it i see something different mel brooks is definitely the all time king of side splitting comedy
<START> minor spoilers i just wanted to say that for anyone who likes entertaining baseball films this is definitely in my top three only little big league and major league can compete with this one in my mind i would also like to <UNK> the writers of this film for creating such enjoyable dialogue without being too specific i would say that the lines are very fitting for each character tom <UNK> seemed to have no problem creating a realistic character as a <UNK> his <UNK> towards playing overseas in japan sets the tone for comical yet meaningful interactions with his new team the dragons he must <UNK> to life in japan first you wash then you <UNK> he eventually sees eye to eye with his coach and sets his goals to have that one final season of greatness though in a much different environment than he ever imagined so for any baseball fan or anybody that wants to watch a good baseball movie mr baseball will not let you down
<START> and one only in my opinion br br that reason is margaret <UNK> she is a wonderful actress on stage as well as on the screen we have few chances to see her though i think that's especially true in the united states br br here she plays a sympathetic role not only that but she is also very pretty and meant to be something of a <UNK> br br walter <UNK> does not hold up the tradition of <UNK> performers he is always reliable but he's not much fun he's not a <UNK> or a consequently this seemed to me a talky <UNK> with little action or suspense but check it out for <UNK>
<START> this movie had the biggest advertising campaign any movie ever had in russia epic movie about russian culture great saga of russian spirit endless <UNK> and interviews for me this movie was the biggest disappointment the main character played by <UNK> is a stupid immature boy ready to set up his <UNK> because of a woman who doesn't even look like a lady what is there to admire in the first part of the movie the story doesn't develop at all people's festival scenes look like <UNK> about russian <UNK> br br i respect mr for his previous works both as actor and director but this movie just demonstrates his ambitions to be considered the of russian cinema
<START> not the best of the but not the worst either i honestly feel guilty laughing at this film considering it had to be career <UNK> for all involved yet the acting dialogue preposterous scenarios and the ever present boom <UNK> get to me <UNK> and certainly add to its bad movie charm as much of a linda blair fan i am top or topless <UNK> go to <UNK> <UNK> also special kudos to henry <UNK> who's the only one in the cast who doesn't play his role too seriously viewing the film now though makes me look at stella stevens character more closely she plays the head officer and i have to wonder if this where <UNK> <UNK> decided to adopt her current look and demeanor after all i'm sure she had to look no further than her husband's video collection to find this film not that i'm judging i've seen it several times myself and it all makes me wonder what would've happened if mr <UNK> had been allowed to <UNK> a hot <UNK> in the <UNK> office hmmm
<START> dashing errol flynn brings his usual flair for drama in this historically flawed but entertaining film of the life of george armstrong <UNK> the dashing <UNK> flynn <UNK> <UNK> from his days at west point as a reckless <UNK> <UNK> through the civil war years in an extraordinarily generous and <UNK> interpretation of history and finally as the <UNK> indian fighter whose <UNK> at the little big horn is <UNK> as a sacrifice by <UNK> of his command as a way of exposing the corruption of government officials and post <UNK> as well as a protest of the unfair treatment of the <UNK> indians olivia de <UNK> <UNK> co star in several other films scores as the devoted <UNK> <UNK> bacon and anthony quinn looks the part as the fierce <UNK> chief crazy horse the film's battle scenes are excellent the civil war battles are brief and are shown as several vignettes in which <UNK> seemingly supported by just a handful of troopers <UNK> the <UNK> army into <UNK> <UNK> last fight against the indians is a grand spectacle a savage clash between red men and white with no quarter given in a wild mix of military might between determined fighting men great direction cinematography casting and wonderful music by max <UNK> make this film a hollywood classic
<START> heaven mary and all the saints above a young man has got super <UNK> it's miracle <UNK> call the <UNK> all you ladies out their desperate to get <UNK> line up out side his door and drop your marks and sparks finest <UNK> retro ealing comedy type comedy trying to bring you a bit of the <UNK> irish charm has an effect like placing two fingers down your own throat <UNK> one out of ten
<START> after <UNK> human <UNK> chop and properly <UNK> it i felt <UNK> and <UNK> to inform potential viewers that chewing on this product is no fun and its substance of low value br br according to the dull nature of this film the following is gonna be a warning more than a review this is the first time i wished that there is an i don't care to rate this movie button on imdb because the only reaction to this boring piece of trash is <UNK> and indifference every possible rating would do injustice to all the other items listed here a 10 is out of question anyway 1 might <UNK> some readers that this is one of those cases where it's so bad that it's actually really bad and that's <UNK> and 5 is unsatisfying as well people might think that it's an ok flick and alright if you wanna have some cheesy fun which it is not honest to god it's neither a 10 a zero nor a 5 it's nothing a black hole a <UNK> work conceived by an <UNK> i bought the region 3 dvd which was cheap 7 bucks at least and of good picture quality i bought it mainly because of the positive and promising reviews posted below my own entry oh boy was i to be disappointed this movie is neither shocking nor disgusting nor unnerving nor it's not even laughable it doesn't take itself too serious to be laughed at but still serious enough so as not to be comic a truly amateurish effort the only sequence that i found mildly disturbing is when two <UNK> thugs put an ugly dog in a bag and bash it against a brick wall but even such a cruel premise only lead to a poor execution the further down <UNK> toilet scene is unrealistic and without any sense for suspense suffering or <UNK> the <UNK> look like painted <UNK> <UNK> there is a <UNK> scene at the end of a <UNK> 85 minutes where three men dressed in plastic a setup which one finds also depicted on the front cover of the dvd start to <UNK> of the female body reminded me of american psycho and shallow grave now these flicks are worth watching and true masterpieces br br let's be realistic for once and not rush to make a myth out of every asian wannabe scary movie as seems to happen lately br br if you are looking out for some eastern horror then try danny lee's masterpiece of the very same english title <UNK> <UNK> fan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> human <UNK> chop it's from 1992 and has not without reason i might add been compared to henry portrait of a serial killer there is also a similar film telling the same story by a different film crew called <UNK> <UNK> fu there is a secret in my soup of the same year sort of a rival production it's available as a region 3 dvd and by most regarded as superior to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sang <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i might add a few more words on the special effects what special effects there are a few chopped off limbs they look awful in a wrong sense probably made in hong kong br br that's about all the info i can share on this subject hopefully it will prove helpful enjoy your meal
<START> this film is supposedly about three young idealistic people two of whom join the movement and blah blah it is really just another film about some beautiful rich people trying to decide who they should bed next the <UNK> and and the political struggles of the era merely serve as a <UNK> backdrop literally as we don't hear the villagers say a word never mind learn anyone's name thus they <UNK> the same <UNK> as the in old hollywood films the movie is also dull and the story does not actually get us anywhere except to various <UNK> we are apparently supposed to admire the of it all which merely means no good song and dance routine which would not have saved the film of course but might have at least the boredom br br my friend was annoyed at the <UNK> of the whole story not the bedroom bit but the whole <UNK> of the story the message seems to be that ideals are not worth pursuing
<START> i've been looking forward to the release of this movie since i first heard the concept two years ago and i was not disappointed i won't bother <UNK> the story since everyone else has but i will say that it was just plain entertaining throughout the performances were great as was the music and the main characters were likeable br br my only complaints are 1 the story was definitely lacking the movie wrapped up very abruptly in fact the writing became pretty <UNK> in the second half as though the writers weren't sure what to do with the plot since the plot wasn't nearly as important as the music and the action this didn't really affect the entertainment value of the film so this is not as major a complaint as it would seem br br 2 this is really <UNK> but the music that the characters in the movie were listening to was sometimes dated after 1985 when the movie was set devil inside was from 1987 and <UNK> are you ready was from 1990 among other mistakes this bothers me a bit since they obviously went to <UNK> to make a good period piece they could have checked the <UNK> date on these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier again not a big deal br br oh i thought of something else that was strange the steel dragon band members were supposed to be english but for some reason <UNK> jeff and <UNK> <UNK> played band members and they each had a couple of speaking lines in american accents that was kind of lazy also but it was still cool to see actual musicians playing musicians so i will forgive that as well br br i could probably <UNK> all day but i don't want to give the impression that this wasn't a super entertaining movie i will probably buy the dvd when it comes out and i will certainly buy the soundtrack cd simply for the six steel dragon songs some of which were sung by the singer from the band if you remember them the highlight of the film was possibly a great <UNK> where mark <UNK> is to a rock song on stage and suddenly someone plays good <UNK> by <UNK> mark and the funky bunch the surprised look of <UNK> face is priceless classic rock and roll flick score 8 10 due to extreme entertainment
<START> i love exotic science fiction fantasy movies but this one was very unpleasant to watch <UNK> and images of child abuse <UNK> bodies live or dead other gruesome scenes plot holes boring acting made this a experience the basic idea of entering another person's mind is not even new to the movies or tv an outer limits episode was better at exploring this idea i gave it 4 10 since some special effects were nice
<START> the white warrior is definitely one of if not steve reeves weakest films set in 18th or 19th century russia steve plays a warrior who tries to over run a mad man russian <UNK> by running up a mountain side with his rebel band in a goofy looking russian white <UNK> for the most part the great reeves <UNK> is hidden in a goofy <UNK> length <UNK> with an even more <UNK> looking russian hat br br the action is rather minimal with only a good wrestling scene from the mid <UNK> up that shows off the great reeves <UNK> this is an apparent attempt by the producers to move reeves out of the sword and <UNK> genre into another historic era with poor results the dialogue from the script is hard to understand at various points and only commentary from the narrator allows the viewer to understand what is really happening from scene to scene i would image reeves <UNK> making this film but in an attempt to try and get out of his <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> armor it helped launch him to other historic characters such as morgan the pirate and the thief of <UNK>
<START> a special unit of four police detectives are <UNK> justice in their own unique way in 1950s los angeles nick nolte plays max hoover the <UNK> lead officer and his partners are played by michael madsen <UNK> <UNK> and chris penn also starring are <UNK> griffith jennifer <UNK> and john <UNK> among others quite an impressive list of names unfortunately that is the only thing even remotely impressive about this film br br our story begins when young allison pond played by <UNK> turns up dead in a remote area of town currently under development our band of four detectives is called in and it is immediately obvious that <UNK> max hoover is going to be taking a very personal interest in this case we will soon find out that allison in addition to knowing hoover quite well was also involved with some rather important military and government types who may have had reason to want her dead but who exactly was involved and why exactly would they want this seemingly harmless woman dead hoover and crew set out to find out sounds like an interesting premise but unfortunately it goes nowhere br br despite the impressive array of names the acting here leaves much to be desired nolte is overacting madsen seems incredibly bored <UNK> and <UNK> come off as caricatures penn has hardly anything to do and griffith is dull as can be by far the best performance is <UNK> in all too fleeting flashback sequences the dialogue throughout the film is forced and wooden the sense of drama you would expect from a mystery of this type is missing altogether nothing dramatic really happens in fact nothing at all seems to happen for the bulk of the picture instead we just <UNK> along towards a rather ludicrous and incredibly disappointing climax when the mystery is solved you may find yourself saying oh come on now is that all there is but it gets worse as after the mystery is solved we get a completely ridiculous and utterly unbelievable action sequence and even then we are made to suffer further as another awful badly acted completely unnecessary scene is tacked on at the end and then mercifully it is over and not a moment too soon
<START> this is a very realistic movie it's the most realistic i've seen on urban youth the actors were great i will look out for more films by <UNK> i had never heard of the film until someone mentioned it recently i bought it on dvd i was impressed i haven't seen anything come close to life as i know it in philadelphia this comes real close in fact one scene where there is an accident i won't spoil and give details reminded me of a nearly identical situation in philadelphia at first i thought <UNK> took the scene from that real life event but then i realized that he made the film a few years before that situation i also agree with the point that this film didn't try to <UNK> its appeal by putting in hollywood crap <UNK> also directed laws of gravity i am eager to see it
<START> surprisingly good mean streets type crime drama <UNK> elements of <UNK> and casino joe <UNK> first big role clever dialog i think the <UNK> guide gives this a bomb rating i can only guess no one actually bothered to watch it br br saw this at <UNK> film fest and he said scorsese used a number of these actors in raging bull
<START> this movie tries its <UNK> to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel br br quirky and obnoxious characters a few quirky town with quirky folk a quirky coffee shop or restaurant coffee shop here lots of shots of canadian stuff for <UNK> ocean stuff here lots of mention of gotta get out of this town downright <UNK> br br and it succeeds on all counts br br something to note though i couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post northern exposure quirky comedy or something surreal like a drug induced or psychotic <UNK> the editing of this movie jumped around from one unrelated thing to another with zero pacing or motivation not to mention the fact that half the time we didn't even know where we were jumping take for instance the very opening shots of yelling teens in a car who are they and what the h did they have to do with anything and this sub uh plot use that word plot loosely kids that seem to span generations i don't think they actually do but the editing makes it look like they <UNK> from flashback all of a sudden to current time huh what did i miss br br avoid unless for laughs or you want to try and trip out on the inept editing

<START> what can i say about this movie that hasn't been said hundreds of times before it's an american classic it has <UNK> dozens of <UNK> or none midnight madness is one of kind from the ridiculous opening montage music to the hotel i was hooked leon made us all feel so young and <UNK> one question though how did he have those two hot <UNK> with him all the time and how did have the time money to <UNK> such an event the cast is top notch david <UNK> is at his best here his tight yellow <UNK> is disturbing his little brother michael j fox in his first starring role is a real brat there is also <UNK> love interest and a <UNK> and the obligatory black dude in a <UNK> hat on the yellow team michael j fox does bad things like try and steal <UNK> of beer at the <UNK> blue <UNK> <UNK> and runs away to van team gives us the most comedy what exactly is the deal with the blond on that team is she dating <UNK> or or blade yes the mexican <UNK> name is blade the other guy on the <UNK> team has the best lines of the movie i won't <UNK> them here the meat machine team is a bunch of <UNK> my personal favorite is <UNK> but the silent black man is great too the other two teams are 4 <UNK> and 4 lesbians two of which are <UNK> <UNK> twins br br you know the ending from the start but that doesn't matter this is the 80's me genre at its finest don't rent this one buy it and buy it now
<START> it's quite simple that those who call this movie anything below decent do not know their cinema the doll master creates a sense of dread and suspense rarely seen in movies outside of asia br br think of a mixture of manga and <UNK> rolled into one and this is what its all about br br first rate acting first rate direction first rate sets and effects br br this is right up there with the best of asian horror cinema <UNK> dark water and a tale of two sisters br br an absolute must br br take it from a guy who knows his movies
<START> evil ed is a swedish film about a man named ed of course and his collapse into total madness after editing a series of b horror films known as the loose limbs series ed becomes so mad that he thinks he's seeing demons and monsters but in reality they are people he knows and people that are close to him such as his wife and daughter br br i first saw this movie back in 1998 and was <UNK> by what i had seen to this day this movie i consider to be one of the darkest comedies out there as the movie is almost slapstick funny with its gore scenes there are still a few creepy moments br br this is a cool flick but don't expect anything marvelous it's simply just a fun movie that is good to show some of your friends for some laughs 8 10 stars
<START> when jan <UNK> lets his imagination run wild get ready you're in for dark harrowing films like alice and little or short gems such as down to the <UNK> and <UNK> all of those are excellent films that represent disturbing <UNK> film making at its best br br on the other hand when <UNK> attempts to make a political statement of any kind you're advised to leave the room in a hurry films in this vein tend to be both adolescent and preachy presenting straw man caricatures in <UNK> fashion to express his pseudo brilliant insights br br <UNK> unfortunately is very much this latter type of movie cartoonish ideas and characters are stretched paper thin for an appalling two hours there are a few moments that briefly hold interest but these few are separated by vast <UNK> of boredom br br if you found dreadful monotonous short film et <UNK> brilliant and hilarious you'll probably love <UNK> if you've never seen a <UNK> film before please start elsewhere
<START> i took my younger niece to an early showing and she loved it i enjoyed it myself as well i don't need to explain the plot since the movie remains completely true to the award winning top selling book by famed author carl the movie takes the popular book and layers it with beautiful cinematography i want to go to florida now humor thanks to funny man luke wilson and some new <UNK> and great music i have to get to get a jimmy <UNK> cd now i know a movie is good when i get <UNK> <UNK> in the end overall it was great family film that i felt comfortable taking my younger niece to i'd recommend it to any and everyone
<START> both disney and bill paxton did a fine job in conveying a story that is based in fact you do not have to like the game of golf to appreciate the story of one man's struggle to overcome the odds it could have been based on any sport or simply on any other situation which involves competition though this one just happens to be related to golf the only problem i have with the story is that i would have liked to see a bit deeper into each of the main characters <UNK> mr mr francis is a typical young man of his times turn of the century america where class lines are well <UNK> and <UNK> be it to anyone who <UNK> to try to rise above his class standing i did a bit of historical research and my biggest question was indeed answered to my satisfaction although the circumstances are a bit different than those portrayed in the film i came away with a feeling of content i thoroughly enjoyed this movie i believe you will too
<START> this movie is in all <UNK> the worst film ever made it is certainly the worst that i've ever seen and i have seen a lot of bad movies br br in this nothing at all interesting happens throughout the movie one could literally start the movie take a short <UNK> and then wake up secure in the knowledge that nothing interesting has happened while you are sleeping and i have seen this movie three times staying awake throughout i feel i should be <UNK> br br the movie goes as one might expect according to a formula with no variation hunters capture baby bigfoot get killed by parent and the nearby town goes into a bigfoot killing frenzy this is surprisingly boring for a troma release br br so please do yourself a favor and skip this movie if you have to see it you will understand why
<START> <UNK> michael is warm and winning comedy fantasy that features one of my favorite performances from the john travolta library travolta gives one of his and most likable performances as michael an <UNK> whose quiet existence at the home of a lonely <UNK> named <UNK> jean <UNK> is <UNK> when <UNK> reports michael's presence in her home to a national <UNK> like newspaper and the editor bob <UNK> sends <UNK> william hurt <UNK> mcdowell robert <UNK> to the motel to check it out hurt mcdowell and <UNK> are quite good as the jaded news who have a hard time accepting they've met an angel but this is <UNK> show and he rules as the pot <UNK> sugar eating cookie <UNK> pie loving <UNK> loving bull chasing michael an angel who just isn't what you think you of when you think of angels and you have to love the scene in the bar when he and the ladies dance to chain of fools i love this movie more and more every time i watch it and it's mainly because of the completely winning performance from john travolta
<START> even if you do not typically enjoy documentaries odds are you will find this one fascinating not only does it have a well <UNK> out plot that while easy to follow contains its interesting <UNK> it also has a very strong emotional <UNK> and not one that relies on a simple specific tone instead the emotions here are as profound and <UNK> as the <UNK> featured br br that being said if you know nothing of donald and the 1968 single boat race around the world as was the case for me please stop reading and rent view this film br br spoilers follow br br my friend brian recommended this at the same time that my aunt had sent me a <UNK> <UNK> this film with <UNK> work in 2007 i was <UNK> by several of <UNK> films still am to connect this film to antonioni i think is a bit of a stretch the character most likely to be seen in one of movies is <UNK> de it's funny on the main imdb page he isn't even listed as playing himself which is probably a function of his lengthy name as opposed to his self realization since <UNK> right out of the race that could be considered is a bit like anna in <UNK> quite a major minor character br br while there are many things to love about this film the actual footage from the time the stoic best friend the sheer power of the roaring forties i walked away with a simple connection a man truly at sea there have been times in my life where i wonder how i got to such a point caught between dreams and reality feeling like a <UNK> in my own skin it may be that i'm reading too much into this documentary and that in turn the directors read too much into but i found that sense as spell <UNK> as the other secrets kept in this film br br on the odd chance that wife who seemed a remarkable study in restraint with understandably conflicted overtones and his children so young in the found footage and still young at this late date in the sense of their pain and pride for their father i am certain the comments here and the film itself fail to catch the man that your father was in his death however he has given the world a glimpse of something like a lost myth he is a pre <UNK> <UNK> never finding his body adds to the air of <UNK> <UNK> if not the stature of a <UNK> being of which he had <UNK> br br this film sticks with you after the viewing as if you expect another twist to emerge from the deep waters or at the very least you hope for the sequel br br <UNK> 8 10
<START> used to watch this when i was very little then used to watch my videos now i watch the dvds i love this ray winston is 'the <UNK> the rest of the cast is all good and even with the changing of robin hood it all works great stories twists and the way it was shot to the <UNK> eye not that mine is trained can be miss interpreted as being <UNK> but it adds to the films <UNK> of the audience with the green <UNK> and the contrast of the lush sunny lit forest to the dark corridors and <UNK> of the <UNK> its great personally the definitive interpretation of the robin hood legend i cannot stress how much i think you should watch this if you get a chance then you must watch it
<START> it was <UNK> close but the china syndrome received the worst kind of publicity when as it was going into theatrical release the accident at three mile island nuclear power plant happened i still remember the whole country's attention was glued onto <UNK> <UNK> coming out of <UNK> and wouldn't you know it a scientist in the china syndrome describes the worst case scenario as rendering an area as large as the state of <UNK> br br less than a decade later in the <UNK> at the soviet union in its last days dealt with such a crisis that didn't get <UNK> in the nick of time the china syndrome once again became a relevant movie br br the film is more about cutting <UNK> for safety than it is about being anti nuclear jack lemmon is a man who lived with nuclear power all his life as the captain of an atomic power submarine what <UNK> him and sets him off to create the confrontation that <UNK> the film is the stupidity and greed of the power company <UNK> stupidity and greed though are found every day the problem with them is that there are places where it can be <UNK> less in human society br br lemmon shares star billing with a couple of famous hollywood <UNK> jane fonda and michael douglas jane is a tv news reporter who is constantly being assigned to <UNK> feature stories and just happens to be at a nuclear power plant when an accident occurs the cover up by her own station and her later meeting with lemmon set off the chain of events depicted in the china syndrome br br <UNK> best scene i thought however was with peter a news executive with her station take a look at her facial expressions as off the importance of the story and tells her that her very beauty demands she stick to <UNK> pieces fonda knows she's got something and sticks with it br br michael douglas plays her <UNK> cameraman this was a typical part for him back in the day in his tcm tribute to his father kirk douglas michael said he <UNK> for roles showing sensitivity still i could have seen a young kirk douglas in this part br br what to do about energy for industrial and post industrial nations a <UNK> problem that will our government for a couple of generations to come this film shows what can happen with a <UNK> on nuclear power our current problems in the world <UNK> in part from a <UNK> on <UNK> fuel specifically oil everything we use brings consequence some <UNK> br br the real hero of the film in my opinion is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> colleague at the nuclear power plant in the end <UNK> really steps up to the plate br br see the china syndrome to know what i'm talking about
<START> herman has made northern drama his own with little voice and <UNK> off but the formula <UNK> in this <UNK> flat and contrived tale of two teenage <UNK> trying to get season tickets to see <UNK> br br <UNK> smoking and drinking <UNK> sex teenage abortion school bullying drug abuse substance abuse depression child violence child sex abuse <UNK> auto <UNK> violent assault and armed robbery all put in an appearance here none of these issues are explored they merely serve to move the story along from one implausible situation to another the film is not as <UNK> observed as <UNK> as poignant as the full monty or as <UNK> of the times as wonderland from which it shamelessly steals music in an overly manipulative manner i suspect none of the filmmakers are from <UNK> and have certainly never experienced the social problems the film references i am all for entertainment and <UNK> track record shows he is aware of the need to balance the social message with laughs and tears quite simply he comes up incredibly short here br br the film has a nice ending but there are far too many flat banal moments to sit through to get there nicely shot not very well acted and ultimately fails on three crucial points script script script
<START> wow this film was terrible it is as simple as that it is actually the first time that i walked out early as far as i can remember this turned out okay though i had a very nice chat with two most charming girls while we all waited for the rest to finally give up on that crap they called a movie br br where to start bad acting bad jokes humour which i simply cannot stand sorry but <UNK> pee and <UNK> are not funny you have seen the title picture that scene actually drags on for about 5 minutes with the two heroes hitting and <UNK> each other which is supposed to be humorous all by itself it is not br br apart from body <UNK> violence and cross dressing i do not remember much about this at least not much good i was really really disappointed by this piece of garbage or let us be honest here given that i am actually a big fan of british i e black humour i was angry br br so want my advice three words do not watch
<START> this movie was pointless i can't even call it sci fi since that requires more from a movie than merely taking place in space max q isn't even set in space for the entire movie the story plot is unoriginal the cast isn't anything to write home about although it would be strange with a top cast in a mediocre film furthermore it's not particularly exciting or well told at least it's <UNK> balanced in a low quality sort of way in that nothing or no one stands out everything is equally bland i usually find some quality in space flicks even if it's just 90 minutes of semi lame entertainment <UNK> on low budget pathetic but max q didn't even give me that satisfaction all in all a complete waste of time
<START> as good as <UNK> list was i found this movie much more powerful as it is a documentary and based on real life it details the story of the frank family and anne in particular although it is a bit slow moving at first <UNK> their family life before the war it becomes very powerful br br due to some of the footage and photos of the camps i would not recommend it for children but for adults it illustrates the horror of the holocaust through one young girl highly recommended
<START> larry is a perfect example of the <UNK> party in the united states of which he is a <UNK> member king used to be somewhat fair and <UNK> and had a variety of guests on the party used to be <UNK> too but that was another era now like larry it's far left br br at least 90 percent of all the guests on king's show in the past year or two are <UNK> who sit there and bash president bush and every conservative they can think of night after night bill one of the more <UNK> ones is and you can look this up the most frequent guest in the history of king's tv show you can count on other <UNK> left <UNK> to be on king's show each week but don't hold your breath waiting for a conservative they are few and far between br br king was also one of the of the media <UNK> that all began with the o j simpson trial night after night after night that's all you ever saw back in the mid <UNK> whatever latest <UNK> on anna nicole smith or the <UNK> murder case or paris hilton britney spears or some other <UNK> subject you can bet larry will beat it to death sadly all the other networks do the same thing now larry was a leader in that regard br br king also has the nerve to sometimes give advice such as on marriage i am not kidding i <UNK> heard him say it the joke is that he has been married and divorced a half dozen times this man has few <UNK> believe me when it comes to morality he is clueless maybe that's why he has dr phil on to explain some facts of life to him regularly larry will nod but he doesn't understand any more than when billy graham used to talk to him br br king also is becoming famous for the <UNK> interview meaning he asks no hard questions that is a lot due to the fact that most his guests are of his political <UNK> people know being on king's show is liking having an hour public relations gig br br what all this has meant is a serious decline in ratings the past five years people see through him and his liberal and <UNK> tv mentality and switched over from king and <UNK> to fox news
<START> this is the underrated <UNK> <UNK> best role based on a true story it tells the story of attempt to save the members of the family and other jews she meets over time one of my all time favorite movie scenes involves an heroic act by little sister all children should see this scene role models like this are very few and far between the movie is well written and acted i am a movie lover and this movie i rate a 10 on rating system it is on my top 25 movies of all time and should be put out on video br br mike porter
<START> 2005 was one of the best year for movies we had so many wonderful movies like batman begins sin city corpse bride a history of violence coming up we also got <UNK> mountain king kong but if this year the only great movie that came out was everything is <UNK> then we wouldn't miss all this year has brought the first movie as a director of the talented <UNK> <UNK> is a delightful heart warming touching drama that also brings one of <UNK> <UNK> best roles he is perfect as jonathan a curious man that heads for <UNK> to find the woman who saved his grandfather in world war ii <UNK> <UNK> who also writes the movie <UNK> a masterpiece with memorable scenes and a lot of funny quotes this here is a genuine mixture of comedy with drama bringing a movie that will be commented years from now a serious oscar <UNK> everything is <UNK> is a powerful original and why not say <UNK> movie but there's one thing you should remember while entering the movie leave normal behind this is special 9 10
<START> i would like to comment on how the girls are chosen why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women every episode their is always more white women then black one's as if to say white women are better looking then black women i would like for once see more black women then white and it not just your show it's like that in a lot of shows always more <UNK> but i would have thought since you as the head <UNK> of the show you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show but you are just like the rest trying to act like you are so fair and nice you are just a big <UNK>
<START> this film is not at all as bad as some people on here are saying i think it has got a decent horror plot and the acting seem normal to me people are way over what was wrong with this it is simply classic horror the type without a plot that we have to think about forever and forever we can just sit back relax and be scared
<START> well i just discovered imdb from my twin sister carol carol and i played the fat identical twin in midnight madness we didn't have to prepare much for the fat part that came with us and well and the rest was natural it was our first major film role and we had a blast making it we were 21 at the time and lived about an hour and half from the disney studio in <UNK> and the hollywood california area we grew up in front of the tv and probably some of the first generation of <UNK> key kids twenty years later we still have lots of fun and are still <UNK> or what ever is politically correct these days we don't pursue acting any more but have been know to <UNK> <UNK> when the right opportunity arrives carol is a <UNK> in our home town of southern california and i am in the information technology field in georgia br br i maybe bias but i thought the film was cute clean and fun we knew it wasn't a master piece or an oscar <UNK> however it was and still is a movie the whole family can watch and have fun together it's nice not to have to worry if your young children can watch a video without having to fast forward certain parts and no one was more <UNK> when it was released on video as carol and i were carol found it at <UNK> for 6 99 now that's an <UNK> way to capture one's memories and share it with others br br sincerely <UNK> <UNK> and carol the thompson twins
<START> harrison ford playing a playing a cop in a crime thriller the perfect ingredients it seems for top entertainment with harrison back to his <UNK> and han solo best protecting a witness from ruthless and <UNK> murderers how easy it is to be fooled if the film concentrated on the main supposed themes of crime and suspense instead of putting up and <UNK> ice <UNK> in peoples faces it possibly could have been more worthwhile <UNK> predictable with the best method of of a <UNK> is with corn
<START> seems to have a love hate relationship with many of its viewers i personally loved the movie and everything about it br br the acting in some places could be improved upon but the filming adds to the atmosphere where the acting can't in some areas the dialogue is a bit cheesy and over dramatic but really what do you expect from the late 90s over all dee did an amazing job in writing what i believe to be one of the most terrifying thrillers i've ever seen it plays on the fears of many age groups adult parents and children every parent fears that their children will get too involved with chat rooms and will meet strangers from the internet and it does happen in the real world and every child and adult fears being kidnapped and tortured against their will that happens too in the real world which is what makes this movie such a sensitive subject for many br br my only warning is if you know you are sensitive to things such as strong violence visible torture and gore then you do not want to see this movie if you are unsure about if this movie will entertain you then read as many reviews as you can ask people you know who have seen this movie and be prepared to turn the movie off at any time should you become disturbed
<START> a true gothic horror trash classic br br <UNK> actually it's a horrible movie best thing about it <UNK> <UNK> naked <UNK> intensely material br br oh sure <UNK> <UNK> is one fine lady never even heard of her before this flick but she is a damn fine looking lady but honestly it were her <UNK> that did it for me in that very last scene before the movie abruptly ends all naked and <UNK> total dream <UNK> man okay sorry getting a little carried away here br br basically i got what i expected from lady frankenstein it's a sleazy and horrible flick with a big stupid ugly looking frankenstein monster and a couple of naked tits and it's got a castle in it so i wasn't really disappointed or anything it just dragged too much in certain places the first <UNK> of the creature kept on going for ages with daddy frankenstein just <UNK> talking trying some more there was one fun <UNK> homage to the original frankenstein though instead of throwing a little girl into a lake here <UNK> <UNK> picked up a naked chick and threw her in a river had me laughing br br some friends of mine <UNK> just a tad bit too much about this flick though had me maybe expecting a bit too much but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sure were worth it <UNK> crap i really need to stop mentioning her <UNK> i think i'll just end this user comment now
<START> gordon scott made some good tarzan movies but this is not one of them br br as i watched it <UNK> at the bad obviously interior sets and the hollow wooden sounds as they walked across supposedly dirt <UNK> and cringing at the bad dialog and worse acting among the supporting cast i kept thinking <UNK> this is tv show level then i find out it was indeed three tv show pilot episodes woven <UNK> fully into one br br it's nice to see scott get outside alone away from the lame sets in a few of the scenes and the fights do have some pretty nice moves but oh <UNK> and <UNK> as to the dialog and did i mention the acting heck <UNK> or in this version was a better actor than most of the humans br br and that's not saying much br br it is kind of a <UNK> to see a younger <UNK> i e <UNK> acting as a native but probably not worth the overall time investment
<START> tries to be funny scary tense and romantic and fails in every respect the acting is average at best but mostly stupid the special effects are not enough to make up for the stupid plot devices and the chemistry between any character is juvenile br br if you don't want to be mad at yourself don't pay money to see it
<START> even my five year old was bored br br very predictable and <UNK> this movie couldn't make up it's mind as to whether it was slapstick or <UNK> commentary on the state of pee wee sports br br characters were underdeveloped could have done more with the connection between father and son both coming from an <UNK> br br did not like the reference regarding the <UNK> the <UNK> to his <UNK> very mean spirited for a kid's movie br br typical mafia behavior was boring and stereotypical br br the dog however was so darn cute
<START> i like many folks believe the 1989 epic <UNK> <UNK> was one of the best westerns ever produced maybe the best and realizing that most sequels in this case a prequel are certain to disappoint my expectations were low <UNK> moon met that expectation with its <UNK> directing and acting poor casting and frankly a lousy script br br <UNK> <UNK> created western heroes of <UNK> and call due to incredibly strong performances by robert duvall and tommy lee jones prior to living in <UNK> <UNK> we believed they <UNK> fought to rid texas of <UNK> and savage indians during their years br br if i had only seen <UNK> moon i would think these two <UNK> were a couple of incompetent cowardly idiots in <UNK> <UNK> call and supposedly chased blue duck all over texas and never managed to capture or kill him in <UNK> moon a shot to <UNK> boot <UNK> convinced him to settle down and raise cattle there wasn't a decent <UNK> or gun fight in the entire miniseries the best punch was <UNK> sucker <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a funny scene but out of character for br br where was wit and charm <UNK> love for a drunken <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> was completely implausible and <UNK> love for call a <UNK> and <UNK> loner defies logic br br the cinematography was excellent superior to the original credit goes not only to <UNK> technology but the cinematographer the <UNK> moon miniseries was better than anything else on tv for three nights but sadly that's not saying much
<START> went to the premiere at the <UNK> film festival in nyc and i absolutely loved the film i am <UNK> 1 biggest fan and of course as always she gave a magnificent performance i have seen every single one of her movies and i must say that this is one of my new favorites diane was funny and moving and just took my breath away donald sutherland was surprisingly humorous but also a good amount of serious anton <UNK> is just a wonderful young actor and gave an amazing performance all in all i recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate an excellent movie 10 thumbs up i would definitely go see it again and again and again this is the best film of the year so far
<START> although it may not be <UNK> best work <UNK> and <UNK> is almost perfect in all its <UNK> the plot is whimsical and charming and surprisingly dramatic with an impressive range of emotion much more drama than comedy contrary to <UNK> profile yes the story is whimsical but not <UNK> it succeeds as believable albeit a tad forced which i will come back to all of the artistic aspects are of true cassavetes form the cinematography and camera work are <UNK> and the soundtrack albeit barely there is <UNK> plus i believe i noticed some <UNK> to godard and such in the editing as i have in a few of <UNK> other films namely the abrupt cutting of a song in one scene which are interesting br br i feel the plot is built up nicely with the first half being particularly enjoyable <UNK> conversation with morgan morgan timothy carey in the diner for example is wonderfully funny and fascinating and sets the tone for the philosophical commentary made throughout the film this <UNK> a tradition in <UNK> films is what made the film for me <UNK> amusing and profound monologues instantly eliminate the first impressions one may have of him as a hippie though his character is curiously similar to that of his in faces 1968 this <UNK> me however on second viewing into the opinion that it stands up against <UNK> best work i gained an affection for this film that i lacked on first viewing br br there are sadly several aspects that make this film <UNK> i find the plot to be <UNK> as i said before it builds up nicely but it <UNK> a bit here and there particularly towards the end because of the spontaneous style in which cassavetes worked and particularly the freedom with which he allowed his actors to <UNK> the quality of his product can easily go either way in this case it's inconsistent i <UNK> that most of this film was improvised and most of it beautifully but one or two scenes unfortunately just don't work in particular the scene after seymour fights with work associate outside her house during what is intended to be the most intense scene of the film cassavetes allowed his actors to run free with the dialogue <UNK> some was planned beforehand this i believe was a mistake one gets the impression <UNK> doesn't quite know what to do as he repeatedly <UNK> in his speech often not making sense and overacts all of this <UNK> the scene and the character development i understand seymour is intended to be a bit of a <UNK> fool but <UNK> attempts here are why does he cut his <UNK> off these flaws are resulting from a lack of direction on cassavetes part a lack of understanding and <UNK> on <UNK> part a lack of rehearsal and <UNK> etc evidently cassavetes didn't learn from his mistakes as he allowed this same thing to happen in his next film a woman under the influence 1974 the committing scene and ending br br the flaws i mention are not minor but they do not ruin the film they simply make some scenes cringe worthy and unrealistic spoiling the flow of the film and <UNK> its potential however i am very very fond of cassavetes and all of his actors particularly <UNK> in spite of the faults i mentioned this is a very enjoyable film although it proves the of <UNK> style
<START> i've read the book and was expecting a good movie the first time i saw it i'm afraid to say that i was disappointed the movie did not follow the book and made many changes that i did not like br br one of the changes that i did not like the way that lord <UNK> was portrayed it made no sense to make him out to be a bad man the way that things ended between lord <UNK> and scarlett was a lot different and their whole relationship was too intimate br br there was also a lot less confrontation between scarlett and <UNK> in the movie than was originally written in the book the movie sent the two in two completely opposite ways and they did not seem to cross paths often enough to make it seem like there still could be love between the two a fine movie but i believe that it certainly could've been better than it was had it more true to alexandra book
<START> i saw this last night at a screening for a marketing company it is and was a lot of fun to watch it held my attention all the way through and did not seem to <UNK> at all i'd recommend watching it when it <UNK>
<START> a very hyped up slick edgy <UNK> br br they've fallen into the because it's modern it has to be hyped up slick etc trap br br romeo and juliet carried this idea off much more successfully but i really think it's time we move beyond the two extremes here period piece vs edgy film br br just because this is a modern retelling doesn't mean the movie has to look like a magazine ad or have anything to do with drugs or guns br br if the <UNK> were as subtle as the words <UNK> would be a far more powerful film as it is read your shakespeare read it out loud ask your <UNK> <UNK> some questions skip the film or don't but you've been warned br br sorry for the super long review imdb made me do it
<START> i saw this the week it opened four years ago and i really did not know what to expect being unfamiliar with work at the time he has created a very intriguing and ultimately moving account of an odd character one for whom the phrase <UNK> is for <UNK> no longer applies it <UNK> me at every turn and i was constantly surprised by the story i enjoyed the pacing very much and the way i was gradually given the pieces to work out what was happening tony is superb as is <UNK> it opens with a brilliantly stylish wide shot and concludes with a very moving image that takes the movie into sublime territory i thought long afterwards about the main character and the position he was in and his final fate and i didn't shake it for weeks i recently bought the film and that final scene where he thinks about his friend gets me every time i still have yet to talk to anyone who has seen this it's a shame that it did not reach a wider audience as if this is the direction of italian cinema it can only be a good thing
<START> i think this is one of the best movies of all time i just think it shows realistically what romance and especially black romance is all about would love to know what others think as well the acting was just out done where is <UNK> anyway it has been awhile since i have seen him in anything however i think he has out did his acting performance in this movie
<START> this movie starts out a little slow but kicks into comedic gear quickly each of the three teenage girls offer their own believable distinct <UNK> and entertaining personalities i particularly enjoyed the dialog and interaction between keith and lisa if one looked beyond the superficial action that was taking place <UNK> character treated <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> and consideration the comic development that followed was also pulled in expertly in my opinion david <UNK> gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle dialogue was sharp quick and <UNK> nicely the director and writer of this film clearly showed how none of the main characters got to claim the moral high ground after all the <UNK> they pulled although the movie appears light on the surface it reflects all the gray areas of becoming an adult human emotions and desire
<START> the year 1983 saw a strange phenomenon two rival bond films <UNK> starring roger moore was part of the official <UNK> <UNK> bond franchise never say never again made by a rival producer is apart from the awful casino <UNK> the only bond movie which does not form part of that franchise its big attraction was that it brought back the original bond sean connery its title <UNK> derived from <UNK> remark after <UNK> are forever that he would never again play the role some have complained that connery was at <UNK> too old for the role but he was in fact three years younger than his <UNK> moore who not only made <UNK> in the same year but went on to make one further bond film a view to a kill two years later br br the film owes its existence to the <UNK> of a <UNK> about the film rights to ian <UNK> work it is perhaps unfortunate that the terms of the <UNK> included a <UNK> that the new film had to be a remake of <UNK> as that was perhaps not the greatest of the connery bonds a remake of dr no or <UNK> might have worked better the plot is much the same as that of the earlier film the terrorist <UNK> <UNK> acting together with a <UNK> <UNK> named <UNK> have stolen two american nuclear <UNK> and are attempting to hold the world's <UNK> to <UNK> by threatening to <UNK> them unless they receive a vast sum of money it falls to bond of course to save the world by tracking down the missing <UNK> br br the film is fortunate in that it has not just one but two of the most beautiful bond girls of all barbara <UNK> as the seductive but lethal <UNK> and kim basinger as <UNK> girlfriend domino who <UNK> to <UNK> side after learning of her <UNK> evil plans a number of the bond films have a plot that hangs upon the hero's ability to win over the <UNK> mistress or female <UNK> there are similar developments for example in <UNK> live and let die and the living <UNK> in the official series <UNK> ally is normally regarded as the female lead but here <UNK> playing the <UNK> is billed above basinger who was a relatively unknown actress at the time basinger of course has gone on to become one of hollywood's biggest stars whereas <UNK> is one of a number of bond girls who have somewhat faded from view br br of the villains max von <UNK> makes an effective the head of <UNK> but <UNK> maria <UNK> seemed too bland and <UNK> as <UNK> except perhaps during the <UNK> game a more sophisticated <UNK> on those violent computer games such as space <UNK> that were so popular in the early eighties <UNK> can be an excellent actor in his native german in films such as <UNK> and but he does not comes across so <UNK> in english br br one of the film's features is that it both follows the normal bond formula and at times <UNK> from it there is the standard world in peril plot chase sequences a series of exotic locations glamorous women sinister villains and a specially written theme song based on the film's title there is however no extended pre credits sequence and we see some familiar characters in a new light for example <UNK> boss m becomes a <UNK> <UNK> aristocrat his american colleague felix is shown as black for the only time and the scientist q is portrayed by alec as a <UNK> <UNK> with despite his <UNK> upper class christian name of <UNK> a distinctly working class accent there is also an amusing cameo from <UNK> <UNK> as a bumbling british <UNK> although connery was perhaps not quite a good here as he was in some of his earlier films in the role this <UNK> the changes on the familiar theme makes this one of the more memorable bonds 7 10 br br a goof <UNK> <UNK> character states that he is from the british <UNK> in as however the <UNK> is a <UNK> country britain would have a high <UNK> in its capital not an <UNK>
<START> i love love love this show whether you say it's because i'm insane in the brain or not i think this show is very funny and entertaining although sometimes uncle <UNK> scares me so all in all i give this show a perfect review and so i really think if you're into the <UNK> what an idiot kind of humor this show is for you it's really funny to see the look on the prank peoples faces and there are many musical guests who come to house buy this cause it rocks you should buy it yes and brother is in the band and they are really good and sometimes come on the show br br bottom line is please watch the show
<START> folks is a comedy about a man whose parents beg him to kill them because they're going <UNK> and want to be put out of their misery several times he tries to kill them and then changes his mind saving them from his death traps at the last minute and losing one of his body parts each time in the process the movie seems to hate its main character which makes it all the more painful to watch there's also the usual tacked on love interest and predictable ending br br this movie was also the first time i'd seen tom <UNK> without a mustache and i remember his <UNK> upper lip looking weird and making me feel slightly slick but this might have been just because of the terrible premise and lame execution of the movie
<START> i guess those who have been in a one sided relationship of some sort before will be able identify with the lead character <UNK> <UNK> a 50 year old woman who is still in the pink of good health as demonstrated by her daily <UNK> routine of waking up extremely early in the morning to prepare for her milk delivery work where she has to <UNK> <UNK> of in a bag in a route around her town like clockwork to exchange empty <UNK> for full ones and to collect <UNK> and issue <UNK> and there's always be that one delivery stop that's right at the top needing to scale a long flight of stairs in order to achieve <UNK> satisfaction br br and peculiar enough that stop happened to be a stop delivering to a man with whom she has been in love with for almost all her teenage to adult life and not having the product appreciated but <UNK> down the sink having gone to the same school we see that they're not talking to each other and in their daily life always seem so close physically but yet so far away there's no eye contact save for <UNK> <UNK> by chance and little <UNK> of each other's existence we learn that they share a past that probably destroyed all notions of being together where clear attraction between the two was <UNK> from developing further by the earlier generation br br while i thought was an interesting woman in herself one who has kept her feelings <UNK> for so long one can only wonder what kind of damage it would do if i read that the original japanese title means at some time the days you read books and it's accurate i felt the movie had a wonderful finale with that shot of her well <UNK> <UNK> likely <UNK> to the fact that she's not alone after all and had probably fallen back on her <UNK> of sorts to deal with the pain of being alone and back to a lifestyle which she had already been <UNK> to for 50 years besides <UNK> herself in two jobs she has those books which serve as a form of <UNK> and occasionally <UNK> little sweet <UNK> to song dedication shows on the radio br br <UNK> <UNK> did a commendable job as the emotionally strong woman <UNK> to her fate and her decision to love none other her object of affection was a more interesting character who has more <UNK> staying true to marriage <UNK> he spends significant amount of screen time looking after his <UNK> <UNK> wife played by while <UNK> with his job of social <UNK> in the children's affairs department in city hall i felt that as a <UNK> couple the job provided him a means to care not for his own but for other people's children the troubled ones who are neglected and left to <UNK> for themselves in a rare moment of rage we see how he <UNK> <UNK> such <UNK> parents who don't appreciate and wastes their children's lives away br br the story by <UNK> <UNK> provides little quirks to make its characters appeal and successfully attempted to provide a lot more glimpses and dimension into them as well such as how is a hopeless <UNK> poet despite being a member of the <UNK> club and supporting characters such as the aged couple where <UNK> <UNK> some comical though sad moments as he slowly turned <UNK> while wife <UNK> <UNK> and brings us through this love story of a single woman at 50 even performance as the <UNK> wife was nothing short of <UNK> with her character's <UNK> state of knowing her husband's past and making <UNK> and painful decisions in her <UNK> state br br it's what you can expect from a typical japanese romantic movie sans young <UNK> leads as star crossed lovers but with all other elements in place such as romantic set ups love songs and those quintessential restrained but <UNK> behaviour i thought the story was in danger of going down the beaten track when <UNK> love gets <UNK> but director <UNK> managed to steer clear of the usual melodramatic moments in such stories though the story did call for some obvious plot development into the final act that you can predict especially if you're already way past your romance movie 101 br br not being your average <UNK> <UNK> story i thought the told a strong story with <UNK> love as a central theme and frankly a recommended romance movie though told at a <UNK> pace if you're in the mood for some bittersweet loving <UNK> and seeking to live without regrets
<START> true there are some goofs for the one who wants to find them they're not important though br br the primary feature of this film is watching veteran expert actors do their craft <UNK> scott thomas is beautiful and plays well the part of a strong woman but one who has been hurt same for harrison ford who for the ladies is just as beau as <UNK> is belle for us guys br br their hurt at the hands of their <UNK> <UNK> brings them together in an awkward manner but one in which they find support in each other how they evoke their hurt feelings and their humanity within on <UNK> screen is why these are such sought performers the viewer cannot help but feel what they feel nor can one help wanting to cheer them when they're together br br yes there are several action scenes involving angry corrupt cops but they only spice it up a little and are not a significant part of the movie br br for the lover of music dave provides a superb jazz based background featuring <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> like the actors shows why he is one of the most sought musical <UNK> in the movie business <UNK> shows why he's one the premiere <UNK> on the scene br br not a movie for the lovers of guts blood and gore but for those who want to see a lot of what makes us feel inside watch a beautiful english actress with big <UNK> blue eyes who can act like harrison ford to the endless <UNK> <UNK> courtesy of dave and <UNK> <UNK> this is a move to watch with someone you love preferably in bed br br i thought it deserved at least an 8

<START> look as being <UNK> irish i assure you this reviewer is anything but bias but i assure you this is very much an irish film and not english as the last comment seems to have suggested this film was written by neil and <UNK> <UNK> and directed by <UNK> <UNK> too both irish the cast is almost entirely irish it was shot in ireland with an irish crew even michael was born in ireland i remember him joking about it in an interview about this film br br michael <UNK> was evidently brought in to boost box office abroad br br loved the film i just wanted to correct a totally <UNK> comment br br now on with the review i loved dylan <UNK> have always been a fan of his himself and michael <UNK> formed a surprisingly good double act it was great to see range as an actor as he plays several different made up characters during the film i would recommend this film to anyone with an interest in comedy as it represents a fresh quirky and inventive turn in irish feature length chuckle films i laughed a lot what more could you ask for
<START> the <UNK> of bill <UNK> robert armstrong and james <UNK> play <UNK> island <UNK> <UNK> for the hand of ginger rogers a working gal who sells salt water <UNK> with the <UNK> of world war i the <UNK> <UNK> and pursue ginger from <UNK> the first half of this rko <UNK> production is hard going with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with <UNK> one liners and <UNK> dialogue that quickly grows tiresome the second half concentrates on action sequences as the us navy <UNK> both a german <UNK> <UNK> and a u boat these sequences are lively and well filmed but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedy drama with a flat ending for fans of the stars only
<START> julie <UNK> stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in france of the <UNK> century the film attempts to <UNK> the romantic <UNK> image of the heroic medieval knight by showing a rather dreary image of the period defined by psychological <UNK> and violence br br the movie opens with a child <UNK> growing up in the shadow of the hundred <UNK> war told by his father to keep his mother safe and to wait for his return <UNK> takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed <UNK> murders him in the name of defending his father's honour like father like son <UNK> grows up and leaves his family also to go to the same war this setting is somewhat of an explanation for the events to come as on his way home we already notice that something is wrong with <UNK> the war has not done well with him he has changed br br the daughter <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> her beloved father to return from <UNK> of the english she is pure of heart and she was left to take care of the estate while her father was gone in her father's absence <UNK> needs to deal with financial difficulties which <UNK> hope that her father will return to save her but upon his return she notices that he lost the will to enjoy life and he <UNK> and <UNK> everything around him even his own daughter from this points the film depicts various ways how <UNK> <UNK> his family starting with <UNK> his own son and ending with the rape of his own daughter <UNK> br br setting the film in the middle ages supposed to <UNK> the blow as the viewer may tell himself that these kind of violent acts were held in difficult times and indeed many films on the topic of incest such as tim <UNK> the war zone 1999 which are contemporary were more shocking because of that br br <UNK> appears in this film in several daring nude scenes indeed she appears to be <UNK> and beautiful br br i was annoyed when i saw some animal torture scenes i believe and this is not confirmed that some birds were killed for the making of this film which really <UNK> me the quality of a film drops when real violence is used towards animals i would hope that this movie will be re released without those cruelty scenes those scenes do not contribute much to the film storyline br br overall the movie is too long the script is <UNK> we don't get to see <UNK> and <UNK> before the war we don't really get the answer why is he changed to such extreme i would have pass on this film however i have to mention a few scenes that made this film worth watching br br scenes of a young child being able to murder in cold blood is truly shocking i saw it first time on city of god 2002 here <UNK> murders his mother's lover while his father away at war excellent scene and very graphic the scenes from <UNK> being raped by her father till she finds out she is pregnant from him are truly shocking and interesting the scene after the rape where <UNK> burns her <UNK> and <UNK> herself she asks her brother to kick her in the stomach with hopes to have a <UNK> br br the brother <UNK> scenes where the father <UNK> his son's head into the food <UNK> him then <UNK> about the war later dressing his son with women's <UNK> br br the film won the <UNK> french oscar for best costume design i agree the costumes here really make the film look authentic for the time period the movie location is <UNK> de a real <UNK> century castle and a historical <UNK> located in south central france beautiful castle and mountain view really helps you set into the period of this film the film also nominated for 3 more <UNK> awards but they were all <UNK> to the widely successful french film <UNK> les <UNK> goodbye children 1998 br br released as <UNK> in new york city march 1987 only to be screened in france on november 2007 watched it on on 3 may 2007 17 45 at work
<START> alien was excellent many writers tried to copy it they all did a bad job or almost but dead space is the worst alien copy because of the bad actors the bad special effects the bad scenario and other bad stuff it would take about 3 pages to tell everything that is bad in this film the movie wasn't very long and this is a very good thing the only one you cannot laugh because it is too serious that is a bad thing because in almost each b series sci fi film you can laugh during the whole time it can be terrific sometimes but instead of watching this stupidity just watch alien or event horizon these are much better i give it 1 out of 5
<START> a few thoughts before i get to the heart of the film 1 i have never seen so many bare breasts in a film before displayed in so many non sexual scenes it was weird 2 joseph <UNK> where have you been you <UNK> us in elizabeth and shakespeare in love and then you went away for awhile mainstream american wants more okay i'm a college english professor i have read this play many times and this is probably the best film version i've seen of it while individual aspects of other productions may have stood out this is the overall package put together well pacino is no olivier but he doesn't need to be so get over it the film's cinematography is stunning and not just because of the bare breasts <UNK> is portrayed amazingly and you do get a feel for really being there <UNK> island is amazingly beautiful and the lighting is always <UNK> the proper way for the <UNK> appropriate <UNK> br br the anti in this film play is hard to watch especially at the end <UNK> dropping to the knees and <UNK> his religious <UNK> is perhaps the most powerful moment of his on film since the godfather part iii when michael's daughter is <UNK> down on the opera steps is the play anti sure is othello racist sure take it for what it is a commentary on the <UNK> era not a commentary on today br br <UNK> is <UNK> in the film but still a pleasure to watch the women in the film are alright no one really stood out here but they do blend in nicely with the scenery jeremy <UNK> and pacino are excellent in the two roles <UNK> until the end i've always felt <UNK> was underrated i still get chills when i hear his voice from the lion king and pacino is pacino
<START> <UNK> the delicious monica <UNK> is challenged by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in order to prove that the <UNK> are better than the <UNK> she promises to build a fancy castle for <UNK> in a period of three months without any <UNK> she calls the one arm architect and gives him two <UNK> to be covered by gold if he <UNK> his mission or become crocodile food if he fails will ask for help to claude rich <UNK> christian <UNK> and depardieu with this movie is very funny specially the parts where and the pirates <UNK> by red beard participate however the screenwriter and the director should have noted that french is not an universal language as english is therefore the jokes with words like in austin powers movies for example does not work well for people strange to french language french people and persons <UNK> in french language will certainly like these jokes but they do not make any sense for me that do not speak french my vote is seven
<START> this is the most difficult movie i have ever seen the emotional content is horrific yet <UNK> a woman who is accused of being a political <UNK> is brought in for questioning the whole movie revolves around her <UNK> alan <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> have intense and powerful roles for which they deserve oscars for their performances
<START> be very afraid of anyone who likes this film they probably <UNK> too many paint <UNK> as a child its so awful i refuse to <UNK> a plot o yeah there wasn't one this movie is a true definition of what hollywood creates for people who don't want to think at a theatre do the bad guys win do the good guys win who cares
<START> viewed this great classic film of greta garbo and thought her performance was excellent however the german film version which had english <UNK> was her greatest performance greta garbo even mentioned to the press that the german film was her favorite where she had to make the change from silent films to sound greta had a high pitched voice and had to take lessons in order to lower her voice for her future roles in films this story was very sad because greta garbo anna christie <UNK> <UNK> was abused on a farm by young boys and her father left her years ago as a sailor and then as a coal <UNK> captain there were many scenes of old nyc the brooklyn bridge <UNK> island and the sky line of manhattan charles <UNK> matt burke days of wine <UNK> <UNK> a classic veteran actor gave a great supporting role
<START> you know that commercial where the guy has a mouth full of <UNK> or whatever it is and he's trying really hard to keep from spitting it up into the sink that's a great metaphor for this movie i kept watching even though it was really difficult but keeping in your mouth will leave you with a <UNK> fresh feeling this movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth i should have spit it out when i had the chance br br the premise is corny enough to be fun for the first time in like a thousand years <UNK> have returned to romania and all of the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are long dead it's up to michael <UNK> and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the <UNK> run amok unfortunately the premise is completely lost in bad dialog and less than enthusiastic acting on the part of the human leads the best acting is done by the cg <UNK> br br in the end this movie feels like a poor man's van <UNK> if you check your brain at the door this might get you through a dreary monday night i gave it 3 out of 10 stars
<START> i didn't see this movie until it appeared on television because i was <UNK> about comic flicks ever since the batman series <UNK> judge <UNK> and many other pitiful p g 13 bombs i <UNK> everything at all cost i would question in my mind why can't someone make a movie that is rated r and stays true to the story how difficult is that and finally my <UNK> have been answered with blade this movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence blood martial arts weapons fire the good against evil etc yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these <UNK> and most of them have bombed but not blade the movie was filmed just right not going overboard delivering a good length and never a dull moment blade ii is cool but not as cool as the first blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks i've seen in a long time
<START> denis <UNK> can indeed be funny and clever at times and is always likable but this takes the cake this show showed <UNK> genius br br the job is set in new york <UNK> plays mike <UNK> a hard <UNK> detective who is married has a occasional drug problem and has a girlfriend <UNK> has serious attitude so much he's dripping in it the <UNK> is filled with funny interesting and likable characters besides <UNK> an excellent cast too all of the episodes in this show are really funny and are <UNK> the one liners in this show are everywhere you'll be in <UNK> after hearing them and still laugh about them a few minutes after and then some the cases the <UNK> deals with are something else to stripper nuns a bathroom hostage situation and more are over the top this show was too good could have grown legs to last many more seasons br br the last word a great fantastic show i miss this show <UNK> all episodes of this show are great you get even belly laughs a lot abc made a huge mistake by giving this the <UNK> too bad <UNK> did not revive the show for cable tv still i give this show one of my highest of <UNK> truly a one of a kind show
<START> the sort of little film which studios used to <UNK> at but seldom make anymore sort of a soul version of the more well known the last of the blonde <UNK> ian <UNK> is excellent as a dj and <UNK> of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of re <UNK> the members of a classic soul group and the film follows his exploits as well as those of the group members a cast which includes such genuine musical talent as <UNK> hayes as well as acting <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and antonio <UNK> not meant to be an epic by any means this is nonetheless a <UNK> of solid gold
<START> i must say out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out it wasn't as epic as <UNK> the warriors and didn't develop the characters as well but it had many nice ideas simple story a elite soldier thought dead returns after years to end the reign of the japanese in korea in medieval days his counterpart was <UNK> the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him the fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch the motives of the figures are discovered first near to the end you might need to watch it again to get all the connections right and me personally i loved the end i could watch it over and over again maybe a little pathetic but a real freedom fighter story people can be killed but not the ideas they stand for
<START> dumb excuse for a thriller with absolutely zero chemistry or reason in relationship between lewis and hurt why is she dating a man old enough to be her father anyway the suspense is laughable lewis is very good but a script is needed and there isn't one my score for this trash 2 out of 10
<START> i bought this movie at a <UNK> store months before my friend told me about it when we were talking about dumb movies we've seen once i spotted the <UNK> i knew i had to have it i watched it that night i could tell it was going to be very cheesy and cheaply done that's what drew me to it i popped it in and i laughed the whole way through i recognized gregory the ice cream man but i didn't recognize his name and i couldn't remember where i saw him later while watching the andy griffith show clint howard ice cream man was featured as an extra since he is ron howard taylor 's brother i saw the credits and i <UNK> i turned to my mom who was also watching the show and said that's the ice cream man she too <UNK> this movie is great but only for laughs and it is the perfect example of a cheesy horror flick if you feel like laughing as well as <UNK> fun at low budget movies rent this video
<START> an <UNK> film that from the back of the box promises twists adventure and an emotional adventure we will never forget this film also fools us into watching it by <UNK> rachel lee cook with a starring role after the first twenty minutes you realize that this movie is going to give you nothing the story goes on <UNK> revealing nothing new or important to keep us interested all three disturbed characters have only small of back story to force us to care just as you reach the end everything about the story is altered and instead of helping the audience catch up you are left with no idea and more importantly no interest in why the director who also thought it would be a good idea to co star seems to come into the film with no prior experience or knowledge of useful filmmaking the entire piece looks like a college art film crafted by a <UNK> film student trying to hide a lack of true talent
<START> <UNK> gives los angeles what it deserves a <UNK> in fire death from above an excellent cast of obsessed characters could survive and sweat out the passing of the mass <UNK> but that would be no fun and certainly not dramatic a really lame review in variety criticized the characters for being concerned with their personal redemption instead of <UNK> together to save the world but what's refreshing about this big heat is that there's nothing anyone can do about it we are therefore mercifully not subjected to heart warming scenes of fascist <UNK> and other big <UNK> as they <UNK> implausible plots to save a chosen <UNK> of mankind ala deep impact here the sweat <UNK> and lust powered dirty half dozen work out their own redemption or face their personal the old fashioned way together as individuals or alone with the alone excellent tv film all in all clearly not by the destructive of <UNK> network <UNK> i highly recommend
<START> ken <UNK> baseball is a decent documentary it presents a clear origin of the game a great depiction of <UNK> early years and heroes there's plenty in this movie for any baseball fan that said the film has several glaring flaws br br 18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span it's clear that burns stretched his film out to fit his nine <UNK> concept it's not even a tight 18 hours the pace on every segment is slow almost <UNK> the music always nostalgic and <UNK> isn't baseball ever exciting and fun why is every player and their <UNK> presented in the form of a tragedy talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional <UNK> <UNK> about baseball as a metaphor baseball as <UNK> the psychology and <UNK> of baseball enough this is <UNK> <UNK> drivel billy crystal is here to sell us all the <UNK> <UNK> he's sold us before ken burns uses the national <UNK> as the <UNK> theme song and manages to play take me out to the <UNK> so many times you might vomit we get it dude br br clearly burns is a neo hollywood faux liberal so he spends probably a third of the film on the <UNK> <UNK> these segments are spent <UNK> whites of yesterday for not being as open minded as kenny is today for shame he <UNK> baseball for being <UNK> in the thirties and forties but fails to realize that america was <UNK> in those times burns falls head over heels in love with buck <UNK> a former <UNK> league player and <UNK> over every piece of footage in which the elderly <UNK> <UNK> poetic about his playing days nonsense br br burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down baseball winds up as <UNK> <UNK> civil rights propaganda disguised as <UNK> its clear that burns is not a baseball fan otherwise he would know we watch games laughing and cheering not <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are you listening mr burns there's no crying in baseball
<START> <UNK> mary <UNK> is delightfully on edge as always i never tire of her upper <UNK> <UNK> especially in the women and pride and prejudice w c brief role is fun though the famous pool table scene stretches its welcome a bit because it seems to go on for ten minutes the <UNK> antics of the film typical of the period are great also a nod to alison wonderfully grounded hotel mistress i would love to see more of her she reminds me of marie <UNK> another personality worthy of high praise br br <UNK> <UNK> allen an irritating unfunny presence whose annoyance went <UNK> until the rise of adam sandler that near <UNK> <UNK> with an accent of unknown origin gets old in her very first scene this is the first of the burns allen films i have seen and while i as a big classic comedy buff try to experience at least one film with every major comedy star this is definitely one team i will not be calling upon again her timing and interpretation of the material is totally off a <UNK> mediocre talent br br the bottom line an ok comedy but the gags are few and far between and at only an hour long you can expect that this is not an a grade hollywood comedy recommended only for <UNK> and fields fans who want to see all of their work
<START> so ya think you've seen every mafia movie ever made here's one that nobody every heard of it's a low budget <UNK> b movie shot in the <UNK> of jersey for us mob movie fans it had a little bit of everything sex violence <UNK> and wise guys acting like while violence dominated the movie i found myself laughing at some familiar scenes i've since seen on the sopranos and <UNK> look for a 1977 version of the girls in the beginning of the movie br br all our favorite mobster stereotypes were featured here and as for realism joe <UNK> was superb portraying the classic wise guy character like we seen him do so many times over the years this was probably his first shot and it was a gem <UNK> fans should run to the video store to check out this flick you have to look carefully for it since it goes by different names my copy called it the family <UNK> here it is known as the death collector but whatever name it goes under it's should be called a winner
<START> is not a masterpiece which apparently was what it needed to be upon first release to justify its great cost and more importantly the continued uneasy <UNK> of hollywood on the auteur model of film making yet seen today at last on dvd in a cut of minutes is a superb film it is a touch <UNK> in pace but at least it is paced quite apart from the incompetence of construction that marks many films today there have been many films which deliberate in form have been severely damaged by being <UNK> down with no care for rhythm so the films become <UNK> and confusing beyond this the criticisms <UNK> at the film have become in retrospect quite lame if the good guys and bad guys are too obviously <UNK> for a serious film and yes sam <UNK> fur clad villain is comic opera and not in the multi <UNK> manner of bill the butcher from of new <UNK> and yes the <UNK> do seem a touch <UNK> on the <UNK> on occasions then a few dozen serious films made since then including <UNK> and the which bears certain similarities and is a notable failure in convincing qualities compared to this film can be <UNK> for exactly the same reason br br also despite <UNK> the film has a plot quite a well <UNK> plot at that it simply does not bow to standard form quality by providing <UNK> heroes <UNK> of sub plots and confusion it experiments with telling in a manner more like much smaller modest films by carefully caught moments of character interaction and well <UNK> <UNK> like explosions of <UNK> action as with the opening at <UNK> and most specially the wonderful scene where the johnson county folk following the lead of a brilliantly physical <UNK> make celebration on roller <UNK> br br 'the deer <UNK> was a critical and commercial success but abandoned the first <UNK> inspired <UNK> like <UNK> of detail and i think in a manner similar to criticism of robert penn <UNK> novel <UNK> the king's <UNK> and its <UNK> of stunts if <UNK> had not had such a strong grasp of the conventions of hollywood epics he might have made a special rare work of art based in honest of people within their <UNK> in contrast succeeds in <UNK> its narrative momentum and tension <UNK> in a slowly <UNK> arc until the finale explodes whilst not <UNK> the <UNK> approach br br the central romantic triangle for instance <UNK> standard <UNK> a decent intelligent but <UNK> defeated man james kris kristofferson <UNK> with a hot shot but identity challenged young <UNK> <UNK> champion christopher walken for the hand of a young <UNK> ella watson isabelle <UNK> there is no self conscious bed <UNK> no <UNK> in the face <UNK> or typical sad sack moments but more a sad and <UNK> decision by ella to choose the younger man whom she loves less because he is ready to make the commitment ella emerges as the film's true hero <UNK> performance though initially awkward is really quite excellent <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> with a hard <UNK> spirit attempting first to rescue <UNK> and then the resistance party of immigrants into an <UNK> <UNK> subsequently is <UNK> into action as friends die indeed in the process of <UNK> so many traps of cliché and style successfully and <UNK> throws off the defeated <UNK> heroes grace note of so many '70s westerns and portrays an eventual <UNK> cheer the heroes <UNK> to a <UNK> but still <UNK> victory br br the social conflict of so many '70s westerns at last into a fully <UNK> war where capital attempts a <UNK> final victory over the <UNK> who stand in their way suddenly they find a and more powerful people's army led by the man who played the thoroughly destroyed billy the kid a decade before this is what led the film to be described as the first <UNK> western but really it simply <UNK> a theme of the genre <UNK> well before the '60s such various and classic old school works as william <UNK> 'the and even tell awfully similar stories it is simply here that the romantic myth of the <UNK> has been replaced by the romantic myth of the people's revolt in a spectacular <UNK> but realistic and thus chaotic finale the <UNK> is attacked <UNK> by dust clouds <UNK> by fallen horses <UNK> bodies and <UNK> puts his classical education to work finally by stealing a roman trick and bringing the <UNK> to the brink of <UNK> before they are rescued by the <UNK> another distinctly touch but surely not so offensive after <UNK> big man's <UNK> depiction of native american <UNK> really it's hard to think of a more <UNK> american vision of <UNK> resistance the film's only real dead spot stands as an unnecessary <UNK> <UNK> eventual a rather <UNK> piece of tragedy br br despite then certain <UNK> and a slow mid section is a supreme piece of work a genuine attempt to create a contemporary western and a new kind of epic if one has to still join the chorus that <UNK> <UNK> was absurd in his behaviour on set and <UNK> it is <UNK> when today <UNK> like 'the adventures of <UNK> and 19 the see nearly a hundred million dollars sink down the drain and yet a tag of <UNK> still hangs on this film one <UNK> what exactly its grim death <UNK> the attempt at original style the <UNK> sexuality the very hard won sense of detail the breathtaking <UNK> of the film making and what is being filmed all throw into contrast what is sorely lacking in so much contemporary hollywood product
<START> i love it i love <UNK> shore it seems some people don't agree it's humor and he's not like everyone else the movie is great i love the story line and most of the people in the movie it's funny from the first time she meets him at school i like the fact that she chooses him over the guy back home i like that <UNK> isn't a bad girl in the end all the secrets are let out only the people you want to see are left in the end except for those of you who don't like <UNK> shore even if you don't like him there are funny parts and her family <UNK> him through most of the movie she's country girl gone wild and needs to be heard she finally makes it it's got just the right amount of love and romance i give it an 8 out of 10
<START> jeff just before dawn is definitely one of the most underrated horror movies ever made the film whilst a little bit influenced by deliverance and the texas chain saw massacre is extremely creepy and memorable the suspense almost never lets up and the atmosphere is genuinely eerie the cast is excellent deborah benson and jamie rose are great female leads the <UNK> twins are truly frightening and <UNK> killers the film is beautifully shot it was actually filmed on location at silver falls state park in <UNK> there is very little gore but one killing when is stabbed in the <UNK> is pretty nasty and unpleasant a must see for slasher fans 10 out of 10 what else
<START> the college teacher larry <UNK> billy <UNK> is a <UNK> writer since his former wife kate <UNK> ruined him stealing his novel that became a best <UNK> he does not hide his hatred for <UNK> his girlfriend beth ryan kim <UNK> who is an <UNK> teacher in the same college while giving classes of creative writing he is stalked by the student owen danny <UNK> that wants to know his opinion about his crime tale larry tells that he did not like it and explains that in every mystery tale the murderer should eliminate the motive and establish an <UNK> otherwise he would get caught further larry suggests owen to watch hitchcock's movies to understand the structure of a suspenseful story owen who wants to kill his <UNK> mother anne <UNK> watches strangers on a train and <UNK> <UNK> advice believing that his teacher wants to <UNK> murders to eliminate the motive owen travels to hawaii and while in a ship falls overboard <UNK> in the sea and is considered dead however larry does not have an <UNK> and becomes the prime suspect while the deranged owen <UNK> him to kill his mother as part of their supposed deal br br throw <UNK> from the train is one of the funniest comedies of the 80's and a great tribute to alfred hitchcock the direct reference is strangers on a train but there are jokes with vertigo with the spinning camera family plot with the car without breaks and other movies the lines are excellent and there is an interesting point when larry tells that every great romance or mystery has a train anne <UNK> is amazing in the role of a nasty and abusive <UNK> mother and the viewer will certainly feel sorrow and understand the insanity of owen kim <UNK> is very beautiful and kate <UNK> is the perfect bitch billy <UNK> performs an obsessed character with many silly and <UNK> attitudes but necessary to the plot my vote is seven br br title brazil a do throw <UNK> from the train
<START> somehow i missed many of the early <UNK> episodes so i'm seeing them in all sorts of orders as they are repeated on various channels i first caught it entirely by accident whilst <UNK> in a hotel room the first 10 seconds had me completely hooked this is what sf is all about br br the characters are strong and pilot the living ship is what should have been the plots <UNK> in quality but none falls below excellent in my opinion and i have to mention what a <UNK> <UNK> character none of your smarmy sugar <UNK> star trek aliens here this is the real deal cynical self serving and <UNK> with disgusting personal <UNK> is the creation of a genius br br last week the scifi channel showed out of their minds the body <UNK> episode a true classic i couldn't stop laughing from start to finish br br long may <UNK> grace our screens
<START> i finally got hold of the excellent dvd of this film which is loaded with interesting extras i have read quite a lot about it and i unfortunately missed it at the <UNK> film festival it doesn't quite deliver as i thought it would but it is still worth watching if you like strange and unique movies i much rather watch this again than any of the recent so called horror films <UNK> out of hollywood these days what <UNK> from the experience for me is certain music <UNK> which sound dated and rely too much on cheap <UNK> sounds for me all these <UNK> <UNK> elements of the score could have been lifted out and replaced by david excellent sound design but that is just my opinion otherwise this is a daring angry picture with welcome <UNK> and poetic parts like the <UNK> of the photograph sequence which is beautiful i look forward to seeing <UNK> and i applaud mitch and for their efforts in producing non mainstream cinema they are a great inspiration as i soon <UNK> on my own short film production
<START> a wonderful movie about people i first saw four friends when it was originally shown in theatres and i've seen it many times since if i'm not watching it when it's on tv i'll get together with friends and rent it <UNK> the people i've watched this movie with find it enjoyable it deals with friends from childhood to <UNK> in the 50's and 60's it's very funny and touching dealing with first love and first sex racism war politics the whole 60's <UNK> it can also be quite dramatic if you enjoy movies about people this one is definitely worth the time
<START> its a truly awful movie with a laughable storyline some awful acting and a script that ed wood might be ashamed of wagner is laughable in this he plays his role like number two in austin powers easily the worst of the airport movies 1 out of 10
<START> once again i fell for it in my roots i <UNK> a fun and gory horror film even a vampire one even if it's stupid as long as i get my fun gore in the mix i'm a happy <UNK> it doesn't take much so i saw the cover of <UNK> over at hollywood video and was kind of curious what it was about it looked kind of interesting so i decided to rent it why why do i always fall for it not only did this movie not fulfill the satisfaction i needed for my gore and senseless violence and nudity but i was bored out of mind this movie has the to say it's a vampire movie and it's really not i'm so close to going back to the store and begging for money back because this is one of the rare times i actually turned the movie off br br an artist meets a vampire i think <UNK> i'm still trying to figure out what the heck he was but his name was so i'm assuming maybe he's a <UNK> eating guy who likes to freak people out i think i <UNK> anyways he thinks the artist has a certain <UNK> for darkness so he gives her a drug to go into an alternate fantasy where a vampire exists and needs blood to become alive i think i <UNK> so her friends get excited and decide they wanna try the drug too i think i <UNK> so after they decide to try the drug things get weird the fantasies are real i think i <UNK> and the vampire is now enjoying the will big <UNK> girls in clad clothing i think i <UNK> but a couple of the girls really end up being vampires i think i <UNK> br br sorry for all the i this is possibly one of the worst reviews i'm going to write but that's because this movie was just awful boring and confusing i love just seeing these wanna be actors who you can tell are <UNK> looking for that big break not too smart that they fell in the cliché of the horror genre sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't in this case they really should have read the script because the movie the look the feel the acting everything about this movie was just bad i really recommend that you just pass the movie if you see it at your video store this possibly could have been an interesting movie with it's concept of a different dimension but why did they pick this director to display his creativity if he even has any this was a bad movie just stay away br br 1 10
<START> blade is a fantastic action thriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and wesley snipes delivers what i would say to be his best performance yet br br this film has everything that you would ask for in an action thriller it has plenty of blood guts and gore a twisted disturbed bad buy moments of humour but most importantly a very good story line with plenty of twists br br their is constant action throughout the film with breathtaking stunts and effects wesley snipes fighting movement is fantastic br br this film is in my opinion a must see wesley snipes cool solid appearance makes this film and i can't wait for the sequel <UNK> <UNK> being released next year br br my imdb rating 9 out of 10
<START> wow this is the movie that should be shown on tv at two in the morning on <UNK> for all those <UNK> lord knows they'd probably pass out from boredom watching this movie terrible acting the killer is quite far from scary i've seen <UNK> at <UNK> that were scarier <UNK> of unnecessary in this film pseudo porn scenes which are just horrible in more ways than a million a soap opera style script which really hurt the movie and the director really had no flair for whatever genre he was trying to create with this film i could see a group of teenagers with their parents <UNK> doing better work than this i don't think there is a part of me that could recommend this film to anyone
<START> simply i just watched this movie just because of sarah am also giving these 4 stars just because of her on the other side this movie was easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen was horrible the script was uninspired this was a movie that kept <UNK> itself the film was sloppy and unoriginal its not like i was expecting a good film just something to give me a jump or two this did not even do that br br he worst thing is that the more i think about the overall plot the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we keep finding a real shame really as i'm fairly sure that there was a good idea lurking in there somewhere br br i'm perhaps being a bit harsh giving the film a 4 10 but given the actors involved and again sara obvious writing talent this film really should have delivered far more br br this movie is just crap i cant put it differently since the very beginning one knows is going to be crap br br the story dialogue acting special effects make up pretty much everything sucks i like vampire movies and i know they will never be oscar winning movies but this one is not even worth seeing i can't believe how somebody produced this thing br br it's not even about vampires it's more about a dream reality experience the development of the movie is incoherent the motivation of the characters is doesn't exist everything seems like a big joke maybe that's what they tried to do but i sincerely doubt it i wish i knew what they tried to pull but it just <UNK> it's definitely one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life and i've seen many bad movies but nothing compared to this please make yourselves a favor and do not watch this br br p s it's also full of clichés p s 2 bad script bad directing bad cinematography p s 3 i bothered commenting on this as a favor to everyone
<START> this is one of those made for tv b movies that is so awful it kind of br br bad acting predictable script and cheesy special effects that were pretty much some of the <UNK> <UNK> seen make you have to keep watching to see if it gets any better br br it doesn't
<START> inside i'm dancing <UNK> <UNK> was here is the story of two handicapped young men <UNK> <UNK> who is almost completely and confined to wheelchair and michael <UNK> who is by ms and also confined to a wheelchair br br set in ireland the film opens with <UNK> arriving at a <UNK> living center he eventually befriends michael but only after a few tense scenes where <UNK> rebels against the staff and other patients in the usual movie way playing loud metal music using profanity and general <UNK> his budding friendship with michael is <UNK> by the fact that <UNK> seems to be the only one who understands michael or is at least willing to try br br eventually through some trial and <UNK> the pair <UNK> and are granted the right to live own their own in specially adapted apartment the apartment is paid for by michael's father who had essentially abandoned him do to his <UNK> the two also hire an attractive assistant named <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> to help them with their day to day living this is essentially where the <UNK> of the film develops as both develop feelings for her michael is struck particularly hard unfortunately for both but michael especially <UNK> does not feel the same and it results in her having to leave as michael <UNK> <UNK> and wants to return to the <UNK> living center <UNK> convinces him to continue to live on his own the film ends on a sad note that many viewers may have seen coming but ultimately we are left feeling that michael has truly become independent and the future is his as <UNK> pointed out to him towards the end of movie br br you know i can't say that i've seen a lot of handicapped films and i don't know if they could be considered a specific genre but there is a type of formula to them one person is unwilling to live beyond his illness until some <UNK> force <UNK> him her to do so and inside i'm dancing is really know different what works however is it probably is more subtle about the peaks and <UNK> the two men go through then what you might expect there are no intentionally gratuitous moments and no stand up and cheer <UNK> the sad parts are sad and the funny parts are funny some viewers might <UNK> a bit that <UNK> is the <UNK> haired punk type with the <UNK> in his nose as the too perfect rebel cliché but the actor james <UNK> somehow makes it real the same can be said for steven robertson who plays michael when michael's heart is broken it doesn't seem to be <UNK> by a poor script trying to get the audience worked up but rather a young man genuinely in pain over <UNK> love the kind of pain many can relate to whatever their physical condition again these are the types of things that make the film work and make it poignant without being overbearing and enjoyable on many levels br br recommended
<START> i've only seen most of the series since i leave the tv on as background noise in my <UNK> br br i've been a fan of <UNK> but this show really doesn't do much for me occasionally he'll say or do something to pull a chuckle out but he has this aura of <UNK> that completely ruins it br br i've always thought he was funny because of his raging angry man routine that's not terribly prevalent in this tv series instead he's just smug i guess that just reflects how funny his comedy is stale and uninteresting when he isn't in the proper mode of delivery i've seen him get into it sometimes on his show but for the most part he just sits there smiling and looking smug and it doesn't suit him well br br just my opinion though
<START> this movie had horrible lighting and terrible camera movements this movie is a <UNK> horror flick with no meaning at all the <UNK> are totally fake looking it looks like some 17 year old idiot wrote this movie and a 10 year old kid shot it with the worst acting you can ever find people are tired of knives at least move on to guns or fire it has almost exact lines from when a stranger calls with gruesome killings only crazy people would enjoy this movie it is obvious the writer doesn't have kids or even care for them i mean at show some mercy just to sum it up this movie is a b movie and it sucked just for your own sake don't even think about wasting your time watching this crappy movie
<START> this film stands as one of the most amazing examples of compelling and <UNK> film making i've every seen <UNK> seems to capture the almost <UNK> tragedy and beauty of story as well as his endearing personal character by the end of the film i was left wishing that i'd had the opportunity to meet <UNK> before his passing br br on a technical note the cinematography is intimate and <UNK> beautiful the narrative is <UNK> woven with great awareness of the subject and his capacity for <UNK> and <UNK> traumatic events few documentary directors have so strong an ability to so thoroughly <UNK> the audience in the character this film is a must see
<START> i have seen this movie many times and i never get sick of it it is about a man coming out of the closet that he doesn't know he is in kevin <UNK> character is a teacher and when one of his former students <UNK> <UNK> character is gay the people in his town start to <UNK> whether he is straight or gay <UNK> character starts to wonder if he is straight or gay too the acting is absolutely fabulous and hilarious by all the cast i found the movie very funny and heart warming i love this movie it makes you laugh and makes you feel good while watching it i recommend this movie to everyone you will have a great time watching it
<START> i watched 5 of this movie tonight and you may tell me that i need to see the whole movie to understand it but frankly i don't think so br br what the hell is the story in this movie i saw a lot of people running around in a factory shooting at everything around them br br where to start okay br br 1 they were shooting around the place as if it was the terminator or something they were trying to kill the entire place is made of metal but not a single bullet <UNK> on the <UNK> <UNK> br br 2 no <UNK> metal vs metal is bound to cause but apparently no one got hit by a stray bullet br br 3 magic bullets in one scene a bad guy is standing right in front of a good guy when another good guy pops out behind the bad guy and <UNK> him full of metal you see the bullets exit his chest as it explodes in a bloody <UNK> but the good guy right in front of him doesn't get hurt at all 4 after having just <UNK> a human being all over the wall the two good guys tell each other some jokes and they laugh and look like teenagers playing with soft guns br br 5 sound at one point the good guys cut a wire and an alarm goes off who the hell cuts a wire just to set off an alarm the lady screams out alarm in <UNK> blah blah and the bad guy boss says okay this is not a <UNK> blah blah in a very very amateur kinda way <UNK> we're getting <UNK> by terrorists this isn't a <UNK> but i'm gonna sound like i don't give crap br br 6 focus first you see the bad guys load up on weapons for some reason the same guy gets the same <UNK> twice <UNK> <UNK> or loop of scenes you literally see every single bad guy receive the same kind of weapon and they lock and load the same way the weapons dealer pops in the clip and the bad guy extra no <UNK> locks and loads when they started opening fire you had to see the barrel flashes <UNK> 7 actors or <UNK> one of the presumed good guys throw down a smoke <UNK> for some reason and of course the bad guys are suddenly inside the smoke because they're smoke blind or something so they don't see it coming they <UNK> and <UNK> as if it was <UNK> in the <UNK> then a semi boss bad guy arrives and he doesn't even <UNK> when he enters the smoke he just pushes the other bad guys away and they suddenly realize that the smoke isn't <UNK> anyway br br 8 b flick i think yeah a guy <UNK> down a metal <UNK> wielding a <UNK> in his right hand shooting away at someone in his eye height apparently i'd like to see a guy fire a <UNK> with one hand and i'd like to see him go get his hand afterwards extra bloody gore mess in a b flick kinda way small pops and a red hole with a torn shirt <UNK> that this guy is dead though the first bullet hit his heart the good guy who is a super trained green <UNK> still feel the urge to empty his clip into the dead guy br br 9 one of these mentioned trained soldiers jump out from his hide with an empty clip how stupid can you be always check your clip before facing an unknown amount of enemies 10 boring scenes like the barrel flash scenes and the lock and load scenes the movie is filled with time wasting scenes of people running around in an apparently empty building cut to the action if you're going for a b flick movie please br br my two cents on this movie
<START> i just took my 11 year old daughter and 8 year old son to this movie and i can't remember a movie where i laughed so hard literal out loud deep bursts of laughter because this movie is hilarious granted the story line is predictable but the ride is so extremely enjoyable it doesn't matter that you know how it's going to end the actors' comedic senses of timing were impeccable the actors were perfectly cast my children mentioned that amanda <UNK> seems to be the last of the young women actresses who aren't ruining their lives she is so refreshing my children said this is now their favorite movie of 2006 our money was well spent on this movie
<START> normally i do not review online but it's saturday and i'm trapped in my room on a rainy day with nothing to do but watch sci fi movies and <UNK> warrior princess i can't get the damned the song out of my head it's been there for the past ten years or so just pops up randomly when someone me does something idiotic if you have any complaints about this movie and actually post them on the internet do you have any idea how much of an idiot you look like if you expect more out of bruce campbell than what he puts out in the most literal sense than why in g <UNK> holy name do you watch his movies no one watches a bruce campbell movie when they want to see something genius and <UNK> we watch them so we feel better about ourselves like those people who watch jerry springer and eat <UNK> monkey and to be easily entertained by mindless psycho <UNK> i personally love bruce campbell movies i'm not a complete idiot in fact i see myself as an intellectual and a <UNK> haha shut up ally his movies reflect insane random quirky ridiculous ideals which anyone with a brain screaming or no can enjoy that and he was kind of sexy on <UNK> warrior princess even with the facial hair i rate this movie an excellent 10 just because i can if you can't take simplistic plot schemes if any hot babes in sci fi <UNK> leather <UNK> and familiar if not exhausted views of insanity then <UNK> out loud don't watch the movie or any that so much as mention the name bruce campbell oh yeah ted <UNK> was awesome in this movie way to go ted you did the best with what you had
<START> it seems a lot of europeans and americans see indian movies for the wrong reason i see some people are complaining that this movie did not have any dance sequence a class apart from their hindi counterparts movies tend to be more realistic is one of the best young directors in india being widely known for his choice of subjects for the movies and the strength of his scripts is a perfect example a faithful adaptation of the <UNK> <UNK> novel dealing with the pursuit of sexual pleasure of a widow the director gives a new dimension to the much acclaimed and controversial work
<START> maybe it's just that it was made in 1997 or maybe whoever managed to get this up to a 7 has a soft spot for kids with aids but really people the <UNK> laughter mayhem during the <UNK> scene did you not see that coming i'm surprised there was no baby <UNK> across the ceiling and addressing the camera the acting was fine sure but to me this is just one example of a movie from a time when situations and subject matter could pass for cinematic language things happen but that's it there's no <UNK> or motive that can be <UNK> on screen allowing the subject matter to use pre existing emotional connections to the plot without the script doing it like it's supposed to
<START> i live and work in <UNK> kentucky the town where zombie planet was filmed i'd heard about the film forever ago from various people who claimed to be a critical part of the production then for several years i heard absolutely nothing imagine my surprise when i found it sitting all by itself at the local video store just <UNK> for a rental so being the <UNK> that i am i decided to give these local filmmakers a shot br br bad idea br br zombie planet is overlong boring poorly acted miserably shot and that's just the good stuff i tried my hardest to enjoy it which included <UNK> my brain and setting it on the table so that it wouldn't get in the way of the horrible storyline alas nothing worked zombie planet is so bad it's pathetic and the very idea that they're planning a sequel leads me to believe that the director and his henchmen have listened to none of the criticisms i'm sure they've heard move on you guys please in fact <UNK> from film making altogether or attend a few classes on pacing storytelling and well basic direction br br otherwise for the love of god hang it up
<START> as everyone knows nobody can play scarlett o'hara like <UNK> leigh and nobody can play <UNK> butler like clark gable all others pale in comparison and timothy dalton and <UNK> <UNK> are no exceptions one thing that i really couldn't get past was that <UNK> has brown eyes the green eyes were the most <UNK> feature of <UNK> good looks and in this sequel she has been stripped of those br br the movie as well as the book had several <UNK> in it the new characters weren't all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever it could be that i'm only 11 but i saw no change in her attitude until the last say 10 minutes when <UNK> told her she had grown up if <UNK> hadn't told her that i would have never guessed that there was any change in her attitude she really loved cat her baby she likes this child best because she had it with <UNK> her only loved husband still if you've read gone with the wind you would see that children make no difference in <UNK> world br br quite frankly it seemed to me like there was way too much going on without <UNK> all anybody cares about is whether or not <UNK> and scarlett get back together and scarlett took way too long to get to that it is virtually nothing compared to gone with the wind but then again what isn't if you have read the novel you will like that better than the movie br br i would watch it just because it is the sequel to gone with the wind regardless of whether or not it's worthwhile it may not satisfy you entirely but it will get you some of the way there
<START> and there are not many in cinema history <UNK> seems to be a bit of a hope hope in mankind and in life but to say only that may be naive <UNK> could find the right way to tell the story of that <UNK> judge and the but wise model perhaps that old and disappointing love affair will not be repeated there's the new couple with the young judge after the accident but what to say about this master of the camera you can't miss a second of the movie because you have to watch every and each one of those faces <UNK> loved human beings and that is quite evident in the way the camera treats the actors ms <UNK> and mr are perfect it's not only this movie but the downbeat <UNK> shall not kill and a story about love that may you think about contemporary cinema as a way of expressing an <UNK> point of view pity american public the average one could not see these films at least they are not in the <UNK> <UNK> and even the <UNK> does not know what to say about this unique man <UNK>
<START> pure schlock from beginning to end the average 12 year old might find that it has an interesting take on <UNK> otherwise it's a pure camp fest <UNK> test like one of those so so episodes of star trek the next generation that thinks it has something important to say br br you'll see every plot twist a mile off in this by the numbers romp however it's worth seeing for its portrayal of drag king prostitutes a <UNK> where young women pay old men to have sex with them <UNK> that for role <UNK> and lesbian soap operas the ghost of valerie lives
<START> this should carry a government health warning if you play it in your dvd machine you are in serious risk of opening a <UNK> in the space time <UNK> and disappearing without trace into it so bad is this <UNK> br br the fact that this movie was so successful is evidence of the true desperate state of modern hollywood cinema and the <UNK> <UNK> of films that appeal to the common although i truly dread to think of the common that this film actually appeals to br br i think hollywood were just <UNK> some kind of proving trials when they made and screened this film i can imagine the executive <UNK> <UNK> at the studio just how bad a film can we actually get away with making and still make loads of money holy cow i didn't realise we could go that bad br br the only films worse than this that i can think of and trust me it is close are die another day rip the bond franchise as i knew it and independence day br br avoid avoid avoid
<START> i really enjoy this genre but the cell was one of the worst movies i've ever been unfortunate enough to watch while about 25 percent of my audience <UNK> in and out of the theater during the viewing or left entirely i was dumb enough to stick it out the main problems with this story there were too many to list all is that with this type of film you have to do two things one provide fear of the killer being that they catch him twenty minutes into the film that's gone and you must give the victim whose life is at stake the girl in the tank enough character development that you actually care whether they get to her in time or not not only did i lose track of the girl i was given such little insight into her that she was only a <UNK> face and when i did remember she was part of the story i really didn't care what happened to her while the visuals were interesting in an <UNK> flashback sort of way they often times made no sense and this should be a lesson that visuals can't make up for lack of a good story see phantom menace for another example finally does anyone know or care what was up with the women <UNK> in that field and staring at the sky ridiculous
<START> <UNK> top in a full length movie enough said only reason this doesn't get a one is through my personal voting system of only one 1 and one 10 and this is no extreme <UNK> horrible god awful there are some movies that are so bad they are unintentionally funny then there are movies that make you physically <UNK> and then there are those that lead to serious <UNK> of suicide burn all copies of the movie shoot anyone who had non creative <UNK> on this movie torture anyone with any creative <UNK> and as for the star there are only so many things that can be said online but he should be begging for the final ten seconds of existence with a severed head by the time the work is done
<START> this is such a fun and funny movie highly entertaining at all angles it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts we got the judge the <UNK> the kid the creepy old lady the slut the clown and unfortunately they all live in a big house that doesn't have any locks and is so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous we also learn a lesson along the way never give your patient an <UNK> br br this was before nest and surpasses it at least on the fun level it even has its sweet moments love is pure love is grace love is strength you love me your love is pure you'll always love me now who could resist that nuts are humans too just a few loose <UNK> be a little careful or you'll get an <UNK> in the back children at play <UNK> br br the <UNK> <UNK> man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine all the characters in this film are tremendously well played and i really did find them funny no hilarious they may even give you dirty thoughts of how you can take advantage of them or how they can take advantage of you br br this is actually a very smart movie there is a brilliant twist ending i must say i expected this to be a good but never expected this it is horrific the court has made its decision you are no longer in control i love it the ending is so so perfect you'll shed a tear br br i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this i will never forget it now it is not just a cult it is a cult classic whatever you do don't look in the basement
<START> i don't know how people can watch this the only people who enjoy watching this are those who have no feelings and emotions and enjoy watching people die houses burn down car crashes babies die and cast members being killed off every week its the most absurd thing on television and i still don't know how it pulls in the ratings its so depressing i can imagine the writers sitting down and saying <UNK> who shall we kill of next week <UNK> or house shall we torch in a months time ' br br its the most depressing absurd and most stupid thing on tv at the moment and i cant understand peoples motives for watching this depressing pile of crap anymore
<START> though not a huge fan i am a three stooges <UNK> i believe that their best work by far was with curly as the third <UNK> and their earliest films are generally their best that's because after a while they began <UNK> their films and the gags started to get stale here in 1934 they were still rather fresh in more ways than one and funny br br here they boys play very <UNK> roles respected doctors in a hospital the three run amok acting silly hitting each other and <UNK> the pants off anyone who expects to get better the non stop energy and <UNK> make this one a must see for fans br br by the way although i liked this film i strongly recommend you try to find a much lesser known short from tiny educational pictures nifty <UNK> is much like men in black but manages to be funnier and is about the best hospital comedy of the era better even than laurel <UNK> county hospital
<START> surely the best film directed by claude <UNK> after <UNK> the jacques life inspiration is really present richard and jean paul <UNK> played a really amazing duo and are really great in the psychological discovery of the two characters they are playing
<START> i really wanted to like this film for all sorts of reasons the subject matter is <UNK> interesting and is probably the major issue facing the world today and has thrown up fascinating works e g linda <UNK> when i lived in modern times usually from the israeli side of the fence also a bloke i like told me he thought it was the best film he'd seen all year so with such a recommendation br br however i actually found myself <UNK> off at points admittedly i was tired and the cinema seats <UNK> but i found it too much hard work trying to identify with the characters once i'd got my head round the idea that it was a series of vignettes i went with it but this made it <UNK> like a sketch show rather than a film i liked the concept of a restrained almost silent <UNK> en scene <UNK> to these <UNK> moments the sexy girl the red balloon and the ninja muslim fighter but personally i think the film has been over hyped i'm not saying narrative and plot is everything it's definitely not but even a little more dialogue would have helped
<START> this is a really cute movie i had a massive <UNK> girls 10 11 and they absolutely loved this movie they watched it twice don't let the rating fool you you have to be 13 or older to rate a movie on imdb that <UNK> the movie's target audience if you have a girl or boy between 7 and 13 i guarantee they'll enjoy this movie br br sort of a gender <UNK> <UNK> hill set in high school aaron carter plays a famous pop star who is failing his <UNK> classes his mom sends him to a regular high school with the ultimatum pass high school or no summer tour taking the advice of his manager former pop star david cassidy he befriends the <UNK> girl in school <UNK> austin with plans to <UNK> off her look for the humorous and insightful janitor another former pop star <UNK>
<START> this film was such a mess i actually <UNK> my friends who i dragged to see it the only reason i went to see it was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the shoot br br i'm sure that this film was meant to be campy but the approach was so heavy handed and self <UNK> it turned out really flat judd nelson stars as an <UNK> garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side his life is hell and made worse by his obnoxious and overbearing companion bill paxton who i feel embarrassed for this was a really tasteless role for a talented actor a freak accident <UNK> <UNK> career course and mayhem ensues br br the attempts at humor were corny predictable and often base and tasteless wayne <UNK> in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty but he adds nothing <UNK> or otherwise br br overall it's a very weak and <UNK> attempt at camp humor that goes over like a lead balloon at least you could laugh at plan 9 from outer space this one just makes you wonder who thought this was a good enough idea to <UNK> and film one of the all time worst bombs you'll ever witness
<START> i caught this about the most unlikely success from a lower league football team the plot is thick and roles out some great <UNK> twists and turns <UNK> with shots and commentary from the 70's i was taken <UNK> by its <UNK> fun br br a great cast includes the excellent tim <UNK> as the crazed drunk manager bumbling along hanging on to anything that will make his team win i keep remembering bits such as the stolen secret file that don super united and england manager loved by the fans hated by everyone else has on united the men which in its detailed report of their opposition united in this the <UNK> cup final merely says sh <UNK> br br lots of other gags a long time before the fantastic feature length mike <UNK> football manager starring ricky <UNK> br br up there with the <UNK> ho english beating germans at football well morally although the score lines says different of escape to victory i still cheer when england score br br and the <UNK> eternal <UNK> of following a really bad team in micheal golden gordon from ripping <UNK> series with terry jones the team were called united in case your interested br br i've looked high and low for a copy of cup even nick <UNK> biography doesn't list it probably someone not mr error br br play it again or sell me a copy please
<START> this was the best film i saw in the year 2000 the cohen brothers have never let me down before and they certainly didn't this time either br br it's one of those rare movies these days it's witty intelligent and vastly entertaining i left the cinema with a warmth in my heart of course there's lot of cohen stuff in there odd characters and peculiar <UNK> well developed plot and magic <UNK> but no cohen film is resembling any other cohen film if you overlook the general quality of them of course br br the big surprise for me was that clooney is so good but the true master performance in this movie comes from tim blake nelson but the rest of the cast is superb too br br a film that is lightweight comedy with a musical touch that <UNK> it's story round <UNK> and old time country music dripping with wit and intelligence thats a very unlikely combination but it's exactly what this picture is
<START> never been <UNK> starring drew as reporter <UNK> <UNK> is a sweet extremely sappy and sometimes quite painful tale of a <UNK> woman named <UNK> <UNK> who though brilliant is quiet and shy and has never been <UNK> by a man she is assigned her first major news story for the newspaper she works for to go undercover as a high school student <UNK> the popular cool kids and get a scoop as to what really goes on in the world of high school only problem is <UNK> has never been popular high school was in fact a <UNK> experience for her as she was the <UNK> of quite a lot of <UNK> and cruel jokes <UNK> grabs this assignment as much to finally fit in as to get a scoop what she finds is the major premise of the story br br never been <UNK> is one of those movies that's so sappy and <UNK> at times particularly in a few scenes at the end that the limits of believability are sorely tested and many a <UNK> may not like this movie it is however very <UNK> done drew is perfect as the bumbling yet lovely <UNK> she <UNK> a breath of fresh air into the character and makes her appear perfectly realistic i also enjoyed <UNK> as the intellectual student who befriends <UNK> on her first day at the school br br never been <UNK> has some really funny moments as <UNK> <UNK> in her frantic efforts to be cool example the <UNK> bar scene i also loved the appearance of brother rob who also goes back and signs up as a high school student the way that he helps to give <UNK> her dream of finally fitting in is just hilarious at the same time as <UNK> story of her original years in high school are shown in flashback it is extremely painful you do not need to have had similar experiences in high school to <UNK> to be affected by her story drew is wonderful at making her character have a personal connection with the audience and we adore <UNK> from the beginning br br there is a lot of mean girls a 2004 release in this movie but mean girls honestly was a lot <UNK> never been <UNK> becomes very much a romantic <UNK> as <UNK> develops feelings for a certain man and the question becomes will they get together br br i liked this movie it was really beautifully done in some areas the movie is corny in some places yes the last scene realistic no way does this movie manipulate your emotions in the most obvious hollywood way oh yeah yeah yeah baby but it <UNK> beautifully there are some lessons to be learned here the movie never <UNK> but manages to paint an accurate picture of what high school was like for a <UNK> few i have actually met people who have had similar experiences to <UNK> i've met people very much like all these characters i think a lot of people simply don't know or can't <UNK> of the cruelty that can exist in the world of high school and how <UNK> it can be but it's there not unrealistic at all what struck me was <UNK> speech at the prom as she demonstrates the sheep mentality that can exist so as hollywood and <UNK> as many think that may be it was well done and very true br br i'm making never been <UNK> sound a lot <UNK> then it is in truth this is a perfect movie to pick when one wants a sweet feel good light heartwarming picture it's engaging <UNK> acted and just <UNK> i'd say check it out 8 of 10
<START> cia <UNK> douglas freeman <UNK> gets to see his first secret location <UNK> when <UNK> is accused of having contact with a known terrorist bomb maker wife <UNK> is frantic regarding the <UNK> of her husband br br don't you just hate it when the title of a movie sends you to a <UNK> i must have an old edition as this rendition is not a musical piece no it's the <UNK> way of <UNK> taking a resident or citizen somewhere to <UNK> him and possibly use some torture to get the desired information br br while watching this movie i was reminded of a similar story line in the crossing jordan tv show now off the air and i expect we will see even more of these story lines it's inevitable the events of <UNK> are the br br this is a tough one to watch because we don't like to see people tortured and our government not telling the truth about things we like the idea that no matter what happens or happened that we can go somewhere to find answers but when that door is closed to us we are truly lost and without hope as wife was br br performances by all were first class and it's possible we may see more of i have no idea how to <UNK> it because he resembles and can act like telly <UNK> no kidding br br violence yes sex no nudity no language yes
<START> <UNK> was one of cannon <UNK> biggest <UNK> it received mostly bad reviews and did nothing to help director tobe <UNK> career in the wake of the spielberg <UNK> controversy all of this is unfortunate because <UNK> is actually a really great movie it is <UNK> entertaining moves along at a fast pace and features some of the most outrageously over the top direction production performances and special effects ever to explode across the screen it must have looked bizarre on paper the producers of the <UNK> force the screenwriter of alien the director of the texas chainsaw massacre the composer of breakfast at <UNK> the special effects <UNK> of star wars audiences were not ready for this demented exercise in weirdness br br what more do you want we got an alien spaceship full of giant bats we got a sexy naked space <UNK> sucking out people's souls we got exploding bodies we got zombies we got possession we got an s m <UNK> we got the entire city of london on fire it's dracula meets night of the living dead meets and the pit meets <UNK> it's quite possibly the single most outrageous horror sci fi comedy action disaster erotic apocalyptic epic ever unleashed that is if there are any other ones out there br br try watching this movie while <UNK> altered perhaps then you'll understand a genuinely f ed up experience and one of director tobe <UNK> most underrated movies maybe one day it will find its audience
<START> i <UNK> this but i am an 80's kid i loved <UNK> bright my whole childhood i don't know if little ones these days would be very interested in the show mine wasn't but thats okay i bought it for me anyway i just brought the little one so the guy at the <UNK> stand wouldn't look at me funny i love the non violent drama and the colorful scenery it just reminds me of a simpler time before cartoons had more violence than our local news can <UNK> show although i may be just a little biased on the subject <UNK> i was <UNK> bright 6 years in a row for halloween i wonder if they make a <UNK> bright costume for adults lol
<START> i think this movie is different apart from most films i've seen it was exciting in a way and no matter what others say i say i was surprised about the final solution certainly didn't see it coming although it's sad it's worth watching i can't think of any movie that would be like this actors knew what they were doing if you say this movie sucks you say probably what most people would say but if someone says that this movie is ordinary i absolutely don't agree and norman <UNK> should be more noticed br br maybe i'm freak but i liked this very much it was kind of mess but who cares i'm tired of boring and ordinary movies
<START> the greatest tragedy man faces is that capable so often of the divine he <UNK> for the banal from this fact does so much great tragedy emerge death in <UNK> is one of very few films with the patience and bravery to tackle this fact head on it confronts the human eye with beauty and inspiration in their two most inevitable human forms self denial and <UNK> undoubtedly this is the greatest film to have no <UNK> influence on mainstream cinema its <UNK> look <UNK> sound mixture of languages and highly challenging themes being impossible to copy as much an accident of its peculiar production as of the vision of its director the central performance at once rigid <UNK> and vulnerable in the face of expression and <UNK> highlights <UNK> as if not the best british actor of his generation then certainly the most adventurous able to hold on to sympathy as his desires take him over and interesting despite the endless close ups and score playing above him not one for a friday night with your girlfriend but certainly ok if you want to explore the limits of human spiritual <UNK>
<START> the brilliance of this film lies not in the filmmaking process which is a conventional but executed <UNK> tale of the lies of three <UNK> post wwii but in the fact that this story was told at all samuel <UNK> deserves credit for having the <UNK> to push through a film who has for its leads a disabled vet with <UNK> for hands an alcoholic and an <UNK>
<START> please why on earth did <UNK> had to add insult to injury making this pathetic piece of follow up crap br br to begin with we the viewers at home are treated to a narration from some unknown <UNK> bat <UNK> us of the aftermath events of the previous episode <UNK> <UNK> triumph over the demons yeah right br br i can tell you right now that this doesn't in anyway what so ever have anything to do with demons as this is a completely new story with a different backdrop altogether <UNK> as usual makes a casual appearance that doesn't even seem to fit into the main context of the story at all acting in this one beyond appalling and the whole concept about the demons appearing through a tv set oh god i'm not going to go on go see for yourself br br as usual you'll be treated to laughable dubbing crap scenarios that don't make any sense and above all un answered questions how typical of a sequel that <UNK> out the first <UNK> of crap br br overall if you're one of those dvd <UNK> then maybe you'll wanna give this a go otherwise avoid like the plague it's no way near the first so you may wanna avoid like the plague
<START> don't be taken in because the premise of this film is a good one it is but that does not a good film make br br comedies require a well <UNK> script and masterful direction sadly this poorly executed film has neither a good director in other genres does not deliver in his comedic <UNK> les series being another example br br the comedic timing is terrible some jokes are <UNK> some are re <UNK> from other movies others just sit there as if they were giving you time to laugh the plot has messy subplots the <UNK> daughter the lesbian co owner and just does not develop or <UNK> the viewer it isn't funny and it isn't believable for a second br br compare this to any comedy by billy wilder some like it hot a foreign etc or by francis <UNK> a true genius at french comedy le diner de cons le <UNK> les la la <UNK> blonde etc and you'll see the difference in their tight scripts great comedic acting and timing with each joke leading to the next one br br watching <UNK> <UNK> twice would be cruel and unusual punishment not a good sign for a comedy
<START> kramer vs kramer is the story of a marital <UNK> and the consequences of same they can be devastating to the partners and even more so to a minor child which in this case is played by justin henry br br what i really did like about kramer vs kramer it's greatest strength as a film is the way that parents dustin hoffman and meryl streep are presented to the audience as whole people with many sides to their nature though the film is <UNK> in <UNK> direction and more about his relationship with his son he's not presented as any kind of saint nor is streep a completely black villain <UNK> a career oriented man in the advertising game he's pretty much ignored his wife's dreams and aspirations still it's a big shock to him when streep says the <UNK> no longer there and she wants out she also wants out of being a mother at least for a while br br hoffman and henry make do the best they can the pressure of being both parents causes hoffman to lose his job and he has to take a lower paying one in another agency at that point after over a year streep decides she wants custody br br both parents make compelling witnesses and state their case beautifully but in these situations the tie is always broken in favor of the mother br br dustin hoffman and meryl streep won their first of two oscars respectively for this film her in the supporting actress category i'm not sure how these things are decided streep does get less screen time than hoffman if that's the <UNK> factor the film does focus on <UNK> relationship with his son and his <UNK> realization that he has his share of the blame for the marriage failure as for meryl it's a choice for her as it is for many women to balance a career and <UNK> the conflict in her psyche <UNK> for all to see on the screen br br dustin hoffman may have won that oscar partly for the same reason that spencer tracy picked up his first by performing the impossible task of not letting a scene stealing child steal the film children with their lack of <UNK> are natural actors and henry is great because he comes over as a real kid not a hollywood kid i wonder if hoffman saw <UNK> courageous and saw how spencer tracy dealt with <UNK> <UNK> dustin could have done a lot worse than channel spencer tracy in his performance br br kramer vs kramer also won oscars for best picture best director for robert <UNK> and best adapted screenplay it's an intelligent and compelling drama about adults falling out of love and trying to deal as best they can with it for themselves and their child don't miss it if ever broadcast
<START> just saw this movie yesterday night and i almost cried no it wasn't because it got me utterly <UNK> no it was absolutely horrendous sometimes you see movies that make you wonder what will become of the human race in the near future this movie is one of those it's as though the writer actors director et al just came together and copied and <UNK> scenes of their favorite horror flicks <UNK> it all together and said hey here's <UNK> whip after seeing this movie i could not help but be tormented by the sight of people whom call themselves actors <UNK> around like they're some kind of talented artistic <UNK> do not be fooled they suck don't bother wasting your time or money
<START> this was hitchcock's third hollywood feature and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of <UNK> turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in rebecca to espionage thriller in foreign <UNK> and now this romantic comedy in the <UNK> of the screwball pictures of the 1930s br br hitchcock's <UNK> method on the other hand had by now settled into something consistent so much so that he was unable or at least unwilling to <UNK> from it it was <UNK> then for him to step outside his usual genre and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate in rebecca it was actually great to see hitchcock <UNK> by his producer and the source text forced to turn his technique to heavy gothic drama but for mr and mrs smith there is a huge <UNK> between form and content in other words hitchcock was no <UNK> lubitsch br br first let's look at the romantic angle the best love scenes in hitchcock films were wild passionate and slightly dangerous  the ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have situation and he was great at depicting that this is something that makes a much earlier film rich and strange one of the few hitchcock non thrillers that really works <UNK> is not so good however when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story a light tender touch is required and <UNK> doesn't have it br br secondly take the comedy of course hitchcock films could be funny  the lady <UNK> is probably the best example  but only when the jokes were <UNK> throughout the story the master of suspense simply isn't enough of a comedy director to create a film that has funny bones he cuts up scenes as he would in a thriller  snappy <UNK> angles of people talking inserted close ups of hands and feet point of view shots  but doesn't allow for comic timing or focus on gags for example the business with carole <UNK> dress <UNK> at the seems is shown to us with a couple of close ups but these are timed more as if he were revealing some crucial plot point and have no comedic impact occasionally hitchcock's style does roughly <UNK> with the comedy  for example the <UNK> of characters in the scene at the club where robert <UNK> tries to make it look as if he is with the attractive sophisticated woman at the next table  but such moments are few and far between br br even the cast of mr and mrs smith are not up to standard i'm not sure this was robert <UNK> strength lay and he is boring here this was of course exactly where queen of screwball carole <UNK> strength lay and yet while she is clearly acting well the scenes are simply not <UNK> to capturing comedy performances even jack carson who could be hilarious when he was really allowed to let go before the camera fails to <UNK> things up at all of course neither of these fine comedy actors is helped by the screenplay which isn't exactly <UNK> with laughs in the first place even if the basic story is a fairly good premise br br the only full on comedy hitchcock made after this was the trouble with harry and that sort of worked because it played upon his familiar however it was only when the story could exist <UNK> of the humour when the basic <UNK> was suspense  as it is in the lady <UNK> or family plot  that hitchcock was capable of doing comedy well
<START> george scott gave the performance of a lifetime in <UNK> the hospital a very dark drama about an aging big city hospital and a middle aged <UNK> on the verge of suicide along comes diana <UNK> as a free spirit determined to save him from himself their dialog <UNK> and it is clear they are made for each other from the outset but will she save him their one sex scene is both graphic and memorable for its passion and fury meanwhile the hospital is under siege by a group of <UNK> who don't want it to turn a condemned building into a cancer center and a serial killer is loose in the hospital <UNK> in doctors and <UNK> a good part of the movie though is <UNK> focused on scott as it should be what a difference a few years made back when this movie was made <UNK> had given us the <UNK> a hokey old fashioned <UNK> of dr with terrible acting and a cardboard script along came 1971 and the hospital less than 10 years later hollywood did something right for a change watching the hospital today is a reminder of how much medical shows like st elsewhere and <UNK> owe to this enduring classic and if the hospital reminds you of network it should same <UNK>
<START> 1st watched 6 21 2001 2 out of 10 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pretty much worthless supposed thriller that spends more time drawing us into sexual encounters with and without the star smith ' it tries to wrap a story around the sex scenes but as usual with these types of movies it is not done very well i was so bored with this movie that i actually fast <UNK> thru the ending to get it over with the video version i watched was called <UNK> me no lies '
<START> the actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast the quality of the camera work makes you feel as if you are there the screenplay is intense and does not wander the plot is one that makes you want to watch it a second time from the new perspective gained by the ending we showed this film to a small group of <UNK> at center for cultural arts after the film ever <UNK> was eager to discuss the film and one person called me the next day to say that they were still bothered while we put an 18 and up age <UNK> on the film i would watch the film with a youth group as it is a very real portrayal of an ugly situation and sets the stage for great conversation
<START> it's one of my favorite movies as much because of the location and music as the story line don't matter how many times i watch it it doesn't seem to ever get old i can almost say all the lines along with the characters now the movie is <UNK> funny and really sweet
<START> director park <UNK> <UNK> returns with what must be one of the and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie history br br <UNK> the latest hollywood <UNK> vampires these days are supposed to be rather <UNK> love <UNK> instead of the evil <UNK> sexual blood sucking mind <UNK> man <UNK> of <UNK> this is the film you want to see if you want to remember the <UNK> thrills of the past well at least in the second half br br starts out with a lengthy character exposition culminating in a slightly different love story the vampire transformation of a priest is over quite some time <UNK> by the romantic and sexual aspects of the story which makes for some awkward viewing but the last 40 minutes or so are surprisingly gory well maybe not so surprisingly if you know and <UNK> a cyborg but that's <UNK> but i guess it's fair to say that beats <UNK> earlier films in terms of in your face violence br br all in all be warned that this is neither art cinema nor a horror flick it may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some is original entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than park <UNK> earlier <UNK>
<START> i saw this on a <UNK> dvd a couple months before it was released br br i liked the main characters and the overall story but some scenes are pretty sloppy and confusing the sets were fitting but a few just looked like left overs from freaks <UNK> or reminded me of a cell phone commercial shot in a middle class home definitely not what the dvd cover claims destined to be the next <UNK> classic hardly br br wardrobe and <UNK> are done well and yes there are some really pretty girls in this always nice to see a good looking cast br br almost every scene contained guitar that just <UNK> on and on sound design was a bit poor i think less would have been best
<START> ok this doesn't compare to the explosive <UNK> of the first <UNK> opening sequence nor to its visual shock value nor for that matter to the <UNK> suspense of the second installment no it's surprisingly and <UNK> different apart of course from the two main actors the tongue in cheek futuristic scenario drives the characters towards each other across genres and languages with an almost <UNK> force the moment of impact conclusion is your choice of a shakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume b <UNK> of violence into <UNK> c humorous <UNK> of an impossible <UNK> everything up to then is even less <UNK> br br highly recommended to <UNK> movie buffs who don't mind following <UNK> with a hot dog caution to those with more <UNK> <UNK>
<START> first the current imdb plot description seems to be misleading the movie is about a group of girls who pick up a misogynistic <UNK> who plans to kill them all they stop at a small motel where he holds them hostage but develops an intense attraction for one of the girls violence ensues br br i picked this up by mistake thinking it was the other 2007 movie the <UNK> not that the <UNK> is any better and i was looking for a crummy movie to watch anyway but this was almost unbearable at times i think i could have <UNK> on a piece of paper and come up with a better plot than this br br i can't even count how many movies i've seen with virtually the same storyline so this was almost painfully predictable at times but what really made it awful were a few scenes that well let me give an example at one point a door is covered in what is very obviously blood and two police officers at the scene because of a <UNK> call are looking at it from 30 feet away see a man also covered in blood walk out of the door agree that it looks suspicious but decide to not investigate further br br but however ridiculous it may be the movie was never boring was well produced directed and acted complete with good special effects gratuitous nudity and violence i probably would not recommend actually spending 90 minutes of your life sitting down to watch this movie but it turned out to be perfect to have on while i <UNK> my basement also highly recommended for fans of crummy movies and would be a good movie to watch with friends when you plan on doing more talking than watching
<START> this is a charming movie starring everyone's favorite cartoon <UNK> in this feature we follow the band of <UNK> on an unforgettable balloon race around the world although there are <UNK> including an orphan penguin all in all it's a great family film
<START> shame to see an interesting story <UNK> into standard vietnam made for tv fare usually hbo movies are a substantial cut above tv bill paxton was a pretty good choice for the lead role but wasn't given much to work with
<START> i'm going to be generous here and give it a 3 only because i live in <UNK> and it was great to see how well the city was filmed that said this movie was pretty bad it's like they started off with hardly any script and the director just told the actors to stare at each other <UNK> with a lot of music playing over it and billy d williams looked like he'd rather be anywhere but in this movie it's just a mess i think i could write a script better than the <UNK> for this film and i'm no writer br br there is one thing i've seen mentioned throughout the reviews and message boards everyone is under the impression that the movie begins around world war 2 and actually it seemed more like it was supposed to start out in the late 1950's early 1960's while the military was not <UNK> by then i'm pretty sure that any troops waiting to board a train would still be <UNK> in a place like <UNK> al if the beginning of film was supposed to be the 1940's then billy d <UNK> ann <UNK> dawn would have to have been in the 70's and 80's instead of their mid 50's or early 60's br br don't waste your time unless you really really like the actors because the story isn't very interesting
<START> an atrocious offense to the memory and genius of welles this senseless <UNK> of self indulgent <UNK> on a grand theme should have been locked up in <UNK> along with a number of other unfinished welles' projects no one has ever seen now we know why to add additional insult to prior injury the appalling english language dubbing by amateur america dubbing actors and even the great man himself only <UNK> all the sloppy mistakes in story telling and construction it's as if every weekend some good hearted spanish soul gave orson a few a <UNK> camera and some short ends of negative film left over from some other production and told welles to drive out to the spanish countryside and just keeping shooting anything and everything until the film stock ran out it's true that if orson had really shaped this film himself instead the notorious jesus franco he might have thrown out 85 of what he shot but we will never know as welles never took the time to edit his own work here and somewhere along the way he or his <UNK> <UNK> someone else to do so he is not entirely <UNK> for the <UNK> those who wish to prove that in his early days welles was the <UNK> of young men because he surrounded himself with the likes of john <UNK> herman greg bernard <UNK> and robert wise need no better proof of his adult <UNK> than this mess of a film in his sad old age welles was capable of doing anything when he needed a few bucks or including selling his artistic soul the devil certainly got his due with this one
<START> the movie was great and everything but there were a lot of mistakes in the soccer scenes i wonder if any of the guys who were working on the movie have ever seen a soccer match before first of all i don't understand how she wanted to try for the boys team in soccer boys and girls cant play in the same team and these are the rules and don't get me started on who when they found out that she was actually a girl they let her continue to play second of all players cant paint their faces with colours and play like that again rules not mine br br and don't get me started on the way they scored goals its was ridiculous completely unrealistic and all the players seemed like they didn't know jack about soccer br br and when duke was training <UNK> why did they only concentrate on shooting what happened to passing and <UNK> or was shooting her only problem and why the hell were all the posters on the wall in their room were for players from don't they like any other players from any other teams it was like this was the only team they know but other than that the movie was good and i enjoyed the rest of it just the training and the game scenes were unrealistic for me they really should have <UNK> some one a bout them
<START> <UNK> 2 is the same as <UNK> 1 bad acting bad characters annoying clown bad lines you name it honestly i'm not all that surprised that more people haven't seen this movie the only reason i watched <UNK> 2 is because i wanted to think that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes they didn't this movie is just as bad if not worse than the first one that clown that <UNK> clown i hate him i hate him so much and i don't hate him because he is a good villain i hate him because he is annoying beyond belief i hope that the filmmakers realized after trying and failing again that this movie is the last thing we need is a <UNK> 3
<START> first a warning <UNK> to marry a comes <UNK> by an apparently random five minute <UNK> performance of <UNK> <UNK> a gershwin <UNK> piece treated with the full <UNK> and ceremony of well gershwin sitting through it takes some patience if you have the dvd rest assured you can skip forward you won't miss anything br br the film itself is one of the <UNK> <UNK> of 50's hollywood a movie so <UNK> by major star power <UNK> <UNK> en scene and perfect high concept that failure seems <UNK> the title alone is perfect generation after generation however are forced to ask themselves how is this so limp the script is an <UNK> about the <UNK> neck a dead <UNK> thing that <UNK> everything and everyone before they can really spark to life there are no comic situations just isolated moments that play for laughs whenever an actual comedy scene threatens to develop the movie quickly moves on to other less interesting things a case in point the scene where the three leading ladies each bring a date to the same fancy restaurant one of them short <UNK> refuses to wear her <UNK> out of vanity one of the dates is married a classic hollywood farce set up surely complete with mistaken identity angry wife and probably a pie in the face for somebody well no instead we cut between the three dates as the ladies react to things their partners say hit the punchline and cut to the next limp joke if in doubt have marilyn walk into a wall where's billy wilder when you need him br br the three stars are almost a perfect <UNK> of the life cycle of the classic hollywood screen <UNK> this was one of marilyn <UNK> <UNK> films and the camera just eats her up even though the script gives her nothing to do she's so <UNK> she almost seems newly <UNK> lauren bacall on the other hand had been a major star for nearly a full decade and she knows how to dominate the screen even when in frame with monroe she gets the only thing passing for a real role and delivers the few good lines with a cynical snap given the right material she could have brought this thing to life she's a curiously <UNK> actress when she lies about her age in the film and claims to be forty it isn't instantly ridiculous and far less <UNK> than her co stars giving her a convincing authority betty <UNK> was far from <UNK> and had a good eight years on her co stars putting her near the end of her hollywood career there's an air of desperation about her at times stranded on screen with nothing but a <UNK> smile and a few <UNK> of comic timing unable to play her real age but <UNK> no one as a contemporary of this new <UNK> generation of actresses relying on the same old <UNK> that had served her throughout her career for marilyn <UNK> seeing the two <UNK> in this movie helps to throw <UNK> subtlety and yes intelligence into sharp relief she's also <UNK> with the dead wood in terms of male co stars although all of the men even the great william powell are guilty of lazy performances she's unable to strike any comic sparks off them better to have given her role to the under <UNK> monroe who could be funny all by herself and left <UNK> with the repetitive mr <UNK> routine br br that the movie is as enjoyable as it is can be put down to the <UNK> hollywood production the sort that <UNK> even the <UNK> likes of <UNK> the light of the <UNK> watchable but somewhere buried beneath the <UNK> jokes and <UNK> lies the rough outline of a sharp cynical comedy about the business of marriage that bacall could have made sing and new generations of movie viewers will sit down with <UNK> to marry a in expectation of that movie ready to be disappointed all over again
<START> one of the most boring movies i've ever seen three immature young people have sex and talk about very little except their love of each other they don't seem to be interested in much but each other and only <UNK> so i was left feeling shut out most of the exterior scenes take place at night so one can't even enjoy well lit sights of paris i gave up after an hour and ten minutes
<START> this film is about <UNK> an <UNK> exchange student from paris who spends one year in <UNK> during that time under the influence of all the new impressions he changes and grows upon return he has a much <UNK> view on his life and finally takes it into his own hands br br this is one of the most moving films i've ever seen and the reason is probably that i've been in a very similar situation i'm from germany not from france and for me it was <UNK> not <UNK> but i can assure you that this film is a completely accurate depiction of what an <UNK> <UNK> in spain will do to you from what i hear the story is <UNK> and that's probably why it is so realistic br br let me give some examples mild spoiler alert <UNK> shares a flat with other students from italy <UNK> germany <UNK> spain and england the flat looks exactly like all the <UNK> shared <UNK> i've seen in <UNK> the main characters are nicely developed and some funny scenes <UNK> from the usual stereotypes the spanish <UNK> is also 100 accurate the story of <UNK> and his girlfriend <UNK> who remained in paris is also very typical about 90 of all relationships break up during an <UNK> <UNK> or shortly thereafter there's a wonderful scene in which <UNK> tries to convince wendy his <UNK> from england who is kind of <UNK> to go out with all the others he finally succeeds and wendy probably has the night of her life br br another great thing in this film is that it's truly the students in the flat speak spanish or english and <UNK> speaks french with his mother and girlfriend there are subtitles so that everyone can understand what's being said i surely hope that this film never gets dubbed anywhere br br i can imagine that for non <UNK> people this is simply an entertaining comedy but for all my fellow <UNK> i can only say this is your film if you haven't seen it do so but be prepared for some feelings of nostalgia br br 10 10
<START> i went to see this movie at a book <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> last night after a wonderful night that consisted of a few brief words with mr bruce campbell you have to say it all not just bruce or mr campbell d friends while the books were being signed and a session with our favorite killer the lights <UNK> br br so as not to spoil anything i wont go into detail but i loved the movie mr bruce campbell did a wonderful job keeping the classic b movie feel the characters were classic <UNK> characters the place was refreshing what movies do you know of that are based in <UNK> and the setting was both near original and fun on top of that the humor that is throughout the movie that kept the audience laughing through much of the movie br br while this movie <UNK> have as great of a general appeal to people as some it is a <UNK> of fun and laughter in a season of as mr bruce campbell put it <UNK> <UNK> that are listed as 'a <UNK> <UNK> dukes of <UNK> charlie and the chocolate factory come on guys
<START> pilot mitch jeff <UNK> sees a <UNK> while test flying a plane but nothing shows up on radar then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a <UNK> increase it turns out it's a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing but what is it and why is it here br br this has all the right elements for a classic it has an actually pretty entertaining script i was never really bored the acting is good for a 1950s monster movie <UNK> doesn't <UNK> the macho hero act and <UNK> is quite good as the requisite female love interest she's also strong and takes care of herself even though she is off getting food and coffee for everyone all during the movie the problem here is the monster dear god it's terrible it looks like a deranged turkey it has a long neck a hilariously stupid <UNK> some teeth a few <UNK> of hair on its head and <UNK> and oh yes it <UNK> not roaring <UNK> the actors had no idea what it looked like it was added after production actors <UNK> and were horrified when they finally saw it in a theatre <UNK> said his audience burst out laughing and he left the theatre quickly before the movie ended producer sam <UNK> was responsible for this he wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster ever and you can see the <UNK> moving it too this gets 4 stars only because <UNK> and are so good and the script is well done it gets no stars for the pathetic monster wait till you see it attack what is obviously a toy train worth a look if you're a horror fan to see what has to be the stupidest monster ever
<START> i was quite impressed with the narration by martha and how it pulled on the emotional <UNK> of the audience as well as how it must have <UNK> the family the forward <UNK> motion of the storyline was well done and normally i don't enjoy movies with the flash back flash forward effects i felt during the whole evolution of the movie that surely tommy did it it leaves you with a sense of how these people lived their lives almost totally devoid of each other and the consequences of not having any desire to answer the question it's 10 <UNK> do you know where your children are and furthermore what the heck are they doing or do i care rich spoiled <UNK> literally getting away with murder or so they thought
<START> i had heard news about this film from anime legend <UNK> miyazaki and i so wanted to see it but i was lucky enough to the film online at youtube after watching the film i knew that it is another miyazaki studio <UNK> classic br br this film inspired by my favorite fairy tale the little mermaid is about a 5 year old boy named and his relationship with a <UNK> princess whom he named who <UNK> to become human and be with i won't give you anymore details you'll have to see the film for yourself so overall one of the best animated movies ever made with plenty of fantasy adventure and humor i loved it
<START> i am huge movie <UNK> and also an active <UNK> player who believes that <UNK> is the greatest game ever played forever strong is a mix of coach carter and sloppy <UNK> this movie is full of great acting well developed characters and in action shots that will have you <UNK> and <UNK> in your seat but with more arm <UNK> than pee wee football and almost every shot cuts away as soon as a player touches the ground its filmed to almost seem like football if you want to bring your kids to see a movie that will build character from within and could inspire a blind man to see again i can easily give it 9 out of 10 if you want to see a great <UNK> movie that truly shows the sport your going to have to wait for the next one because forever strong is mostly practice running and a one <UNK> film for this i give it a 7 75 out of 10
<START> big spoiler right here this film is b a d but enjoy it's good bad br br <UNK> is the kind of film you can't believe exists with dialog plotting and direction so <UNK> handled that uncle <UNK> <UNK> home video looks like an <UNK> experience since it's a troma flick there's plenty of gross out gore on tap but its even <UNK> than usual br br most of the production money seems to have gone into buying <UNK> and <UNK> for cast and crew the brilliant dialog is best summed up in the immortal what was that which is second only to the <UNK> screamed now what br br any knowledge of how people act in a desperate situation is alien to ronald armstrong the writer director when one of the friends is found being eaten alive by a <UNK> <UNK> thing armstrong has the survivors immediately making time with cute but dumb as a <UNK> divine while she's being hit on divine is cooking up a big steaming pot of a rat poison <UNK> mixture on the <UNK> stirring smiling stirring smiling never falling over dead from the <UNK> br br the killer bugs are as frightening as which they too closely resemble the effects used to move them include dragging them across <UNK> floors real fast with their legs dragging behind br br the highlight for the film would probably have been the house blowing up but they were either out of cash or never had any so instead of seeing even a <UNK> go up in flames they simply let the screen go black eat you heart out <UNK> br br the cast is virtually all black how can the <UNK> consistently <UNK> something truly funny like <UNK> and andy which depicts characters certainly no less <UNK> than those on 99 of all white comedy shows but says <UNK> a <UNK> about something like <UNK> oh well it's best they don't know about how <UNK> this film is to all involved as it would be if it were played by any single ethnic group frankly before they put the <UNK> on <UNK> get some friends together and get ready for the plan 9 of bug <UNK> movies
<START> well its ten year's on since this film was released and the <UNK> of time have not improved it one bit again like the other comments made the aussie film makers should have a little more drama rather than middle class <UNK> riding around beautiful places on there <UNK> with not much in the was of dialog middle class is not funny nor is rich there is also a <UNK> mash of cast why is a young woman going to marry a man old enough to be her father it escapes me it's such a shame about this film looks like a wonderful place to holiday <UNK> anyway its an hour and thirty mins of my life i will never be able to get back <UNK> to short to watch this movie
<START> <UNK> does a wonderful job depicting a conflicted bride torn between the challenges that <UNK> her <UNK> the memories of the freedom she thought she would have when in college inspired by a famous author and the safety of her <UNK> marriage to a man she really doesn't love this movie is definitely worth seeing as predictable as it may be the acting is inspiring and real chemistry exists between <UNK> and malcolm warner
<START> separate lies is such an elegant intelligent and thought provoking film and i could have watched tom <UNK> forever on the screen the locations in the english countryside the marvelous london locations the interiors smart <UNK> and of course the writing and dialog made separate lies a thrilling adventure br br with that said and perhaps this is just an american viewpoint as the british are so much more sophisticated in handling sexual <UNK> i found it hard to watch tom <UNK> just stand by as his wife goes <UNK> on her way in a sexual journey that really brings her very little joy creates much despair for her husband with the <UNK> that is rupert everett yes i saw the <UNK> of character his aim for perfection the desire for everything in its place but in emily watson she should have looked deeper into his true character and solid goodness to realize what she has thrown away br br tom <UNK> makes separate lies into a powerful film by watching him experience all the pain embarrassment and despair on the screen as his wife goes off with another man and he himself makes the journey in separate lies by understanding his faults <UNK> his wife despite all that has gone on and leading her back to london bravo tom
<START> any fan of russian cinema will have great difficulty in believing the sub par performances <UNK> in by and <UNK> jr and will perhaps be utterly <UNK> by <UNK> sr 's hackneyed and confusing script which is coupled with <UNK> weak direction most of the characters wander through the movie as though they have no idea who they are or what they are doing it is also sad to see that jennifer jason <UNK> acting skills have not advanced one <UNK> since fast times at <UNK> high and her screen exposure is mercifully limited this is a terrible mafia movie so much so that it makes the godfather iii look like a winner in the genre to see the key russians at their best check out <UNK> sr 's work on prisoner of the mountains which also features jr turn in the thief and <UNK> jr 's new criminal in brat
<START> how can anyone even begin to like this film is really beyond me br br the idea it has none a guy fell apart that's the idea wow an environment was slowly killing him now that's original and worth watching br br this is the first film i've seen i've heard that he's a genius of <UNK> en scene but i've seen student films with more attention inspiration idea and craft than this this this nothing it has nothing br br each and every shot is too long there's so much <UNK> in them the <UNK> horrible you can see the actors had no <UNK> at all no understanding of their roles not even an attempt at showing emotions it's so superficial the lines are so that you could removed 90 of them and still have the same crappy film <UNK> who cares about it atmosphere dynamics that's for <UNK> one shot per scene 80 of the time people staring <UNK> having no idea how to represent emotions and importance of the moment besides hollow staring at the camera or one another editing all rules of editing have been <UNK> with no <UNK> pay off of any kind photography half of the shots have reflection in them and crappy lighting with no <UNK> of any kind shadows play of shadows who needs that we need a guy <UNK> drinking hitting his wife like he's like he's acting we need a bunch of close ups of a not so beautiful woman we need an amateurish climax of his capture by an unconvincing <UNK> <UNK> this film has so much <UNK> that it isn't worth the no budget it had br br frankly i haven't seen a film this bad since american pie 5 <UNK> that bad br br i've just started watching his <UNK> movie which seems much better based on the first 15 minutes since it does have a hint of directing and artistic idea unlike this crap so i won't argue that clueless but this this film sucks
<START> it's possible to have a good time with this film while at the same time <UNK> all that it isn't in the 1980s a u s <UNK> tom hanks <UNK> support for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the soviet union br br hanks is in <UNK> <UNK> fellow well met form as <UNK> politically incorrect charlie wilson first <UNK> sharing a hot <UNK> with three deeply available looking women if only the film had the same air of <UNK> but apart from philip seymour <UNK> turn as a cynical cia agent it tries to be perceived as patriotic too aaron trademark <UNK> dialogue serves its purpose but the story is no more plausible than one of <UNK> tall tales and there's an oddly <UNK> subtext <UNK> <UNK> pals later mutated into the <UNK> and other anti western groups leaving the world worse off than it was when these events occurred
<START> first off the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which i don't understand how was missed you consistently see the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in and out of the film the first time i saw it i just said well mistakes happen and <UNK> it off after about the <UNK> time it began to get incredibly irritating and <UNK> funny if you haven't seen the film yet try counting how many times you see the <UNK> might make for pretty interesting game br br now about the film this movie started out with the <UNK> of a pretty solid ghost story however the plot twist at the end just ruined it completely you begin watching the movie under the <UNK> <UNK> by the tv commercials that the haunted house consists of ghosts which can only be seen by children particularly young children which makes it even more freaky as they will be unable to effectively warn the family of the impending danger the opening scene did a good job of misleading the audience that this would remain the premise of the film spoiler the movie starts with the family being stalked and ultimately killed by an unseen force in the home the idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when the daughter at the beginning of the movie asks her little brother to tell her where it is right before it grabs her and drags her screaming into the <UNK> the young boy also witnesses this supposedly unseen force kill his mother after she tells him to hide under the bed after his family is killed the boy attempts to run and hide only to be <UNK> away as well br br as i said this movie started out with the <UNK> of a pretty spooky movie in which the family would be stalked by an unseen force with their only hopes of survival <UNK> on <UNK> by a two year old this began to be ruined less than halfway into the film as the daughter began to see the ghosts as well completely ruining the only children can see illusion set forth by the commercials and opening scene br br regardless of this the movie didn't actually get ruined until the plot twist at the end in which the man who had been helping the family <UNK> the farm turns out to have been the man responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the movie all of a sudden after being attacked by a <UNK> of <UNK> the man <UNK> and tries to kill the mother daughter and son while having a psychotic breakdown in which he believes them to be his family which he killed at the beginning br br the whole plot twist at the end just created a whole list of <UNK> questions and left me going wtf first why was the family's souls trapped in a house if the director was going for a <UNK> on the grudge approach in which the family after dying in a fit of rage would haunt the house and kill whoever enters why did the haunting stop after the father was captured by the ghosts of his family if the ghosts only wanted to kill the man that killed them why were they attacking the new family here's another one for you it takes several months from the time you <UNK> <UNK> until the plants fully <UNK> in time for <UNK> this tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning the man that the ghosts apparently had a grudge with the whole movie was living on the property for months during all this time why didn't the ghosts just go kill him br br this movie included a lot of clichéd horror movie scares as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies however i'm telling ya this movie still could've pulled off okay if not for the plot twist at the end it's like they just ran out of their budget and just threw together something for an ending for this movie to have been a success they should've stuck with the only children can see them premise and ended with either the family barely getting away or being killed off like the family at the beginning would've opened the door for possible sequel too
<START> i really liked this one spoilers it had a really good plot the main female in this movie is really <UNK> br br despite the fact that she's the only one left alive and her lover dead it seemed to be much like ninja <UNK> another kick ass movie br br watch it in japanese with subtitles i don't know where the idiots who learned to speak english are but for some reason all <UNK> get an f in translation techniques the subtitles are more correct br br 9 10 br br quality 7 10 entertainment 10 10 <UNK> 9 10
<START> i was a fan of buffy and hoped it would come to a proper end when angel got only one more season but when the end came closer i was <UNK> to see that and what did we get this episode called not fade away was the very last one br br i was so disappointed by this episode this is absolutely the worst way to this series why couldn't it get a happy ending why did have a few of the main characters to die why did angel not become a human and was reunited with buffy again no angel has to sign this piece of paper that he'll never become a human how stupid br br and the end is a cliffhanger br br what could have been worse the began so great such as angel but the hole universe ended so crappy somebody should put a spell on the man who wrote the screenplay to this episode and make sure he <UNK> lost in hell br br so don't bother watching this it's so bad it hurts totally 1 out of 10
<START> to be fair i didn't see a lot of this show probably because it wasn't as good as the original m a s h but i seem to recall them moving it around on the weekly schedule some shows just aren't worth the trouble of following around every week but i really did try at first so it wasn't all bad maybe i just kept expecting it to improve but i can't give this show a 1 in all honesty i can't give it any more than a 2 either br br it wasn't mash i'm not going to type those stupid 's every time and it was trying to be mash without putting forth any effort like it would just magically happen well guess what no magic the best i can do here is to compare it to other shows br br <UNK> john m d was a much better show by far however they should have called it b j m d because <UNK> roberts looked exactly like an older <UNK> but nothing at all like <UNK> john keep everything else the same just change his name and the name of the show <UNK> after mash wasn't the only sequel to completely bomb and <UNK> the original <UNK> <UNK> place was a lame follow up to all in the family it had no heart no conflict no depth  all of the things that made all in the family so memorable likewise mash was funny because the doctors were <UNK> to the impossible absurdity of war remove the war and you remove the drive for 99 of the humor potter can't yell at for wearing a dress because isn't wearing a dress because he's not trying to get kicked out of the army because he's already out of the army because the war is over breathe all of the jokes became forced because there was no motivation for anything the least motivated was the viewer to stay around and watch the show br br and from what i remember the whole show seemed to be potter and <UNK> just standing there <UNK> facing the audience like a trio of vaudeville performers it was reminiscent of good times where they spent 90 of the show standing behind that couch and talking to the audience trying to make it look like they were having natural conversation they weren't and it felt even less natural on after mash br br another random <UNK> i recall is that the people who made mash never got any <UNK> from the spin off the studio used the absurd excuse that after mash was really a spin off of the movie mash which they owned and not the tv series nice try but <UNK> was the only one of the three in the movie and he was never deaf i guess studio <UNK> will do anything for a buck anything other than make a worthwhile sequel that is
<START> at the least some of the sitcoms that <UNK> endlessly out of the us are honestly bad this junk however portrays a heart warming side to a clothes horse acting laughably <UNK> with <UNK> and phrases delivered in the i'm so important and thin and beautiful fashion in the episode i just sat through someone's job was at risk simply because a colleague had placed a phone call her <UNK> off really this is the lowest of the low what kind of damage does this <UNK> on the watching masses seeing only <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> people <UNK> around working utterly sick making when the titles rolled i thought oh well it provided jobs for the boys you know who you are
<START> i suppose you could say this film has a grain of potential but nothing more because boy did the filmmakers <UNK> it the plot is practically incomprehensible the pacing is <UNK> and the acting is pathetic and what the hell is a trade rat worst of all though this movie's climax is the <UNK> of all plus the title doesn't seem even remotely accurate the only redeeming feature of this film is the pretty dark haired woman well the blond girl was pretty too but she was annoying and not as good looking as the brunette <UNK> as with a lot of movies this is one to be seen only on mst3k
<START> dallas stars gary cooper ruth roman steve <UNK> barbara <UNK> raymond massey it's directed by stuart <UNK> photography is from ernest pen duties fell to john twist produced out of warner brothers dallas is vividly filmed in technicolor out of the warner <UNK> in california very much a film with its tongue firmly in cheek the film is a <UNK> to the westerns of <UNK> that exist without <UNK> or deep meanings br br the plot sees <UNK> civil war <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fake his own death so as to kill off his reputation and to free himself for the pursuit into dallas of the brothers who <UNK> his family in essence a routine plot story is <UNK> up along the way by many a fun and exciting <UNK> there's role <UNK> dandy fashions <UNK> <UNK> shoot outs a love triangle <UNK> dialogue and <UNK> little twists to keep the piece purely from painting it by numbers br br cooper seems to be enjoying himself too which further enhances the feel good factor on offer it's true he isn't really asked to do anything more than be a <UNK> dude on a mission but when called on for action duties he delivers the goods that his fans have come to expect during his successful career the villains entertain particularly steve vile and dopey <UNK> <UNK> because each have their own little <UNK> to keep them from over familiar <UNK> the two ladies of the piece look gorgeous and hold up well in amongst the <UNK> while the high production value allows to really treat the eyes with the lush technicolor and involving camera work around the locations br br it has ideals to being an a list <UNK> does dallas something it just can't quite <UNK> but it's not for lack of trying and the end result is one of pure entertainment that in truth should be enjoyed on a cold winters day when the viewer needs a pick me up 7 10
<START> before i watched this tv movie i did not know much about one of my favorite actresses after watching it i realized how sad lucille <UNK> life really was it had it's great moments too but i didn't realize how sad it was this movie was very good and told the story of the beloved lucille ball very well i highly <UNK> it
<START> rating 1 2 out of br br the net is one of those films that won't remain in your mind till the next one hour well just if you keep thinking how bad it is it's a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage one of those <UNK> i've just used above is the reason which made me add 1 2 a star to the one i would have given so is it a case of <UNK> bad it is <UNK> no it's a case of <UNK> bad it is br br <UNK> in a surprise very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time she works at home doesn't have any friends and her neighbors don't know her suddenly she sees herself involved in dangerous situations after her colleague dies and the same thing almost happens to her her identity bank accounts etc etc etc are all deleted and she is now ruth marx the conspiracy involves even the government and wait haven't we seen this before yes thousands of times the net tries to be modern to be the portrait of the <UNK> showing the computer as a villain big deal it is a film about nothing just a <UNK> to show ridiculous action scenes take the scene of the boat accident i just laughed when the camera started to get slow br br what makes everything even worse here is sandra <UNK> how awful she is has she already made a decent film a time to kill okay but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures br br the <UNK> and <UNK> of the computer were already shown in 2001 a space odyssey the best most intelligent and most complex film ever made it's not needed to compare the net with it is it br br the only reason to see the net is to laugh as i've said and to see what it tried to be the results well are a shame br br <UNK> this film from your mind
<START> oh boy it's another <UNK> hitting the earth film coming within a year or two of deep impact <UNK> space <UNK> and various other stupid flicks with rap stars in them you'd think people would be burned out on this concept apparently not since i rented it hoping it might not be awful dennis hopper was in it after all and he's a good actor right br br i forgot something important along with peter o'toole robert de niro and quite a few other <UNK> actors hopper has a <UNK> for appearing in dreadful films not only that but he seems to prepare for them by taking forget how to act classes his performance in is so awful that you expect divine or edith massey to appear in some scenes br br i don't know what else to say about this rubbish other than if you're into things crashing into the earth films watch deep impact and then <UNK> and space <UNK> at a stretch forget the others altogether this one really is bottom of the pile
<START> <UNK> is a good example of a basically interesting idea gone very very wrong as far as horror movies go and especially with the <UNK> of teen movies at the moment a film based around a bunch of teens attending a mysterious freak show is something you could have a lot of fun with br br however the writer decided to make a very straight very boring very plain tale about five teens who become part of the show when <UNK> midget <UNK> graves transforms them into freaks using some pathetic machine that <UNK> them into <UNK> br br the five teens are picked off one by one until the last guy is left his <UNK> being that he is unable to join his friends and thus <UNK> <UNK> what a load of rubbish br br the <UNK> are really poor this film has no comedy and it could have been so funny no gore and it could have been so gory no action and no horror and it could have had so much of both br br the director has failed in his duty to even try to make this a little interesting to watch his experience in soft core has obviously disabled any creativity he may ever have had as all the shots are the same with very few edits and little movement the quality overall is poor br br i'm not usually <UNK> by nudity in movies but believe me the only high point in this film was a pair of breasts
<START> this film is brilliant it has cute little <UNK> in it and its a great storyline and it has <UNK> wood in it which makes it a great film too his acting skills are very good and if you want a good soft family film this is the one to watch
<START> i've seen several of these body <UNK> type movies but none was nearly as bad as this one br br no thrill no fx bad acting bad photography bad sound bad everything br br blue <UNK> all
<START> calling all d grab your friends hit the theater and see the hell out of this movie from the opening sequence until after the credits you'll be laughing your self breathless br br this movie is a wild ride through the history of the d and not just some bull crap list of the things they've done but a <UNK> of their rise to power i am a huge fan of rage <UNK> kyle <UNK> and jack black so naturally i loved the movie br br it helps to know about the show they had and their first cd but it's just as funny if you don't from the hilarious and vulgar lyrics the <UNK> <UNK> the massive amount of pot smoking and the cameos down to the outright insanity that is the story line this is a movie for d and <UNK> alike br br many of their songs are <UNK> such as two kings tribute and to their many audio tracks like <UNK> push ups every fan in the audience will be saying i remember that as well as new <UNK> saying that's <UNK> hilarious i highly recommend this movie to any body that's ever <UNK> out this movie is certainly in high competition for being the next this is spinal tap one of the best ever
<START> mediocre at best slow but probably more entertaining to the younger viewers a young boy chris miller is haunted by an indian spirit and horrid monster in the <UNK> of his father's new home also in the cast are patrick <UNK> suzanne and ford
<START> just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent bbc mini series published in 1981 it was not available on dvd until the last few years since then it has become available but initially only in the british format for which i bought an dvd player which you have to hack <UNK> i suspect to see it but the series is now available through amazon com 3 <UNK> for between 19 21 to be viewed on dvd in the us format no <UNK> there were <UNK> reviews average 5 stars this mini series is one of the very best on <UNK> or the manhattan project or virtually anything produced by the bbc
<START> there i am sitting at home in the morning suddenly my brother <UNK> on what appears to be the stupidest looking movie i have ever seen considering it was the 70's and special effects weren't to <UNK> this movie just about <UNK> the definition of crap the stupid monsters the stupid story line and the stupid setting made this the worst movie i have ever seen so bad in fact i didnt even finish it i made it up to a certain point then <UNK> to see how long i could go without putting a rope around my neck and hanging myself im just kidding haha awful movie
<START> a lot has already been written about the film itself so instead of adding to the noise i just want to say a few words on the two female actors br br it has to be a <UNK> <UNK> for any actress to star in a sense versus the spectacular monica <UNK> but pulls it off to sensational ends a film starring monica <UNK> where i fall in love with the other girl that's not supposed to happen br br it's been said a thousand times but monica <UNK> strikes the saddest figure in modern cinema i have never before seen such <UNK> sadness she would not be out of place breaking <UNK> <UNK> heart
<START> is this a good movie no certainly not but for jolie lovers it's must have her non polished acting and semi nudity scene will please her fans for ages to come the current rating however 3 2 is too low the movie might lack a good storyline and isn't a great sf movie altogether but the acting is good enough and like mentioned before <UNK> acting is nice and raw the movie is shot very direct with a lot of close ups the scenery is bizarre and last but not least leaving van damme out was a very good choice presumably non of the jolie lovers would like to see her having sex with him this movie has all the potential of becoming a cult movie
<START> i am a guy so i was very <UNK> to watch the movie because i know that richard gear likes to be in tear <UNK> movies i would rather watch action adventure sci fi i was right the movie is definitely a tear <UNK> diane tended to over act a few times as did richard but they brought it around and made it work the daughter was a <UNK> teen with huge attitude so you started out hating her the movie is way too predictable but for entertainment purposes it was a masterpiece go rent it see if you don't shed a tear lol if you like the <UNK> you will love this one the beach scenes were <UNK> shot even though the <UNK> scenes were a little off sequence it was still a bit to watch them react to it
<START> the first 4 episodes of season 6 are just to throw up to predictable and the worst scenario i've seen won't and hopefully i <UNK> buy it also seen in seasons back that episodes about space they did suck even more all i want to say to the people who make this is don't do whole episode about space because they suck the point is that season 6 sucks even more than the seasons before gets worse from season to season i got so disappointed and frustrated watching first 4 episodes of season 6 that i just had to write this only people who are brain washed can watch this crap seems that people writing the scenario are getting out of ideas for a long time think that my 2 year old nephew had a better idea for the episode than these people do
<START> okay where to begin did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous <UNK> team <UNK> and bet ya didn't but they turned it down complaining about robot make up then they faded off into obscurity now this movie has everything a crazed killer robot who thinks he's dirty harry lots of cool robots it's funny it's touching it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci fi and romantic comedies it's the first robot romantic comedy now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues but there are very minor and can be overlooked i think couples will enjoy this movie and will want to watch it over and over again 9 stars
<START> it is a shame that this series hasn't been <UNK> and produced on video by warner or some other professional movie house br br copies of most episodes are available but are usually of poor quality being copies of copies of copies br br as i understand it <UNK> episodes were produced during its run but only 15 are noted here br br some of the series writers such as richard <UNK> went on to become noted authors br br excellent series well written well staged and well produced br br michael br br thailand
<START> you know before seeing this film i had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases i mean if they were arrested and charged they must have been guilty i <UNK> br br i formed this opinion over some years you see a good friend of mine once worked as a detective in some of the more seedy areas of sydney he frequently complained that his <UNK> efforts were wasted due to <UNK> lawyers and <UNK> he would bang the crooks up in the morning and they would be back on the street by <UNK> it took its <UNK> they wore him down he quit br br he has <UNK> since not <UNK> i thought that creative evidence gathering to keep the baddies where they belong was well acceptable br br my arguments about the rights of innocent people weren't valid he claimed what are the chances that you will ever be arrested and charged with a serious crime he would argue and being a law <UNK> citizen the weight of his argument convinced me he was right the chances of me or any of my family or friends being charged with murder or a serious offense were zero to none i thought br br <UNK> well as mentioned earlier seeing this wonderfully <UNK> documentary changed all that br br i'm sending him a copy
<START> i am giving this movie vampire <UNK> a 2 rating mainly because it had no sex or nudity other than that i am not sure why it was ever made it was more like a training exercise in how to make a movie with a very limited budget the characters derek and <UNK> were the best actors they were followed closely by the biker dude with the pants and silver belt he was ok too most of the movie was filmed in some kind of distribution warehouse if you got tired of watching the kung fu kick boxing stunts you can check out the <UNK> of scott <UNK> <UNK> and other cleaning products you will have a lot of time to do this trust me i almost started to make a list the dialogue and kung fu stunts were extremely slow they talked slow fought slow etc i don't know why at least with the extra slow delivery of the actors lines you could hear everything very distinctly i am trying hard to find good stuff to say about this movie we watched it all the way to the end to see if got any better but it didn't we never could decide if the actors really knew martial arts or were just acting like they knew martial arts you can watch yourself and decide my favorite line was something like vampire speaking what are you looking at other man <UNK> your bad dental work
<START> i have been a <UNK> star trek fan since 1966 still am one thing i learned from star trek is that the special effects are secondary to the characters encounter at fails in its mission br br superbly produced br br poorly directed written acted d c <UNK> really blew this one this episode is so embarrassing the master tape should be burned br br the first half of the first season didn't fare much better
<START> i am really sad that that this film has got so much negative criticism i think it is a nice little comedy and really funny the humour in this film is kind of warm and innocent and i like it i also like <UNK> character and i do not agree that she played herself she has created a character and a sympathetic one br br my favourite scenes were the fighting scene on top of the sinking car and where madonna climbs over the fence in a fancy dress to claim her love the humour in the film has a slightly touch and perhaps it is not everybody's cup of tea but it's their problem not of the film br br i found this film wholesome and sunny in fact the day i first saw it i was incredibly sad for some reason and this film lit up my day and madonna can act just take off your glasses of negative thinking
<START> what an awesome film i came out of the theatre feeling stunned the film that i had just seen was one of the best films i have seen in my life i had my eyes glued to the screen it's very symbolic visually lush beautifully shot and <UNK> told it's basically about two people who move into a flat and live next door to each other with there partners who are assumed to be having an affair with each others partners assuming this our two heroes act out what they think their partners are getting <UNK> there is an obvious <UNK> of feelings for each other with the use of camera work body language and it's a visual feast and hard not to like some of the story gets slightly confusing but that's nothing the ending is one of the most beautiful and anti hollywood endings i have ever seen in my life and visually amazing the films haunting score adds to the mood i highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind and respect what a superb film
<START> sherlock holmes basil <UNK> begins this story in disguise helping to <UNK> famous <UNK> dr <UNK> william post out of and under the <UNK> eye of the nazis who want his bomb sight plans the allies obviously want it too and sherlock is there to help dr has invented an <UNK> which greatly aids in the accuracy of <UNK> <UNK> br br holmes and dr arrive safely back at baker street but the scientist would rather be alone for some mysterious reason although he had promised the english to help them not the germans he stays true to that promise but there are some desperate moments for holmes and the english along the way br br it's an entertaining film and one in which our famous detective uses not one but three different <UNK> he needs all the help he can get when he goes up against his arch rival professor <UNK> one complaint if <UNK> was that evil he would have <UNK> with holmes without <UNK> an instead of giving him <UNK> to escape it's pretty sad too when the usual dim witted dr watson <UNK> bruce has to rescue his boss from certain death a couple of times br br yes there are some credibility issues in this story but if you can put your brain on hold a few times it's a fun film to watch and it looks beautiful thanks to the great <UNK> job done on this dvd it makes the old print come alive with some wonderful visuals particularly the night time shots br br one other note whoever did the english subtitles in here <UNK> or <UNK> at least a half dozen words it's very sloppy work and not the first time i've encountered this watching the entire series on the restored dvd set
<START> you want the worst horror movie of the 21st century el is it <UNK> the hands of fate is the worst movie of all time but el certainly is the worst movie of this century it also has to have the distinction of having the absolute worst leading actor ever eric <UNK> the actor in the lead role has never done another film other than el gee i wonder why br br apparently the monster is attacking people but everyone that is attacked moves really slowly and is really stupid and there are no cops at all in this town just two idiot detectives hello cops show up on the scene of <UNK> first then the detectives come and apparently the monster only attacks in one person's backyard and some deserted area by the <UNK> or thats the only places the filmmakers could get access to film br br this <UNK> is the reason why imdb must allow us to give negative stars this easily deserves 10 stars or at least 0 they should allow a 0 rating
<START> there is absolutely no doubt that this version of tarzan is the closest to <UNK> vision while he gladly <UNK> his <UNK> from the films produced during his lifetime he frequently made it clear that they were little more than the bastard children of his tales the film <UNK> ludicrous obsession with casting olympic <UNK> as tarzan was beyond laughable i guess we should consider ourselves lucky that they did not set their sights on shot br br prior to this film the most faithful adaptations were in comic <UNK> and comic books as fine as some of these were we had to wait seven decades for a filmmaker with the integrity to respect the character as he had been created
<START> i remember <UNK> this movie the 1st time i saw it but it has grown on me i love the costumes and poses the actors make the humor the cinematography the soundtrack the scenes are very rich and it moves very quickly every time i watch it there is something new that catches my eye <UNK> as is probably the only thing that ruins it but not enough br br also the <UNK> in this movie is different it is not the same character you can see that the character <UNK> has been given <UNK> like qualities because i'm assuming anne wanted it in but there is no reason to trash this movie just because it's not like books it's a fascinating by itself
<START> i have watched <UNK> from first episode to now and i will continue to watch it the setting and the characters are amazing and the plots are great the show really keeps me on the edge of my seat and when the show goes off after an hour i keep hoping it will be another hour
<START> atmosphere and <UNK> dialog don't redeem this overrated classic boyer is a french thief hiding in the of <UNK> while the police try to figure out how to get him out meanwhile he falls for <UNK> and tries to find a way to escape the film is slow to get started and never really goes anywhere reminiscent of casablanca in some ways it's completely lacking any larger theme than the wanted man <UNK> a good woman it's all talk talk talk with endless scenes of boyer <UNK> among his idiot <UNK> and boyer <UNK> <UNK> in the shadows personally i didn't care for <UNK> character for a minute so the tension was utterly nonexistent br br stock 1930s character actors stumble thru the <UNK> plot as <UNK> henchmen guys who clearly do not belong in <UNK> <UNK> is the wildly overacting jealous girlfriend of boyer his <UNK> <UNK> in front of her doesn't <UNK> well for any future he might have with <UNK> br br especially bad is a long sequence in which an <UNK> comes to tell boyer how another henchman was captured it sounds exciting too bad we didn't see it for ourselves the ending is completely <UNK> and seems to be remarkable only because it is not a hollywood happy ending that doesn't stop it from being sappy
<START> before seeing this picture i was quite <UNK> i don't like movies with an agenda nor do i appreciate being scared into thinking like the writer i was also afraid this would be like the 2 part mini series 10 4 which had a far fetched concept little relation to the real world and very poor execution at the beginning is says this film is fiction but the events portrayed and the information about uk <UNK> planning are based on extensive research and the general feeling is that you're not being sold on an idea but that you're being taught a lesson in civil awareness the message that is being conveyed is obvious from the start it is coming and we're not prepared the use of real places and a scenario which not only could happen there are plans for when it does all add to the disturbing effect the movie will have on even the most cynical of viewers the movie's perspective is that of the society and it stays away from heart breaking personal moments which won't convey the message so none of the romeo juliet drama we're used to
<START> i got this movie for fifty cents at a going out of business sale i want my fifty cents back bad acting poor script writing lousy direction historically inaccurate even the sound of the film is awful it's not the subject matter that <UNK> i'm one of the many who find suspense films and true crime films very interesting the subject matter could have been treated more seriously with much more attention to detail and accuracy and the lack of respect shown for the victims and their <UNK> friends and family is enough to puzzle anyone also there is little to no attention paid to what could have caused someone to begin the bizarre behavior that ed <UNK> was displaying in acting out these horrible crimes br br save your time and sanity don't watch this awful film if you bought it you have my sympathy it's not a total waste though you can throw away the disc and make use of the plastic case
<START> <UNK> was <UNK> viewing from start to finish the story <UNK> on apparently random murders of men in london in various gruesome ways red <UNK> ken has to find the truth which to his surprise is a little closer to home than he might think br br gripping drama and ken was brilliant hopefully we have not seen the last of red <UNK>
<START> this was one of the worst movies that i have ever watched the story was about a woman prisoner sent into space to try and save mankind but what it actually turned out to be was that the prisoner was actually put on board a space ship with a <UNK> lesbian commander all the story was about was having sex over and over again there was no need for all of this footage only to create a soft porn film of course we had to see the heroin of the movie having sex for about 2 minutes i don't know what all this had to do with the actual plot of the movie except i assume to get men to watch it i gave it 1 out of 10 only because there was no other rating lower don't waste your money or time it has nothing to do with science fiction but rather a movie for young adolescent boys to watch to see t a the creature was shown only more than half way through the movie and looked like the alien in the movie with weaver poor excuse for entertainment
<START> what the hell was the point of this dull movie it looked pretty interesting in the beginning but quickly fell flat on its face its supposed to be based on a true story but for crying out loud is there no more script writers left in hollywood man <UNK> seen these guys in some of the best movies ever made <UNK> can play just about anything and when i see he's in a movie i don't have a problem renting it but i'm starting to wonder redford also a great actor is also <UNK> perhaps their hard up or just losing their senses the dialog was long and terribly heavy eyed especially at home with the family i wonder if the actors thought they had a hit going here perhaps uh an oscar
<START> largely forgettable tale in which <UNK> <UNK> travel into the jungle in search of missing sister br br despite its connection to the cannibal movie family this film is more of an extreme version of <UNK> <UNK> crime of the century clearly aims to exploit the at that time <UNK> <UNK> massacre by depicting a rogue self righteous <UNK> with a <UNK> for <UNK> and just a hint of <UNK> played with ruthless intensity by <UNK> <UNK> leading his <UNK> crew flock into self inflicted oblivion with sister in toe attempt to stop the <UNK> but after several failed <UNK> they end up fleeing into the green <UNK> only to run <UNK> the locals and their notorious <UNK> br br one in a string of excessive gore <UNK> that emerged in the late seventies early eighties where every new addition seemed to engage in a one <UNK> contest with its predecessor by attempting to <UNK> the most gory and graphic display ever brought to motion pictures this inferior <UNK> employs all the <UNK> and gimmicks of the others but with much less success br br was it the so called <UNK> natives who looked like they were bollywood rejects this film was made on location in <UNK> <UNK> or the inept <UNK> and <UNK> scenes that seriously <UNK> the authenticity that was apparent in cannibal holocaust you can decide without spoiling the conclusion it appeared as though put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic <UNK> for a cohesive ending where all loose ends are resolved most unsatisfying br br as with the others where the extent of the graphic depictions of violence toward humans is limited thankfully the filmmakers have <UNK> no extreme in <UNK> the worst possible cruelty on hapless animals in their pursuit of the most sadistic shocks unfortunately the only thing shocking about this film is that it rates a mention among others of the <UNK> that deal with the subject matter more convincingly br br if there are any <UNK> features at all is an <UNK> if somewhat one dimensional leading man and his <UNK> of scantily clad co stars <UNK> and provide some visual <UNK> from the relentless <UNK>
<START> yep this has got to be one of the <UNK> movies i've ever seen it's utterly tasteless has no style whatsoever the story is so thin that you can watch television through it and the whole film has so many holes you could drive an oil <UNK> through it br br sure i appreciate a good b movie as much as most male white <UNK> <UNK> do but this has got to be the worst i've seen in fact it's so b that it lacks everything that makes a b movie interesting br br the whole movie is based around such charming <UNK> as the characters beating the crap out of each other various <UNK> functions and the complete lack of sanity of anything on screen br br it's not even funny in fact it's quite the opposite i found it even boring at times due to it's extreme predictability br br i find nothing good to say about this movie it was a waste of time watching it and i hope others don't do the same mistake if you also pay for it you should get a serious done
<START> instead of watching the recycled history of pearl harbor with nothing new to reveal except for a couple of real events involving a few individuals thrown in so the makers of the film could say they contributed to the spread of history along with nothing but cgi explosions filling in for a sappy romantic triangle one should go see dark blue world br br this film takes place during the historic time in wwii which the czech pilots left their <UNK> and went to fight for the <UNK> instead of laying down their arms and giving in to the nazis it was a part of history that should at least be told once to the outside world a love triangle takes place between the main characters but one of them does not die off conveniently like in pearl harbor but through sacrifice for true friendship the movie is tragedy after tragedy with not even a bittersweet ending with our hero not enjoying glory of taking his country back the return of love by his current lover the return of love by his reunited lover or even the return of <UNK> love by his life long pet he is utterly <UNK> and feels no worse off in the russian labor camp this kind of ending is something that hollywood would probably change if it was their script br br the movie does play on the sentimental sometimes but it also shows the humanity of people overall a worthwhile movie
<START> drab morality tale about a high school kid who's pretty much the now stereotypical nerd he's smart but has no friends no social skills and a lazy loser of a father who borrows money from him a pretty girl hits on him he should've known she wanted something he's supposed to be smart right she <UNK> the poor desperate fool into writing her term paper on shakespeare which the teacher immediately knows she couldn't have written he loses the girl not that he ever really had her the confidence of his teacher and his college <UNK> all in one fell blow br br <UNK> is so silly and desperate for love that he decides to rob some heroin dealers who are running the stuff through the warehouse he works at then maybe the trashy little slut will be impressed and want to marry him sad really sad <UNK> is such a pathetic <UNK> and pretty brainless for a supposedly smart guy i mean trying to rob drug dealers has this kid got a screw loose that you stop feeling sorry for him and get the dreadful urge to kick him in the butt instead br br the girl of course tells her boyfriend about the robbery <UNK> <UNK> of to her and talks him and his <UNK> into stealing the money from <UNK> and company they try to do so and in the process manage to shoot several people the cops show up at the same time and the idiot <UNK> is dragged away a total disgrace forever i know this thing was <UNK> towards making teens behave themselves by showing them the consequences of bad behavior but all it really illustrated was the consequences of stupid behavior which is the <UNK> end of your film career of course goodbye <UNK> we never really knew ya and thank goodness for that
<START> now i've seen many many b grade films in my 15 years of living and i must say that this was one of the better ones i personally enjoyed the real estate and the storyline but it did suffer from amateur acting although <UNK> <UNK> did give a decent performance as lisa grant joseph <UNK> couldn't hold his part well enough to be considered good the other performance which really fit the film was that of barry hope barney <UNK> it begins with an eager real estate agent taking an asian couple through a house only to find there's a dead girl in the shower of the it progresses with detective <UNK> and introduces the key characters with reasonable grace i think that for any person who's in for a giggle at the over the top drama the victim provide during the over the top gory scenes this truly is a gem <UNK> who am i kidding it's not that great but worth a watch if you're insanely bored
<START> i'm seldom partial to movies about smart <UNK> teenagers who have problems with authority but toy soldiers has grown on me with repeated viewings this is as much a movie about billy <UNK> growing up and becoming an adult as anything else and i give credit to sean <UNK> and writer director daniel jr that they don't make a big deal of that but let it just unfold and sneak up on you the <UNK> of <UNK> friends their grief over <UNK> death and their joy at their survival all are genuinely moving and i have to admit i take a certain patriotic and perhaps slightly <UNK> glee when the u s army guys finally move in and <UNK> kick some terrorist butt <UNK> general kramer and the heroic robert folk score is the <UNK> on top i'm sure i could find a hundred reasons not to like toy soldiers but as long as we don't take it too seriously i don't see the need this is one of the most entertaining bad movies in my <UNK>
<START> i am a fan of a few of the vacation films but when a movie franchise goes from the big screen to the tv screen you know it's out of steam made for tv national lampoon films do not do well on tv this movie is another reason br br i think a lot of us were excited when this was coming out but we also had to face the reality it's a tv movie randy quaid is fine as cousin eddie but is better in a supporting role than the lead dana <UNK> sets history as the first actor to <UNK> her role as one of the <UNK> kids she is just as pretty but it doesn't help a thin script br br why was this movie even made it was probably because nbc recently picked up another few years of presenting x <UNK> vacation there is nothing wrong with the acting it's all in the script it's just not that funny people need to think before they write stuff like this it is one christmas movie i do not recommend
<START> i've tried to remember the name of this movie for years and years finally read something today <UNK> <UNK> 2005 that mentioned <UNK> <UNK> name and it reminded me that i had seen a movie that he was in in 1974 at the <UNK> film festival so i did a <UNK> search for <UNK> movies and found the <UNK> train we were supposed to see <UNK> <UNK> at the film festival but for some reason they were unable to show it and instead <UNK> the <UNK> train we were terribly disappointed that we weren't going to be able to see the much hyped <UNK> <UNK> and had heard nothing of the <UNK> train and have heard nothing of it since br br however i recall we were pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was and as i recall it was quite humorous would love to find it on tape
<START> when i first saw the poster of this movie i <UNK> it off as another low budget movie <UNK> youth after some days when it finally made it to the theaters one of my friends told me it's a good one br br a year later the first time when i saw the <UNK> that <UNK> was going to be aired on television and the moment finally came as i <UNK> channels and for a moment i stopped to watch and that's it i ended up watching the whole movie br br and by now 3 <UNK> later i'd have watched the movie at least 7 8 times and i don't really watch movies again and again br br this movie is great because it tries to be different when all <UNK> movies were composed of 6 songs and 4 fights br br it's a simple movie a bit slow but a very gripping screenplay <UNK> no loose ends in the movie very well <UNK> dialogues which is really really hard to find by br br music is both classic and <UNK> great <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> some great also come in the through out the movie br br cinematography deserves a mention editing is not slick but adequate for a romantic one such as this br br but what really blows you out in this movie is two things 1 the way each scene has been treated with <UNK> respect by the now famous br br 2 the beautiful lyrics by br br and one more thing deserves a special mention <UNK> part of her success attributed to for <UNK> her such a beautiful voice really tell you the voice does wonders to me br br the other actors are equally good <UNK> in the title character and the little girl and the way she shouts when she gets a new dog br br ultimately i can tell you this movie is soon on its way to be another classic with those old classic romantic ones along with another classic romantic piece
<START> i like 50s sci fi movies a lot i like the really good ones such as the day the earth stood still when worlds <UNK> invasion of the body <UNK> and many others and sometimes the really bad ones because they can be really funny and great to watch with friends such as plan 9 from outer space however when a sci fi movie is bad but not bad enough to be fun it really should be avoided this movie is just such a film the posters make it appear as some sort of sexy she beast is attacking mankind whereas the real plot is a lot less interesting a woman is married to a <UNK> she is <UNK> and begins to grow to a huge size and decides to track down this worm and kick his tail and that's about it also many of the special effects really stink especially the gigantic <UNK> <UNK> hand that comes into the room to grab the wicked <UNK>
<START> if you've seen atlantis 1 then you'd know that what made that film truly great was brilliant animation and a good script this movie was so <UNK> drawn and animated the story is also dopey i was so disappointed in this half baked drivel that i couldn't make it past the first hour and man did i try the one thing this film had was that it expanded the mole character making him both more sympathetic and three dimensional take it from me judge this junk from the cover on the video box the cover is poorly drawn disney schlock clearly grabbing for an easy buck from an unsuspecting parent if this was a stand alone flick it wouldn't be so bad but riding on the <UNK> of a brilliant piece like atlantis makes it utterly
<START> i first saw this movie when i was about 12 years old it has been one of my favorites since it's so perfect in all it's glory complete with awesome soundtrack cheesy dialog and it was both hilarious and terribly sad the first movie i really just had a fit about at the end i won't ruin it for you guys but boy is it a tear <UNK> i just remember feeling so sad for gary what a bunch of cool characters in this movie it's genius they are all so great even the nerdy girl gary doesn't like she had a nice little body though i can't believe all the girls go for rick he is such a sleaze ball with his <UNK> tied around his neck ha ha ha when watching this movie be prepared for lots of sex jokes complete with sexually <UNK> <UNK> almost but a love story at heart with real problems dealing from <UNK> to life <UNK> decisions that make you think and feel genuine sorrow for the cast i love this movie if you like valley girl another all time classic you will too
<START> was simply one of the most touching and sincere movies <UNK> seen in a long time the story of an adopted girl who on her <UNK> birthday learns the truth about her <UNK> she sets out in an <UNK> to find out more about her real mother and learns that her mother is now a terrorist br br the greatness of the movie lies in its simplicity <UNK> generally has a tendency to create unreal and pompous overblown characters in this movie every person seems real and their interactions are touching and sincere this is the reason why this ranks as one of his best movies br br the movie is emotionally <UNK> and <UNK> at the heart of the viewer as the 9 year old and as her adopted mother are simply brilliant their relationship is the <UNK> of this movie there are some notable flaws here particularly the scene where learns that she is an adopted child is jarring and seems totally unreal it is hard to believe that such sensitive parents would break such a news in the manner that they did another flaw is surprisingly enough the brilliant songs they again seem forced and stand out not <UNK> with the rest of the script br br having said these this still is one of the most poignant and beautiful movies to come out of india in a long long time this beauty is not just in the script or characters but in technical brilliance as well <UNK> camera work is sheer poetry all characters perform and the realistic humour especially in flashback scenes are entertaining br br a sincere 9
<START> dirty dancing i think everyone has seen this movie at one time or another i can remember as a kid i loved this movie and watched it over and over again without <UNK> of it br br now that i'm a little older i bought the dvd recently and still wasn't disappointed with the performance br br <UNK> and grey create the atmosphere for this movie even though it's claimed they don't get along the chemistry in the movie is unbelievable as the movie proceeds we are sucked into their relationship and believe every single one of their actions br br the soundtrack is amazing the music only adds to the romantic mood of the movie and adds to the relationship between baby patrick br br the last scene makes this movie who can ever forget the famous line puts baby in the corner the song is perfect and the dancing is amazing br br i would recommend this movie to anyone at any age it's just a fun movie anyone can enjoy 8 10
<START> sex lives of the <UNK> men is about the sex lives of several men involved in delivering <UNK> so there are no surprises there it is in fact pretty much what you might expect from the title that is it's a quirky comedy involving sex and <UNK> men at times the film works it's an edgy sometimes uncomfortable comedy about the lives of some rather <UNK> and rather average men who are having problems of various sorts with women where the film clearly does not work and why it failed at the box office is that the quirky uncomfortable parts are perhaps just a <UNK> too quirky and uncomfortable instead of laughing during the scene of a man suspended from a basement ceiling <UNK> over another man while he makes love to his wife i think most of us just kind of <UNK> <UNK> and wonder what andy <UNK> was thinking well perhaps we are shown what he was thinking all too clearly
<START> track listing 1 outta my head 2 <UNK> take me away 3 4 machine gun <UNK> the girl of my dreams is giving me nightmares 5 <UNK> 9 growing pains 6 grace good thing 7 <UNK> up 8 james <UNK> a <UNK> 9 k lee 1 1 1 10 the international noise conspiracy smash it up 11 <UNK> shock living with you 12 <UNK> <UNK> girl 13 filler machines don't sleep 14 giants of science complete this progression 15 rocket science <UNK> 16 the cruel sea three <UNK> dog 17 dog home entertainment system 18 drag secret design 19 chemical heart <UNK> mix 20 come on <UNK> mix br br loved this movie sure it wasn't hollywood material some people complained about the script acting but thats the beauty in australian movies
<START> the worst ever korean movie the plot is ridiculously complex unbelievable and the film creates not a single shock it builds up suspense well enough then leaves you <UNK> providing no shock or <UNK> moment whenever there is a chilling moment you are not bothered by it as you're still trying to work out who is who and what is going on it goes something like this a <UNK> company <UNK> 4 people for a <UNK> career but the owners are not what they seem they have model dolls of everyone and a strange girl is seen walking about the place and the owners have no recognition of a girl it turns out that everyone is there for a reason and thats as much as i could grasp the ending is a <UNK> of killings and you don't know who's a doll who's real and who's dead i don't recommend it to fans of korean asian horror films
<START> i don't know how people can watch this the only people who enjoy watching this are those who have no feelings and emotions and enjoy watching people die houses burn down car crashes babies die and cast members being killed off every week its the most absurd thing on television and i still don't know how it pulls in the ratings its so depressing i can imagine the writers sitting down and saying <UNK> who shall we kill of next week <UNK> or house shall we torch in a months time ' br br its the most depressing absurd and most stupid thing on tv at the moment and i cant understand peoples motives for watching this depressing pile of crap anymore
<START> i don't even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie i mean really you got this guy running from a bunch of cats because he's dead but in order to be really dead this girl has to shoot them and they leave a corpse even though normal people can't see them because their dead the script already has a hole in it the size of <UNK> then you have the main character played by susan who just <UNK> up her lines in a <UNK> boring voice and with so little emotion on her face she might as well have starred as a female terminator robot it's absolutely horrendous and i don't even understand how i managed to see it all the way to the end of the movie the end being just as stupid as the entire movie mind you and with absolutely no reward in it for the viewer what so ever they might as well have called this movie the little movie that could <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the greek locale for parts of the movie were very beautiful and the photography get all my votes and that's about the extent of my <UNK> for this movie i found that all the characters were <UNK> <UNK> found so often in the american culture and were shallow and uninteresting susan sarandon and gena rowlands are easy to look at but i found their characters very <UNK> and unlikeable for many other reasons when gena rowlands sings at a party it made me wonder how this woman could think of herself as a competent star of the stage i was tempted to hit the mute button until she finished singing molly <UNK> was herself and <UNK> <UNK> character was so <UNK> he was downright creepy the movie was much too long for my liking and i could not sit through it again even at the point of a gun
<START> this was one of the best half hour horror suspense fantasy shows of the eighties without a doubt granted the show had a barely capable cast with every single episode and it <UNK> as far as production values i e the sets went but darn it i have to give it some credit for being <UNK> with the plots i mean the plot of each episode was edgy enough that even i a hardened horror movie shock film and 70's <UNK> house buff got a little <UNK> and <UNK> out great show just great regardless of what the other reviewers have said here my favorite episode was called bug house yeah that was the title i think anyhow it still gives me the <UNK> every time i think about it to this day almost 20 years after it first premiered other shows like tales from the <UNK> the outer limits and of course the twilight zone were definitely better production values wise but in my opinion they ain't got a thing as far as plot lines go when compared to this sick little show it definitely <UNK> the way for the even more graphic cult classic phenomenon that was tales from the crypt
<START> i shall begin with a <UNK> this movie is not recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played the game before watching the movie relies on the audience's knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements and it does so very subtly do your <UNK> before watching this wonderful piece of cg film and i promise it'll be that much better br br with that in mind this film has some of the most spectacular cg sequences i have ever witnessed the whole experience felt like an extra long <UNK> sequence from the game on <UNK> yeah the attention to detail in each scene especially in the heavy action oriented ones is so impeccable it left me with a sense of awe br br i believe the soundtrack is <UNK> so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music again for those who are familiar with the story and background the music should not surprise anyone although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original <UNK> each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animation br br once again i myself having only played through once thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from square <UNK> and that is the feel in most scenes choreographed and organized like a dance br br in short if you enjoyed the music or the game final fantasy 7 this film will blow you out of the water if you're in the unfortunate majority who has not experienced the goodness known as on <UNK> or pc doing so before watching the movie will allow for an <UNK> greater experience br br finally i just want to make a note of the quality in <UNK> this film characters move with <UNK> each scene background comes to life and tells its own story for those who criticize the <UNK> and <UNK> of the story plot i urge you to the animation facial reactions subtle clues that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery br br square <UNK> and the great <UNK> has set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling <UNK> children has <UNK> in a new era for cg animations allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselves br br thanks square <UNK> the wait was well worth it
<START> i rarely give ratings less than 5 but in this instance i must <UNK> in <UNK> leonard is a great writer with many wonderful complex books original characters crisp dialogue <UNK> plot twists films based on his books go way back to <UNK> paul newman mr bronson and out of sight clooney lopez among others even when done so so the films at least have some measure of story essence coming through this one it is simply not a worthy addition to the <UNK> br br the acting is bad i do not know why because these are very capable people here and the story is handled with stupidity the characters are re arranged the chemistry is missing the actors and actresses are <UNK> cast br br since <UNK> leonard is a really great story <UNK> i would hope that anyone who does not know his work would be <UNK> from reading his books because they saw this disappointing rendition of one of his stories br br the story is a sequel to get <UNK> if you have not seen that film do not watch this if you have seen get <UNK> do not proceed to this br br i saw be cool a few years back and tonight have been re visiting the <UNK> the first time must not have made such a negative impression because i had forgotten how dismal this sequel was br br fortunately i think no less of those who appeared in this film for having done so they probably expected something more get <UNK> was original and great fun travolta i nearly always like but he is so much better in <UNK> pulp fiction and in the <UNK> get <UNK> he was clearly unable to enjoy whatever was going on here br br and i hear freaky <UNK> another <UNK> leonard book is in pre production for 2008 release hopefully they can pull it off br br read the books they are almost all great
<START> this movie was simply amazing the writing was incredible as well as the directing and acting the story instantly gets you interested this movie is one of those movies that has your heart <UNK> the whole time as always <UNK> is brilliant his on screen acting is as powerful as any hollywood actor the cast in this film is perfect each character made the story more complete the cinematography was captivating and it <UNK> the movie i was totally stuck to the screen and couldn't stop watching it there was no getting up for popcorn or anything this movie is one of the best all year maybe even the best definitely rent this movie i recommend it this movie if u want to see great <UNK> or just for pure entertainment
<START> this film to me deserves a lot of praise because even though i am not a <UNK> or <UNK> i remained inspired throughout the whole documentary br br the depth of history and development of these two extreme sports <UNK> what they were able to do for two groups of individuals the dedication that these individuals had have is truly inspiring and it was because of them that others can now enjoy and do what these guys <UNK> br br unlike most other documentaries this one was cleverly put together the amount of footage that was recorded and survived throughout the decades is outstanding and it was because of this that some of the greatest editing i have ever seen was put together and resulted in the subject remaining focused without the urge for them to <UNK> to recent footage of the more famous surfers and <UNK> that remains popular today br br the film explores areas such as the success such <UNK> new tricks winning <UNK> and gathering fame as well as failures such as injury or burning out br br it was also fulfilling to hear the experiences come from the <UNK> and surfers themselves and not from second hand information this resulted in a better picture to be drawn br br overall a truly outstanding effort
<START> the only reason i bought the dvd was to satisfy my curiosity about the scene when liz kim basinger <UNK> to the music of joe <UNK> you can leave your hat on that was the best part of the whole film not because the scene was any good only the song i am not saying it was a terribly bad film just not that good <UNK> so br br especially when the exploration of male and female sexuality could have been expanded upon instead of <UNK> on the dangerous side of lust obsession and <UNK> and where it can lead to it drags its heels from one idea to the other for example when john played by rourke is able to leave her on the top of the big wheel liz kim basinger is <UNK> <UNK> at the bizarre experience courtesy of john's sense of humor but less <UNK> at his sexual exploits involving the ever willing liz and like one reader mentioned that for a woman to enjoy sex she has to experience the dangerous side is unconvincing this dangerous side is not exploited enough in the film and one gets a sense of anti climax from the view point that it all could go horribly wrong the theme of bondage makes an appearance often but only just takes one to the brink of danger and then all goes well is the film sending the message out that this kind of <UNK> is fine if the film was making a point about the <UNK> of bondage and by <UNK> the ugly <UNK> of sad <UNK> then maybe it would make a good moral point instead the film <UNK> jumps from one <UNK> scene of rourke feeding basinger and her to another in a film that could have been good it falls flat on its face because it does not expand and <UNK> the themes the film is maybe trying to relate thus for me it doesn't have a plot nor a theme just a mixture of ideas
<START> this is one great sweeping movie you will remember for a long time it is about history america the change of times teddy <UNK> <UNK> a kidnapped american and her children and the leader of the with the blood of the prophet in his <UNK> br br this movie is based on a true story like jesse james was a <UNK> an american was kidnapped in <UNK> and the marines went part way to the <UNK> of to rescue him so much for that you know hollywood sean connery is the <UNK> <UNK> and muslim leader <UNK> <UNK> is the guy who was kidnapped along with her two kids the son is rex <UNK> <UNK> simon no less john huston is secretary of state with a great john huston style straight line at a state dinner watch out for it brian <UNK> is teddy <UNK> all american all male a character that is an interesting commentary as modern as today br br the <UNK> and beauty of the desert and <UNK> are shown beautifully in the cinematography in this film which will stay with you a haunting and compelling memory the score is as sweeping and exotic as the images br br this is a story about two cultures both with grand ideas and historic <UNK> struggling for the future without an idea at all about one another in any event the struggle comes down to might versus <UNK> br br then at the last there is the little boy remember the little boy what do you think he thinks
<START> if you thought <UNK> 10 5 was stupid you'll be happy to hear that fx reached into the <UNK> of made for tv hell and <UNK> it's fingers into this pseudo post 9 11 <UNK> not only was the plot stupid it was a complete ripoff of 24 and a bad ripoff at that the filming style was the now <UNK> <UNK> action look complete with cuts to grainy b w footage i'm not quite sure what that means but it sure sounds like something the <UNK> said to the director before filming i don't know what they were going for here but it reminded me of the guy at the office who thinks <UNK> with fly ins and animations are cool br br the story is that 6 terrorists take over a nuclear power plant in southern <UNK> that's right nuclear power plants where hundreds of people work where there's security <UNK> up the <UNK> <UNK> for the sake of reality they put 2 off duty in the mix because they'd be able to stop 6 people right six i mean even bruce willis had to deal with more terrorists over at that stupid <UNK> building br br leslie hope tv's <UNK> bauer plays a officer who has problems talking on the phone after she's shot in her bullet proof <UNK> her voice sounds like a sally tv ad whiny and monotonous her character is only a plot device and after she performs her one small duty she is promptly <UNK> of yes <UNK> bauer is died br br bruce <UNK> stars as fbi s a c tom <UNK> who continually points out how he punches foreign <UNK> in the face his boss is out so nobody over at the <UNK> of <UNK> security believes his of the situation he's the sensible one out of a group of paranoid public officials afraid of taking blame for any type of catastrophe he's calm he's strong he's boring br br there is absolutely nothing redeeming or entertaining about <UNK> ok well maybe <UNK> bauer getting died was pretty unnecessary and funny other than that nothing redeeming
<START> this isn't so much a review of a tale of two sisters as it is a discussion of some of the smaller plot details so i advise you not to read this review if you haven't seen the film because doing so will absolutely ruin a few surprises for you br br in a way a tale of two sisters is far from original at least from a purely superficial aspect some of its <UNK> is taken straight from ring or dark water while the storyline itself especially what calls the rubber reality aspect of the narrative is reminiscent of films like fight club lead character <UNK> with someone created in their mind <UNK> drive character creates alternate reality in a <UNK> as well as other minor aspects of lost highway <UNK> ladder and basically every film under the sun dealing with mental illness plus <UNK> films the others <UNK> los <UNK> <UNK> particularly with regards to the <UNK> nature of memory et al thankfully all these similarities do not detract from the film's overall emotional impact and i personally found a tale of two sisters an extremely moving and rewarding experience br br many people have commented on the confusing nature of the narrative but i personally found the storyline to be fairly self <UNK> even if it is in part portrayed in a non <UNK> manner the narrative only becomes confusing for some because <UNK> through the final third the story switches from a purely <UNK> setting ie <UNK> <UNK> perception of reality to an objective one with a flashback at the end explaining the origins of <UNK> nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness the shift in emphasis is bound to throw some people off guard but <UNK> i found it somewhat reminiscent of aforementioned <UNK> drive even though we're not dealing with a character's perception of reality via a dream but instead their own <UNK> <UNK> something which in turn reminded me of another lynch movie lost highway to be honest i don't really regard a tale of two sisters as a horror movie as such but rather a tragic story of a family's breakdown as well as an honest look at a character's mental illness and i <UNK> to add that fans of <UNK> cinema are going to love this film br br that aside the cinematography in a tale of two sisters is incredible and visually this is one of the most beautiful films i've seen this side of wong <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the performances are also fantastic without exception and i expect to see more of the four lead actors in the future not to mention the music but then east asian films without a great soundtrack seem to be few and far between these days br br it's very likely that some people will look past the <UNK> artistic points of a tale of two sisters and simply dismiss it as yet another asian horror film oblivious to its aesthetic beauty and honest <UNK> approach but then each to their own if you can ignore some of the film's <UNK> aspects and simply take it for what it is at heart ie an extremely tragic heart breaking story then i see no reason not to recommend it
<START> you'd hardly know that a year later mgm put norma <UNK> in the <UNK> which <UNK> with mgm technical know how how far they came in one year <UNK> is a very <UNK> early <UNK> the camera hardly moves <UNK> is her usual charming self and <UNK> does well in a romantic leading role they are all very careful to speak clearly and slowly into the <UNK> source which does against a naturally flowing dramatic scene but the play is a <UNK> and fun so one can enjoy <UNK> if one's expectations are not too high oh by the way the plot involves a ring of upper class jewel thieves who <UNK> themselves into society to prey on their victims there are some clever twists in the script and true love <UNK> all an oscar <UNK> for best screenplay adaptation
<START> the story of dirty fat filth like middle age woman who lives out of society be knowing as the <UNK> woman ever lived can someone take her the crown there is one couple the nice film for people who don't like ordinary pieces of comedies and don't mind some disturbing sense of humor i was very surprised seeing some scenes and love theirs <UNK> kind br br
<START> silly and violent thriller that is a rip off of <UNK> but without any charm and intelligence the plot is ridiculous and the cast seems to be tired and anxious to be free of this obnoxious entry this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way it's a shame to see good actors like <UNK> and james make a living in a mess like this
<START> olivier film stars asia <UNK> as a woman who had a relationship with michael madsen madsen is a business man who's in financial trouble in desperation he is going to sell his share of a business to a company called golden eagle a company from the far east as madsen begins his moves away from his company asia <UNK> returns to his life the pair had a <UNK> love affair that included her doing business <UNK> for madsen with said golden eagle once <UNK> enters the film the film follows her as we see the <UNK> web she's woven and how the complications spin dangerously and violently out of control br br i'm not a fan actually i was quite bored as the film seems to go from <UNK> to post for much of the first hour during which i kept wondering what the point was other than to provide a <UNK> role for <UNK> <UNK> daughter of director <UNK> <UNK> and a director in her own right is a unique actress at times stunningly good she is more often then not going to give you a quirky off beat portrayal of a damaged human being sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't i don't think it completely works here mostly because the script is too complicated to support it i didn't care what was going on so her wounded girl just <UNK> me the wrong way she seemed more nut job than anything else i'm not <UNK> the actors but writer director <UNK> who has once again constructed a complicated tale with the sort of parts actors love to tackle but which leave audiences scratching their heads because they they don't really work br br if you must try it on cable
<START> <UNK> is a 1942 film partly aimed at getting american support for the war against nazi germany propaganda or not it's great entertainment the leading actors are robert <UNK> and <UNK> lane although director alfred hitchcock wanted gary cooper and barbara stanwyck in the roles which would have given the movie more stature this is a good movie anyway with robert <UNK> and <UNK> lane bringing their own style to the characters as in other hitchcock movies we see the director's disregard for the socially suave and the well <UNK> he often portrayed spies and foreign agents as nice upper class folk who at the same time <UNK> at <UNK> values and concepts such as guilty until proved innocent these upper <UNK> <UNK> are the last the police pursue or even suspect hitchcock had a <UNK> <UNK> of the police he wanted to elevate the regular guy the and the fellow who doesn't take himself too seriously one can see him wanting gary cooper as an icon in the frank <UNK> mold nevertheless bob <UNK> puts his own <UNK> on the boy next door and works well in the role <UNK> lane as the <UNK> female lead comes off as the all american girl who can handle herself quite nicely when put to the test robert <UNK> as <UNK> plant worker barry kane is framed for a bombing that kills his best friend this leads to a cross country chase scene reminiscent of other hitchcock heroes on the run hitchcock repeats some of the well established <UNK> from previous films the reluctant female who is drawn into the action e g madeleine <UNK> in the <UNK> steps and <UNK> his life to <UNK> the authorities who are on his heels we view scenes of america as kane tries to find the real <UNK> in the bombing he stands accused of we see rivers bridges backwoods <UNK> <UNK> the hoover <UNK> and finally new york city new york is a fitting backdrop for the climax as we go from <UNK> center to the ocean liners with a cut to the ship <UNK> and the grand finale on the statue of liberty great movie with <UNK> action don't miss it
<START> certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time excellent original music clever <UNK> it's hard to be <UNK> about something this good there isn't one character that you don't instantly love to watch there's trouble in the black room my name is <UNK> the lines thrown away left and right are classics themselves <UNK> <UNK> anchorman <UNK> <UNK> any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set up punchline variety called you tasteless my organization is pro <UNK> where's lopez in my <UNK> they don't sound brilliant until you hear them in the context of the scene this movie will eat your brain it's too good i've read reviews calling this film racist which couldn't be <UNK> from the truth every scene is gold from the <UNK> commercial to the brothers in the black room meeting to that haunting <UNK> in the closing scene one word genius
<START> <UNK> de <UNK> genuinely bizarre short story on which this was loosely based gets an unsettling albeit <UNK> filmed treatment here as a sort of forbidden love <UNK> over a period of time between man and beast in the early part of the <UNK> century thin and very blonde english actor ben daniels plays the role of a young soldier during the <UNK> wars who gets lost whilst <UNK> an <UNK> french painter across the rugged dangerous landscapes of the <UNK> desert after literally going around in circles the two men give up ever trying to reach civilization again thus each decides against better judgment mind you to go their separate ways with the promise of both returning to the same exact spot when and if a water source is actually found this is of course how <UNK> character comes to encounter the creature a wild and <UNK> female <UNK> and eventually form a seemingly <UNK> bond or rather love with it that both saves his life and nearly destroys it by film's end the exquisite cinematography <UNK> dialog somewhat demented story which arguably hints at possible <UNK> in about three scenes are what ultimately lead professional critics to pan the film as pretentious and overlong rubbish while it is a film that isn't exactly for all tastes mind you i find it to be a subtle though decidedly left of center mixture of fantasy with a surreal and <UNK> atmosphere <UNK> by the fact that for more than half of the flick actor ben daniels is forced to perform opposite a wild animal four <UNK> were actually used as opposed to just the one which plain common sense and a slight knowledge of <UNK> <UNK> that it must have been a <UNK> and very difficult job that he managed to pull off quite brilliantly if you ask me overall i think that passion in the desert takes a while to warm up to but if you're a patient person who is willing to give it some time it does in fact cast it's uniquely original spell over you in spite of everything and unlike most <UNK> human and animal relationship stories it need not require a talking pig monkey or shaggy dog to keep your interest throughout out of
<START> yep it's me again mr 'i sit through crap so you don't have <UNK> br br what do you think this is about could it possibly be about a woman who call a sex line and <UNK> to meet <UNK> in a secluded area then her cross dressing boyfriend comes along and <UNK> their throat with razor before they make off together with his cash wow what a guess and if i tell you that the cop who is put on the case is forced to team up with a sexy assistant da to nail these <UNK> what conclusion will you come to do you <UNK> the sexy da will go undercover wearing a flimsy red dress to an attempt to meet the drag queen but then end up being kidnapped and having to be rescued by the maverick officer who has already handed in his gun and <UNK> <UNK> you get 10 points br br frankly this film bored me to tears why do people insist on making this kind of rubbish its a waste of our time their time and yet they still carry on regardless filming a movie that no one gives an <UNK> about if it has any redeeming features there's the fact that it has some of the <UNK> ladies i've seen in a motion picture for a while i hope they spent what <UNK> <UNK> they earned on plenty of <UNK> and they'd look great on the cover of <UNK> or <UNK> on the top of a car in a bikini they should just leave acting to the professionals like shannon <UNK> br br talking about future careers i ran into the director the other day he sure does whip up a tasty chicken <UNK> meal i must say too that the uniform really does suit him i asked him about <UNK> <UNK> and his eyes went to the floor before he <UNK> something about extra <UNK> oh well guess it didn't quite work out never mind they're letting him take over the drive thru tomorrow <UNK> 1 10
<START> what the hell is this that was my first reaction to this film actually my first reaction contained more swearing this isn't star wars star wars is space battles this movie has none star wars is the force this movie only has a retarded witch with a magic ring star wars is <UNK> battles this movie hasn't got any battle worth mentioning star wars is humor this movie isn't star wars is a galaxy far far away this movie has horses in it besides all of this how did lucas get the insane idea to let a five year old baby do the leading role big big disappointment do you like star wars don't watch this 1 out of 10
<START> the silly saying you can't touch this surely applies here with all the clone horror and sci fi films coming out along with all the inferior remakes it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your time that's why i always rely on the classics that scared the out of me when i was a pre teen br br the thing is without an ounce of doubt in my mind the <UNK> sci fi horror classic that john carpenter or any other director sorry even you mr spielberg ever made what really gives it power though is not the gore it of <UNK> and blood and god knows what other <UNK> but rather the sense of dread isolation and <UNK> it <UNK> in the characters and the viewer br br you can't get more remote than <UNK> and in this howling <UNK> white setting is where the story takes place several americans <UNK> and military men are <UNK> there one day they witness a <UNK> <UNK> dog running for dear life from gun wielding <UNK> before they know it the american <UNK> is battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants it may <UNK> into disgusting slimy bloody <UNK> before it's finished but once it's finished if you didn't see it in progress you can't tell it among humans or other normal earth animals br br kurt russell keith david <UNK> <UNK> richard donald carter thomas <UNK> and charles are just a few of the fine cast this film is the reason why horror can be a great genre it actually still scares me the alien blood jumping out of the <UNK> dish when the hot wire touches it still makes me jump br br still the scariest of them all
<START> well i only caught the tail end of this film on hbo just the final 10 minutes or so but i must say that it contains probably the most laughable depiction of distance running ever put on film i'm a serious distance runner and a dedicated fan of the sport and i've sat through many painful <UNK> in movies before however nothing could have ever prepared me for what is shown on screen in the final 10 minutes of this movie it literally defies belief the depiction of the <UNK> is even more ironic considering that african <UNK> completely dominate the sport and they are elegant and <UNK> the female protagonist <UNK> along like an overweight pregnant woman and her highly trained male supporters are no better well into the race this alleged world class runner is surrounded by <UNK> overweight people many of whom are walking i find it interesting that the director decided to have her lead the female competition yet near the end she is shown passing people who look like they're <UNK> along on two broken legs are we to believe that this amazing stellar <UNK> has only <UNK> a crippled person at the very end of the race maybe the director just thinks that female <UNK> can't run faster than 12 minute miles and he has obviously never heard of <UNK> like paula <UNK> or br br even if you aren't a running fan you'll be <UNK> by the insanely inaccurate portrayal of running and this movie is only watchable as unintentional comedy here is a note to the director the next time you decide to make a movie about a sport it might be worth it to hire at least one person who actually has observed that sport in action
<START> <UNK> indeed hitchcock is <UNK> all time <UNK> however we all know his <UNK> are <UNK> as well so we forgive him and we not only forgive him but we applaud his clever way to invite us for an unforgettable train ride br br i saw <UNK> 1953 i confess a week before this one and i put both in the same category as part of his <UNK> these <UNK> <UNK> in his genius questioning and <UNK> his artistic <UNK> that <UNK> psychological drops of blood on the viewer without leaving <UNK> of guilt instead very subtle awareness of feeling <UNK> br br the pen is always than the sword and <UNK> firmly wrote the most <UNK> questions with his <UNK> and then holding firmly with his hands he held cameras that always reflected peoples <UNK> for blood most humans have otherwise comedy wouldn't be mostly a tragic thing and making people laugh wouldn't be so complex br br mixing all dark elements of high society with a wealthy psychopath bruno and an ambitious <UNK> player wanna be politician guy the story is one of the most well constructed and guided by <UNK> inspiring many filmmakers not only with its plot but with <UNK> images provoking dark smiles and happy nightmares br br barely perfect
<START> now after watching the <UNK> children twice the storyline isn't as shallow as majority has criticized it to be in my opinion if you haven't played or disliked it for whatever reason this movie is most likely not for you being familiar to the original story is a <UNK> to understanding <UNK> fully otherwise you will just see the greatest cg animation in your life so far br br without actually spoiling the storyline i must admit that after seeing <UNK> we have been putting pieces together with my friends relying on our knowledge of seeing it second time allowed to actually pay attention to the story more and most of the questions we may have had were answered some were not <UNK> is clearly for players fans and doesn't honestly try to be anything else there is little to none realism in it outside world which serves the purpose music is mostly <UNK> themes with a <UNK> touch team according to end credits and works well with the eye candy without exceptions i found the music <UNK> the experience added to the visual fireworks in all situations br br we all know you can't put a in 1 5 hours and keeping that in mind the storyline actually offered more to me than i expected there are two issues at hand in <UNK> and both stories were wrapped up very smoothly between the action sequences and trust me when i say there's a lot of it action that is br br i'm changing my vote from 9 to 10 after watching it the second time because i had missed a few <UNK> sequences i couldn't put together the first time that provided some answers as a warning it's going to be easy to disregard the story and concentrate on graphics but try not to judge the children because of that if you don't let the story in it's no wonder it seems sloppy br br i'm not going to praise the graphics because i assume we all know they are awesome which might be an understatement especially characters talk so much more with their facial expressions than ever before i hope you pay attention to the storyline for it actually makes sense and works well with the whole get ready for the ride of your life there are no breaks
<START> i think that this was one of the most trite films ever made no redeeming features at all even my 12 year old son said it was laughable may be a good candidate for the next generation of mystery science theatre
<START> honestly i don't really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show it <UNK> the elements of the original while <UNK> on them the storytelling has been updated and while some of the episodes seem to be a bit fast that is a good thing br br christopher <UNK> is perfect in the role easily as good as tom baker br br rose is one of the best companions on par with sarah jane smith or br br i like the concept that the have been destroyed no more with the doctor acting as president <UNK> and it adds something to the character to be the only one left br br the <UNK> are outstanding especially in comparison to the original br br take it from me and i was a huge dr who geek i actually took notes while watching the show all the way from dr number 1 to dr number 8 i tossed the horrible movie out of cannon personally this is the best sci fi show on tv right now possibly ever watch it and buy the dvd
<START> <UNK> is not an <UNK> exploration of mixed sexuality but if you're in need of it a movie for an x rated channel although i suspect there's nothing in this movie to spoil for a willing viewer the plot is simply an excuse for male to female and male to male <UNK> set in the unconvincing context of a competition between a <UNK> school for future <UNK> and a major school for those seeking higher degrees in the liberal arts there's likewise a <UNK> of cultural clash between high status and lower status french youth plus a societal conflict involving native <UNK> and arab immigrants from north africa all that's missing is a female to female <UNK> which could easily have been arranged with no more than a slight twist in the plot br br the acting is at a somewhat higher level than in the usual pornographic movie but <UNK> is to be blunt about it no more than pornography with artistic aspirations i'm not offended by the sex it's just repetitive and before long boring where's the <UNK> office when you really need it
<START> as a camera <UNK> i couldn't help but admire the great look that this picture achieved the performances were excellent as was the story just when i thought this film was about to slow down it didn't heart <UNK> tension great pacing through editing and a score that knows when to be quiet all come together here under competent and capable direction the camera was always in the right place love that
<START> i just saw this movie tonight coming into it i thought it would be good because i like natalie portman alot and susan sarandon is a great actor too but it was way better than i could have imagined you come out of the movie feeling great the acting was excellent which is something that can be hard to come by lately natalie portman is destined for great things and me being a college student at <UNK> think that it is great that she is going to school instead of just being an actor anyways back on subject the movie keeps you interested the entire way through and i definitely think that everyone should go see it i would give more details but i don't want to give away the movie
<START> i recently <UNK> 8 by going and see this movie in the cinema it was a waste of time and the only feeling you get going out of the theater is a slightly <UNK> of all the disgusting social pornography br br it could have been interesting if it had a quite absurd twist but it hadn't so it was just plain awful with maybe one or two scenes which could have been taken out and made to very nice short movies br br another thing i thought about is the way the director uses all the finish stereotypes as characters it is quite extraordinary how you as a finish director can make a movie with the worst stereotypes of your own <UNK> it was sad to sit and and hear the audience sitting and laughing at things that they thought was typical finish but in general just is making fun of people
<START> i am a chess player and i wanted to like this film trouble is the content could have been <UNK> in a 30 minute documentary br br there were lots of shots of corridors being walked down and <UNK> <UNK> out in the hall where he won the world championship there were other shots of <UNK> being walked round the site of the 1997 match and being told where he sat and where deep blue was located this just looked like filler br br also i didn't find it interesting to see in detail where deep blue was now and seeing an <UNK> <UNK> trying <UNK> to it what would we have seen of interest inside anyway a little <UNK> br br also the recent match against i no longer follow professional chess enough to know when and where this was it would have been nice to have been told was this a one off <UNK> for the <UNK> was it part of the world championship cycle what was the final score the of the film was the play in game two could would <UNK> let <UNK> see the machine that's where the focus should have been
<START> it is interesting to see what people think of this movie since it is in fact quite unique though it bears some of the <UNK> of clive <UNK> writing even though it might seem a bit cynical to say so the movie is just intricate enough to <UNK> those that need standard hollywood plot <UNK> and layered so that if you expect to be fed you will see a normal monster flick with lots of monsters and a disjointed plot br br those who need a linear specific and plot line will hate this movie because the story lies like in the <UNK> partially between the lines or in this case partially off screen in comments and the imagination br br another possible hang up is the ending of which i can say without spoiling it that it is not entirely good and not entirely bad it is in fact not very defined at all which i know sends some people into raging <UNK> about that they didn't get to know what happened but to me and to many others i'm sure just adds another dimension to the story the dimension of <UNK> and in addition the point that great <UNK> has a tendency to cause <UNK> that <UNK> quite far br br there is definitely moral here but of a rather different kind than the standard hollywood in your face at the end of the movie sort of display <UNK> that moral up is simple even though it is not quite that simply displayed prejudice and the human tendency to hate the different br br i love this movie even though as many of the reviewers have noted the expressions of the actors with the exception of david <UNK> who does a wonderful appearance are rather tacky i'm not sure they are entirely to blame for their <UNK> appearance and lack of depth though seeing that these are common problems in <UNK> literature to screenplay br br all in all this is a great movie provided that you do not expect it to be a standard horror movie
<START> wow a masterpiece of a movie not to be missed br br i had no idea what this movie was when i started watching it late night i didn't find out it was a stone film until after the film when i went on imdb watching it i was <UNK> the cast especially eric <UNK> is just superb one of the best scripts and camera work ever the movie drew me in and kept me <UNK> until the very end i did not dare blink for fear of missing something amazing how a small budget film can be so engrossing and well made while huge budget films that feature tons of action and computer generated special effects can be so incredibly boring don't miss this film
<START> the <UNK> of father brown is that a good dose of roman <UNK> will solve all of life's problems a little <UNK> i don't mind but this gets a bit ridiculous at times br br some fine actors have played father brown over the years kenneth more and <UNK> hughes are two good examples alec guinness plays him in this film and does all right by him but you didn't see any great demand for future father brown films br br i suppose if you are a committed roman catholic it all makes perfectly good sense it's far more important to catch the thief and <UNK> him to your religion than see he's brought to justice br br but that's what were asked to accept here in fact there is a <UNK> story before the main action of the film guinness in <UNK> <UNK> is caught trying to put back stolen <UNK> that one of his <UNK> sidney james had during a robbery br br that's the story he gives the local cops and of course this is something that james has in him so he can't break the <UNK> br br now on to bigger game master thief played by peter <UNK> has stolen a cross that is <UNK> to father brown and was said to belong to st <UNK> back in the day but father brown is more interested in getting to go back to his faith than seeing him brought to justice so he <UNK> the cops so he can accomplish his mission br br i'm sorry but this whole thing was just too much for me to swallow father brown i'd hate to say it was guilty of <UNK> and ought to have been arrested and he was under no <UNK> not to reveal anything he knew about the man had not come to him as a seeking <UNK> and spiritual advice br br author g k <UNK> a very noted catholic lay person in his day finds all this very reasonable carried to his logical conclusion we should replace all police forces with an army of priests br br guinness borrows from his own <UNK> from kind hearts and <UNK> and from barry fitzgerald in going my way to create father brown granted though brown is a lot than the other two there's also a bit of colonel nicholson in this portrayal in the bridge on the river <UNK> guinness also was playing a character who's rather weird interpretation of the rules caused him to lose sight of what was important in the situation nicholson was in br br father <UNK> an entertaining fellow when he's solving mysteries and making the authorities look foolish we've enjoyed brother do it in a medieval setting and american audiences liked father <UNK> played by tom <UNK> a few years back br br this film should have stuck to being entertaining
<START> one of the best sitcoms to run on indian television along with <UNK> and great acting well paced and an extremely amusing script made this a truly memorable series the fun filled opening montage sung by none other than the <UNK> kumar gave a very accurate picture of what one could expect i used to borrow it from my local video library years after <UNK> had stopped airing it i wish indian television would <UNK> back to serials such as these rather than the <UNK> <UNK> and reality television which is all its good for these days anyone who's found of genuinely good comedy ought to go and get this series you'll might also enjoy a couple of <UNK> sitcoms such as ups and downs and <UNK> which are certainly comparable to <UNK> best
<START> a remake of a successful movie can be a <UNK> business at best to remake a true classic especially one that is the definitive film of a director like alfred hitchcock is something else again and after watching this version of psycho ' directed by gus van <UNK> two things come to mind immediately what's the point and what on earth were they thinking especially in light of the fact that van <UNK> used the same screenplay by joseph <UNK> taken from the novel by robert <UNK> that hitchcock used the final result here <UNK> some of the <UNK> points of the art of filmmaking first that a <UNK> should be just that a of the original rather than a using new players and second that shooting in color using more blood and being a bit more graphic does little more than detract from the impact of the film although this was a noble effort by van <UNK> ironically in the end it suffers from the same flaw with which norma bates was <UNK> the <UNK> of the film was divided half was hitchcock half van <UNK> and the <UNK> though met shall never be bound van <UNK> even working from the original script would have been better off making his own film all the way through rather than attempting to <UNK> exactly what hitchcock did with certain scenes the opening shot of the movie for instance and especially the scene arguably one of the most famous scenes in the history of the cinema <UNK> hitchcock from the shots looking directly into the shower head to the one of the drain and using the same ' sound effects even as homage to hitchcock again only distracted from the story and if you factor in the performance of william h macy as private eye you have yet another split in the psyche of the film macy is a terrific actor one of the best character actors in the business and his performance here is excellent but as good as it is the attitude and delivery are pure david mamet with whom he has worked many times and seemingly out of context with what van <UNK> is doing so the film winds up with a triple personality disorder hitchcock van <UNK> and mamet i felt like i was watching house of good will psycho games ' br br as far as performances go <UNK> was as solid as they come and anne <UNK> marion <UNK> did a good job of creating an original character escaping the trap of attempting an imitation of janet leigh the weak <UNK> were viggo <UNK> sam who made <UNK> boyfriend so smarmy and unappealing it made you wonder why she had anything to do with him in the first place and vince vaughn who to put it as <UNK> as possible was simply awful as norman bates his whole performance was that of an actor playing a role and not very convincingly at that affecting <UNK> mannerisms and <UNK> his speech with bursts of <UNK> laughter made his norman more of a caricature than a character altogether unbelievable and pretentious it gave the movie the feel of a <UNK> of a true you would see on a television show it would have been entirely in keeping with the sensibility of the film to cut away from norman sitting alone in his <UNK> to a shot of a sober faced peter graves such was the mind set of norman bates on that <UNK> rainy night when marion <UNK> stepped out of her car and into his life ' the supporting cast includes <UNK> moore <UNK> robert <UNK> dr simon philip baker hall sheriff al <UNK> anne <UNK> mrs <UNK> <UNK> everett tom cassidy <UNK> howard mr <UNK> rita wilson caroline james <UNK> <UNK> and james <UNK> charlie the car dealer if nothing else van <UNK> <UNK> is a curiosity that goes to show that having a good director a <UNK> excellent cast and a script that is a <UNK> <UNK> does not necessarily <UNK> a success granted todays era of psycho <UNK> american <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> have effectively taken the edge off of a character like norman bates somewhat but there is still a <UNK> <UNK> in this particular story of the relationship between norman his mother and his victims that will forever remain <UNK> disturbing and terrifying but van <UNK> is unable to convey that sense of dread that throat <UNK> fear with this film if ever there was a movie made that should have been straight to video this is it better still had it never been born i rate this one 2 10

<START> a recent re issue of the french crime film original title <UNK> <UNK> les with its famous 20 minute silent jewel heist sequence now comes in the us in a gorgeous new print from the <UNK> collection with improved subtitles and some extras jules <UNK> was an american born <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> who was forced to make films in europe because he was <UNK> <UNK> was well <UNK> in the us and did well in art houses later <UNK> became a lot more famous in the us for <UNK> on <UNK> 1960 starring his wife the greek actress and political <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was again <UNK> and <UNK> for americans and others with anthony quinn in 1964 the which was even a big hit in <UNK> the new <UNK> dvd includes a recent interview with <UNK> i did not previously realize that one of the main robbers <UNK> the <UNK> was played by <UNK> who stepped in when the original actor became <UNK> he's one of the most memorable characters a <UNK> italian safe cracker who speaks no french br br although this classic has all the <UNK> of french film noir the black and white twilight world of well lit apartments shiny black cars men in suits the nightclub scenes including a dramatically filmed and lit title song performed at the club the <UNK> faces and the in hand or mouth i don't think it's as atmospheric or has quite as distinctive a style as <UNK> films do but there's the mesmerizing robbery which still holds up today as a tour de force it goes like clockwork with a fine sense of craft and <UNK> among the robbers some <UNK> cops are <UNK> dealt with things quickly go wrong after they go home and <UNK> the <UNK> when one of the players gets sloppy and gives a dame a ring with a million dollar in it has there ever been a heist film whose <UNK> lived happily ever after br br it's the <UNK> heist sequence that <UNK> this a special place and <UNK> an american director who had an unusually varied and exotic career deserves full credit for that he took a novel so conventional he was going to reject it and added some key elements that make it special in the event he couldn't pass on doing the adaptation he needed the money too much jean who plays the lead character tony le was an actor rather down on his luck his grim face is perfect for the role he was later to play the lead in <UNK> he who must die 1957 which used french actors in <UNK> for a political tale is a somewhat disappointing 1964 caper film it <UNK> compared to that also got us distribution it does have a good setting but it's wasted gone all bland and bright and of <UNK> post hollywood <UNK> <UNK> on sunday ' with its catchy theme song and charismatic heroine is the popular choice and won best film at cannes 1960 <UNK> who must <UNK> the political choice the genre choice an odd piece is his with and tony <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of tough guy hollywood genre work would <UNK> these and favor <UNK> early films which include a prison drama <UNK> <UNK> a cop flick 'the naked <UNK> 1948 and two hard core <UNK> <UNK> 1949 and <UNK> and the <UNK> 1950 personally i tend to like french noir and american neo noir <UNK> better than the original american noir source material hence my enduring fascination with but <UNK> is rather unique in having not only made hollywood noir but then going over to paris and producing a memorable example of its fifties french derivative
<START> honestly at first i watched this movie because of the gratuitous sex scenes i heard it possesses but by actually watching the film it just made me realize that there are still good and sensible movies out there truly it is one of the most well crafted and touching movies i've ever watched i'm a teenage <UNK> and the film spoke to me about my <UNK> sex religion love acceptance etc it gave me an idea on how to deal with these issues with the help of my self and others around me who love me for who i am cox really handled the movie well by <UNK> <UNK> of heart warming lines and a bit of sexuality in it it made the movie more interesting some people compare it to <UNK> mountain but i don't agree myself <UNK> mountain has more drama while latter days is well balanced
<START> from director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of fortune i think i saw a bit of this in my media studies class and i <UNK> the leading actress so i tried it despite the rating by the critics basically cool kid richard <UNK> half <UNK> ryan <UNK> and justin <UNK> <UNK> michael pitt team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them investigating the murder is homicide detective cassie 'the <UNK> <UNK> sandra <UNK> with new partner sam kennedy ben chaplin who are pretty <UNK> by the evidence found on the scene e g non relating <UNK> the plan doesn't seem to be completely going well because cassie and sam do quite quickly have richard or justin as suspects it is just a question of if they can <UNK> them away also starring <UNK> <UNK> as lisa mills chris penn as ray <UNK> r d call as captain rod cody and tom <UNK> as <UNK> d a al <UNK> i can see now the same concept as sir alfred hitchcock's rope with the murdering for a challenge thing but this film does it in a very silly way and not even a reasonably good <UNK> can save it from being dull and predictable adequate
<START> as one who loves films that appeal to intellectual as well as those that simply tell stories this film should have been appealing but as written and directed by catherine who seems to be playing out her own <UNK> in film making experiences this tedious and talky film fails to <UNK> interest br br the main character <UNK> anne is the screen form of a director frustrated in her attempts to film a convincing sex scene with two difficult actors <UNK> colin is the actor and <UNK> is the actress the one bit is <UNK> the use of a <UNK> <UNK> onto the actor in order for her to drive the sex scene to <UNK> but even this sight gag wears thin quickly and we are left with a film within a film that feels more like a <UNK> <UNK> on a dvd than a solid french comedy with class grady <UNK> august <UNK>
<START> this has got to be one of the best episodes of doctor who that i've seen since it came back last year there is a brilliant mix of amusement fear and <UNK> all mixed up which equals one amazing episode the <UNK> were brilliantly designed and i'm pretty sure <UNK> going to be a lot of <UNK> jokes in the next few weeks i myself am guilty of that already i particularly liked the way that we saw a different perspective of <UNK> and the doctor's relationship and the ending well it's the first time i have ever hidden behind a <UNK> i cannot wait until next weeks episode to find how they get out of this mess
<START> here you see mr eastwood in all of his glory i e at the top of his form as an actor and at the height of his physical appeal but the ladies depicted are hardly typical of the south then or now the young girls at the <UNK> school are incredibly naive some showing signs of developing into really <UNK> women and <UNK> page full blown in her corruption hardly represents the mean when it comes to head <UNK> of girls schools either then or now that is not to say that there isn't the occasional bad apple in any barrel mr eastwood has said this is one of his own two favorite films br br the <UNK> does have an original plot a lot of attractive characters and many surprises in store for the viewer it's thoroughly engrossing and entertaining but not really realistic i know having grown up in the south and attended a girls' school and college moreover i have been <UNK> with <UNK> girls who did the same not to mention their laid back teachers or you might even say repressed <UNK> who were a far cry from the <UNK> depicted here she is downright comical in her depiction of a southern gentle woman who is not quite what she seems br br this movie was a little outrageous when it first appeared and still is i think but you won't be sorry you spent your time watching it
<START> ok imagine that every state in the us <UNK> every country has exactly the same trees growing and ground <UNK> imagine also that a monkey camp so far off the beaten track you had to do the first half of the approach by river has a beautifully perfectly straight road leading up to it imagine a world where you have to wear a full <UNK> suit to collect a <UNK> <UNK> then you just drop it in a <UNK> bag and transfer it to your pocket with no <UNK> as soon as you get back to the office a world where two nine year old girls are happy to give lots of blood without complaining this is the world this movie is set in br br on top of that it's one of the most cliché ridden pieces of <UNK> it's been my misfortune to witness in many a year br br i liked it
<START> i really wanted to like this movie great cast  walter <UNK> in a role that reminds us of his iconic forbidden planet barbara <UNK> and robert sterling as young lovers frankie <UNK> as a <UNK> inclined sailor is a guy on a submarine a sailor even peter lorre as a scientist with a <UNK> for sharks maybe it's a good kiddie movie but i had trouble staying awake lorre was severely underused i guess he was a red <UNK> like <UNK>  you expect him to maybe go nuts and try to throw the hero or his gal in the shark tank no such luck by the way why is there a shark tank on a submarine it's typical of the movie's lack of ambition they explain why lorre is walking the shark back and forth because we're seeing it but just expect us to accept the fact that there's a shark on this sub for some reason research yeah scientists are always doing that research stuff who can understand them of course if there wasn't a shark who would kill the evil psychologist lady joan fontaine i'm sorry but even kid's movies in the 50s are capable of being less predictable and frankly idiotic not to mention exploitative br br the first 10 or 15 minutes really got my hopes up great theme song sung by frankie <UNK> <UNK> leading <UNK> the <UNK> howard <UNK> actually sorry <UNK> loved ya in blue hawaii and joan fontaine on a guided tour careful to skip the room with the huge warning sign on the door past peter lorre with aforementioned sharks and then we see a full screen shot of <UNK> shaking her <UNK> to <UNK> horn playing the movie quickly goes <UNK> from there there's no real explanation for the <UNK> threatening the earth so there's a distinct lack of dramatic tension and no villain to boot instead character is made into an unconvincing red <UNK> vaguely of the <UNK> variety i guess the caine <UNK> was still fresh in people's minds and <UNK> character suddenly turns evil for no reason at the end oh i suppose the reason is that it's a surprise for the audience and it is kind of surprising since the only negative thing she's done is to talk bad about the <UNK> mental health and there's still no reason why she did the <UNK> after she's revealed to be the villain very poorly done and unconvincing the guy who was the <UNK> bible nut was better  at least his character made sense br br so what else could go wrong endless interminable <UNK> diving footage i never understand the appeal of that kind of thing a giant <UNK> attacks the ship for a minute just so there's a monster for the theatrical trailer maybe that fooled some people into thinking it was going to be a fantasy adventure film instead of a half baked suspense movie about military scientists who are never wrong yes  perhaps worst of all it's barely a fantasy movie much less a science fiction movie it never did anything for my imagination because the whole premise was nothing but another disaster apocalypse and these characters never experience any feelings of wonder or discovery i'm through with irwin allen i never liked his later movies anyway but this one got me by pretending to be jules <UNK> when it's really just another formula exercise in disaster <UNK> the whole movie is just waiting to see which character will <UNK> turn evil and die he always hired an actor actress with a charming and <UNK> screen persona to play these roles and that's the only element of surprise to be found since there's no logic to these characters anyway what a pathetic waste of time for these actors george <UNK> movies are 100 times better the only one that was lame was atlantis which not <UNK> was the most allen esquire full of wonder and excitement and  think of it  ideas other than a few effects scenes and barbara <UNK> there's nothing worth seeing here in my opinion i guess it's good fun for those who are into disaster movies but i think they are a hollow and dull genre of films
<START> one chinese gang attacks and <UNK> out another gang in the beginning of the film unfortunately the <UNK> of the winning family is killed in the process oddly and without any discernible reason the gang <UNK> a <UNK> to blame the massacre on and he leaves until the police decide to stop investigating now how one man alone is the one responsible for about 50 deaths is beyond me so sending this one guy away just seemed silly but that's the plot later when this man comes home <UNK> and scheming have occurred leading to almost one hour and fifteen minutes of non stop killing br br if you are looking for a chinese martial arts film with much of a plot then you should probably skip this movie as its practically non stop action and practically no plot or character development even when compared to other martial arts films i would <UNK> that 80 90 of the film are fight scenes endless and reasonably well made fight scenes using knives again and again and again fight scenes if you want a film with a body count perhaps running into the hundreds as people are <UNK> kicked and <UNK> then this is the film for you the problem was by the end of the film there are literally no people left to kill and the film really lost my interest deep it ain't but if you want to see excitement and action only then this film is for you br br by the way this movie is set in contemporary times and no one thinks of shooting the hero until just near the end and when they finally do the logical thing it's too late and the effort is really really lame logical errors like this and the <UNK> suicide why make this a turn off your brain type of film
<START> incredibly vampire assassin is significantly worse than such atrocities as <UNK> body shots and zombie nation and those movies are terrible writer director star ron hall is devoid of both charisma and acting ability and is also clearly incapable of the most basic directorial concepts possibly the worst camera work editing lighting sound visual effects music and fight choreography i have ever seen in a movie rarely do two shots cut together nor can you see much in the beyond dim lighting the terrible dialogue is spoken extremely slowly by a <UNK> <UNK> cast <UNK> the movie to a near deadly <UNK> minutes this is a truly laughable embarrassment for everyone involved obviously <UNK> of terrible film making will want to see this but it's very hard to sit through no matter how experienced a bad movie viewer you are the fact that ron hall thought this was actually is astounding if you are a movie director and you actually think it's ok for the opening credits of your movie to include a few frames of the words slug before the title appears left over from your rough edit and you apparently can't <UNK> the energy to edit those frames out then your standards are obviously so low as to be insulting i am <UNK> that lions gate <UNK> agreed to release this movie on dvd in spite of <UNK> ray moore's very brief cameo this movie is a work of supreme self <UNK> on ron <UNK> part he clearly thinks he is a <UNK> actor and must also believe he possesses superior writing and directing skills but the movie is so unbelievably inept that it's hard to believe he'd actually want people to see it for fear of being brutally <UNK> like i'm doing right now a jaw dropping insanely terrible movie i'm not kidding
<START> so it's a little dated now it's almost 30 <UNK> old amazingly enough i have this on <UNK> tape and it still plays just fine if it came to dvd i'd snap it up in a <UNK> br br the drug humor is not appreciated nowadays as it was back then then it wasn't as much like driving without seat <UNK> and child seats i can remember my father crying he was laughing so hard watching this i had <UNK> in the 90's who'd seen it and i could bust them up by getting on the and saying br br great lines great spoof of the original and funny to me anyway even three decades later
<START> the main cast br br <UNK> stella <UNK> br br director <UNK> gives this charming story of elderly folks enchanting twists that make the characters appealing really universal br br <UNK> <UNK> is retired and on a <UNK> his previous <UNK> unknown he lives in a very nice apartment with his wife of forty four years <UNK> his son <UNK> the <UNK> apartment as a problem <UNK> as he needs to house one of his ex wives and several of their children the son isn't a vicious <UNK> just a guy with one past <UNK> too many and a blind eye to the <UNK> his dad has for the flat which he moved into after <UNK> a previous <UNK> to the son br br <UNK> and his also elderly close friend ed spend there more than ample free time doing small con jobs not for money but for the pleasure of putting one over on easily <UNK> folks like estate agents a favorite <UNK> is for <UNK> to act the part of a retired of new <UNK> <UNK> opera returning home in need of a <UNK> mansion ed is his companion as <UNK> fall all over themselves <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and fine french restaurant <UNK> in hope of a <UNK> sale br br when not engaged in well planned <UNK> the duo engage in quick <UNK> such as pretending to be <UNK> security agents so as to snatch kisses from breathless and teens trying to sneak onto trains <UNK> kisses that is there's no <UNK> here br br long suffering wife is obsessed with saving enough money to <UNK> that the couple <UNK> and <UNK> have a grand funeral an event the life loving <UNK> is in no hurry to experience br br <UNK> about money and <UNK> <UNK> of marital <UNK> lead to a crisis whose resolution rings both real and endearing <UNK> for the viewer's emotions but he does it openly honestly and effectively br br <UNK> spring subtitled of course is a product of an increasingly vibrant czech cinema it wasn't shown widely in the u s but its <UNK> on dvd will hopefully bring this affecting flick to a wide audience sadly recently <UNK> to cancer so this movie is a to a fine actor who <UNK> his character with a passion for life's pleasures that must have reflected the actor's own values br br 9 10
<START> no one can say i wasn't warned as i have read the reviews both user <UNK> but like most of us attracted to horror movies curiosity got this cat come on we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room but you know that's horror <UNK> are always dying to know what's in there even if we know it'll be bad br br the bottom line is that this movie left me angry not because it pretends to be real who cares gimmicks are allowed or because the actors and dialogue are so lame is this an unusual event in horror movies or even because the movie is so bad and i am being polite here what really got me mad is that the film is not only a rip off of <UNK> but also a half hearted lazy rip off at that br br i don't believe in sacred <UNK> and if they thought they could <UNK> <UNK> then kudos to them but they didn't even try the movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror or any movie
<START> yes i have noticed that there are other comments i think that is a good sign for a movie even if some are negative i have seen this movie 2 and a half times i adore it and would watch it again it is very smart but i can understand why some people would hate it they don't get it's appeal yes i have a weird taste in movies but this is a great movie some of the lines are just so quick like the whole scene in the chinese restaurant i started dying laughing that and when he was in the <UNK> line talking to the contact jude law was wonderful though it was humorous him trying to cover up his wonderful accent anyways i do not consider myself the movie <UNK> as some critics of this movie and if you have nothing better to do than write pseudo intellectual movie <UNK> about films you hate online i feel sorry for you why don't you write about movies you like like me i just love how everything ties together it keeps you guessing even though you guess wrong the ending was interesting and not overdone it was purely clever i would not compare it to the matrix because i think people then get the wrong idea i went into this movie expecting nothing except jude law and a sci fi i was blown away i have no clue about any other of films but love this on its own merit another clever thing was the <UNK> with the dog definitely watch this movie
<START> i decided to watch this movie because it has been noted as the scariest movie ever so that's what i expected unfortunately what i found out is that the movie didn't have a single scary moment in it and i'm the kind of person who jumps very easily the movie was nothing but terrible clichés and every time there was a jump moment it was incredibly obvious the pros of this movie would be the music and the odd scene thats actually shot well like the very last scene when she opens the door and you see in the reflection and when it <UNK> back to him you see the ghost on his shoulders overall this movie really added nothing new to the j horror genre and all around lacked creativity and scares
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is one of the only films i've seen where i can almost say that simply nothing happens i felt as though i watched a drug dealing middle class couple with child walk around eat smoke <UNK> excuse me swear through most of the film and i don't believe i'm missing the point i think this film was well directed well acted although the husband's performance was rather wooden and the constant feeling of impending doom around every corner certainly kept the viewer involved but when the dust <UNK> your left with zero just a boat load of fade outs i didn't want car chases gun violence <UNK> etc in fact i'm sick of violence but my goodness let's at least get a bit deeper into all these characters let's get to know each of these corrupt officers a little better not just show <UNK> shots of them as street thugs why was the dialogue so juvenile everyone spoke as if they were in junior high i believe even this side of our human race can say something other than fu sh etc the pacing and the storyline of <UNK> <UNK> i found quite interesting but the execution was plain and simple empty 4 10
<START> this was without a doubt the worst movie i have ever sat through and that's saying alot because i've seen my share of horrible movies br br but i have never seen a movie in which every single character portrayed was an <UNK> loser seriously there was not one respectable character in the entire script how fitting that the plot was equally lame lacking any intelligence whatsoever br br i can't believe that keanu reeves and cameron diaz would even <UNK> to <UNK> in such stupidity and while i haven't seen all of their other movies i've always enjoyed their performances until now it's not that the acting was bad just the entire story line was moronic
<START> 'the mill on the was one of the lesser novels by mary ann evans who wrote under the male <UNK> george <UNK> i tried to read this dull and very turgid novel years ago but was unable to finish it i'll review this film version solely on its own merits as i don't know how <UNK> it follows the original novel br br the film's opening credits are <UNK> in an old english <UNK> that suggests the <UNK> period and so it's a very poor choice for a film with a 19th century setting on the other hand about halfway into the film we see a close up shot of a advertising an estate <UNK> this is set in authentic victorian type <UNK> and looks very convincing most of this film is extremely convincing in its depiction of the architecture and clothing of early 19th century england the precise location of this film's story is never <UNK> but judging by the actors' accents i'd place it as somewhere in the perhaps br br the plot what there is of it involves a mill that changes hands a couple of times over a couple of decades between two rival families one wealthy and one working class i disagree with another imdb reviewer who claims that james mason has only a small role in this film mason has the largest and most central role in this drama as the <UNK> of the <UNK> family as the <UNK> and <UNK> tom mason is darkly brooding and <UNK> his performance here belongs in a better film it made me want to see <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with mason as <UNK> br br as this is a multi <UNK> saga something which george <UNK> did much better in several of the main roles in this film are split among two actors <UNK> child actors in the prologue adults in the main narrative the prologue of this film features a very well written scene establishing tom as <UNK> and bully <UNK> from an early age and young philip as decent and thoughtful through hard <UNK> philip has earned a tom tries to bully it away from him but is unwilling to take the <UNK> by <UNK> force he wants philip to give it to him all the child actors in this movie male and female are talented and attractive unfortunately all of the children speak their dialogue in posh <UNK> voiced accents that are utterly unlike the accents of the actors and actresses who play those same roles as adults this <UNK> calls attention to the <UNK> of the material <UNK> none of the later scenes are as good as this prologue br br the climax features a crowd of <UNK> in a <UNK> much better paced and photographed than the earlier scenes but modern viewers in britain at least can no longer take this sort of material seriously by now practically every british comedian has done a trouble at <UNK> mill <UNK> comedy routine <UNK> precisely this subject matter so i had difficulty watching this movie with a straight face br br the character actress <UNK> hunt is good in a small role but the opening credits in that old english <UNK> her as i'll rate this dull movie 3 points out of 10 one point <UNK> for james <UNK> performance the early scene with the children and the authentic victorian in that
<START> technically <UNK> a van damme fan or i was this movie is so bad that i hated myself for wasting those 90 minutes do not let the name <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ii fool you i had big hopes for this one depending on what i saw in <UNK> ii man was i wrong all action fans wanted a big comeback for the classic action hero but i guess we wont be able to see that soon as our hero keep coming with those going to a border far away town and kill the bad guys than comeback home movies i mean for god's sake we are in 2008 and they insist on doing those disappointing movies on every level why do your self a favor skip it seriously
<START> br br i've seen this movie during a festival here in <UNK> with a huge crowd of real fantasy fans at about the middle of the movie one part of the audience was sleeping and the other part was boring dialogues badly choreographed fighting sequences a terribly dumb story and even worse special effects well at least the actors hadn't much to do except for looking concerned or in case they were female showing their breasts in the right light even otto who was among the audience admitted afterwards that <UNK> could understand the disappointment of the viewers be warned folks of the <UNK> fantasy movie ever
<START> director todd unexpected turn into sentimental coming out drama <UNK> a predictable result nothing new to see here attractive but unconvincing leads these 20 somethings are supposed to be in high school <UNK> out <UNK> about confused adolescent sexuality doesn't strike me as the best way to explore the promise of anonymous which was equally self involved but also honest raw and by comparison not all that <UNK> i have no idea what to make of this drab and uninspiring movie other than to hope that finds another career sure it's <UNK> but <UNK> mike br br no single <UNK> however is as awful as jim <UNK> electronic score which <UNK> non stop wall to wall for the full length of this movie if i'd seen this and heard this in a theatre i would have walked out thankfully on my <UNK> i could <UNK> and hit mute
<START> great british director christopher nolan <UNK> insomnia directs this odd film about a struggling writer obsessed with following people this proves harmless at first but soon turns dangerous after taking the game a step further after meeting a like minded man who shows him the ins and outs of breaking and entering the two men soon get in over their heads in a strange world involving the mafia and prostitution jeremy plays the writer and alex <UNK> the like minded friend both are great performances this low budget movie was shot total <UNK> style with no <UNK> for any locations and no big stars but has what a lot of huge budget films don't have which is a clever script and creative direction an impressive debut by one of todays best directors good stuff
<START> certainly an unbelievably <UNK> cartoon drawn in a deliciously way and <UNK> in almost any respect takes place in a kingdom ruled by a mean and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the kingdom or at least what we surroundings of the king's palace seems devoid <UNK> br br a few inhabitants there from the the <UNK> underground city br br an it an allegory call it a <UNK> only do not call it a fable br br because imdb encourages and maybe for other reasons as well i will add that this cartoon is the work of the great paul
<START> all films are worth of seeing some like and <UNK> are best films in their genre and have reached a status of a classics in <UNK> cinema history br br most people have formed a impression of actor through films acted leading role in three of films which all became <UNK> at box office and movie reviews br br it's nice to see that idea of still lives in commercials i think it was <UNK> <UNK> tv add where was walking in mountain fell at with <UNK> in his arms who has seen the film knows what i am talking about is a beautiful film with great actors and good filming locations like famous small town in where the best film festival in the world is held the midnight sun film festival i recommend it for all to go there on june but remember warm clothes and <UNK>
<START> unfortunately this is not one of those movies which at least make you laugh at their unbelievable stupidity it has no entertainment value at all it just plain sucks i don't know where to start to explain how much this movie annoyed me i think what really takes the cake is the unbearable soundtrack it sounds as if someone took a simple beat and then for the rest of it let a 5 year old child run amok with a <UNK> and taped it it's really that awful and as if that's not enough there's not one scene in the movie without music noise by the end of the movie you're either deaf or already cut off your ears earlier which would at least keep you from falling asleep since there is nothing happening in the movie to keep your attention just a lot of bad acting a few cheap and unconvincing kills no story at all it just jumps from one scene to another and you as the viewer can try to make any sense of it and in the last 30 minutes or so you can witness some of the worst special effects ever it's extremely boring do not watch this movie you could do something much more entertaining like staring at a wall or reading the phone book did i mention how much the soundtrack sucked
<START> the film is annoying br br technically there are too many times you see <UNK> and very roughly edited scenes one could easily get a <UNK> film using a decent amateur camera and 100 video editing <UNK> down to earth man on the street doesn't mean sloppy editing <UNK> scenes that don't contain important statement should have been deleted the same goes for making sure that the head hand others stay in the frame my 8 years old son knows that by now br br the film is way too long the main point anti <UNK> is understood after 30 minutes why bother with all the rest after the interview with james <UNK> i pressed the stop button what a <UNK> of time br br the main theme just doesn't work for me anymore i've seen too many small which produce mediocre <UNK> and many big that produce great and unique the movie <UNK> the small producers as the ones that are producing with more identity or the bigger ones are accused of producing or <UNK> the film is trying to make a black and white statement in a world full of gray tones however the movie hasn't proved this claim they look at a couple of <UNK> examples tie some of the big producers with <UNK> and provided interviews with key people well did all the small producers spent wwii in the resistance is it relevant to see that parker has a thing with the movie is very manipulative and unconvincing
<START> i must in light of the of praise for this flick from viewers assume once again the role of the turd in the <UNK> as <UNK> used to say i am scratching my head at the sheer number of <UNK> comments the african queen this ain't the period flavor is wonderful yes the acting is fine but no actor no matter how great can bring life to the seemingly endless stream of perfectly tedious and insignificant party and dinner table conversation here and i care not how much of it is taken from <UNK> text imagine spending an hour and a half as a fly on the wall at a christmas dinner of a not particularly interesting group of people it's not clear to me that it's a family as one person suggested having to listen to their mundane table talk and you have the essential experience of this movie absolutely nothing happens and nothing important is said but it is said at interminable length as i said the popularity of this movie is a mystery to me speaking of mysteries watch a good one rather than this
<START> minor spoilers follow br br steve allen <UNK> that <UNK> humor about serious events might be found by many to be acceptable based on the formula tragedy time comedy 1939 before the german assault on <UNK> was hardly a fun period and subsequent events including the <UNK> following the which took germany to the channel resulted in the heroic <UNK> at <UNK> and gave the world the sickening spectacle of a france its honor before the nazi <UNK> br br the stuff of romance comedy and a big <UNK> of serious drama yep director jean paul with a well matched and outstanding cast creates in bon voyage a <UNK> of events and scenes from history and from imagination that is hugely entertaining br br <UNK> the eyed and beautiful isabelle <UNK> is <UNK> top actress as war clouds gather over europe what an <UNK> cliche sorry a veteran self with many affairs to her credit her inner motivation seems to be whatever is good for <UNK> is good for <UNK> following a premiere of her latest film after which a minister in the incompetent <UNK> administration jean <UNK> gerard depardieu in an unusual role for him <UNK> his interest in her she goes home only to <UNK> encounter an ex lover who doesn't understand the word no she <UNK> <UNK> that issue but then <UNK> and <UNK> another former beau the still <UNK> <UNK> gregory to help deal with the mess in her flat <UNK> is a novelist in expectation br br a comic accident that once again highlights almost as a public service message the importance of working <UNK> <UNK> puts <UNK> in jail on most serious charges fortunately the <UNK> of the germans from their static positions forces a <UNK> transfer of prisoners to the south of france but our boy escapes making his way there <UNK> rather than as a ward of the state br br the panic and fear in france as the germans swept to victory is well portrayed and a new twist enters the story who should <UNK> encounter but the truly gorgeous young research assistant <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is accompanying the obligatory jewish <UNK> scientist professor jean marc has some <UNK> of heavy water he needs to get to england of course the germans <UNK> <UNK> on to this vital <UNK> for you know what this part is pure fiction there was never any heavy water in france in 1940 just <UNK> and <UNK> is so <UNK> as well as dedicated br br what next peter <UNK> as a supposed french journalist alex be <UNK> off as to his name he's really an officer in the german military intelligence a spy and he used to bed <UNK> too and wants a <UNK> of their affair apparently the kind is the only major male character who doesn't want to have it off with the actress br br what follows is a series of adventures and <UNK> that are <UNK> integrated to produce a very fast paced and enjoyable film partly a tribute to and a bit of a spoof on casablanca this is is a remarkably funny movie except for the heavy nazi bits br br isabelle <UNK> deserves kudos for the best portrayal i've seen in years of an <UNK> cute total <UNK> with few if any redeeming features and depardieu <UNK> to and ready to jump ship and join the <UNK> is convincing as a man whose <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> sense of duty to the republic as a human being in power at a critical moment in french history is <UNK> vile br br not shown in too many theaters bon voyage should be available for purchase or rental soon see it br br 9 10
<START> i caught this movie at the cinemas at the weekend as part of the kansas international film festival which as usual has provided a thoughtful and <UNK> <UNK> of world cinema br br i have been keen on australian film for a number of years so was pleased to learn that this film was included and i was certainly not disappointed br br superbly shot firmly directed it's an eerie tale of one man and his journey to the heart of darkness as it were it reminded me a tad of lynch's wild at heart it has that strange madness in it but i was glued to the movie for other reasons namely that it presents a portrait of australia which is well very believable br br i have to the land down under a number of times once in the 1980's and again about 7 years ago with my wife br br i don't wish to go to great <UNK> explaining my <UNK> but the director appears to have a grasp on much that i find so odd and eccentric about australia a country that is responsible for the <UNK> of say nick cave on one hand and steve irwin the <UNK> <UNK> on the other br br one <UNK> i would have preferred even more of the australia much more in fact but i also realise that there's only 1 and a half hours to do it all in ' br br overall though this movie is very very accomplished
<START> i was looking forward to this movie <UNK> actors interesting plot great atmosphere then if you are going to attempt something that is meant to <UNK> the meaning of life first know it ok i did not expect the directors or writers to actually know the meaning but i thought they may have offered <UNK> to peck at and treats to add fuel to the fire which they almost did things i didn't get a woman wandering around in dark places and lonely car parks alone oblivious to the consequences great <UNK> that fell by the <UNK> the promise of the knowledge <UNK> contained by the original so called criminal i had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the suspense i understood and can wax lyrical about the fool and found adrian <UNK> role crucial and <UNK> and then basically the story line and the script where good up to a point and that point was the last 10 minutes or so what run out of ideas such a pity that this movie had to let us down so badly it may not comprehend the meaning and i really did not expect the writers to understand it but i was hoping for an intellectual if not spiritual ride and got a <UNK> in the road
<START> i thought it was brilliant it was great watching the <UNK> tracking each one of them down dwight <UNK> still looked the same he had hardly changed in looks neither had <UNK> <UNK> he still looked just as <UNK> i thought that mr t looked thinner though but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time i thought that it took some doing tracking down the other members of the cast such as the one who played <UNK> and the lady who played amy it was just a shame that mr t <UNK> make the actual reunion also it was a great shame that george <UNK> had died thereby leaving a gap so to speak i only wish now that i had taped it to keep let's hope that they repeat it again
<START> this is a perfect example of a classic full moon pictures movie any fan of horror vampire flicks should definitely check this one out original plot and good easy to follow story also this movie has some heart racing scenes that combine horror with action as of now the only sequel i have seen to this movie is part iv which i have to say is almost better than this original br br i give it 10 10 br br fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master <UNK> party massacre skinned alive sleep away camp and other full moon pictures flicks for other <UNK> check out the other comments i have sent in by <UNK> on my name above this comment section
<START> have you ever found yourself watching a film or documentary and having to hold yourself back from screaming things like no don't do it no well it's time you do and undoubtedly deep water is the one to get you started br br the story is based on that of donald and his entry into the first round the world <UNK> race to be <UNK> by individuals in 1968 that word individuals is important as the men who set off on this nearly <UNK> <UNK> head out alone br br most of the men are well <UNK> in the sea <UNK> <UNK> of england where they launch from but one of them is the unknown dark horse and his name was donald struggling <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> who can take everything from him should he fail to at least attempt to make it through a large portion of the race he could take his home his property everything br br now finds himself between a rock and well deep water either attempt the race with an <UNK> ship and an <UNK> captain or lose everything you own which was significant since had a wife and several children you'll note the term <UNK> captain in there too not only was he <UNK> he'd never been out on the open sea did i mention <UNK> <UNK> between <UNK> footage of the pre and post race and those of friends family and <UNK> of today deep water is put together masterfully initially seen as a poor <UNK> who got in over his head the film gradually shows you the limited choices had after months and months out on the water his ship <UNK> equipment breaks psyche stretched to the breaking point and beyond finds himself lost in an internal struggle with no successful way out it is interesting too to see the psychological breaks that other <UNK> have as they deal with their <UNK> <UNK> on board their respective <UNK> br br the wave like emotions that you'll feel as you watch this astounding documentary may make you a bit ill not unlike trying to get your sea legs and you'll probably be frustrated at the choices being made perhaps just as frustrated as poor mr br br the ending is also amazing in that we get to see the actual ship that <UNK> sitting deserted and rotting on a <UNK> beach not unlike other things that felt deserted and rotting toward the end of this poorly thought out race br br incredible
<START> i didn't like as good as it gets very much but i am a big fan of william hurt and holly <UNK> work so i decided to watch this movie and the most surprising thing for me was the superb work of albert brooks here in spain he's little known and only as a 2nd division version of woody allen in the west coast he played a great part but hunter and hurt were good too specially hurt in an relatively unusual role for him hunter played the role that reminds me a bit of her part in once around <UNK> 1991 br br finally the rest of the cast is great too robert one of these familiar faces of the american cinema the ex bond girl lois <UNK> pretty good placed on that role i think the always perfect joan cusack in her early years and specially the brief of jack nicholson maybe he doesn't have any good scene but it's jack nicholson anyway the best movie by james l brooks great story well resolved and superb cast for one of the surely best movies of the 80's
<START> the expert starring jeff <UNK> is the definition of dull br br dull characters dull situations dull direction dull actors dull cinematography dull music br br i don't really understand this movie is it supposed to be an action movie it's almost as if <UNK> wanted to be in a serious movie but the level of acting and writing found in the expert is below your average tv drama and there are some typical <UNK> <UNK> bad guys scenes here and there but the main aspect of the movie relies on some sort of believable drama which is totally wrong for <UNK> or is so badly directed that it just doesn't work with the action star in the end this confused movie looks and feels very <UNK> and bland the worst aspect of the expert is the music the composer is a jerry <UNK> wannabe with his pompous and melodramatic score which simply doesn't belong in this kind of dull movie it's as if the producers knew they had a very dull product on their hands and they asked the composer to make the film feel more compelling and dramatic with his score which makes the entire movie look even more confused <UNK> and dull br br don't waste your time watching this even if you're a jeff <UNK> fan
<START> here in germany king of queens has a big big cult status nearly every teenager and adults watch this sitcom it's really awesome better than the other horrible american sitcoms like full house or set by step the only series who is still ok is al <UNK> there haven't been an <UNK> sitcom in europe who was as effective as this really funny show kevin james and <UNK> as doug carrie are the <UNK> couple i know jerry stiller as arthur is the funniest grandpa i know and victor williams and especially <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> are the most different but funny guys i know i watch it as often as i could and i still haven't enough good humor
<START> i purchased this film on dvd for <UNK> but it was a waste the film is very bad the plot is your average monster film where it kills a few people the mayor chief doesn't believe it and they fight it at the end br br on the plus side the film quality is very good and the setting of new york is impressive for a budget film as opposed to a small <UNK> town the acting is reasonable too br br however the special effects in a monster film are laughable and the addition of a random bus load of kids to the plot half way through just gets weird the ending is just bad br br in summary whenever you have a chance to see this don't there will be something better on br br r t c true horror films don't have a pg rating
<START> after a couple years of searching for the <UNK> bogart film two against the world it unexpectedly showed up as a tcm offering under the title one fatal hour a first national film from 1936 <UNK> character is <UNK> scott the man who runs a radio station whose program <UNK> is losing <UNK> the owner <UNK> reynolds robert is a pathetic executive who calls the shots at the station but hides behind his decisions by <UNK> them off on scott br br in an effort to boost the audience base and <UNK> reynolds has the idea of <UNK> a twenty year old murder case and offering it as a fifteen chapter radio play scott <UNK> the aid of dr martin <UNK> harry hayden to write the play and present it on the air br br the murder case involved a woman who was <UNK> of murdering her husband the circumstances of which are not made clear however gloria has married and is now living as martha helen married to a successful <UNK> henry o'neill and their daughter edith linda perry is about to be married on the same day no less as the radio play is to reveal the identity of gloria about to be faced with the devastating effects of this revelation martha and jim <UNK> on a <UNK> to have the program stopped simultaneously <UNK> future in laws respond by demanding that the marriage not take place br br without revealing the final outcome the film takes a devastating turn to <UNK> the viewer edith confronts the principals of the radio station <UNK> <UNK> scott and the <UNK> reynolds while accepting his share of the blame for the outcome scott partially <UNK> himself by <UNK> his job firing his secretary and <UNK> her out of the office <UNK> her for the conscience he once had with an entirely abrupt finish the film leaves one as <UNK> and <UNK> as any movie that doesn't have a happy ending br br with about a dozen films under his belt <UNK> bogart gets a chance to take center stage here with intriguing results with no name supporting players <UNK> rises to the occasion by taking charge in the confines of the radio <UNK> and runs the show as if it was his own in an interesting bit of characterization he expresses his <UNK> by crossing his hands over his <UNK> head <UNK> by a half dozen years a similar effect we'll see him do in casablanca for bogart fans it's a genuine treat to catch an unexpected nuance like this
<START> i own this video as well as the concert version of the musical with <UNK> and george with the san francisco <UNK> orchestra george is fantastic in my book as are angela lansbury and the composer stephen <UNK> this musical is operatic in scope and shows much <UNK> in composition i certainly hope that this vhs becomes available on dvd performance is <UNK> sympathetic the one annoying performance is the young woman who sings the role of joanna i believe this performance was at the dorothy chandler in los angeles rather than on a broadway stage and am not sure that the <UNK> set was <UNK> in new york as it was in this production but i found the <UNK> being dragged across the stage to be quite effective to portray the streets of london i highly recommend this movie
<START> ostensibly hans ' isolation and despair are caused by a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mother a <UNK> wife and a <UNK> <UNK> and despite the complex portrayal hans himself doesn't precisely make these claims the above must be a substantial part of <UNK> thinking as well his use of <UNK> and marx but the viewer may look no further than gender and <UNK> to locate the <UNK> cause of his crushed spirit br br first it's highly unlikely that his mother's lack of love pushed him into <UNK> up with the foreign legion it was far more likely and is in part <UNK> that it was a quest for adventure male <UNK> escape from the female world of mother and sister and male identity itself which both the legion and war offered br br second hans loses his successful job as a policeman because of his own <UNK> by falling for a <UNK> <UNK> at work he not only rubber <UNK> prostitution as an oppressive institution but shows that he cannot even control his sexuality in a professional <UNK> and is even willing to <UNK> a <UNK> career br br third he commits serious verbal abuse against his wife in front of his sheep like male buddies making no distinction at all between her absence or when she shows up looking for him presence in fact he is more brutal in her presence br br a few hours later in a violent and drunken state he beats his wife in front of their daughter who <UNK> on her mother's behalf the terror he <UNK> in her and his daughter are <UNK> but both he and the audience move on with <UNK> a <UNK> of conscience or protest why because his wife is <UNK> <UNK> as both <UNK> and sexually <UNK> yes this this may be <UNK> view of what capitalism does to women owned insecure and a <UNK> but this hardly brutality nor <UNK> exploitation of her in the <UNK> scene br br and then there is this male role pressure which hans could choose to reject and protest but instead accepts he's too short for a male and too un heroic to achieve the <UNK> success the male role <UNK> but how can these be causes of despair when he not only <UNK> his lost love as a mistress but marries a tall woman who is considerably more attractive than himself finally hans allows harry his war <UNK> to remain over his wife's convincing <UNK> to the contrary on in their house by this decision he not only makes it clear that he is more tied to harry than to his wife but that male bonding <UNK> his love of women and <UNK> in the end his own life because it is harry's superior <UNK> and spirit around the house that causes star to fall hans the <UNK> may be to a degree the victim of capitalism but more to the point he is the victim of his own <UNK> to his own male identity his inability to let it go is the ultimate cause for his isolation and despair br br this is something that is lost i think not only on fassbinder but also on <UNK> sister anna although only to a degree lost for <UNK> and <UNK> support of her brother over her mother only goes so far she is quite <UNK> that only he can save himself that her support and love cannot it itself end his self loathing unfortunately she does not offer any of this same support and love for his wife who must be much more <UNK> than hans but who in the end is able to pick up the pieces and save herself and daughter and present a marked contrast to <UNK> fall
<START> walter matthau is wonderful as the <UNK> dentist dr julian winston whose frequent to girlfriend goldie provide <UNK> proof of the dangers of lying goldie <UNK> touching <UNK> toni simmons certainly deserved to win her oscar ingrid <UNK> work as the stiff as nurse stephanie is also touching to watch as she comes out of her shell slowly and <UNK> this is a great movie to watch in the <UNK> or any time for that matter it's very underrated i never heard about it until i found it in the video store and what a find
<START> the dvd movie the <UNK> directed by jack <UNK> was published in 2001 it didn't make its way to german cinemas and neither the director or an actor were able to receive an important award for this movie the movie refers to the shakespearean play the <UNK> which was published at the end of the <UNK> century the director tried to create an modern version of this play but failed at the beginning of the movie the plantation owner <UNK> gets in a conflict with his brother antonio about the treatment of their slaves antonio sets his brother a trip and tries to kill him but with the help of a witch <UNK> is able to escape and <UNK> with his daughter and a slave called ariel to a small island nearby the <UNK> river for over twelve years he has lived isolated on this island till a lucky chance <UNK> him to take revenge on his brother if <UNK> will be lucky you have to find out by yourself br br in my opinion this film is really a bad try to create a modern version of the original play by william shakespeare the story of the movie is confusing as well as the characters <UNK> doesn't have the same powers as in the <UNK> end of part i
<START> this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen what were they thinking stop preaching to me already this is why all of us watch walker texas ranger and wont admit it to our friends terrible acting and a extremely phony plot while the movie is unfolding the story stops and the actors start preaching to the audience the director somehow believed the two <UNK> well it looked like crap when i saw the title at my local blockbusters it looked interesting their should have been a warning on it saying it was religious instead of the false <UNK> of an action adventure first time in a long time i stopped a movie and couldn't tolerate finishing it
<START> though i strongly feel that is the best gene kelly movie but this a pretty good one i liked the music and the dancing and the ending on how gene got the girl my favorite part though without a doubt is <UNK> dance with his alter ego i love watching two gene kelly's for the price of one it shows what talent mr kelly really was it is a movie that i think that everyone should watch at least once in their life time so you have not seen it go out and find to watch it today i'm sure that everyone out there has a gene kelly friend that has this movie in their collection so go over to their house and pop some popcorn and enjoy
<START> certainly this film has the ring of truth about it as it <UNK> to be based on actual <UNK> at a marine base it deals with the attempted cover up by the local marine commander of <UNK> conduct by a marine major which resulted in his being shot to death by his former girl friend a marine captain the man and woman had been lovers but the captain attempted to break off the relation when she discovered her boy friend was married he continued to stalk her going so far as to fire his side arm in her direction at one time finally he broke into her home attacked her with a knife and was shot twice with her service pistol and killed the <UNK> <UNK> ruled the killing self defense but the marines decided to charge the captain with murder the major you see was a <UNK> hero from vietnam and an old friend of the commanding colonel at the marine base the captain too had made some enemies in her <UNK> pool command <UNK> some male advances in a very butch style br br there is considerable psychological <UNK> <UNK> and controlling the actions of the principal participants in this drama which the very capable cast gets across nicely the director and editor however seem determined to obscure the happenings as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and shifting points of view you're lucky if you know where you're at most of the time bear with them though it's a worthwhile story as the <UNK> court martial trial unfolds and it seems every man's hand is against her even her attorney at times br br the verdict well after all this is rather a suspense story so you'll have to see for yourself there is a kind of <UNK> message <UNK> into the film but forget about that sure war is hell but sometimes it can't be avoided we'll need those marines then even if they aren't always the best <UNK> of fair play <UNK> as <UNK> says in his poem tommy <UNK> br br it's tommy this and tommy that and tommy wait outside but it's room for mr <UNK> when the on the tide
<START> i love those kind of movies blood revenge a lot of action very dark cheesy and more but this one doesn't deliver the genre that you might expect when i saw <UNK> birds and <UNK> the killer before i had fun watching those but why this one not dead or alive final is a decent anime and its not hardcore and don't even expect nudity in this movie at least add some more action to entertain the audience even the drama wasn't that good well i don't want to spoil the movie nor the plot but i felt that dead or alive final is a bit nerdy so without further to do i don't recommend this movie to everyone but i recommend for the people who love decent and well directed anime br br dr jacques <UNK> university of paris <UNK> university of paris 1 <UNK> <UNK>
<START> personally i think the movie is pretty good it almost rates an 8 i liked the aspect as well as the gorgeous photography colin <UNK> character isn't the most likable but he does a better than decent job with the role the heroine played by the beautiful long is a familiar film heroine in that she's trying to do what she thinks is the best for her child marrying a respected member of her <UNK> community while fighting her attraction for the bad man one who's not a member of her community the <UNK> most of the film is about this mother's struggle should she do what's expected of her what she thinks is best for her son or should she follow her heart i don't want to give away the ending let me just say that it's a feel good movie with gorgeous location shots exquisite african dress it's worth seeing the film just for the women's brilliantly colored african clothing and and likable characters overall the actor who plays <UNK> son is bright and adorable the plot is a bit formulaic but i liked the movie nonetheless if you're a colin <UNK> fan you must see this film if you like <UNK> flicks see it i think i'll watch it again tonight
<START> in the last few years of ron <UNK> son in law of walt disney <UNK> producer reign he <UNK> out live action crap on a stick often starring the very boring dean jones whose entire career was based on that kind of light empty headed fare other horrible films from that same period include <UNK> dragon the last flight of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> flying oddball and the <UNK> i'll not mention <UNK> because i thought it ambitious and miller was only the executive producer on it so he had little to do with the actual production however he was in full force when this god awful piece of human junk was <UNK> from the <UNK> of creativity <UNK> goes to <UNK> <UNK> second sequel to much loved love bug tale finds <UNK> in love with another car who has a brain and heart too there's a race some lame bad guys a diamond and barney <UNK> shot in france the film actually is nicely photographed and the countryside is lovely but one gets the idea the film was made so all involved could have a three month vacation in france the rest of film is a wreck <UNK> falls bumbling thieves wicked german racing <UNK> and a pretty <UNK> feminist all fall under the category of stock supply the biggest insult of the film trying to further develop <UNK> lover personality via shakes <UNK> flashing lights and movements <UNK> of a horny <UNK> year old disney's writers do an injustice to our cute little <UNK> then again i would think it'd be tough for anyone to top helen hayes driving <UNK> around a <UNK> <UNK> in the second outing
<START> i wonder sometimes if maybe meryl streep has become so accepted as the most impressive versatile actress since well maybe just about the beginning of the sound era that maybe her talent is now taken for granted there are probably about three <UNK> that she relies on consistently throughout her performances most <UNK> a <UNK> lip but other than that her performances are amazingly <UNK> and original and fresh expressions of internal <UNK> even though <UNK> choice and a cry in the dark and may be her work here and in bridges in madison county is remarkable too just more subtle in one true thing she is mostly sweet and in love with her <UNK> life and streep makes what could be routine even boring seem attractive and charming i think that she must work out these mini <UNK> for each character and find what things make this person real and interesting she works from the inside out with each character and maybe it's this essential quality that has <UNK> the main criticism of <UNK> or self consciousness i don't think she's cold at all but instead has thought out her character's unique qualities i think her critics are confusing self consciousness with intelligence not too many other actors would be so thoughtful and creative as to make kate lightweight and <UNK> within her beloved <UNK> environment only to later reveal <UNK> depth because of her genuine <UNK> to that <UNK> environment her performances are of an <UNK> <UNK> she rarely does anything wrong i wonder if it's <UNK> for any of <UNK> pictures to not seem <UNK> because of her presence anyway kate loves her home and her affection for her family life is as endearing as her new conflict within the home is jarring when all of this comes together and kate starts to recognize that she can no longer function in the same capacity and she breaks the pie dish and screams out that she is not handicapped it is painfully sad to watch because this has not been someone prone to emotion streep is smart enough and generous enough to recognize how much better everything works because she has felt out the dramatic <UNK> of kate and it's really the only scene when she allows her character to go but how <UNK> true it is to see a character who can really surprise you by displaying something that you wouldn't have thought possible once again <UNK> character has at least three <UNK> god this sounds like a <UNK> itself but as an actress streep just has a special kind of intelligence incredible empathy and great <UNK> skills the movie itself is probably somewhat mediocre i suppose william hurt is meant to be an unlikeable jerk and he does very well i think hurt is really kind of creepy though script is quite standard another tribute to streep that she was as touching and believable as she was
<START> why watch a tv drama billed as a comedy in which none of the characters are likable or even interesting people i can sort of see what the writer david was trying to achieve the and bad taste surprises that he put into one foot in the grave etc i admit that the script made a bit more of an effort than most on british tv at the moment but really who cares about these people they are cold <UNK> br br another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased ex boyfriend <UNK> that was the moment when i switched off this programme never to return br br p s it's interesting to note that the posters who didn't like this series are all british whereas those who praise it are mostly in other countries this reflects the fact that when the bbc broadcast this series it was ignored by viewers and <UNK> like a stone br br p p s good news for those who liked it there will be a second series in <UNK> 2007 though without the male lead it sounds like the bbc have decided to turn it into a more conventional 30 minute sitcom
<START> i enjoyed the film very much especially the performance of the exceptionally beautiful <UNK> li as the <UNK> br br it was a little distracting however to have chinese dialogue plus english subtitles plus american <UNK> voice over even though the voice over was very well <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> the first emperor of family name was and his given name so in the english he should have been referred to as king or emperor and not as king <UNK> as in those days the two family given names were not used together br br the state of is <UNK> <UNK> not shin a pity the <UNK> didn't get this right br br i <UNK> this but was <UNK> at the end when the commentary announced that he was buried at an together with his <UNK> <UNK> warriors the town is <UNK> see an never an surely the american voice over <UNK> could have got that right
<START> since paul was running short of actual relatives to avenge the third installment in the death wish saga revolves on him returning to new york to visit an old war buddy he arrives only to find out that brooklyn entirely changed into a <UNK> and that youthful thugs killed his friend and continuously <UNK> all the other <UNK> of a <UNK> apartment building strikes a deal with the local police <UNK> <UNK> the heart of his blond attorney blows away numerous villains with an impressive <UNK> gun and gradually trains <UNK> the <UNK> new <UNK> to stand up for themselves okay there's no more point in defending the death wish series after seeing part three the 1974 original was a masterpiece that <UNK> on the social drama as much as it did on the <UNK> and even though it was pure exploitation part two still had quite a few redeeming qualities and at least the events were a <UNK> linked to those occurring in the first number three frequently feels like a totally separate franchise apparently isn't an architect anymore he's ten times more social and <UNK> than he used to be and suddenly nobody not even the police is against vigilante actions anymore all these changes and several other aspects make it more than obvious that michael winner and charles bronson reduced their death wish success to being a purely brainless and exploitative action series with a death <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> with each episode that becomes more and more explosive and criminals that get <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a lot harder to kill however the gentlemen didn't seem to realize that the non stop <UNK> of violence actually creates an opposite effect namely this extremely monotonous and much more boring than the previous two i once read a brilliant review that referred to death wish 3 as the pure definition of cinematic masturbation this description couldn't be more spot on as the script <UNK> moves itself from one <UNK> execution sequence to the next particularly the final twenty minutes are a complete orgy of <UNK> explosions and <UNK> realized through improvised <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this entry in the series has quite an interesting supportive cast including martin <UNK> psycho 12 angry men as the <UNK> neighbor who keeps machine guns in his closet ed <UNK> family plot the longest yard as the slightly <UNK> <UNK> and even alex winter from bill and ted's excellent adventure in his debut role as one of the thugs
<START> it is in the opinion of this reviewer that the best time to be a child was in the 1990's a period when cartoons were not heavily <UNK> and talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family entertainment to hit the air waves the best producers of saturday morning animation were at warner brothers television who experienced a major golden age with the dream team of steven spielberg tom and paul <UNK> along with serious and dark series like batman they also <UNK> zany outlandish cartoons made famous by the looney tunes <UNK> was the biggest <UNK> with its dark adult humour and <UNK> to the celluloid of <UNK> and today but tiny <UNK> adventures was equally popular by re <UNK> the looney tunes for a new generation while still keeping that crazy cartoon violence and intelligent comedy that can hold onto any age group no matter how old even when the tiny <UNK> were stretched to a feature length with how i spent my vacation it did not feel like a longer episode of the television series a curse that so often <UNK> other feature length adaptations of popular animated shows br br the tiny <UNK> gang are young off springs of the classic cartoon characters who made audiences laugh back in the 1940's and 1950's and are currently learning cartoon comedy to earn their <UNK> degree summer vacation has started and each character has their own idea of what to do buster bunny charles <UNK> and <UNK> bunny <UNK> <UNK> start a water gun fight which ultimately leads to <UNK> <UNK> getting <UNK> and them both <UNK> down the <UNK> <UNK> duck joe <UNK> joins pig don <UNK> on a cross country car trip to the <UNK> theme park in the world but family proves to be more difficult than he imagined meanwhile in other stories scattered throughout duff <UNK> summer tries to find a cat to hug and squeeze <UNK> le <UNK> attempts to go out on a date with her favourite <UNK> star and shirley the <UNK> <UNK> goes to the cinema with a loud mouth rob br br while the premise sounds thin for a feature length film the many directors and screenwriters make all the stories work well together the best of these is unfortunate road trip which <UNK> a golden comedic opportunity very well feeling pity for somebody while also laughing at their <UNK> annoyed reaction to all the bad things that happen to him are a perfect blend of script and animation all in the confines of a small car stuffed with <UNK> story definitely ranks second just to see how a little almost innocent girl can cause fear into so many jungle animals the aforementioned cartoon violence definitely comes to the <UNK> front with buster and <UNK> story which makes us smile not only due to the hilarity of the <UNK> but also since and company would probably not be allowed to show half of what they do in that segment practically half of that segment plays as a parody and homage to deliverance including a clever twist on the <UNK> <UNK> scene featuring the unforgettable tiny <UNK> adventures theme song br br part of the universal appeal of the tiny <UNK> is that the humour proves to be very intelligent as it targets subjects with a <UNK> that proves that it does not at all deserve the title of children's fare that people seem to slap it with an entire segment featuring poor <UNK> at the cinema <UNK> fun at in a note perfect way along with an additional <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> that scene is done so perfectly that it should be featured before every cinema showing there are also a couple of moments that poke fun at disney world cinematic plot holes and even <UNK> legal department the fact that today's cartoons are bland and un creative makes those intelligent moments even more <UNK> as there probably will not be another animated series that will come close br br after watching how i spent my vacation for the first time in many years i can say with all <UNK> that they do not make cartoons quite like they used to with the ongoing censorship that today's family entertainment receive one wonders whether anything like this will ever be made again this review is not only a recommendation of a truly smart film but also a <UNK> for spielberg and <UNK> to team up again and bring forth a magical creation to our minds once again lord knows that the children of the twenty first century is in need for something with the intelligence of tiny <UNK> adventures this is not a simple cash grab it is a wonderful film with full of spirit <UNK> mayhem and hilarity
<START> i have viewed this cartoon as a child a father and now a grand father it is my favorite cartoon i love the characters the great little tunes and the very good drawings i totally love the main song which comes up throughout the cartoon i think it is a beautiful little cartoon everyone i have shown it to simply loves it it is too bad it opened on such a bad day pearl harbor bombing if it wasn't for the bad timing it would have been a great success i hope i can find a dvd of it because all the vhs tapes don't do it justice br br i think if anyone shows it to their child they will come up with the same result they will just love it br br
<START> i carefully checked if there's another movie named as this one and there isn't but i really don't think we all saw the same movie there's no way how can you vote more than 1 for this movie the idea of this movie let's say it's acceptable oh and the acting of dan gordon chris is quite good but those are the only two things acceptable in this project the others are awful it's a very delicate word to describe the acting of the other actors the directing the so said special effects even the way that the crew was filming i don't even like the way that the camera <UNK> were moving to record the scenes this may be the most miserable film i've ever seen i really don't remember a movie lower than this one maybe there is but i don't think so <UNK> what's done it's done that's the movie and there's too late for anyone to change anything i've voted 1 but my realistic vote starts with a minus in front
<START> this movie was a dismal attempt at <UNK> a crucial time in english history the film version of <UNK> growing involvement in the war is <UNK> accurate but the overall historical accuracy of this movie was way off this film implies that the war was started over religious differences but the civil war was in no way catholic versus <UNK> both sides were <UNK> <UNK> was never present at the battle of nor did he ever save the day the did not win the battle ended in a draw br br as another reviewer has noted <UNK> was certainly not one of the five members who were to be removed from the house and arrested br br overall this movie was decent the producers tried way to hard and it didn't turn out so great br br definitely could have been better
<START> a stunningly harrowing account of two soldiers plight in wwii set against a <UNK> backdrop of not only the fight against the nazis and <UNK> in but the harsh natural elements this film tells a tale of two soldiers of <UNK> morals one who survives but finds it somewhat impossible to deal with his own circumstances and one who dies having done all that can be done in the face of <UNK> and everything possible to break one's spirit in fact the <UNK> of the title a film that should be seen by all particularly for the phenomenal performances of the main characters and <UNK> set pieces the <UNK> and hanging scenes in particular an absolute must see
<START> in <UNK> the crippled rebel <UNK> <UNK> james <UNK> moves to the <UNK> home for the disabled affecting the lives of the residents roy is able to understand the <UNK> speech of michael connolly steven robertson who was left in the shelter by his prominent father many years ago due to his cerebral <UNK> and they become close friends <UNK> convinces michael to move from to an apartment in <UNK> and they hire the gorgeous <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to assist them living together with <UNK> michael faces a new world finding friendship love and freedom and learning to survive by his own br br inside i'm dancing is a wonderful tale of friendship and freedom in a very beautiful story the acting of steven robertson and james <UNK> are awesome and i do not understand how they have not been nominated to the oscar with such magnificent performances <UNK> <UNK> has also a top notch performance and is extremely beautiful and sexy the screenplay is touching never corny and without redemption and the precise direction of <UNK> <UNK> is very sensitive unfortunately the brazilian title of the dvd is <UNK> ridiculous giving a wrong idea of this excellent movie my vote is eight br br title brazil <UNK> <UNK> de the best years of our lives
<START> it is ok movie if it would be done by high school kids for their friends it is way below limits be called professional there isn't plot no actors' play and visual looks like you see it through the plastic film i was so glad that i have <UNK> button on my remote worked really well i understand that everyone need to start somewhere but it shouldn't be reason to bring it to the public if you have concerns about quality and budget open water was made on and more than half went to the guy who provided the security in the ocean and trained sharks and that movie looks 100 times more professional and it was an event in the <UNK> film making
<START> this is a sort of hidden gem it has little to no promotion no <UNK> no classic status and it deserves all of the above one of the great directors of cinema fritz lang has created a real gem in this excellent western a fine cast led by randolph scott in probably one of his greatest performances the always <UNK> dean jagger robert young as a surprisingly accomplished dude plus many veteran character actors chill <UNK> slim <UNK> john carradine barton and others in an exciting zane grey story of the laying of the western union cable across country it has tense drama of humor and great effects it's reminiscent of demille in ways and yet fritz lang leaves his own <UNK> on it at very least this is a damned good western
<START> unlike some of the former <UNK> i was and am an avid fan of the <UNK> face it christmas would never be christmas without the <UNK> that said i believe the movie did a good not excellent job at depicting <UNK> life the movie was enjoyable to see on <UNK> tv but the content fell a little short i suggest that you all look into getting some of the <UNK> <UNK> that were shown in the 70's you cannot believe how awesome a drummer karen was <UNK> did not capture the extent of <UNK> talent also karen was beautiful but had a bad <UNK> my choice for playing karen is <UNK> <UNK> i would love to see a more <UNK> story because there was more to karen than meets the eyes when listening to we've only just begun i have tons of <UNK> music and it is absolutely excellent her singing of california <UNK> is to die for
<START> most of us kids growing up in the 40's or 50's were western buffs but this was one that had escaped me until seeing on the movies for men channel today i loved the film's story cinematography as well as the superb casting of ben johnson and harry carey jr in the lead roles along with the ever <UNK> ward bond apparently this movie was the inspiration for the later television series <UNK> which featured bond once again as the boss of the <UNK> trains heading west johnson steals the film with his horse riding skills and it's nice to see an actor doing his own stunts like ben does in this movie other <UNK> include the lovely <UNK> <UNK> as denver and an early non speaking role for james <UNK> who later became famous for his <UNK> matt dillon role in ' if you like films of this genre you can't fail to like this one
<START> after the across the board success of my name is barbra cbs television <UNK> barbra to create an even more elaborate follow up as her second special streisand wisely knew in order to follow in the ground breaking success of my name is barbra that her second special would indeed need to raise the bar even further in <UNK> and spectacle not surprisingly she succeeded once again even more <UNK> streisand managed to <UNK> this large production without <UNK> the <UNK> and vision of my name is barbra br br once again the special is divided into three distinct acts filming on location at <UNK> <UNK> department store was so successful in the first special that streisand and company decided to film on location once again for the first act of this second special the decided upon location this time was the philadelphia art museum which would allow endless chances for barbra to enter different art works that would <UNK> with the songs being performed in addition to the numerous artistic possibilities that this location made possible the museum would offer the perfect opportunity to take advantage of filming in color br br after the recording of draw me a circle that is set against the opening credits barbra then <UNK> around the museum in a maid costume to the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> she stops to admire various paintings and <UNK> often becoming the character that is depicted and singing a <UNK> appropriate song streisand performs a bittersweet rendition of <UNK> and one kiss as thomas concert singer delivers a hilariously campy performance of minute <UNK> as marie <UNK> <UNK> abstract art with the frenetic rhythm of peter gotta move and performs a wrenching rendition of non <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> girl the high point of act i however is when streisand <UNK> <UNK> with the bust <UNK> of egyptian queen while singing a tour de force rendition of rogers and <UNK> where or when the act ii circus <UNK> allows streisand to interact with various farm and circus animals while singing various songs with farm circus animal themes some highlights include barbra singing were <UNK> that special face to a baby elephant performing i've grown <UNK> to that face as a <UNK> to a <UNK> the campy sam you made the pants to long sung to a group of baby <UNK> and barbra comparing <UNK> with an while <UNK> we have so much in common streisand also <UNK> on a <UNK> and leaps from a <UNK> to the chorus of spring again and then slows things down by performing a haunting version of i stayed too long at the fair while <UNK> alone on stage barbra also gets the chance to show off her pet <UNK> <UNK> in this segment and even speak a little french br br the act iii concert is once again the high point of the hour dressed in a white <UNK> dress the concert segment is performed on a uniquely designed stage with a partial <UNK> that leads nowhere streisand opens the act with a <UNK> rendition of harold <UNK> i hang my hat is home before <UNK> into heartfelt versions of the familiar standard it had to be you and the rarely heard <UNK> <UNK> bon it's so good streisand then really <UNK> the audience with a <UNK> powerful <UNK> performance of the sweet charity <UNK> where am i going of which streisand delivers the definitive rendition of streisand also introduces the then newly written richard jr david <UNK> <UNK> starting here starting now which contains an <UNK> vocal from streisand that ranks among the very best vocal performances of her long career br br more than anything else color me barbra was a showcase for <UNK> ever increasing mega <UNK> star power despite the presence of even more visual <UNK> <UNK> streisand herself is always the main attraction her voice sounds as beautiful as ever and this special was the first to showcase how strikingly she photographs in color as with my name is barbra color me barbra was another rating smash and <UNK> yet another top five gold selling soundtrack album simply put color me barbra defies tradition and emerges as a sequel that is nearly on par with a classic original
<START> the man who knew too much 1955 is alfred hitchcock's own remake of his 1934 thriller about a married couple james stewart and doris day on vacation in <UNK> where they got caught up in a nightmare that include murder espionage <UNK> and the worst of all kidnapping of their 10 years old son the movie which hitchcock himself considered superior to the original is a great fun stewart and day have a good chemistry together the film is filled with the wonderful comical scenes and dialogues as well as the scenes of chilling suspense br br the inclusion of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> proved to be a stroke of genius because rarely the song fits the content and plays such an important role in the movie like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> did in the man who knew too much br br hitchcock also treats us to the live music playing from arthur benjamin storm cloud for almost ten minutes while scene in <UNK> royal albert hall where the assassination of a very important politician was attempted takes place and both the scene and the are simply marvelous

<START> loosely based on actual events <UNK> edge is a film much in the style of david lynch about a group of teenagers who are aware of a murder committed by one of their friends but no one does anything about it for a long time with top notch acting by <UNK> glover and dennis hopper we are able to forgive the average acting by everyone else in the film br br the film begins with a young boy tim joshua john miller dropping a doll off of a bridge murder 1 tim then hears someone yelling when he looks up he sees <UNK> daniel <UNK> standing on the bank of the river with the dead naked body of his girlfriend behind him murder 2 <UNK> eventually shows the body to his friends all of which are horrified not only because of the murder but also because the victim jamie was a friend of theirs despite all of this no one goes to the police you may think this is unrealistic but this is what happened in the real story if you are familiar with the story of <UNK> dog 2006 you will know that the same thing happened there as well through all of this <UNK> glover is working to keep <UNK> safe although no one including <UNK> seems to care about keeping him out of <UNK> way as time goes on we learn that dennis hopper a middle aged shut in who deals drugs to the local teenagers has also killed a woman before murder 3 from here things begin to close in on <UNK> and his friends and eventually everything is revealed but not in the way you may be expecting br br in the film we learn of three murders each one with a different reason a different reaction and a different effect on those involved when tim drops his younger sister's doll off of the bridge we are never made aware of his motive however we do see the reaction of the younger sister she cries and screams while her mother <UNK> her later her older brother matt keanu reeves helps her put a cross in the yard in <UNK> of her doll the murder of jamie <UNK> everyone except <UNK> who is <UNK> to the whole situation and when asked by why he did it <UNK> replies with she was talking sh t but they do not <UNK> or scream the run away and go on with their lives trying to forget what had happened in situation he did not kill his girlfriend out of hate we never really know why he killed her but we see that is not proud of what he had done he even mentions that he is sorry and that her loved her from this we see the different ways we can be affected by death in the film it is easy for us to identify with the teenagers because they do not know what they feel or how they should feel about the death of their friend in much the same way we the audience do not know how to feel because we do not know jamie we are obviously <UNK> by the death and realize that <UNK> should be arrested but we don't feel strongly for jamie as an individual br br there are several similarities between <UNK> edge and twin peaks 1990 1991 especially in the overall feel of the film i wonder if mark frost and david lynch were thinking of <UNK> edge when they were creating their series after all tim hunter did go on to direct three episodes of twin peaks br br <UNK> <UNK> performance as the <UNK> frantic is an oscar worthy performance always in a rush and always worried about keeping <UNK> from getting caught is an intense character that seems to be on speed if you have seen <UNK> glover in any film you know that he can deliver a line like no one else it is always a treat to see him perform the other great performance in <UNK> edge is by dennis hopper his portrayal of the shut in drug dealer who has one leg and an sex doll he talks to named <UNK> reminded me of a more toned down and more humorous version of frank booth <UNK> character in david lynch's film blue <UNK> 1986 br br <UNK> edge is great film and i believe it shows us how easy it is to be <UNK> when in reality we need to step up and speak out against the <UNK> in the world
<START> i grew up in new york city and every afternoon abc would show the 4 30 movie <UNK> <UNK> was one of the first movies i remember watching as a kid i loved this movie and it has stayed with me for years i recently watched it again and still thought it was great maybe i am just a romantic but i thought it was well done i do not want to say this movie was good only because of the main actors i really did not know who they were when i first saw this movie i guess i just knew quality acting as a child both bergman and cooper were excellent i especially loved seeing old new orleans during the time period of this movie if you ever get a chance to visit new orleans you should watch movies that show the city during that time period when you get to see some of the old homes in the french quarter not just <UNK> street or <UNK> you can truly imagine life as it was 100 years ago br br i love old movies this one to me is a good flick
<START> i tried watching this movie but i didn't make it past the first 15 minutes it's a terrible disappointment considering the cast but i can't look past the fact that the dialogue is in english and some of the actors pretending to be indian are not even close read <UNK> <UNK> considering that india alone has 1 <UNK> of the world's population and one of the biggest movie <UNK> i don't think it would have been hard for the film makers to have found an excellent indian actress to play the part and i don't say so because of some blind <UNK> but because it's absolutely and totally absurd for a non indian to play the role of an indian <UNK> now some people say that <UNK> long as she's convincing who cares ' but my point is exactly that she's not convincing and never can be not due to her acting skills but due to her <UNK> for example however good an actor tom hanks may be he'll never be able to play an australian <UNK> br br but that is still minor to the biggest faux <UNK> the film makers made having the dialogue in english it totally destroys the mood as well as any semblance of authenticity had the same movie been made in native languages hindi <UNK> <UNK> with english subtitles this may have been an excellent movie unfortunately as things stand i would not recommend anyone seeing it apart from film students who want to study what not to do in movies
<START> i am shocked by all the good reviews on the cover of this movie and on imdb it belongs in the 2 bin at your local video store to say that this is a b movie is extremely generous br br besides lacking a single <UNK> character only slightly better than average acting and an ugly 80's style picture quality the script for this film is dull and lifeless this film is not only boring it is pathetic admittedly there is occasionally some mildly interesting chemistry between the two main characters even the final plot twist rather the only plot twist does not save this film br br rent diamond men if you must but do not hesitate to turn it off once you become of its <UNK> 2 out of 10
<START> after the lead actress of the opera is killed in a car accident her young betty is brought to the <UNK> that's very lucky for her with one problem she has an admirer that has decided he will kill all her friends and make her watch what is his connection to the opera and what is his fascination with betty br br i love <UNK> <UNK> with every part of my body and i'm not an <UNK> fan i think many people particularly critics praise his earlier work <UNK> and deep red but really <UNK> on later films such as <UNK> which i liked my favorite <UNK> is usually vastly underrated opera tends to fall somewhere in between some consider it one of his last great films others see it as part of his so called decline i loved it br br the picture is crisp the music is great unlike other critics i love the metal soundtrack the female lead is someone i can feel for not unlike jennifer <UNK> from <UNK> and the imagery wonderful great cinematography and some amazing kill scenes the concept of <UNK> <UNK> to a person's eyes so they cannot blink brilliant my assistant tina thinks this looked fake but even if it does the idea is more than enough to pay off and some great effects like a knife blade coming up inside a man's mouth awesome br br jim <UNK> calls the film stunning and calls attention to the innovative cinematography well constructed shots and exceptionally violent murders i agree with this completely one shot follows the camera through <UNK> <UNK> and there is a very interesting visual use of <UNK> throughout the story mike <UNK> likewise calls it visually fascinating eye candy and the crisp editing and flowing camera work it's really a wonder that this is not one of <UNK> more highly praised works br br <UNK> returned to the opera with phantom of the opera which was a bit of a failure despite the casting of his daughter asia and julian <UNK> even more interesting this same year offered the release of <UNK> <UNK> which like opera has a killer loose inside a theater killing off the people involved with the presentation both are great films with <UNK> more on the slasher side actually served as second unit director on opera you can make your own conclusions br br my only complaint with this film is the length and pacing while it is very beautifully shot and the kill scenes are glorious they are not as frequent as they should be the first one takes over a half hour and then we get down times between them the lead actress should be in constant terror but she is given time between kills to calm down as if everything is normal again not cool <UNK> we need to keep the suspense low and the intensity high
<START> my guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts and thus at least a quarter longer because otherwise how can one explain its confused <UNK> storyline i was never completely lost but i was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation the movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time <UNK> br br if it were longer it might make more sense but it still wouldn't be much good the movie's most interesting idea is of the war between <UNK> and <UNK> as being a war between the male and female but the movie drops the ball on this making followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what followers do or believe the movie is also interesting because you don't see the gods and there's no real <UNK> that they exist so it's got a couple of intriguing ideas but it doesn't do anything useful with them br br bad dialog cardboard characters and one interesting scene involving <UNK> and his three <UNK> sons not unwatchable but also not worth watching
<START> i strongly dislike this show i mean like basically everyone at that school is perfect and rich and i doubt a <UNK> school would look as cool as that and why do they suddenly allow girls into the school isn't that just a little weird anyways jamie <UNK> spears cannot act she always has the same facial expression which really <UNK> me she is basically <UNK> and all the guys seem to like her br br and shouldn't chase tell her he likes her its not that hard really none of this show is real life and she isn't a girl like me because majority of the regular girls do not go to <UNK> school do not have designer clothes and do not live by the beach br br fake fake fake
<START> if you've never been this is the troma movie to see first amazing acting <UNK> soundtrack and bust a gut humor blend perfectly with <UNK> unique brand of storytelling and special effects despite <UNK> from a word for word retelling of romeo and juliet the fact that it stays in <UNK> <UNK> gives you the odd feeling that it's closer to shakespeare than that overdone music video with <UNK> and danes i assumed i'd seen the ultimate <UNK> comedy when the cast of <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> but nothing comes close to <UNK> and juliet i strongly recommend the dvd version which contains a second audio track with director lloyd kaufman which is just as entertaining as the main track
<START> this train wreck begins with <UNK> and <UNK> crossing the mexican border <UNK> is suffering from some horrid curse that causes her to vomit garden snakes and <UNK> every few minutes as well as <UNK> her teeth and <UNK> nonsense so apparently <UNK> has this uncle in los angeles who knows of a cure for her they hop aboard a train to get there and luckily a friend of theirs pays their way <UNK> and <UNK> stay in the <UNK> <UNK> the whole movie since they can't afford upper class seats meanwhile in the higher class we see a bunch of <UNK> on their way to la for whatever reasons a <UNK> guy on a business trip two girls one of whom is carrying 5 grand and a <UNK> of cocaine three <UNK> and some <UNK> the <UNK> rough it up with <UNK> and try to take his <UNK> which apparently is a <UNK> for snakes inside her they realize that the snakes don't attack they enter your body through your <UNK> very twisted and b movie <UNK> saves the guy by ripping out his heart temple of doom style and <UNK> the snake for some reason he cannot have the snakes <UNK> or it'll hurt <UNK> while this is going on a <UNK> expert tries to bust one of the girls and gets a little action topless in exchange for not telling about her <UNK> of drugs a mystery guy shows up and has a <UNK> with him as a grand finale <UNK> turns into a vampire bites her man and then becomes a giant pathetic excuse for a cg snake the size of the train eats the train and is <UNK> into a nuclear bomb <UNK> <UNK> and disappears everyone then heads to la on foot br br the credits actually say at the end any similarity to actual persons living or dead or actual events is purely <UNK> and very weird we suggest moving and or taking a plane odd since a line in the movie from the bald guy is yeah i hate planes the credits go on to say no snakes were hurt during the production of this screenplay only a small child but it's cool there actually were a lot of real snakes used in the movie and all of them very tame there is actually no scene of cg snakes attacking anyone unless you count the large one but then it just eats the train and the other fake snake is just the head and it looks like a muppet the snakes don't really attack anything they're just there one <UNK> out of toilet paper actually br br the movie isn't funny isn't scary as there's no real snake attack and is just a cash <UNK> which is when a low budget movie company hears about a big budget hollywood release then they rush to put out a similar film or even a <UNK> version for release just prior to or simultaneously with the big name flick the effect of this being that many people will either confuse one for the other and go see the <UNK> rather than the or they will want to see both for whatever reason like myself avoid at all costs
<START> any gun can play 1967 directed by <UNK> g <UNK> is a very good <UNK> of spaghetti westerns especially <UNK> the first half is great which apart from the opening which is a direct nod to for a few dollars more with colonel douglas <UNK> and el walking into a ghost town and then promptly killed by a bounty hunter called the stranger is entirely serious with great <UNK> especially the train robbing scene fast and furious action and nice performances from gilbert <UNK> george hilton and who manages well considering that he is badly miscast <UNK> <UNK> but then when the film reaches the half way mark there is a <UNK> fist fight between hilton and <UNK> it isn't very funny and is the weakest part of the film but it throws everything you have seen previously in a new light you realise that in fact the whole thing is a spoof of spaghetti western conventions and in retrospect the first half is so well done that you completely miss this spoof <UNK> what now follows is a more obvious parody with even some <UNK> jumping around from that <UNK> all those seventies circus westerns the ending a complete send up of the good the bad and the ugly climax is very well done as in other hands it could have been very silly so a pretty fun spaghetti western that doesn't take itself too seriously i would recommend it to anyone who likes spaghetti westerns
<START> great book poorly done movie cheesy performances and contrived situations make this movie a sentimental bore fest flat and uninspired work from most of the actors leaves this film in the after school special category no doubt there is a lot of talent to be <UNK> in this cast and crew but something went horribly wrong the very talented gretchen mol attempts to pull this film out of the <UNK> but even she can't seem to rise above the silly dialogue feels like everyone just <UNK> it in even the makeup <UNK> ages 20 years over the course of the film looks amateurish and crude don't waste your time on this <UNK> go read the book
<START> the word honor should be <UNK> from the of all nations it <UNK> male <UNK> and is responsible for the death of millions of innocent people anybody who does not agree should not care to continue reading this comment br br as can be expected with these screenwriters <UNK> is an engaging crime thriller with quite a lot of respect for the <UNK> background against which it is acted out friends of gore and violence will not be disappointed either but especially towards the end violence becomes somewhat pointless redundant and downright silly contrary to other reviewers i found robert <UNK> performance not very good this is an actor who definitely did not improve with age he looks like a tired janitor it does not go too well with the part and his air of <UNK> which made him such an impressive screen presence in earlier years comes through as either confusion or lack of interest ken and richard jordan are very good as man of honor and young intelligent feeling thug respectively br br the best way to stand this movie is seeing it as a tragic comedy things are set in motion by the mitchum character's asking the character a favor based on wrong <UNK> the error quickly becomes evident but the sense of honor demands they must not back off so they start <UNK> around shooting in all directions wielding swords and <UNK> their friend's arty apartment although the guy <UNK> with them it please all through the <UNK> fight bodies start <UNK> up and the story ends with <UNK> character making his point if you give him your little finger i will give you mine well it's the least he can do can't he so he pulls out a knife takes a <UNK> breath and starts <UNK> off said <UNK> outside the frame luckily it was a moment which probably should have been <UNK> it just made me laugh br br the use of locations is very good in this movie i particularly liked the scenes filmed in and around the international <UNK> hall on lake an interesting futuristic building by architect the <UNK> <UNK> was signed there to me the presentation of architecture seems better here than in sydney <UNK> more recent documentary sketches of frank o which is about architecture and nothing else
<START> trite and unoriginal it's like someone watched immortal beloved and <UNK> and decided to mix them together and in the process steal other formulaic plot parts from other movies to make another one as with most historical movies nowadays there are some inaccuracies as history is manipulated to better suit the story which is understandable for the most part for example during the remaining days of <UNK> life it was necessary for other people to write down what they needed to say in order for him to understand them that of course would have been a <UNK> to have to show on screen the script although filled with some <UNK> lines doesn't quite capture the feel of that time period and coupled with some bad acting seems rather contemporary diane <UNK> is nice enough to look at but she still has lots to improve on her craft ed harris doesn't work for me as <UNK> and i mostly blame gary <UNK> for that overall not a very good interpretation of the musical <UNK> life better just find yourself a copy of immortal beloved br br http <UNK> com reviews
<START> this is a very mediocre jackie chan film and one of his absolute worst james <UNK> ruined it all the characters are decent i guess but the story is so so however jackie chan is still amazing in this even if he did look bored jackie and danny aiello had zero chemistry together and it was very boring a lot of times however the finale was above average and managed to be fairly entertaining and had some good stunts i have not yet seen the hong kong version however i'm sure it's better then this dud plus the twist is very predictable it's really lifeless and bland and i don't blame jackie for not looking happy in this and if he didn't star in this it would have been unbearable and completely unwatchable the opening is supposed to be memorable but it's nothing i haven't seen before and done better at that and i thought the whole film was rather lazy and could have been an awesome film if jackie had control of it plus i really didn't root for any of the characters this is a very mediocre jackie chan film and one of his absolute worst james <UNK> ruined it not recommended even for die hard jackie chan fans the direction is terrible james <UNK> does a terrible job here with extremely bland camera work bad angles and keeping the film boring for the most part throughout the acting is so so jackie chan is amazing as always however he is not his usual energetic self and looks bored and ps ed off throughout the film had zero chemistry with danny aiello and i really don't blame him either jackie rules danny aiello is ok here as <UNK> partner but his character is a bit of an ass and he had zero chemistry with jackie he did ok i guess roy is decent as the main villain but was just going through the motions and wasn't all that menacing he still is damn cool though rest of the cast are average at best overall not worth your time or money 1 2 out of 5
<START> ok i watched this movie someone needs to kick me why must the olsen twins insist on <UNK> the world to this <UNK> torture this was another movie of watching the olsen twins travel to an exotic location meet some cute guys look pretty and have everyone <UNK> over them the direction the plot development ugh the acting i don't know about the u s but in my country it is considered extremely stupid to hop onto the bike of a guy u met like 10 minutes back though i'm now convinced that these girls will never learn to act i really hope that one day we'll get to watch a movie with an original even slightly plausible plot
<START> this film tries very hard to be an action film but it fails miserably br br steve <UNK> plays the head of an elite counter terrorist team that fails in attempt to keep a mysterious group from stealing a deadly nerve agent br br the story the acting the special effects all fall flat br br definitely a must avoid
<START> i understand checking out will likely be released in theatres in the usa in june 2006 and on dvd in november 2006 my recommendation is to not miss checking out this comedy film will entertain everyone who will all relate to the characters family relationships and multiple social issues that are portrayed checking out will make you laugh throughout with quick fire clever humor built into almost every line and may make you <UNK> cry in a touching positive way as well br br the subject of suicide is dealt with in a comical way that at the same time may help people considering it understand the <UNK> this act may have on those their life has touched and on those who love them lets hope that checking out can have a positive impact and help prevent those considering suicide from acting it out especially in the 16 25 age group that has the highest rate of suicide in the usa br br the script is wonderfully written perfectly casted and loaded with <UNK> and meaningful flashbacks in time whose significance become more apparent throughout the film and especially at the ending i believe the script is worthy of an academy award nomination for best screenplay play to a movie the phoenix film festival <UNK> checking out with a best screenplay award br br the cast is loaded with great actors that out do themselves and have a long track record of great performances acting award nominations and wins i feel peter <UNK> performance in checking out is worthy of an academy award nomination and is the most challenging and wide ranging of his career laura san performance and chemistry with peter falk as her father is masterful and was recognized at the palm beach international film festival with a best actress award br br even the teenage characters in the movie shine and are played by young acting <UNK> dan <UNK> movies a story with <UNK> duff 3 young artist award nominations won 1 and mary elizabeth tv monster island wolf lake passions touched by an angel 2 young star nominations br br director jeff <UNK> and producer mark lane wonderfully develop the characters their <UNK> and the story line of this entertaining enjoyable yet complex script br br the film editing keeps the pace of the film moving quickly only appropriately <UNK> in the poignant scenes so that the audience will never loose interest from the beginning to the end br br don't miss this film that you can take the whole family to see and all will enjoy it
<START> talk radio sees a man somewhat accidentally stumble through life indeed the american dream from whatever <UNK> standard and everyday job he has in a store to <UNK> of a local radio show before going right the way through to the same job only later <UNK> <UNK> it's a role he <UNK> out of his own <UNK> and natural mannerisms a <UNK> mad approach to freedom of speech as he attacks just about everyone and everything even those that often call up to agree with him or compliment him his role as a man that <UNK> on all things good evil right wrong political religious moral and <UNK> is something that people seem to take to in one form that of <UNK> entertaining and worth <UNK> in <UNK> but additionally on a plane of <UNK> and <UNK>  two things born out of the very things seemingly encouraged in professional working life in the western world this towards a man as he gets to the very top of his game by way of the american dream and dealing in freedom of speech as people take to a man but do anything but take to what it is he says br br talk radio begins with a montage of tall <UNK> buildings in a business based area of dallas texas the <UNK> are shot from a <UNK> angle and tower over the viewer plus everything else in the general <UNK> as this voice of one man tears through the images <UNK> out statements and information on items as these <UNK> buildings dominate out screen they are the very physical representation of capitalism while the voice of what we learn to be a radio dj is the <UNK> representation of the free west personal speech and opinions on anything and everything stone will finish his film in the exact same manner in which he started it although the film is anything but a <UNK> journey of any sort as the characters <UNK> monumental changes in both what they witness and their general <UNK> rather the shots of the buildings act as an anchor around which the study is observed the <UNK> and ideas of a way of life exist people <UNK> to them but it does them more harm than good before the re establishment that this proud way of life still exists and will continue to exist in <UNK> out the sorts of people on display in the film until someone or something drastically changes things br br the dj is barry a man with a radio show on a local <UNK> station dealing with just about anything somewhat <UNK> attitude to some pretty explosive content is established when he flies from one call with a <UNK> man whom recently visited a holocaust museum to a young drug addict whose girlfriend has supposedly <UNK> and onto both the <UNK> and mocking of a pizza shop to us the content comes across as quite shocking to these people everything seems to be business as usual which plants some serious <UNK> of both doubt and horror within the minds of us the <UNK> to all of this br br what <UNK> show is about nobody ever seems to really establish everything and nothing indeed time is taken in the form of either <UNK> or dialogue that the shows immediately pre and post show are on specific subjects <UNK> for instance and are <UNK> by calm speaking and <UNK> people whom i'm sure do not <UNK> from one random or extreme to another all the time raising the stakes one wonders what <UNK> <UNK> is the kind that plays around about lunch time during someone show coming up later the barry show featuring the village idiot and psychotic drug <UNK> indeed his show's <UNK> piece carries a matter of fact tone a shouting at the audience as a loud rock track <UNK> it br br <UNK> success arrives in the national <UNK> <UNK> it's born out of confrontation and a relationship built on the contempt he has for his <UNK> and that they have for him the <UNK> of the material and the <UNK> of the stakes ought to call into question just how far they think they can take this and whether this <UNK> down a track for sake of entertainment is really worth it it is when the show reaches this level of broadcast that barry seems to come <UNK> for the first time in his <UNK> life when a supposed serial rapist calls in and leaves mostly everyone slightly stunned it's at this point the camera pauses on barry and by way of depth of focus <UNK> those same <UNK> <UNK> buildings the film began with which stand outside of the window directly behind barry they remain tall and proud specifically of the <UNK> they've been built on and this <UNK> of freedom of speech in <UNK> show <UNK> as one man climbs his ladder suddenly <UNK> with the sort of content that's being offered everything reaches a point too far and that with freedom ought to at least come a sense of clarity rather than a mere <UNK> br br oliver stone made talk radio right in the middle of both a fascinating and explosive period of film making he had in the late 1980s in this time he produced a series of really well received films in a pretty short space of time beginning with one of my favourite war films in platoon before continuing with the quite brilliant wall street and eventually finishing with <UNK> <UNK> one might even say that this run continued on into the mid nineties with natural born killers talk radio is like its lead character in the sense it's loud <UNK> stark and <UNK> it isn't anti capitalism as much as it is focused on drawing a line between what is perceived as entertainment and what is just going too far for sake of popularity and <UNK> talk radio is certainly a film that sticks in the memory
<START> amazing amazing amazing what more can be said <UNK> is the best hamlet ever to grace the stage and captures every inch of the character every nuance and element of hamlet is depicted and depicted well some people have complained about his age but you honestly cannot tell when watching the film if anything he looks drastically younger than 40 i only wish a more worthy <UNK> could have been found her acting is passable but she just doesn't look the part the only real exceptional performances come from <UNK> and stewart who is a great <UNK> the rest of the cast is good but <UNK> is what truly <UNK> this <UNK>
<START> i've never written a comment on imdb before but this movie was so bad it left me little choice but to warn you not to waste the two hours of your life as an avid wwii <UNK> i don't even know where to begin on how historically inaccurate this movie was <UNK> with korean war <UNK> <UNK> missing cleaning and sight <UNK> german uniforms that didn't exist the list could go on forever added that it's loaded with flaws has literally no plot or climax and acting on par with your local high school theater the epitome of cheesy br br please there are too many good wwii movies out there to waste your time on this junk
<START> what can i say after having read <UNK> books and loving lynch's movie version i was extremely disappointed i felt i was watching a reject version of buck rogers the sets looked like left overs from a star wars tv special i felt the acting was a bit amateurish by most the costumes were <UNK> and over done which gave it a '60s flash gordon pulp feel the worms they're supposed to be sand worms and yet they appeared to big with a mouth at the blunt end the effects in general were pretty second rate i won't even start about the <UNK> <UNK> effect br br this so called frank <UNK> <UNK> wasn't even to his books it should have been called frank <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> key plot elements were left out names were changed and the entire feel of the story was <UNK> i didn't even <UNK> the in fact most of the characters appeared nothing like <UNK> <UNK> had depicted them i'm starting to get upset just remembering what a tragedy it was i'm glad i couldn't stomach the second installment
<START> some spoilers dull as <UNK> slasher flick that has this deranged homeless man harry out murdering real estate agent all over the city of l a because of the high <UNK> that they charge for their looking like an extra from a clint eastwood spaghetti western harry who's been living in abandoned houses eating dog food <UNK> very upset where his quite lifestyle as a <UNK> is interrupted this happens when a number of real estate agents <UNK> his space in an attempt to sell the houses that he's staying at to their potential <UNK> br br joseph stars in this bottom of the barrel horror movie as radio talk show host dr david kelly the handsome and popular host psychologist of the survival line dr kelly is being <UNK> by the family of one of his <UNK> tracy who ended up blowing her brains out while on the air with the doc who couldn't do anything to help her survive her ordeal of taking to him br br the real estate killer gets to talk with dr kelly on the air about his adventures and the police try to get the doc to get his phone number and address by keeping him on the line but he refuses to in order not to hurt his rating by having potential <UNK> not call in in fear of being <UNK> by the br br kelly also is having a hot and heavy affair with a real estate manager and agent the <UNK> lisa grant <UNK> <UNK> who's office of sellers are harry's main victims in he movie harry also gets to murder <UNK> main competition in the <UNK> business the <UNK> and outrageous barney <UNK> barry hope who threatened to put lisa out of business by any means possible even if he has to kill her br br getting alone and with his pants down harry <UNK> his head off while he's being entertained by one of his <UNK> a hooker whom he leaves dead and hanging together with the <UNK> barney the movie ends with the deranged harry taking lisa hostage and having dr kelly try to come to her rescue only to have <UNK> <UNK> robert looking like e hasn't slept in a week pop out of nowhere and blow harry's brains out harry quickly come back to life minus the gay matter between his ears and gets himself killed for the second time in the movie by being thrown from a balcony and landing on the ground as a dozen members of the <UNK> <UNK> and ready come on the scene br br nothing in the movie house worked with the tension laughable to almost non existent even the hot sex scenes between dr kelly and lisa didn't save the movie since there were far too few only two of them and and sexy <UNK> <UNK> was a bit too with not enough light and too much clothes on in all of them br br harry the killer in the movie was also a bit to comical to be taken seriously in trying to make a point to dr kelly on the phone and in person about the high <UNK> and real estate <UNK> in the country and how people like himself find it almost impossible to find a decent place to live in you can sympathize with harry's concern about the high cost of living but be very critical of him in how he <UNK> went on in it
<START> seeing this film or rather set of films in my early teens <UNK> changed my idea of the possibilities of human interaction and the range of potential experience this monumental exploration of individuals and their historical setting reveals how full <UNK> and intense every human existence is the people are portrayed as they are to themselves their experiences of the smallest to the largest internal and <UNK> <UNK> are detailed with the greatest of artistry and perception edgar displays a fabulous appreciation of human motivations and <UNK> br br when these <UNK> are set against the immense time allowed by the length of the work one cannot help but <UNK> the force and of happiness defeat lust love sadness melancholy that each person feels when i saw these films i perceived my future experiences how my life would inevitably twist and <UNK> due to both intended and accidental events i acquired a feeling of the <UNK> of being and what it meant to reflect upon past lives memories and <UNK> a masterpiece and a revelation i only wish the bbc would screen it again br br if anyone knows where i can get a copy could they contact me
<START> richard is a canadian marvel and one that should be shared with the world be it for gut <UNK> early work such as getting started and the oscar nominated <UNK> through the apprentice and the <UNK> made la is a <UNK> local hero but no <UNK> piece of work puts a <UNK> on his career quite like the big <UNK> and did i mention it was nominated for an academy award darn br br the big <UNK> although clearly a dated message <UNK> from the 1980s the short revolves around cold war esquire nuclear <UNK> but don't worry  it's hilarious as hell carries with it a larger meaning as is most of work in an understated sort of way while the planet <UNK> for cover from <UNK> a couple <UNK> over each <UNK> annoying <UNK> in true fashion he the furniture while she shakes her eyes  literally and don't forget to watch it again and again there's always something to look at loads this <UNK> up with countless visual gags and memorable catch phrases br br i strongly encourage this incredible piece of animation be <UNK> down in canada it's usually spotted in a national film board video that includes other stellar shorts including fellow <UNK> <UNK> equally funny the cat came back americans will just have to dig a little deeper but keep at it  the reward is worth the <UNK>
<START> before i had seen this film i had heard some negative comments about it however when watching it i found myself thinking ok it's a little slow paced but this is quite interesting as it built toward the end it created a complex moral dilemma leading to a shocking yet within the context of the film entirely believable decision with extremely powerful dramatic consequences if this had been followed through it would have been a tremendously powerful ending and would have given me a very <UNK> impression of the film br br however due to an ending which not only cops out emotionally on an unnecessary happy ish ending without real emotional credibility but also within the context of the film makes absolutely no sense whatsoever for you clearly see one of the character take an action which should end her life but inexplicably doesn't incidentally please tell me if i did miss something here and there is a reason why she survives as i just couldn't how <UNK> she could have and this <UNK> the whole film for me br br this said all three leads put in powerful performances although kevin characters' transformation by the end goes a little further than is fully convincing and it does create a very powerful <UNK> triangle br br this film is recommended if you ready yourself to walk out when the mother and the sister are lying on the bed but do not watch further than this unless you have only a <UNK> but several mountains of salt
<START> when i first heard about this movie i noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s i noticed the music was by <UNK> john so i figured i had nothing to loose so i got it what a surprise the movie was awesome it was true love is all about the characters paul and michelle had no <UNK> no money and sometimes no food yet they were still happy i recommended this film to all my friends but they all my tastes and even called me names <UNK> the movie featured two <UNK> naked i think that only made the movie more realistic the cinematography was great and it only come to show the great abilities of director lewis gilbert
<START> having seen many of wong <UNK> <UNK> other movies happy together fallen angels <UNK> of time i knew what to expect coming in to the theatre the cinematography would be lush the use of space and perspective would be varied the acting would be superb and at least one of the characters would be consumed by an <UNK> loneliness these are after all precisely the techniques that make wong <UNK> <UNK> art what it is what i was not expecting was the degree to which i was drawn into a film that some reviewers <UNK> as unfinished and compelled by characters who seemed consumed by <UNK> br br i find it interesting how people can be so utterly <UNK> by a film that so vividly displays emotions and settings many of us take for granted or work <UNK> to forget the overwhelming sense of grief <UNK> from being betrayed the guilt <UNK> by the thought of becoming no better than the <UNK> the mundane yet profoundly intimate moments of relationships where the need to express <UNK> <UNK> is utterly superfluous this is what wong <UNK> <UNK> attempts to portray in the film and what he achieves so well br br too many americans are consumed by the need to have every moment of a film filled with stock dialogue witty banter <UNK> sarcasm and overwrought <UNK> seem to be the <UNK> of the best american film has to offer wong <UNK> <UNK> sees things very differently instead of the character needing to keep the audience <UNK> of her every feeling perception or belief <UNK> characters make their feelings and <UNK> known clearly by facial gestures body <UNK> and yes silence br br if viewers merely contemplate this film from the standpoint of character development and action then they may be disappointed by what it has to offer if they are willing to let themselves try and what the characters are feeling then they may feel quite differently about what wong has to offer them
<START> alter <UNK> do not come funnier than the creation of <UNK> baron <UNK> ali g completely <UNK> by his <UNK> and non existent sense of the middle england suburban surroundings that his social background consists of he <UNK> on living the style of a los angeles while still living with his <UNK> in the london <UNK> of he keeps tight control of his <UNK> the west br br spending his spare time between me julie his girl the <UNK> and teaching local eight year old <UNK> at keep it real advanced lessons at the government <UNK> john <UNK> <UNK> centre br br this is where the story takes off being told that the government funding has stopped ali g then proceeds on a one man quest in the struggle for justice i willing to lay down me life just like martin <UNK> van <UNK> did being his <UNK> to the local media crew when <UNK> him on <UNK> strike while <UNK> to a fence br br charles dance here plays david <UNK> the sinister and <UNK> deputy prime who is even more than <UNK> using ali g <UNK> to lose the prime 18 000 votes three weeks before the general election seeing ali g as a bumbling idiot his plan <UNK> ali g suddenly becomes an over night sensation and a <UNK> of the people working directly with the prime the story becomes more sinister and with hilarious consequences br br ali g is a great british movie that brings the hugely talented attributes of writing along with dan executive production and acting of <UNK> baron cohen charles dance and michael as the p m play their parts with great seriousness among the gags and hilarity that is ali g br br ironically seeing the parodies playing their parts in a world that really is real and who are continually preaching keep it real from their own little world that is the west is true comic <UNK> br br directed by mark his first full length feature film since directing television work such as shameless shooting stars the fast show and the smell of reeves and <UNK> to name a few br br very real and very funny
<START> what's the point of this film it's totally forgettable unless you have a serious bunny fetish look elsewhere so the <UNK> had a merit <UNK> list no chewing <UNK> in front of the customers are we supposed to find that interesting
<START> i thought there might be some level of worth to this movie and sat through the whole thing i can <UNK> by saying it left a bad taste in my mouth br br the movie started out ok i think the initial characterization of was true to the <UNK> both as a child and a young adult he started out pretty strong but not the <UNK> <UNK> but later on he somehow transforms into a charismatic <UNK> beloved by all huh br br other problem terrible cgi the looked ok but the rest of the <UNK> just looked terrible especially the hart the <UNK> looking beast in the movie and how come <UNK> skin was sometimes golden sometimes normal the worst part for me and everyone should cringe at this was the twelve <UNK> of <UNK> because the producers obviously didn't want to cover all of them maybe they thought us primitive screw heads watching this garbage couldn't count that high instead of the twelve <UNK> of <UNK> we got the five <UNK> of <UNK> yes the five <UNK> wtf he <UNK> even finish the last one so it was really the 4 1 2 <UNK> just terrible i'll take <UNK> the legendary <UNK> over this piece of crap any day of the week
<START> maybe it's because i'm no fan of the comics but if the comics are of the same quality as the movie it's hard to believe there are any but this has to be one of the worst movies ever made non existent plot laughable acting dumb dialogue this movie is so bad that it hurts a lot that some people actually gave this one 10 10 is an insult to any good or at least mediocre or at least bad movie if you hate yourself then watch tank girl on another thought if you hate yourself that much maybe you should just commit suicide my rating <UNK> 10
<START> empire of passion starts out <UNK> that is if you're immediately expecting it to be a horror movie it's like a riff on james m <UNK> the <UNK> always rings twice at first <UNK> is a mother of two and a <UNK> hard working wife to <UNK> driver <UNK> but when he's not around and she's at home with the baby the <UNK> and <UNK> young man <UNK> <UNK> comes around to bring some <UNK> for and a little extra they're soon sleeping together but after he does something to her let's just say a <UNK> he knows that he'll find out and immediately <UNK> that they kill they drink him up <UNK> him and then toss him down a well naturally this will come back to haunt them but that it's literally at least to them at first super terrified and then only later on skeptical changes <UNK> into the a japanese ghost story br br this is a film where the horror comes not simply out of oh ghost ah but out of the total dread that builds for the characters in a way there's the <UNK> of a film noir at work throughout if only loosely translated by way of a 19th century japanese village as opposed to an american city or small town i e the <UNK> cop the evidence found possibly by another word getting around <UNK> <UNK> etc it's compelling because <UNK> actually was against the plan from the start manipulated by the <UNK> but ill prepared and her reactions to re appearances are <UNK> to her take the one that comes closest to poetry ghost pale blue face and mostly silent chilling stare motions for <UNK> to get on the <UNK> she does reluctantly and he pushes her around on a road she doesn't know in the wee hours before dawn surrounded by smoke most japanese ghost stories wish to heavens they could get this <UNK> atmospheric br br while it starts to <UNK> into <UNK> towards the end there's so much here that director gets right in making this a distinctive work after hitting it huge in the international cinema world with in the realm of the senses which ironically got banned in his own country he made something that he claimed was even more daring that maybe he was right empire of passion has less graphic sexual content by far than its predecessor also starring <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> physical actor with an immense lot of range but its daring lies in <UNK> a world of dread you can believe in ghosts in this story but you also have to believe how far down to their own personal <UNK> these two would be <UNK> will go the <UNK> detective or the <UNK> <UNK> are the least of their <UNK> the fate of their very souls is at stake br br and takes what in other hands could be merely <UNK> pulp sadly it wouldn't surprise me if an american remake was already in the works and <UNK> shot after gorgeous shot with <UNK> working its way into the <UNK> en scene i e the shots of <UNK> and walking on that road the camera at a dutch angle the world <UNK> and surrounding them in a grim blue <UNK> as well as some affecting movements that will stay with me long after i finish <UNK> this i e throwing the leaves by one hand into the well in slow motion or how nude body is revealed after she becomes blind it's daring lies in connecting on a level of the spirit not to be confused with the spiritual though there may be something with that as well about life and <UNK> connections to one another <UNK> it's a classic waiting to be discovered
<START> this is the last film of <UNK> one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema he intended to <UNK> after this film so in a way it is his artistic testament he died a couple of years after making the film and though it is said that he intended to return to directing destiny decided that this was indeed his last and what a film br br the last film in the three colors french trilogy is actually a very swiss film set in <UNK> one of the two main characters is a swiss retired judge and immediately comes to mind but there is more switzerland in the cool atmosphere in the lack of communication of the characters in the <UNK> that <UNK> cruelty of life several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final which only a great artist could have staged br br little else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times yes the film starts slowly and the fans of the american style of action movies or <UNK> will get <UNK> first and will get lost as viewers they deserve it the film gets quality as it advances and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than the hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters cinema quality is very original the image being a in as the title shows acting is fabulous with irene <UNK> and jean louis <UNK> the later in what will remain <UNK> the best role of his old age br br a great film seeing it again probably adds and i am happy to have it recorded on tape 9 10 on my personal scale
<START> br br is a strange dark obsessive object the casting is impressive the plot is powerful reminded me of edgar <UNK> tales probably not a masterpiece but it does leave us with the <UNK> of strong images fine music fear sadness confusion and a sentence that says it all the wolves are coming is quite forgotten now and when it was released nobody seemed to appreciate it that's a shame if you ever have a chance to see this well give it a try
<START> five fingers relies heavily on <UNK> shock value hollywood tactics to <UNK> apparently a positive movie going response this is where this movie fails throughout primarily because it is too graphic to be taken seriously i was <UNK> and disgusted that five fingers was even made and essentially had to force myself to continue watching it torture in and of itself is gruesome even the sounds coming from a room where someone is being tortured are gruesome but obviously the makers of this stinker of a movie felt that was not enough it had to go way beyond what was needed and simply and effectively ruined any chances this movie had of making some sort of valid point for this reason this movie came across as nothing more than being self <UNK> five fingers also pretty much <UNK> itself to a b movie status solely by its <UNK> on manipulation of time in other words we are shown the present and then the past is revealed in snippets this is a little bit of a twist of the normal hollywood manipulation of time whereas the viewer normally is shown page 95 in a 100 page script as the beginning of the movie and then the rest of the flick is essentially explaining the ending five fingers is dedicated to flashing back which gets quite <UNK> by the end of the movie overall five fingers made me feel stupid for watching the whole movie because torture is obviously obscene and it certainly was not necessary to resort to graphic <UNK> to make this point i am surprised that dick <UNK> did not make a guest cameo appearance at the end as some sort of torture superhero this movie is a perfect example of what happens when an important topic falls into the hands of greedy mindless <UNK>
<START> i have been wanting to see this since my french teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago perhaps the long wait was worth it since the <UNK> collection dvd <UNK> is impressive br br in its outline this movie follows the time worn script a <UNK> of men <UNK> plot a difficult heist of a bank vault the heist takes place a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all even though the heist footage is <UNK> it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film this film <UNK> itself from the typical heist movie by giving us insights into the personalities of the characters and their motivations its plays as much as a drama as it does a thriller relationships play a big role and a kidnapping is tacked on giving us two movies for the price of one br br john plays the idea man tony le always referred to as le with such world <UNK> that he could have just stepped out of a <UNK> novel tony has just recently gotten out of jail and <UNK> re entering the life of crime until he has a highly unpleasant interaction with his ex lover who has taken up with another man where as punishment he physically <UNK> her with a belt thankfully that scene occurs off camera but you are not likely to forget it after that <UNK> event since there seems little hope of <UNK> that relationship tony meets with two of his old partners in crime jo and mario and decides to join them in one last big heist they <UNK> the services of <UNK> an italian safe cracker played by director <UNK> himself and we are off to the heist br br the heist goes off without a <UNK> but <UNK> bent is a personality <UNK> that turns out to be fatal for all concerned however we can understand his attraction to the nightclub singer he has fallen for since there is a brilliant set piece where she performs a sexy and <UNK> inspired nightclub act it has to be one of the most memorable scenes from any noir film br br it is established early on that tony has a close relationship with jo and his family in fact <UNK> son refers to him as uncle i think it is partly to help <UNK> family that tony agrees to the heist the ending scenes where tony saves the life of <UNK> kidnapped son partially <UNK> his more brutal and amoral actions but only partially
<START> i found it hard to care about these characters who were either annoying or insipid all living their <UNK> hilariously urban lives br br the dialogue was at times and at other times the narrative seemed hard to follow was it me or were entire scenes deleted br br it felt like a poor sitcom somehow turned into a film the stereotypes and jokes about men's groups would perhaps have been funny in the early 90s as it is this is where much of the humour of the film comes from and boy does it get old fast br br apart from the attractive irish man this film was a dud and not even in a so bad it's good way the last 20 minutes were particularly painful perhaps if you've never met any gay people or never thought about homosexuality before then this film might have something meaningful to say otherwise <UNK> you'd still be better off renting the boys in the band or beautiful thing
<START> i've often heard people express disappointment that <UNK> has little to do with shakespeare's original in my opinion that is both true and false but most of all it's a bad starting point for offering critique a work of art should never be <UNK> for what it isn't but for what it is the movie <UNK> is nothing like a faithful rendition of the play but to my mind it is faithful to shakespeare's work in spirit what <UNK> is then is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time no not experimental as in hand held camera and <UNK> dialogue but experimental as in exploring the <UNK> of a story without <UNK> regard for box office <UNK> <UNK> is epic sad realistic <UNK> full of life but most of all it is imaginative cassavetes portrayal of philip <UNK> is in itself worth a 10 10 rating and when you add gena rowlands susan sarandon a wonderfully deep molly <UNK> <UNK> julia the dialogue the music and the <UNK> suggestive little <UNK> scattered throughout the picture i rest my case one of the best movies of the 80's don't miss it
<START> whether or not this adaptation of the marvel comic was made  and <UNK>  so its production company could retain the <UNK> to the characters it doesn't change the fact that it's utter rubbish the dr doom and especially thing costumes are surprisingly good but everything else suffers from a <UNK> of either cash or talent director can't even point a camera at stuff without including such <UNK> as a blind woman's <UNK> the dialogue is absolutely dismal the <UNK> costumes don't fit properly and the effects are appalling the human torch seems to be drawn onto the film with felt tip <UNK> while mr powers are brought to life using a <UNK> blue stick with a <UNK> on the end joseph <UNK> <UNK> for having to wear a mask by wildly waving his arms about jay <UNK> is incredibly annoying the rest of the cast hit various levels of terrible and while it's hard not to feel sorry for all these guys who thought this movie would get a release it's equally difficult to imagine any of them believing it was actually any good
<START> this film has some pretty <UNK> parts like a <UNK> getting bit off and a other big bites castle freak himself is a good monster i would be scared to pieces if he was coming after me however the movie had some dumb parts about it br br a husband goes drunk driving and kills his 3 year old son and <UNK> his teenage daughter i suppose death is a greater damage than <UNK> but you'd never know that the parents actually feel bad about their daughter being blind all they care about is that j j 's dead while their teenage daughter walks around running into things and talking about how she'll never be able to drive a car the parents are like honey stop walking around without a guide you know better than that and then they cry and don't ever stop being depressed because <UNK> dead sounds like <UNK> to me br br the lines of dialogue are not very realistic or well done for example when a giant crash is heard in the castle everybody runs down into the basement to see what it was it was a huge mirror that crashed to the ground and <UNK> the husband runs to the broken mirror in horror and <UNK> says the mirror broke i don't know i would say a little more than that if a giant mirror mysteriously crashed to the ground in my castle br br the husband and wife have some major relationship problems and it's funny to watch how dumb they are with each other no one ever believes the blind girl advice if a blind girl says she hears things believe her and don't tell her to shut up i think this is the moral of the story listen to people when they tell you things or else you might end up killing yourself to prove your point br br lastly i thought the best character was the main police officer he was the best actor and character everyone else besides castle freak was pretty run of the mill 3 10
<START> great balls of fire is the movie you show to someone you really really hate it is absolute torture of the highest rank and is probably used by <UNK> of a foreign power to <UNK> info from captured intelligence agents i've enjoyed some of dennis <UNK> performances in the past but he goes totally over the top in this film he doesn't so much cross the line he pole <UNK> over it then comes back to jump over and over again he <UNK> and <UNK> as if on some incredibly bad acid trip it's one of those rare performances where you wish you could enter the film and beat the man within an inch of his life for doing something so truly awful was he desperate to win a golden <UNK> or some other award for bad acting that's the only conclusion i can come up with thank you dennis you gave us a bad performance for the ages where was the director to reign in this guy br br the opposite end of the extreme is <UNK> <UNK> she of the plastic features and plastic acting i came across a review of her acting style that compared her to a wax <UNK> that was of course an insult to wax <UNK> all over the earth all of whom could have <UNK> more humanity to the role of <UNK> <UNK> cousin wife this brings up the film's mixed up message that being it is 100 okay to marry your own cousin and have a child by the union i fail to see what is so okay about that but it looks as though hollywood thinks that <UNK> incest is hunky <UNK> talk about family values br br another problem is the format is it a forward re telling of <UNK> life or is it a musical i'm not talking about the music i'm talking about the truly weird scene where jerry drives up to the school starts to belt out a tune and everyone starts to dance like it was broadway musical in search of a tony fantasy and reality are thrown together in a mix that does not work but who really cares i don't and neither should you you can't get back the minutes of life you would waste on this film so don't waste your time it's too precious for something this misguided and poor
<START> you belong to me was the final <UNK> of henry fonda and barbara stanwyck as a screen team and it was a <UNK> out film for fonda to columbia pictures fonda had signed a contract with 20th century fox in order to get the tom part in the <UNK> of wrath but after that it was usually his <UNK> out films that were good while he was cast in mediocre things at fox br br but the rule was broken here though the character he plays bears some superficial resemblance to charles <UNK> from the lady eve this film isn't anywhere near as funny in fact <UNK> would probably be <UNK> at it br br in fact barbara stanwyck herself didn't like it at all she liked working with henry fonda right enough but thought this film was ridiculous as well she should have br br fonda is another millionaire playboy who we would now call a trust <UNK> baby who doesn't really do much with his life he's sort of lovable <UNK> who meets stanwyck on a <UNK> <UNK> and literally falls for her trying to show off turns out she's a doctor and they have a <UNK> <UNK> and get married br br but it turns out fonda has a jealous streak especially when it involves roger clark another millionaire patient of <UNK> and he's not understanding as to her professional <UNK> br br stanwyck like bette davis and <UNK> hepburn was and is a feminist icon when she tells fonda that he ought to go out in the working world and live on a <UNK> and see if he can do it fonda goes out and gets a job as a salesman in a department store she's so proud of him that she actually is going to give up her medical practice and live with him on his <UNK> <UNK> br br today now would be the film stanwyck did not have too much conviction in her performance probably because she didn't believe any of it i certainly couldn't br br i don't think even back then audiences believed it either but the two stars and the rest of the cast tried their best but this one was a <UNK> special
<START> this film was both entertaining and thought provoking i'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged great acting directing and it is canadian to boot it is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers the locations in <UNK> <UNK> such a sense of nostalgia for the era with so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick for any family that has <UNK> to overcome a challenge or an <UNK> be it financial or illness this film strikes a <UNK> <UNK> it approaches the idea of the <UNK> in a contemporary way without cheaply <UNK> on all the and supernatural themes that have become <UNK> in hollywood and the tv networks
<START> despite of all the negative criticism i really enjoyed this movie i am not saying this lightly i love movies and am fairly <UNK> about them my home dvd collection is over 9 000 movies some are great others are ok a few i do not like at all and to all those with criticisms this is a comedy i simply love this movie it is light funny and very <UNK> i am aware of all or most of the <UNK> but i love it the comedic talents of eddie murphy and robert deniro are <UNK> fully for this type of movie do not compare it to other movies with these star actors simply enjoy it the cast is great and i believe that the purpose of this movie was fully accomplished if you want a really easy going and very <UNK> night watch this movie deniro and murphy simply had fun making this movie so should we watching it and please do not be so negative do not expect godfather performance or meet the parents from deniro do not expect comedy blockbusters performance from murphy it is a completely different genre and it made me relax after a hard day work your sides may not split from laughter but it is still very funny
<START> zombie planet seems like an example of good ideas and <UNK> ambition budget i thought the explanation for the zombies was real original and <UNK> and loved the dog <UNK> in the exposition scene the rest of the gore was effective in a low budget kinda way but too <UNK> apart throughout the movie the problem was that it was too long and anti climatic sure they had a intriguing if derivative plot line and a similarly familiar but cool setting but a low budget zombie film really needs to be to make an impression and there just weren't enough red moments in this for me i think there was <UNK> of cheap looking and <UNK> fight scenes as well especially given the generally minimal <UNK> plus for a two hour movie there's very little closure at the end and though it kinda makes me want to track down zombie planet 2 i felt a tad cheated so probably most worth looking for the two of them
<START> <UNK> <UNK> tries his hands at comedy and succeeds one of the few good movies that involves salman khan a very funny movie from start to finish all the characters contribute to the movie and believe me there are a lot of them <UNK> khan salman khan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kapoor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kapoor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and more the direction editing sound are not up to par but that still does not matter because the actors more than make up for that part
<START> 1st watched 7 <UNK> 2001 4 out of 10 <UNK> mark fast paced frantic animation effort by ted <UNK> feature animation group plays a lot like tv cartoons and leaves a lot to be desired in the area of likeable characters but <UNK> has extremely unlikeable villains i'm not even sure why the kids would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know very little or nothing about mediocre effort at best despite <UNK> on the box comparing it to disney efforts like <UNK> and lion king don't let this fool you there is no comparison in story or quality
<START> the only thing i expected that this film didn't have was an intelligent talking motorcycle br br this film is just plain awful i gave it 1 star which of course means i enjoyed it tremendously bad acting bad writing bad directing bad fight choreography the only real actor in this movie is martin <UNK> who of course does a good job playing the villain although the character is your standard cardboard <UNK> evil <UNK> villain even the so called plot twist at the end was no shock br br there was so much to make fun of in this movie i enjoyed it a lot and it did have a few impressive car wreck stunts br br like bad movies check this one out <UNK> want a good movie not here
<START> the dvd release of this movie hopes you will buy this movie on the name and face of sandra <UNK> her picture from years after this film basically is the cover art and the back cover art and the inside cover art the same picture her name is <UNK> shown on the front cover all 4 edges and the <UNK> itself she is the first name in the list of stars her biography is <UNK> inside the case this film must <UNK> around her character right wrong it is her first movie and she plays a minor role after watching the movie every role seems like a minor role the character dog actually displays some personality less than an hour after watching it i don't even remember the names of many characters br br maybe if i watched it several more times i could actually figure out the plot but i don't think it would be worth the effort br br oh wait i just remembered a funny bit shoot em up video game fans will get a kick out of the doom <UNK> looks just like a first person <UNK> game hands and gun pointing out in front of the camera br br i am generally not a person to be critical of movies but this may be the worst movie i have ever seen i kept expecting some <UNK> to walk across the screen sit down and start making fun of it br br i'm just glad that the money we spent on this used went to charity
<START> i started watching this because i was looking for a nice comedy for my sunday morning then i noticed that this was going to be a road movie and i decided to actually watch this br br first 15 minutes were awful but i wanted to give this a chance because i never judge a movie without watching it <UNK> then things started to get little better this seemed like a nice road movie about friendship but then the movie started to get horrible predictable cliché twists and when the movie was over it left you feeling like you had wasted your time did this have anything to say why did they even make a movie like this and i wasn't expecting a modern citizen kane but still i have several ideas how this movie could have been improved br br so take my piece of advice leave this alone and go watch a real road movie there are many of those i won't make the directors of those movies seem bad by putting their names on this review br br 1 10
<START> if this film had been made in the 50's or 60's critics and fans alike would have praised it i myself enjoyed the film from beginning to end it's not a timeless piece and has not aged well over the years but it is enjoyable to watch nonetheless as for mrs <UNK> acting in the film not the best on the planet but it adds to the film's unique slapstick comedy aspirations and showcases <UNK> often underrated sense of comedic timing madonna plays <UNK> <UNK> an ex convict who was framed for a crime she didn't commit <UNK> dunne plays the hapless future <UNK> puppet who is sent to <UNK> her from prison to the bus station where a series of unfortunate events occurs thus creating the plot and there is one folks give the film a shot you might be pleasantly surprised at how funny it really is
<START> on the face of it this film looked like it might be really good it isn't br br the cast is pretty good but most of them seemed embarrassed by the whole thing the real disaster in this film is not the <UNK> but the script it attempts to include every cliché in the book all done incredibly poorly the ending is very abrupt but this is a <UNK> in disguise if you make it that far br br all three main male actors <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> would surely agree that this is the low point in their careers i hope they got paid a lot of cash because none of their <UNK> come out in <UNK> br br the special effects are quite good but the same thing was done to much better effect in the day after tomorrow br br in short a pointless exercise don't waste your time
<START> the historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented it was never intended to be serious history but an entertaining saga and there it succeeds errol flynn was never better as this role was <UNK> for him olivia <UNK> was never more beautiful arthur kennedy never more villainous anthony quinn never more noble than as crazy horse it had much humor and pathos and held your interest throughout the one historical aspect i found most <UNK> inaccurate was the final last stand which occurred on the banks of the little big horn the film version was filmed in a desert with no river in sight however i still consider it marvelous entertainment typical of hollywood's golden age
<START> is an awful movie the dialogue was pointless the acting was pathetic it had virtually no story line and you can't really tell what the hell is going on half the time due to the continuity errors and plot holes br br but you will love it anyway because it pushes the boundaries on gore violence death destruction and chaos they even kill children and unborn babies in this movie you will be sitting there thinking oh my god that is disgusting and they surprise you by killing the chick who always makes it out <UNK> when the predator and aliens are fighting in the hospital br br it's like the movie industry has said we know what we did in the first alien vs predator movie was was bad so we're doing it again but this time we're getting help from <UNK> with vivid <UNK> it's <UNK> moronic and down right pointless but you will be thinking about it for a while after you see it
<START> the best thing about is the dialogue like scream and i know what you did last summer this movie is <UNK> of the conventions of this type of horror movie and manages to come up with a few good lines and scenes that play on those conventions unfortunately is just boring the plot is your basic ten little indians <UNK> with a monster controlled by one of the suspects victims you know from the beginning that each of the characters will get <UNK> off until only the hero is left to defeat the evil and this is exactly what happens absolutely no surprises and no tension production values and acting were ok but i had no motivation to watch to the end although i did because i already knew how the end scene would play out the ending did surprise me a bit because it managed to <UNK> out literally instead of throwing out a bucket of special effects maybe the special effects budget had been spent up by the end
<START> now that i have seen it it was not what i was expecting at least not until the very end i read some of the other reviews before picking up a used copy of this from amazon and was glad i did having been first introduced to <UNK> work via <UNK> i was curious to how he'd treat the genre and was rather pleased at the clever manner in which he executed it i think park has <UNK> in terms of presentation because while <UNK> and some of his other work has very nice and deliberate camera work he has some nice <UNK> in that i had not seen in other <UNK> movies for example the scene where father is realizing the beast growing within him as he gives his shoes to the always <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and he is able to see the blood <UNK> through <UNK> skin and his <UNK> <UNK> in blood lust for it that was a nice effect i was also happy that park did not cg the crap out of the movie and the is in fact very little cg at all i came away from being totally set up to think one thing was going to happen and get taken for a ride in true park fashion additionally i liked that park played with a little symbolism and <UNK> whereas we don't usually get this is asia cinema during the beginning of the movie we see the plot develop slowly and get to know the characters and you feel like an invisible <UNK> to the thing that are <UNK> park treats you a little like ghost of christmas future coming to show you albeit a bit <UNK> what life is like outside your world ah but then we start to feel a little <UNK> with the <UNK> father and his <UNK> lust for <UNK> <UNK> and conflict with duty as a priest we almost start to root for them even until park not so nicely <UNK> us back into reality and we really see that in the end is a movie about moral dilemma and right and wrong it won't spoil it if i tell you to watch from the mindset of a priest and i think you'll come away from it with what park wants you to come away with don't expect <UNK> and <UNK> because that's not what you'll get here a very interesting take on the genre indeed those who missed the many literary elements and religious <UNK> watched some other movie not after watch let the right one in it's also not what you'll expect either
<START> basic structure of a story beginning middle end br br sometimes this structure is played with and we get <UNK> or <UNK> and the story plays backwards sometimes it's just not linear a la pulp fiction regardless they all have a beginning middle and end br br this is the first film i have ever seen that doesn't have an end br br beginning girl's best friend is <UNK> br br middle girl needs to cope without best friend br br end non existent br br not that having an end would've saved this film but at least it would have been complete br br it's an exercise in <UNK> we get a party mix of characters and they all turn out to be <UNK> boring vain vapid and <UNK> <UNK> of people br br and here's the action within this film nothing happens nothing at all happens <UNK> barton tries to talk with a <UNK> english accent <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a lot and brad receives a blow job from some old guy end of movie br br by the time the credits rolled i had a horrible feeling that many prisoners must feel periods of time those precious minutes of our life have just been wasted br br the only passable point and that is a very <UNK> only is brad he acts well <UNK> <UNK> i tend to like but no luck here due to good work in other films i will forgive <UNK> barton this travesty but i hope all cast members were slapped in the face for their involvement br br please i <UNK> you avoid don't fool yourself into thinking i'll make up my own mind my sister told me to never see this and i ignored her wanting to make up my own mind that was a bad decision br br i have never hated a film there are many i don't like but i have never hated a film until i saw this
<START> <UNK> was the very first movie my parents ever took me to see even at the tender age of 5 years i was so greatly moved by the drama that i cried <UNK> at the screen crown please don't take <UNK> i was fortunate enough to see the one tv broadcast of <UNK> so many years ago and now all i have are the great memories and the record album to remember this wonderful wonderful movie i have been waiting and wishing and hoping that one day i might own a copy of <UNK> but it doesn't look like it will happen what is the hold up obviously there is enough public interest in this movie to warrant a release after all these years i remember it and it sure seems like i'm not alone this movie is <UNK> with human emotion jealousy lust anger bravery determination <UNK> is a buried gem that deserves to be brought forth into the light for a new audience to admire and an old audience to <UNK>
<START> i found this robin williams vehicle mildly amusing at best i guess you would call it a political satire of sorts it's about a political talk show host comedian who decides to run for president and unexpectedly wins i found most of the humour dry myself and robin williams is much more restrained and <UNK> than usual i would say the movie is more of a drama than a comedy with a bit of mystery and suspense i think the dramatic parts worked better than the comedy parts and the mystery and suspense aspect though that's a small part of the movie worked the best still i wouldn't rate this movie very high for me it was an ok waste of 2 hours but nothing special my best advice would be to catch it on tv cable or rent it cheap first before making a decision on whether to purchase my vote for man of the year is a 4 10
<START> an unusual film for an audience outside the usa lena <UNK> looks fabulous and so does ralph cooper there is not added background of tap steps as in other musicals so you do not hear the beat of the <UNK> which is great realism music is muted to hear what dancing steps there are acting is a little stilted and the casts speak slowly so that you think the movie is older than it is costumes are daring for the time in the dance routines at the end often feels like you are part of an audience at a stage show what furniture you see is very modern which adds to the movies feeling of other <UNK> a must for all film buffs
<START> not as bad as <UNK> nails where hopper plays an unstable cop but pretty bad how can a movie with such a great cast go so wrong this film manages to find a way the story was pretty stupid and <UNK> direction seemed like he had never directed before all of the long shots in the beginning were <UNK> lots of meaningless scenes with a lot of meaningless dialogue
<START> i was able to see a preview of this movie through pre screening program and let me tell you this movie is unbelievably good i have seen many movies but few have made me laugh so sincerely or talk about the movie afterward as much as this one i had a decent respect for <UNK> d before seeing the movie and now i am mad about them i will most definitely buy their album when it is released on the <UNK> and will see this movie again br br if you were on the fence about seeing this movie get off and go see it it is worth the extremely expensive price of movie tickets these days as you will surely bust a nut laughing during the whole thing br br aside from the comedy the glorious and divine music that flows from guitar and voice is awe inspiring the audience is left in a <UNK> that such beautiful <UNK> and amazing <UNK> can be created in <UNK> with such ridiculous and hilarious lyrics if for nothing other than the music itself this movie is worth the price of admission br br with a wonderfully coherent storyline <UNK> in almost all aspects of the traditional d history and <UNK> great new songs hilarious comedy and some pretty awesome cameos this movie ranks up there with the best go see it
<START> <UNK> down to south park is a <UNK> long documentary about south park with interviews with <UNK> parker and matt stone and all the other people who work on south park there really isn't much to say it shows the history of south park and what it takes to make one episode it is basically a behind the scenes of the show it shows the different <UNK> that south park has made it was really comedy central who put it out it also shows the controversy which was caused by south park it shows plenty of funny clips from the show as well it's a fairly funny documentary any fan of south park should check this out you can find it on youtube br br 9 10
<START> edward <UNK> is a rare film coming from the hollywood of the 1940s this was groundbreaking territory for mr and the studio because of what the director and his <UNK> john paxton decided to do with the novel in which the film is based br br if you haven't seen the film please stop reading now br br richard brooks novel was about the killing of a gay soldier in the movie the subject matter was turned around to prejudice against jews a theme that was taboo during that time in the american cinema it's to mr credit to have had the courage to get involved with this film project at all br br the movie is an outstanding piece of film making because the way the director presents it obviously influenced by the film noir style we are taken to the washington of the post war the opening scene about the brutal murder of shows such unusual cruelty being inflicted to a decent man who we don't know yet or why has been killed but who didn't deserve to die in such horrible fashion br br the basis of the murder is prejudice pure and simple we realize how in the mind of an ignorant man the mere fact of being successful and different plays in the mind of the assassin stands as the <UNK> <UNK> the same way the gay soldier is the victim in the novel the parallels are well drawn br br this film makes compelling viewing because of the brilliant star turn of robert ryan as <UNK> mr ryan was an actor that always played interesting roles but never so well as in <UNK> also there is a great appearance by gloria <UNK> as <UNK> the prostitute with her heart in the right place br br the rest of the cast play as an ensemble robert young as the police detective in charge of the investigation plays is a decent man who has known prejudice first hand in his own family and speaks <UNK> against it robert mitchum plays a cool sgt who is deeply touched by the crime when one of his men is accused of committing it sam <UNK> is excellent in his small role of br br this is a film to watch because of it probably the first to speak out loud against ignorance
<START> what's there to say about pink <UNK> it is beyond criticism or even explanation because it doesn't really <UNK> to be like any other movie you've seen you will either get it or you won't laugh at it or roll your eyes in disgust or both john waters is an odd filmmaker putting that mildly mixing both innocent <UNK> humor with shockingly offensive moments intended to well who knows what his intentions were it is like a form of assault albeit a funny one br br the thing that makes humor so <UNK> and effective is that his characters inhabit a world that can seem both alien and completely familiar to the viewer like the petty <UNK> that form the plot of pink <UNK> surely everyone has experienced this kind of thing at some point but almost certainly the matter at stake was not the title of the <UNK> person alive what makes the movie compelling viewing for me is the way that waters creates <UNK> self contained <UNK> and doesn't let you in on the joke right away the people in his films are completely in tune with one another for instance when <UNK> tells <UNK> that she doesn't want to <UNK> her into town because <UNK> is bringing his lady friend out to the trailer <UNK> <UNK> with a knowing <UNK> and says to her in a <UNK> aside that little just perfect at this point we do not know yet that <UNK> plans to take his lady friend out to the shed to thrust live <UNK> at her naked body while <UNK> watches through a window but this weirdness is totally <UNK> and understood by the characters in the <UNK> world that waters creates br br another example would be the conversations between the girls in the basement and <UNK> the <UNK> butler the first time we see them waters cuts <UNK> from a scene in <UNK> <UNK> office to <UNK> <UNK> into the basement where we see that there are two women down there one dead and one very much alive and p ed off susan is not a <UNK> victim but is <UNK> and abusive to <UNK> <UNK> up to launch a full scale verbal attack on her <UNK> they both have a weird understanding of the bizarre situation and she is not so much <UNK> by her kidnapping as she is violently insulted and <UNK> furious she does not let up for one second while <UNK> is in her sight and the two scenes that feature their delirious banter are two of the comic highlights of the film later in the film when divine and <UNK> break into the home and discover their crimes of keeping <UNK> women in their basement it represents the total lack of support that divine and her family have for the brand of <UNK> that the <UNK> are <UNK> here is something divine is unfamiliar with a corruption <UNK> by her <UNK> rivals and she <UNK> it furthermore while kidnapping does not seem like something divine would think twice about she is <UNK> that the girls are being held down there and happily sets them free <UNK> the revenge that they take on <UNK> br br at the other end of the filth spectrum waters occasionally reminds us of the line between his twisted fantasy world and the real world the first time we see connie she is <UNK> a minor character named sandy who has never heard of divine cookie on the other hand <UNK> with a hilariously matter of fact <UNK> of title as the <UNK> person alive revealing that she <UNK> this world of <UNK> and understood <UNK> as well br br something also must be said for the way the players are in touch with their respective roles especially divine who doesn't miss a note not once does he <UNK> in the ridiculous <UNK> and character he's been given and it takes pink <UNK> to a new level or weirdness people actually believed divine was like this in real life and it's easy to understand why because while watching the movie you're not really thinking about the movie you're thinking about these people who made it since they're really doing the outrageous things in the script you start to think that maybe this is not a story but a bizarre documentary br br but even more so pink <UNK> is not so much a movie as it is an event or something that happens to you even though its shock value is mostly gone for me now i say mostly because the a hole scene and the chicken scene still make me <UNK> i still find this film to be hilarious and habit <UNK>
<START> as was mentioned before in other comments the major problem of <UNK> is that it cannot decide what it wants to be slapstick of the <UNK> kind or an honest parody of the east german army there are a couple of moments which are quite moving for example when one of the <UNK> returns from the army prison in with a completely broken personality but in the end <UNK> goes for the <UNK> humour no wonder the film <UNK> at the german box office as it's historically <UNK> to the real situation in those training camps and led by an actor who is unfortunately incapable of giving a nuanced performance br br however there is the camera work of frank who as always does a wonderful job if it wasn't for his beautiful images i would have rated the film far worse
<START> i wouldn't exactly call this a good movie in fact it might even be a bad one br br but there are at least 2 good reasons to keep watching this movie those are the performances from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and jonathan jackson eric whom both deliver solid performances br br they are much better then the rest of the cast whom are pretty bad especially <UNK> <UNK> cousin br br <UNK> <UNK> was excellent in the suburban kids goes to the hood drama havoc but here she's far from good on the edge to being annoying br br the story is decent enough although nothing special but it would have been much better since it takes place in that any of the kids actually <UNK> a down south accent but they don't br br especially in a movie where the monster is actually <UNK> so deeply into the folk <UNK> with voodoo and such it's just plain stupidity not to include that accent into the characters br br the only one who does this is <UNK> method man he plays deputy turner and puts down a pretty good accent in his few scenes and i mean if a <UNK> is able to do this then why shouldn't the actors be able to do the same mister aka <UNK> is highly enjoyable in his very very small role who know the <UNK> would ever be a cop even if only on the big screen br br anyways besides that it's a pretty stupid but fairly enjoyable slasher movie but if <UNK> and jackson was as bad as the rest of the young cast this could have been really bad thankfully they are good as usual br br 4 5 out of 10 decent but there are hundreds of better slasher movies out there
<START> what a frustrating movie a small southern town is <UNK> with possibilities for exploring the <UNK> of <UNK> relationships and dark hidden beneath <UNK> <UNK> as anyone who has read anything by carson <UNK> already knows this does none of that instead the writers settled for <UNK> cheap warm <UNK> and banal melodrama the thing looks like a made for tv movie and was directed with no particular distinction but it's hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interesting br br the most frustrating aspect though is the fact that there are a lot of extremely competent and appealing actors in this cast all trying <UNK> to make the best of things and do what they can with this well there's no other word for it drivel a tragic waste of talent in particular that of the great <UNK> <UNK>
<START> <UNK> molly <UNK> self <UNK> lousy <UNK> jimmy stewart is having a bad marriage to carole lombard after falling on hard times he <UNK> a <UNK> job a fault finding passive aggressive over bearing live in mother who is in dire need of an epic <UNK> and an endlessly crying baby the movie on failure and <UNK> to no discernible end do you want to watch a couple <UNK> with his mom for ninety minutes many scenes feature a <UNK> baby the movie fails to <UNK> why we would want to endure the mother from hell or why jimmy stewart can't grow a pair who wanted to see this who wanted to see stewart and lombard without laughs or charm br br it's absolutely depressing and <UNK>
<START> this movie's one <UNK> quality besides barely there <UNK> is the hilarious acting on the part of the bad guy this wonderfully <UNK> villain has a certain oh shakespearean presence that made this movie bearable hence the 2 i just <UNK> every time he <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> to henchman or hero a true example of someone not getting paid enough and that beard br br now really what was with the 12 minute hang <UNK> scene really really really bad i can't emphasize that point enough br br so seriously if you even <UNK> to see this movie watch the mystery science theater 3000 version with those dear <UNK> has many a horrendous movie been <UNK>
<START> i actually though that black snake <UNK> was great movie which takes place in the south the story follows a man named <UNK> whose wife <UNK> him for his brother and finds <UNK> abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road <UNK> finds out that <UNK> is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by <UNK> up <UNK> with a chain to cure her of her <UNK> samuel l jackson and christina <UNK> have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that <UNK> and <UNK> become best friends i was also amazed by <UNK> ability to play an electric guitar and being able to sing s is great as love interest angela justin timberlake plays boyfriend <UNK> who is underused in the film but does the best that he can to deliver a fine performance
<START> a wide variety of snakes stage an <UNK> on tourists <UNK> their island due their <UNK> boat damage the few remaining survivors who aren't caught vulnerable by the snakes will attempt an escape mission their goal to flee to available <UNK> which can get them safely off the island br br presented straight faced with <UNK> doses of visual humor featuring lots of snake gags wayne <UNK> snake island features plenty of different <UNK> of the <UNK> in striking position ready to attack their prey star william <UNK> as an author <UNK> snakes for a <UNK> novel has fun in his role along with writer director co star wayne crawford as the tourist boat captain as put upon heroes who stare down a most serious crisis kate connor is <UNK> attractive love interest a lawyer on vacation the other cast members serve as either tourists or crew mostly fodder for the snakes br br as in many other movies of this type director crawford features live snakes with computer generated ones and the violence is really tame crawford even <UNK> the point of view technique with the camera as the eyes of the snake as it faces the potential victim with the actor looking directly into the camera never to be taken seriously the tongue in cheek approach was probably the best way to shoot snake island because the premise is just too ridiculous to accept on it's own br br the effects and suspense scenes rarely work because crawford is often unable to successfully stage the sequences where humans face off with the snakes the snake attacks themselves also never happen on screen one or two tops or are so <UNK> presented they leave little impression that's a no no for a genre such as this fans of <UNK> will probably want to check it out because he does provide some facial comedy that <UNK> the overall tone of certain scenes where he must defend himself against the snakes the cgi scenes where we see a large number of snakes in a general area aren't very effective which remove the realism crawford <UNK> attempted to establish there are plenty of better horror films featuring snakes as the <UNK> than snake island surprising moments of nudity <UNK> to a scene where the tourists and crew <UNK> after a long day with the <UNK> not knowing what danger lie ahead
<START> might contain spoilers br br this is just a good movie lots of good silly stuff to laugh at however do not watch the tv version they cut to much out dom <UNK> is rather awesome as the mafia don who is hired to kill robin all i can say about his ten minutes it's a long drive from jersey also you gotta love them checking the script to make sure robin gets another shot also <UNK> century fox br br any bad stuff the <UNK> at the beginning and the end seem rather out dated the songs were rather lame one time while watching this movie i could think out a few more times when they could have thrown in another joke or 2 br br on the whole however an enjoyable movie experience a must watch for comedy fans
<START> after having seen this show a few times i am thoroughly offended as a female that there are so many stupid women out there that fall for this <UNK> im a little more mature than some of the players in this show but am still appalled that the whole dating game has been boiled down to a <UNK> where goofy <UNK> can score points on their lame ass attempts to pick up chicks if young guys are watching this and using it as a learning <UNK> don't save yourself the effort and hire a prostitute if all you are after is a piece of ass maybe there are girls out there with the same mind set but some how i don't think so
<START> i took my 14 year old to see this movie we left after 15 or 20 minutes it was absolutely awful this movie should be rated r at the least i am not that strict with movies but this was just too much it was a waste of money i thought it would contain some comedy and i knew the comedy would probably be crude but this was way beyond crude i was sitting there watching and reading a certain <UNK> at the beginning of the movie was what really got me and i could not believe how <UNK> sexual it was i could not believe that it would be ok for a 13 year old to read and see this content i don't understand how the rating system works
<START> <UNK> kurt russell returns from the computer wore <UNK> shoes for a new adventure that can stand alone <UNK> ever the college student prone to <UNK> has an idea for a formula to render things invisible dean <UNK> joe flynn is less than impressed and sets his hopes for winning a <UNK> science prize with the <UNK> studying <UNK> however the <UNK> <UNK> the student and he turns out to be <UNK> there goes that chance for a prize but wait <UNK> does it he actually <UNK> a <UNK> that makes him invisible trouble is a <UNK> businessman <UNK> romero learns about it and decides he can use that formula thank you for something illegal can he manage to steal the bottle out from under <UNK> nose this is a companion movie to the but one need not have seen the first film to enjoy this one russell is a <UNK> leading screw up who comes through when it really counts the rest of the cast is also a dream with flynn romero jim <UNK> and others showing why their comic abilities are still held in high regard today the script is just innocent fun that is charming with the special effects somewhat simple by today's standards but effective nonetheless if you want to sit down and <UNK> a <UNK> era or just want to share a quality g rated film with your family this is a great choice although it is over 30 years old there is a great possibility that even now you will see your loved ones giggle away the blues with a showing of this fine flick
<START> this movie was terrible the plot was terrible and unbelievable i cannot recommend this movie where did this movie come from this movie was not funny and wasted the talent of some great actors and actresses including gary <UNK> kathy bates joey lauren adams and jennifer <UNK>

<START> this is a very low budget film set in one location in a valley <UNK> by the effects of radiation the cast an older man and daughter a handsome visitor a couple a tough buy and gal a drifter a <UNK> and a radiation affected man interact during the after effects of a nuclear blast added to this is an <UNK> watching the women take a bath br br they all have guns some of them get shot some of them are told to have children others are murdered and others just drift away and well this is the movie harvey first film it shows a certain simplicity in movie making to avoid expensive sets actors go through <UNK> to enter and exit the house ie the studio the location shots filmed in the hills near hollywood are the backdrop br br i would not say this is worth going out of your way to see but interesting to see how movies with human subjects were made in the 50s
<START> the 20th animated disney classic is often criticized by many people as mediocre or poor in quality but it is a great movie br br too bad that the <UNK> doesn't get the deserved credit i personally see it as one of my favorite disney classics br br despite being extremely underrated it is one of the funniest disney classics it is full of hilarious some of them hysterical moments br br edgar the greedy butler is the villain of the movie but he is a perfect comic relief he's one of my favorite disney villains because he is so funny br br every scene with edgar and the <UNK> dogs <UNK> and <UNK> chasing him are among the most hilarious you'll ever see especially the one when edgar drives his motorcycle into the river and around the bridge with the dogs chasing him that is hysterical br br but the classic humor doesn't just come from edgar or the <UNK> dogs other characters have their moments as well br br about the quality subject it isn't perfect but remains on a high level even after walt disney's death those artists knew how to keep faithful to <UNK> spirit and the <UNK> is one of those examples they don't make them like this nowadays br br as usual legendary disney actors voice the characters in this case we have phil harris sterling <UNK> paul eva <UNK> and pat br br the characters are cool in general thomas <UNK> and her 3 <UNK> the mouse the alley cats the english <UNK> the <UNK> dogs and the horse the human characters are included as well the eccentric and kind retired opera singer <UNK> <UNK> the comic old lawyer georges and edgar himself br br about the soundtrack it has some nice and catchy songs such as thomas theme but i can't remember its name everybody wants to be a cat and the <UNK> sung by maurice <UNK> for example br br this movie takes place in paris france in the year of <UNK> above all this is a <UNK> nice and very pleasant movie a timeless classic which is often <UNK> and forgotten but very worthy br br this should definitely be on top 250
<START> an apt description by spock of an all powerful <UNK> into whose <UNK> fall the crew of the enterprise this was one <UNK> of space our starship should have avoided first <UNK> kirk simply disappear off the bridge a landing party follows them to the surface of an unknown planet and encounter a seemingly <UNK> man dressed in <UNK> from an earth of many centuries past but he demonstrates abilities of someone or something far beyond human and doesn't register on <UNK> medical the officers manage to escape back to the ship but like some bad <UNK> penny keeps popping up he brings them all back including some female <UNK> to continue his games the dilemma now takes on elements of 'the most dangerous <UNK> out in space and there's an <UNK> even <UNK> aspect to the <UNK> utter <UNK> before such <UNK> power br br what really makes this a great episode is the memorable performance by guest star campbell as the <UNK> but not all knowing alien his character is obviously an early version of q who was introduced 20 years later in the pilot for the <UNK> series confrontation scene with spock stands out among all the strange drama which unfolds as usual kirk quickly begins to look for possible weaknesses in his new nemesis despite being quite <UNK> the answers to exactly what or who is are right in front of us the whole time so when we do learn the truth it makes complete sense in view of <UNK> pitch perfect acting he <UNK> himself constantly <UNK> before some unknown audience <UNK> on things with a flair which is <UNK> but not quite right we can't quite pin it down at first but there's something missing here every few minutes his tone becomes sinister and the crew now appears to be in serious danger in a way you can't take your eyes off him always waiting to see what he does next actor john de <UNK> captured that similar tone as q on the next generation series
<START> i love this young people trapped in a house of horrors movie not just because i'm a huge <UNK> <UNK> jill fan but because it is a lot of fun and actually scary at times br br the special effects are awesome especially scene with the <UNK> and towards the end when almost everyone is dead and possessed br br plenty of nudity provided by <UNK> and jill plenty of humor cool soundtrack high body count etc by the way if you have never seen this one try and buy watch the <UNK> version which has more gore and some scenes the rated version is missing
<START> i'm a collector of films starring ms weaver so i bought this only because of her being in it i find it really odd that her early career is filled with so many awful movies she started with incredible promise in alien but then had a slew of bombs these bombs include this movie deal of the century one woman or two and half moon street she also appeared in the year of living dangerously which was not a bomb but her performance was less than notable in the time between alien and it's 1986 sequel aliens the only movie she did that was worth anything was <UNK> before the release of aliens i'm sure everyone thought this woman was on her way out luckily she wasn't br br back to <UNK> though the film is boring it doesn't create any suspense william hurt seems like a cardboard stand in and the atmosphere is just to dry <UNK> is decent but nothing worth remembering br br watch this movie if you must but don't go in with any expectations of a decent movie watch better movies with these two stars like accidental tourist and working girl
<START> the producer matt stumbled upon the film's subject anderson <UNK> leader of the music movement when on a <UNK> foundation trip to <UNK> de <UNK> was so moved by story that he called his friend nyc filmmaker jim <UNK> who quit his job and joined in brazil to work on a documentary on <UNK> <UNK> and the culture of violence br br the first part of the film shows you the culture of violence in <UNK> <UNK> where the poor live via footage of police <UNK> and <UNK> on the residents the footage is graphic and shocking br br rising from the <UNK> of the <UNK> is the charismatic anderson <UNK> who <UNK> a possible career in drug dealing to start the movement which combines elements of <UNK> brazilian culture <UNK> <UNK> and other elements into a fast paced <UNK> heavy style of music which has since spread to other parts of the world you can't help but be carried away by the music especially when you see the local children get involved in school which he <UNK> to keep kids out of drug gangs the rest of the film follows <UNK> rise and his <UNK> changes many of the children's lives to seek a life beyond drug running spoiler just when the filmmakers thought they had wrapped filming an unbelievable life changing event occurs of which the resolution has to be seen to be believed the film then continues and you are <UNK> in your seat until the end br br this film is a response to city of god and a worthy one at that the bleak situation portrayed in that movie is <UNK> by a real example of how <UNK> can overcome the dire situation they are in and use their resources to <UNK> ends you can't help not liking and rooting for anderson <UNK> to succeed br br this film is <UNK> shot fast paced and is quite absorbing judging by the overwhelming response of the audience at last <UNK> screening the film should get domestic distribution in the us and the <UNK> soundtrack should be released as well keep an eye for this <UNK> documentary it is excellent
<START> this film was basically set up for failure by the studio one anne rice author of the book offered to write the screen play but was refused by the studio two they tried to stuff 2 in depth novels in to a <UNK> movie br br i maintain the only way for these two books vampire <UNK> and queen of the damned to work in a live action form would be through a mini series first off the the vampire <UNK> alone takes place from the <UNK> to the 1980's and has a <UNK> of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character <UNK> the entire book vampire <UNK> sets up the events of the second part queen of the damned without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyed br br <UNK> was not cruel and vicious to all he was not wanting to go along with plans <UNK> did not make <UNK> <UNK> did not love jesse or make her <UNK> could not go remain <UNK> by the light <UNK> was not after david nor the other way around every character was completely represented wrong basically same names different story br br if they wanted to make a vampire movie fine even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels fine but don't back into the theaters off the success of <UNK> great novels and characters just to destroy what her loyal readers have come to love br br if you haven't read the books you won't understand the film really if you have read the books you will be insulted that being said i am such a huge fan i had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it catch 22 must see it will hate it
<START> this should have been a short film nothing more the length of 1 5 hours is much too long because after 10 minutes you have seen almost every joke it's getting more and more on your nerves <UNK> you finally kick out your brain to endure that movie br br to do yourself a favor don't mention to see that movie
<START> this is an excellent little known movie tom <UNK> does an outstanding job of acting in this movie with the japanese i'd love to see if this movie has come out on dvd yet there are some spots that clearly have been cut <UNK> love interest has clearly had some parts chopped it would be interesting to see more of japan in the film the baseball sequences are far and away the most realistic of any baseball movie i'm quite sure most of the actors were current or former baseball players i love <UNK> the tape of this movie at least once a year best scenes involve the lack of hat <UNK> after tom gets in the big game and an intensely sensual scene of tom having a hot bath with dennis <UNK> also does a great job it's good to see he's finally getting some recognition not just in baseball movies he was also in major league
<START> after watching <UNK> which was decent only because of the very nice digital fx and several anime films written by <UNK> including <UNK> <UNK> which is fantastic i decided i should check out the <UNK> cinema trilogy box set being that the red <UNK> and stray dog are related i will comment here on both and let me tell you it was one of the biggest wastes of money i have spent in a while i first watched stray dogs and then the red <UNK> i am sad to say that these films are quite possibly the most boring two movies i have ever seen for only about 10 minutes in each film do you get to see some action between the the characters who are only dressed in the cop outfits for a few fleeting scenes the rest of the time you will see some very drawn out scenes filled with boring dialogue in some less than impressive locations i really don't understand the motivation behind these two films at all i love the wolf <UNK> outfits and the idea behind the plot but the films themselves leave much to be desired i would suggest not watching these films and certainly do not buy the box set like i did unless you enjoy wasting money oh and if you are wondering what i think about the 3rd movie in the set talking head i couldn't even bring myself to watch it before i <UNK> the box set from my dvd collection via ebay at a 20 loss if you want cool japanese live action check out or <UNK> the killer or the series
<START> teenage exorcist is one of those god awful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent entertainment for low brow sexual antics adolescent humour and empty writing this film delivers exactly what its was trying to deliver it is about a girl moving into a house where a baron de <UNK> hmmm once lived and finally being drawn to him through her own inner demon her sister and brother in law along with an irish priest her boyfriend and a pizza delivery boy try to save her and <UNK> her demon well not much here in way of horror or suspense in fact one line from the film pretty much sums up what to expect mike the girl's brother in law has tied her the name is diane by the way and she is played by <UNK> stevens up after trying to chainsaw her sister he <UNK> a gag from her mouth and says something like this won't be the last gag we see tonight indeed it was not the special effects are cheesy and poorly crafted and the film makes use of this by playing on its comedic appeal some of the lines and situations are funny robert <UNK> old count <UNK> himself really steals his scenes as an irish priest he <UNK> it up <UNK> biblical <UNK> and <UNK> irish songs you know you are in trouble however when eddie gets top billing does his <UNK> and has a couple nice moments as well but the material is just too <UNK> than to be anything more than teenage <UNK> time filler michael <UNK> from the hills have eyes also has a brief but interesting cameo in the film as for the other <UNK> well they are all pretty good at being pretty mediocre stevens is lovely in <UNK> <UNK> and french cut <UNK> but beyond that don't expect too much more from her her sister is played by <UNK> and she shows a bit more than <UNK> a very lovely young lady by the way and out acts <UNK> by miles her husband played by jay richardson shows off his ability to act and be funny amidst mediocrity again not a bad film to waste a little time that involves no thinking on if you are a robert <UNK> fan watch it for his performance at the very least
<START> you're dead is an <UNK> awful attempt at a british gangster film it has not got a single original idea in it being an atrocious copy of various elements of lock stock two smoking <UNK> the usual suspects and pulp fiction the acting and dialogue are absolutely excruciating the plot is ludicrous and utterly predictable despite constant attempts at plot twists and contains nothing but one dimensional stock characters and clichés it has some good actors in it but they are off form and unable to do anything much with the dreadful material they are working with it is absolute torture to sit through this drivel
<START> that this movie has been <UNK> to the wall of a <UNK> as proof that god is truly dead am i the only one that really saw rather through this film this is the only movie i've ever seen in the theater that i regret not walking out on and demanding my money back it was just that dull and i even saw <UNK> 2 the at the local cinema from beginning to end gibson and downey have absolutely no chemistry as two cast together by <UNK> who eventually work together as best buddies the action what little there is is goofy and as dull as the of the writer thank whatever <UNK> is down at us as it <UNK> our cinema that there's no chance for an air america 2
<START> this was on odd film i liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children spoiler ahead ironically the main character murders a federal official then he's a fugitive on the run they later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly br br this was on odd film i liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children spoiler ahead ironically the main character murders a federal official then he's a fugitive on the run they later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly
<START> this movie was great don't understand the <UNK> it <UNK> i first scene this in like <UNK> <UNK> and it was actually scary if you are an 80's horror fan you should have no problem with this film it has everything that makes 80's horror great i got to meet a few of the actor's and they were cool what is not great about a creepy old house demons crazy party horny good looking young people the dialog and the special fx made this movie a classic this film also took care of one of those classic rumors about horror the black guy does not <UNK> have to die in the end even though this movie was great there is one thing that remains <UNK> to me what really happened to the old couple at the end was it on purpose or not that little side story thing <UNK> had me puzzled
<START> stars robert mitchum as a world weary private eye <UNK> the case of a missing <UNK> mike <UNK> he is hired by <UNK> smith the anxious wife of the missing man what <UNK> fails to inform mitchum is that she knows full well her husband's <UNK> after all she was the one who helped her lover james <UNK> <UNK> of her wealthy <UNK> br br what more would expect from a rotten slasher film with robert mitchum <UNK> goes western monkeys are abused models lean against classic cars and smith is constantly <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> until a giallo style wrap up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end this is bad cinema and this movie is <UNK> poor it makes it look like halloween mixed up with trick or treats avoid this br br rated r for graphic violence nudity and sexual situations
<START> when i finally got around to seeing this film recently it turned out to be exactly what it looked like to me at first glance yet another hollywood cg live action rehash of an established cartoon franchise nothing special or memorable whatsoever designed in every way possible to appeal to very young children and very immature adults making heavy use of comedic devices such as <UNK> poo eating and the size of <UNK> butt br br this film would bother me a lot less if it weren't such an obvious step down for the <UNK> even their characters i found were changed for the worse for this movie while in the past each one of them had a very distinct personality here they all <UNK> like immature smart <UNK> children with add constantly <UNK> <UNK> off the walls it especially bothered me to see simon portrayed in this way he's supposed to be the smart serious nerd who acts as the straight man to <UNK> crazy antics but here he's pretty much a <UNK> copy of alvin one joke in the film even implies that simon only thinks he's smart but really isn't and honestly if i had never heard of the <UNK> before seeing this film i would have agreed br br in my opinion this film is just another obvious cash grab and i'm more than a little sorry it was even made the fact that it's a kid's movie doesn't excuse its flaws to excuse a stupid movie that <UNK> a classic franchise just because it's for children is insulting to children and any kid would deserve something more intelligent than this film
<START> i don't understand the exaggerated good critics about this film except that a lot of people from <UNK> are understandably very excited based on that the <UNK> cinema is really a bit behind of what other countries are in the region br br the movie first of all is too repetitive a lot of scenes are almost identical from each of the both leading roles so you get the impression that it's a time filler a time filler is also a good point as this movie is definitely too long with <UNK> minutes you will start to get tired after a while and watch on the clock br br all actors are quite bad by exception of the <UNK> guy edgar <UNK> who brings in a bit of slapstick and plays the role of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br by the way this is not a representative movie about the people of the region <UNK> zone it tends to <UNK> them
<START> my friend took me to a screening of this movie in hollywood and it was awesome it's a film noir with amazing acting great script cool music the whole thing was very well done and entertaining don't know if it is getting a release in theaters but this would be a great date movie or a fun movie to rent if you see it at blockbuster this is the kind of movie i love low on budget but big on style and imagination i hope alexandra <UNK> gets more big parts like she has in this one she is fantastic
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> got and roughly jam them together and what do you got this god awful movie <UNK> made for dull normal <UNK> the plot very closely follows <UNK> got served ' three ghetto <UNK> this time living in john <UNK> far from their time getting failing <UNK> in high school and dancing in <UNK> 100 year old buildings with <UNK> to <UNK> their expensive <UNK> hip hop clothing tastes they steal cars and deliver them to the local chop unlike john tony travolta who worked in a brooklyn paint store so he could purchase his <UNK> disco clothes br br tyler gage one of the black three <UNK> gets caught <UNK> the local fame high school and is forced to perform <UNK> duties he meets nora clark a 26 year old white high school student and discovers he's irish american much to the <UNK> of his black buddies mac and skinny br br as in <UNK> got crime doesn't pay and skinny the youngest member of the trio gets shot by a bad bad <UNK> brown that doesn't stop the heart stopping finale
<START> this <UNK> is very similar to modern disney cartoons soulless technically good and the usual in jokes for adults maybe it's because this is the first cartoon i watched after laputa castle in the sky but it was quite disappointing br br the plot is contrived and forgettable but it involves <UNK> and going to the territory to rescue a <UNK> teenager who then learns <UNK> and finds love as well oh and initially they don't get on but after facing <UNK> they all share a deep bond of friendship <UNK> <UNK> br br the best bit is to watch out for the little jokes the <UNK> get all the best ones such as the <UNK> wife giving a list of furniture and <UNK> to bring back from the next raid or the <UNK> not knowing the meaning of mercy literally oh and <UNK> the dumbest <UNK> is actually hilarious as much for the voice acting as the dialogue br br for example aboard the <UNK> ship after a speech by <UNK> the <UNK> daughter <UNK> who is this new guy captain that's my daughter <UNK> brain <UNK> your daughter's a man
<START> this is one of my most favorite movies of all time pretty pathetic you say well yeah it is but chris is incredibly incredibly funny his innocent brilliance comes out in this film more than in any of his other films look at both motel scenes when spade gets caught with his <UNK> down and the other just go away for the love of god
<START> so totally unique and entertaining another great canadian invention a regular joe dan and a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> aka puppets all share <UNK> at a half way house its <UNK> job to keep an eye on four to <UNK> and help them to <UNK> bill the homicidal <UNK> the cigarette smoking dog buttons the <UNK> teddy bear and <UNK> the comfort doll the five of them find themselves in all sorts of odd <UNK> despite their homicidal and often overtly perverse sexual <UNK> it's hard not to find them lovable br br i give this show a 10 10 simply because it provides good entertainment without needing a huge budget and exudes a canadian flair that makes me proud
<START> i found this to be an entertaining account of the challenges an independent film maker might encounter something i never even thought about the film managed to keep my interest the entire time and i actually laughed out loud more than once i'm not a film maker so i know nothing about the technology but i though it was well edited and <UNK> smoothly telling the story as a <UNK> i contributed to this effort after the fact providing music for the soundtrack but i was not involved in the creation of this film and i could not tell you a thing about <UNK> man except that i remembered seeing it way back when i'm not really a sci fi fiend i enjoyed the comparisons the film made of punk rock file making to punk rock music my wife went with me to see the film and she did not know a thing about it before hand and we had a great time
<START> on the scale of 1 to 10 i gave this a 4 i thought the film was not very good with too much violence and not one character to like br br on an erotic scale i give this a 6 many of the sex scenes were <UNK> with an underlying <UNK> i always enjoy nudity and nancy travis and faye grant come through but the sex scenes were more <UNK> than erotic
<START> bad bad movie when i saw the synopsis i was expecting something like ring only with video game instead of tape nothing of the sorts happened i'll admit idea is interesting and could be turned into a good movie but this is not it br br first of all choosing real life person <UNK> is stupid move that adds absolutely nothing to the story anybody even vaguely familiar with her story would begin to wonder why and how did this hungarian end up in this movie choosing a generic vengeful spirit would be much much better br br then there is whole you die in real life as you die in the game concept as i said before interesting ring like story but instead of developing it into good story line it sort of just flows along with no explanation given why did this game became such as it is why it was created and so on waste of good idea br br and finally this movie doesn't even have gory of funny parts that can if not save at least make crappy horror movies watchable death scenes are too quick and acting is too wooden to be funny br br avoid if possible
<START> being featured at the 2006 cannes film festival and gaining quite some fame this movie appears to be another modern and profound school drama br br it's about a bunch of <UNK> who get through a revealing and desperate day at school <UNK> <UNK> around a suicide shown at the very beginning to some extent that happens at 2 the characters are somehow all connected with each other what moves them is described via short interview sequences strictly shot in b w the characters are well written the acting is intriguing especially <UNK> <UNK> as melody and frank sweet as marcus are <UNK> br br let's stick to the <UNK> technique that's what really impressed me there rarely are cuts most of the time the camera follows one of the protagonists like in gus van elephant some scenes are presented more often than once but each time from a different point of view here character this surely evokes a slowly developing but grabbing atmosphere that drags you inside literally the colours are vibrant somehow <UNK> considering the tough plot but that's nothing less than a clever contrast a disturbing fine <UNK> the use of lighting is adequate all the time <UNK> the characters' actual mood and finally there are decent <UNK> of music br br 2 <UNK> somehow <UNK> you from the very beginning it does not compromise nor does it serve laughter it rather strings together what <UNK> would define as terror moments this movie <UNK> focuses on emotional there ain't nobody who's not to handle some kind of <UNK> even the depicted minor parts e g the teachers seem to be in some state of disorder and that is what keeps this movie from being really good its <UNK> up of <UNK> <UNK> is unrealistic to its very bones there is no friendship love smiling truth passion there is <UNK> <UNK> despair sickness and beating up it's like being hit in the face real hard all the time but you are <UNK> after the first hour this flick keeps on hitting you until it reveals something quite <UNK> in the end br br for being <UNK> and superbly acted 9 for being technically innovative and original 9 for being <UNK> 3 br br makes a solid 7 out of 10
<START> takes place in a small japanese rural town where people are going mad they go nuts over and <UNK> the crisis is getting worse because people are turning into <UNK> and appear everywhere has to be one of the most bizarre and original horror movies i have seen the plot is really clever and the gore scenes are really funny as the film doesn't takes itself too seriously is wonderfully photographed and the use of colors is top notch the characters are likeable and there is enough shocking surprises to satisfy fans of japanese horror despite of some hilarious scenes the overall tone of this film is pretty dark is not as good as <UNK> <UNK> on or audition but if you like japanese horror movies you won't be disappointed 7 out of 10
<START> i recently purchased lost horizon on ebay having vivid memories of the things i will not miss number from childhood i am an ancient <UNK> i also recently finished the novel upon which it is based i was so pleasantly surprised to find a genuine hidden treasure a wonderful cast brings such warmth and depth to a beautifully simple and <UNK> told story subtly updated from the original film and by now quite a separate <UNK> to the far more intellectual and thought provoking book by james hilton sally <UNK> in particular has a <UNK> presence as the <UNK> neurotic sally hughes who gradually <UNK> to the charms of <UNK> la only <UNK> <UNK> in her wooden portrayal of the <UNK> a role far more suited to a julie andrews type the fact that <UNK> and <UNK> are all dubbed isn't important as it is almost impossible to tell the songs do <UNK> in quality the music being far superior to the lyrics but it is still a vibrant and engrossing film that really deserves a proper dvd release and a lot more recognition
<START> this so called movie is horrible the actors cannot act there is no plot i believe they need to start from scratch and film again i hope that they can correct the acting flaws in this movie i would like to see the trailer after they shoot it again maybe there is hope for it i am not out to hurt feelings but i believe high school kids can do a better job the wardrobe could have been much better sorry but this just did not do it for me i normally enjoy the trailers from this site but this one i cannot find entertaining i hope they take criticism well because i believe they will get much much more from others in regards to this film
<START> the photography and editing of the movie is exceptional for the time period <UNK> builds upon each scene of the movie leading to the the <UNK> revolt and the massacre at the town as much as the movie is a high point in the cinema it is also an example of realism by <UNK> the soviet government <UNK> used the arts including film as a means to spread the message of the revolution portrayal of the revolt on the <UNK> offers the viewer insight into the message of the soviet elite <UNK> theory and perspectives of class struggle are demonstrated as the sailors who represent the <UNK> workers and the officers who represent the elite of society much of the film demonstrates the communist party message and how film was used as a tool of propaganda
<START> first i must say that i don't speak spanish and usually do not enjoy spanish speaking films but two <UNK> is an exceptional film there is enough action and hard drama that it doesn't matter that its a spanish speaking film the subtitles were easy to read and didn't block the action or the drama br br i would tell fans of spanish speaking films and non fans of spanish speaking films to go see this movie the action and drama are worth every penny br br
<START> but you can see it from here br br i definitely don't understand why anyone would recommend this movie not a bit of plot not suspenseful not well made no point to having made it really br br completely forgettable in ever way
<START> this might be my favorite so bad it's awesome film of all time like many pre teen children of the 80's repeat viewing of revenge of ninja <UNK> a ninja phase of my childhood man i thought sho k was <UNK> back then jet li could him with both legs in a cast this movie has insane <UNK> that include <UNK> the exorcist and the lee van <UNK> ninja tv show ugh but as a friend of mine says anyone can get a good movie made it takes true genius to make a film that starts with a ninja surviving 17 shotgun <UNK> long enough to take over the body of <UNK> to get revenge wow while previous <UNK> have the sword flying out of the closet on the string no one has yet the powerful love scene where the sexy leading man cop takes off his shirt to reveal a <UNK> of the fun never ends rent this
<START> the <UNK> series is an always will be the best vampire movies ever there is something about them that makes them special i think it s the feeling you get when you watch them br br they are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they are set in the <UNK> s or <UNK> s i think it has some thing to do with the set s that are used if so then it s working keep it up guy s br br in a quick round up of what s happened in the first part was supposedly from his home land years ago by his father and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birth <UNK> the blood stone and all his father has so he kill s his father who is played by <UNK> <UNK> the tall man from the phantasm movies and takes the blood stone which has power to who ever has it because who has it need never <UNK> anyone again because the stone is supposedly meant to <UNK> the bloody of the saints and every time the takes a drop from it he is slowly going insane thats all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire <UNK> bad enough well s brother <UNK> try s to put a stop to his evil ways all while trying to stop himself falling with a tourist who is staying at a house <UNK> which belongs to a friend of his br br well one thing leads to another and the two brothers clash and well you will have to see the movie to see what goes on from here on in br br i will review comment on the other sequels soon br br the difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial and this is not so this will not appeal to everyone but this has an atmosphere far superior to that of buffy although does not look as good as the wonder full sarah michelle <UNK> br br rating for this movie 10 10 a fine example of how a vampire movie should be done br br
<START> the truth and <UNK> process in south africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and <UNK> process almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and <UNK> we all need to understand ways of dealing with the past what's happening in south africa should guide us all i found it credible moving and at times <UNK> there were no outstanding acting performances but this added to the strength of the narrative once again the bbc has been <UNK> in taking a complex topic and turning out a top class movie
<START> there was a recent documentary on making movies that featured a long list of actors and directors talking about what its like to make movies one common theme was you can have a great script great cast the best director and lots of money and still create a bad movie br br down <UNK> is proof of the <UNK> to that theory not an original or terribly well written screenplay a few solid actors but mostly <UNK> and this movie just makes you laugh out loud it would be easy to just say that <UNK> <UNK> carried this movie but that isn't truly the case other character actors like rob schneider and the hilarious <UNK> williams added significantly to the <UNK> of the film br br cast dynamics or that mysterious movie magic are really what happened here creating a film that flows smoothly has incredibly well executed transitions and line after line of well written and well performed dialog br br a preposterous premise lots and lots of technical inaccuracies and just plan silly things that could not happen in the real world or the real navy but you just don't care as a <UNK> marine myself i found that the overall feel of the movie while not plausible was also not too far off the mark as far as life at sea goes br br this is a very funny movie a good family film and particularly if your a fan lots of <UNK> <UNK> wit sarcasm and just damn
<START> when is art going to overcome racism i believe the american people have grown up since this movie was made consists of a stellar cast and music this motion picture is an excellent adaptation of a great opera i e miss <UNK> is based on <UNK> <UNK> les <UNK> is based on a classic book recently an opera has been introduced here in los angeles based on the movie the fly an opera so be it br br disney is <UNK> about releasing song of the south the <UNK> has voiced no contest for race issues and let us not forget <UNK> n andy was a huge hit in the 50's as a tv series <UNK> is our <UNK> in the u s and we should embrace all forms of ethnic artistic diversity br br please release on dvd br br j

<START> the buddy holly story opens on a shot of a yellow <UNK> moon on the roof of a roller <UNK> in 1956 texas as the credits start the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot into the roller <UNK> past the <UNK> and across the <UNK> to a small <UNK> where a small band is doing their sound check it's a tracking shot welles and <UNK> would both appreciate it cuts to buddy <UNK> <UNK> face <UNK> down in <UNK> concentration as he grips the <UNK> and talks to a man putting this band on the radio br br a young gary busey plays buddy holly and his performance is key he has to somehow show the passion that holly had for his music to make the film work this is a rock and roll story without lines of coke chased with shots of heroin and a fifth of <UNK> this isn't about a man with several women to choose between in a sex <UNK> abandoned <UNK> tragedy this is a film about a nice texas boy who respected his parents and went to church and had the same girlfriend for 5 years and fell in love with rock and roll busey finds that spark and <UNK> it his passion is clear and <UNK> he really plays the guitar in the film and sings its not <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> busey was a young guy in hollywood in the seventies a struggling actor and as much or more so a struggling rock musician as well thus he gives a great performance because although he isn't buddy holly he's in a similar situation br br his first song is the old les paul classic <UNK> hill and he has the country <UNK> to nail it next a kid calls out for some <UNK> and against his two band mates in reality the <UNK> were 3 guys but the down <UNK> works fine for the film's limited narrative he leads them <UNK> into <UNK> with ollie <UNK> the kids love it and the parents hate it the dj at the rolling <UNK> tapes it and it is later released in new york without buddy holly even knowing it was ever recorded this leads to the funniest scene in a film filled with humorous moments an <UNK> up disc <UNK> from buffalo calls up buddy at home the dj has been playing that'll be the day for 12 hours and is going for 24 the cops are <UNK> on the <UNK> <UNK> door holly is confused but when the dust <UNK> he is quite thrilled he tells the boys and their <UNK> rise begins dan <UNK> as the drummer and charles martin smith as the <UNK> round out the band nicely and have good chemistry with each other there are problems but not overblown drama thats found in most rock all <UNK> the movie doesn't manipulate you either your emotions <UNK> but they're not manipulated when the <UNK> step onto the apollo stage in harlem the first white group ever to play there then rip into an <UNK> charged performance of oh boy and win the audience over my rock and roll loving ass got <UNK> up and cried next busey and the boys make it's so easy sound and more <UNK> than i would have believed possible br br anyone with even a <UNK> knowledge of buddy <UNK> story will know where this movie will end holly died in a plane crash with <UNK> and the big <UNK> way too young we as the audience know that yet the movie is so well written directed and lovingly acted that we forget it almost immediately the movie isn't about his death it's about his life and his place in rock and roll history the film ends with his last performance and it's a good fifteen minutes of busey <UNK> out possessed by the ghost of buddy holly i was happy to hear him end it on not fade away my favorite of his songs the film <UNK> before the end credits with the information about the plane crash but i hardly noticed it i was still thinking about how good that last song was
<START> i also have been a wife of an abusive husband even if in my situation the attacks were psychological not physical he presented a very respectable responsible and generous personality to anyone who saw us together which in contrast to myself resulted in having others treat me as dull and unstable initially i was so incredibly <UNK> that anybody like gus who worked in a bank and was <UNK> confident would even give me the time of day and i fell completely head over heels for the idea of him rather than the person he was if i'd had my head on straight and gotten to know him much better first there's no way i'd have married him however that's my mistake it wasn't my mistake to be abused i didn't deserve that nor did i see it coming until i was <UNK> in the mind games criticism and isolation he acted like i had no business holding an opinion that <UNK> from his own actually he went further if i didn't agree he assumed i misunderstood and increasingly <UNK> his <UNK> by the time i finally lost my self respect i was incapable of <UNK> the <UNK> i was in and i had to be <UNK> to reality by outside influence my dad said gus called me a bitch well it was still a half year before the rage that began at that moment finally <UNK> and i packed some stuff while he was at work and i left and it was still another several months before i could grasp the fact that i had been abused and that it wasn't my fault he was doing the things he did so please anyone who assumes it's the fault of the victim think if a puppy is kicked by a cruel owner when in an anxious situation it has an accident on the <UNK> do you blame the puppy by the time the abuse in a relationship reaches an obvious violent level the target of abuse has been so wounded and much like in nazi concentration camps that it's nearly impossible to judge the <UNK> accurately because by then the victim believes all the horrible things <UNK> by the <UNK> have a heart people <UNK> abuse victims as stupid morons is like kicking someone who's already terribly beaten and this helps how
<START> <UNK> 12 starts off on annoying and gets worse from there on like a celebrity awards presentation each major actor actress is introduced in short 60 second scenarios that seem to stop just short having a <UNK> applaud now sign the first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disjointed poorly edited and at times utterly unrelated to the story and confusing speaking of the story there is one kinda but its barely visible for all the look at me shots and cameos only matt damon seemed to actually act during this film the rest of the cast appeared to only be there to participate in a rat pack wanna be session as for the heist the action the drama it was put into the last 8 10 minutes of the movie and was pathetic and <UNK> horrible horrible horrible
<START> many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much <UNK> however every so often a movie might come along thats honest funny entertaining and memorable the last american virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time <UNK> all four ingredients this film follows three friends gary rick and david the big apple <UNK> into the world of first time sex and true love along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship we follow hopeless romantic gary the main character on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at it's ending if you haven't been lucky enough to see this movie yet by all means take a look <UNK> with many memorable 80s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace l a v truly is an original film a <UNK> among films of it's genre
<START> one night i was listening to talk radio and they had leslie <UNK> on the program he went on to explain why there were only 6 shows ' br br with tv shows like mash you could go to the <UNK> to get a beer and as long as you heard what was going on you didn't miss anything but with police squad you had to watch the show with the sight gags you missed a whole lot if you didn't see them who could forget the part of town known as little italy with the <UNK> in the background br br even the movies relied heavily on the sight gags but then again being in the theater you were a captive audience br br leslie also said the one reason the show movies and other movies like airplane were funny is because they didn't attempt to tell what was funny it was up to the viewer to get the jokes br br well that's just my 2 cents
<START> i hate to admit it but i didn't find it to be one of hitchcock's best but nonetheless a riveting climatic thriller in a remake of <UNK> 1934 movie of the same title dr ben <UNK> james stewart  the man who knows too much and his wife jo <UNK> doris day are in <UNK> with their son hank christopher when there is a case of mistaken identity and caught up in the web of an assassination plot the <UNK> go to extreme <UNK> to prevent them from <UNK> with their plot kidnapping their beloved hank br br i found it surprising that doris day who i usually associate with rock hudson comedies was cast in a hitchcock film as i was watching it i soon realized that this was more of a family film compared to hitchcock's other works example psycho and she had singing ability needed to pull off <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which she did beautifully she was well cast as herself and james stewart had chemistry which helped make the couple believable br br in comparison to the great director's other works i believe this isn't as good but it is still a exceedingly entertaining family thriller mystery there is also the added bonus of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which turned out to be a smash hit for doris day well directed well acted a fine film
<START> seems <UNK> seagal is getting more and more <UNK> and less action packed to date this has to be his worse movie no action a poor story line an impossible plot and to make things worse one of the endings i have ever seen br br seagal films are like seeing a dirty harry you do not go see it for the great social causes or impeccable acting you want a good action flick br br on a scale of 1 to 10 this one gets a 1
<START> words fail me for this appalling waste of two hours of anyone's life the story is contrived to the point of complete <UNK> br br the acting is <UNK> and so much of this is laughably dreadful <UNK> jones so wonderful in lock stock and two smoking <UNK> is <UNK> awful and unbelievable as mike sullivan journalist br br i honestly can't ever remember seeing a worse film it's only worth watching for the appalling continuity <UNK> after jones is handed a huge beating he emerges without a scratch on him his girlfriend <UNK> a drink over him and he chases her <UNK> from the pub bone dry it's quite dreadful made all the worse by the talented actors who appear in it
<START> maybe like most others who have seen this film long after it's premiere on television i wanted to see many of my favorite actors in old and obscure form which is exactly what <UNK> is except aside from the nostalgic value the movie itself is not very good br br eric roberts plays former reporter <UNK> ash hired by a <UNK> raymond j barry a rich artist to investigate the <UNK> of his estranged son brian who had been living with his mother <UNK> beverly <UNK> for the past few years in a phillip <UNK> esquire fashion <UNK> ash <UNK> what would become more than just an investigation into the <UNK> of brian but once <UNK> tracks down <UNK> his <UNK> break open wide a whole lot of trouble perhaps because events in the film move too slowly there is never much suspense to this little thriller not even by the end with the finale routine of revealing the <UNK> and their motives br br however as said before this movie is probably one that will draw attention for it's then relatively unknown cast of actors which include both a very young eric roberts as well as the adorable johnny <UNK> who plays <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that may be reason enough to give it a try if you can find it
<START> this movie was so cool i saw it on a friday night with a couple of my friends while the first credits were rolling we saw that <UNK> films had made this movie they are the ones that made that stupid movie wolf creek which was totally gay when we saw this we <UNK> we thought it was going to be like wolf creek but we were so wrong the movie was not only better than wolf creek which really isn't that hard it is one of the best horror movies i have seen in a long time they really redeemed themselves with this movie it was gory smart and scary which are the <UNK> to an awesome horror movie kane is awesome as <UNK> <UNK> and christina <UNK> samantha noble and luke did pretty good jobs as part of a group of <UNK> cleaning an old motel it had some gross scenes and you actually kinda feel sad for some of the people who die all in all a great horror movie to watch on a friday or saturday night with the lights off and with friends just don't watch it in a hotel
<START> when <UNK> <UNK> character says i feel like i'm in someone else's dream and they're going to be ashamed when they wake up she is referring not only to being an unwilling player in <UNK> war games she is referring to being an ignorant <UNK> in life itself at the film's end when she says that she had a dream that she had a child and she was trying to take care of it but she forgot something else the <UNK> is that she has forgotten what she has learned in the war she's just survived that like her own mother before her she will be unable to pass on any vital lessons to her own child and therefore the cycle of the shame of ignorance will continue ad <UNK>
<START> <UNK> of the jackass fame is back with his own reality show and not only is it not as funny as jackass but it's also amazingly <UNK> this has to be one of the dumbest shows ever conceived sure there are worse reality shows but none are as mean spirited or as dumb br br <UNK> has made it big and his parents decided to <UNK> bank off of his fame <UNK> and his parents his uncle his crew of idiotic friends all live together and while <UNK> and his buddies are off breaking things and getting into <UNK> generally his parents are at home being stupid when parents aren't at home being lazy they're being tortured by <UNK> especially his father to add to the humor we are treated to his fat uncle don who is constantly out of it and never paying attention br br this show really is like a toned down version of jackass toned down in that there aren't stunts instead <UNK> and his buddies just go break stuff and do lame stunts and meanwhile loud music plays to make it all the more awesome this is not funny in the least i can't imagine a dumber show than this because there is not an ounce of intelligence found here br br if you are a big fan of <UNK> and want to see one of the many follow up cash in sequels to the jackass series br br my rating out of 30 mins
<START> this was by far the worst movie i've ever seen and thats compared to alexander <UNK> 2 and the new world br br i should go back to blockbuster and ask for my money back along with <UNK> as it was a truly traumatic experience for the first ten minutes i was changing the zoom on my widescreen tv because the actors seemed to be out of screen i didn't think it was possible to make such a bad film in this day and age i was wrong while <UNK> this message i've thought of a good reason to buy this movie a joke present at <UNK> i'm <UNK> the mrs for this one as she picked it thanks babe br br be warned a true shocker all round
<START> yes it's not a great cinematic achievement but toy soldiers is a fun and entertaining movie the young cast does a great job with both dramatic and comedic aspects of the story and i particularly liked shawn <UNK> as derek <UNK> i've seen this one plenty of times over the years and will probably see it several more just don't think too much and you'll love it enjoy
<START> i consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies the more bizarre and imaginative the film the more blood and guts the better and i really fall in love with cheaply done flicks if they are done right <UNK> starts out well enough his origin at the circus a creepy run at a supermarket an attack of an old lady and his disturbing <UNK> of a woman's <UNK> all set the mood nicely a hot sex shower scene ensues when the woman's daughter and daughter's boyfriend arrives at the house when <UNK> steals the boyfriends <UNK> the movie takes a turn for the worse br br the characters are presented with numerous opportunities to a save their loved ones b get the police to help c escape or most importantly d kill <UNK> i can't feel empathy or fear for characters that are too stupid to help themselves <UNK> chances to arm themselves with guns and knives while <UNK> is away a policeman eventually arrives and is equally <UNK> in stopping <UNK> even though at one point he has a rifle <UNK> aimed at <UNK> while <UNK> and does his rendition of the polish chicken dance i found myself <UNK> <UNK> my television make sure he's dead hes gone get out of there or just kill him already br br <UNK> is a <UNK> savage but he is hardly <UNK> <UNK> if you can't <UNK> this <UNK> you deserve what's coming to you by halfway through the movie you'll be so <UNK> to the <UNK> of the half wits that only morbid curiosity will sustain you to last to the mildly amusing ending this movie was noted as one of 101 greatest movies you've never seen well <UNK> is half right in the case of <UNK> the geek
<START> it's a great movie for the whole family i don't think many people have seen it cause i ask people and they say that they've never heard of it before sophie <UNK> is my <UNK> sister in law my favorite scene is the whole movie i can't even pick a favorite scene my favorite character is <UNK> because he is a funny yet smart dog if someone hasn't seen it they are missing out on a great adventure i've only seen it cause my aunt is related to sophie and she got a copy from her if someone is reading this i suggest buy the movie and i guaranteed it won't be a bad decision i've seen this movie about five times and every time it gives me the same message dogs are as smart as people just give them a chance
<START> according to most people i know that saw this film and to the reviews i've read this was supposed to be a hugely entertaining thriller that oh so needs to be seen by more people i didn't expect this film to blow me away but i certainly didn't expect to find this movie mediocre at best which is what it is br br i'm no stranger to french films being both french and having studied them as a student so i'm aware of the clichés and corny plot twists that can go <UNK> by english american audiences there are some great french films that should have been given <UNK> international release but this isn't one of them br br to begin with the plot is both far fetched over complicated and too smart <UNK> to be entertaining so you really feel every minute of its <UNK> and <UNK> run time and by the time everything is finally revealed you are beyond caring the main character himself is lacking any real charisma or even acting talent to keep your attention fixed mainly on him and his journey anytime close to the crap ending so by the time you've even considered <UNK> the main plot twists it's begun to dawn on you that you've wasted your time i actually remember switching off before the credits actually began to roll after the film's climactic reunion that was the point in which i was sure i had almost completely wasted my time by the way br br the film is not at all the worst thing i've seen but it seems completely overrated for instance i read somewhere that it beats all the bourne identity films in terms of suspense or even that it has to wall i can safely say some people are <UNK> up this frankly dull movie br br 4 10 is a <UNK> <UNK> rating for this film i feel and since i have seen some complete and utter <UNK> i'll therefore save the <UNK> <UNK> and for them
<START> crack house 1989 was one of the few film during the 80's that falls into this genre what's supposed to be an anti drug film turns out to be nothing more than some white exploitation exercise in <UNK> there's nothing wrong with that however the video presentation even has an anti drug message from one of the stars of the show richard <UNK> <UNK> br br the movie follows two young lovers in high school one of them is a quasi tough guy and the other is his girl one of them <UNK> turned out by a mutual friend whilst the other is given a trip to the slam and is later on given a chance to get back at his ex friends jim brown appears as the movie's mister big he's one bad dude who still can punk out anybody and is a very sadistic guy who likes to <UNK> his and beat the <UNK> out of those who try to defy his word luke from general hospital makes a guest star spot as well br br if you like hard edge sleaze then this movie's for you sadly hollywood doesn't make these any more and when they do it's neither exploitative nor entertaining br br recommended for sleaze fans
<START> i am <UNK> for the sequels i needed something to keep me from going insane with tension anxiety what if it isn't as good and constant lack of information i needed something to calm me a little something to pass the time other than of course the matrix this was just the thing br br i found it informative like the part about <UNK> neck and some of it was funny i <UNK> carrie anne <UNK> much when she said there was only one bathroom and all those guys i found only one problem with it given that 95 of the people there were as a matter of fact male they just kinda let their mouths run wild and there was language in it it's not near as bad as the <UNK> <UNK> runs but that one scene were keanu is describing a bad day plug your ears if you are little br br it was entertaining and was just what i needed it is what all matrix fans who are going nuts need to keep them quiet they mention a tiny bit about the sequels and someone almost gives something away but he catches himself in time shoot it gives you almost no spoilers but it is great to have if you are a matrix head like me br br there is no <UNK>
<START> fame did something odd it was not only a musical that was created originally for the screen most are based off of broadway musicals but it <UNK> a tv series and a broadway musical let me correct that sentence fame is not a musical musicals have song numbers in order to advance the plot or to show characters' feelings the singing in this music is not used to do either in fact there's no use for it at all people just randomly sing to fit in with the plot and that's not the type of musical i know br br the so called plot of fame has an <UNK> of characters who are all introduced at once last time i saw that in a movie <UNK> park it had disastrous results who audition for and get into new york high school for the performing arts all of them are in for different reasons i e acting singing etc quote <UNK> drama unfolds as these middle aged people pretending to be teenagers go through their four years br br my largest complaint is that the high school is supposed to be <UNK> after all it's a free college and they can't let everyone in so how is it that some people who are really bad get into the college obviously so that drama could ensue between all of these different people and why is the person top billed not even in the movie until near the end for no reason at all except to make us feel uncomfortable there's many unsettling situations that these <UNK> people get into yet you can't feel bad for them because you don't know who they are these relationships occur between people whose names you don't know and these characters realize things about themselves throughout the course of the movie yet you don't realize that because you don't know what they were like in the first place br br as for the singing it pops in randomly and is supposed to be humorous and does nothing when the title song is sung it's played in the middle of a street and before you can say <UNK> <UNK> everyone's in the middle of the street dancing wildly and off beat to it the song itself is fine but the whole scene like the whole movie is unnecessary fame is an unpleasant movie to say the least i would say more but most of the movie has thankfully gone out of my head just don't see it you'll be doing yourself a favor br br my rating 2 10 br br rated r for language
<START> i think this was a horrible mistake on disney's part first off does not need to pass emperor school to become emperor that's never happened before secondly the new voices don't sound like the originals at all very poor <UNK> and while i <UNK> the movie the <UNK> new groove the new school is just stupid like all the jokes are the same and many are from the movie the plot gets redundant always is that how you spell it trying to become <UNK> stopping her etc or learning to become a better person i think gets annoying with his constant complaints and questions he is a spoiled brat and it bothers me i do not think this is worth five minutes of your time much less a half hour
<START> five years after she teamed up with james cagney in the public enemy mae clarke makes another appearance this time as his fiancée with <UNK> character on the other side of the law it seems like she was calling more of the shots in their relationship as well trying to get johnny cave to be a little more practical with his money and his career you had to figure they'd get back together after she gave him the boot for challenging her crooked boss those things have a way of working out in pictures br br i got a kick out of watching cagney in this one i usually do and here he looked like he might have <UNK> that characteristic shoulder <UNK> move that he used to good effect in angels with dirty faces portraying rocky sullivan it was right after he threw <UNK> robert out of his office during the first attempt at <UNK> the new <UNK> and <UNK> boss he turns to the camera and <UNK> up as if entirely pleased with his response to the crook very cool br br it's my understanding that this wasn't one of <UNK> warner films but it might as well have been <UNK> often took up the cause for the common man and the expose of crooked <UNK> and the politicians who <UNK> them would have been right up their alley you also have those great new york city street scenes depicting cars and <UNK> of the era with home made signs <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> cents a pound hey how about the furniture store selling the living room set for a hundred <UNK> nine dollars you might get a single stick chair for that price today br br best part of the picture just might be that meat counter scene when cagney james burke <UNK> and the <UNK> play catch with an chicken one of the film's lighter moments but you get an idea how tense people can get when they're caught cheating same with the truck driver who's <UNK> by johnny into <UNK> for an accurate delivery he just wasn't used to doing that br br all in all a nice <UNK> from <UNK> more typical gangster presence even if not up to the standard of his feature films it's easy enough to obtain as one of a handful of public <UNK> cagney pictures out there and often found in relatively <UNK> <UNK>
