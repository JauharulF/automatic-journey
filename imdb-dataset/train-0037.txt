<START> soylent green is a classic i have been waiting for someone to re do it they seem to be <UNK> sci fi classics these days i e war of the worlds and i am hoping some director producer will re do soylent green with todays computer animation and technology it would have the potential to be a great picture anti <UNK> films may not be that far fetched the human race <UNK> like <UNK> with no outside influence to <UNK> it we as humans have the option of putting the <UNK> on the <UNK> of lesser species if they get out of hand but there's nothing to control human <UNK> except for ourselves despite all the <UNK> wars <UNK> birth control etc the human race still <UNK> like <UNK> in a <UNK> dish classic <UNK> <UNK> states that any species including humans will <UNK> beyond their means of <UNK> 6 billion and growing that's obscene
<START> i wish i could laugh again as much as when i saw this show for the first time i have not done so ever since br br the strange thing is i find myself laughing almost as hard after watching the show again and again br br eddie izzard is <UNK> is poignant is a man of the world he is <UNK> talking about politics and yet feels no need to engage in political discussion he is above that i would contrast him to george <UNK> who uses his comedy to try and convince people about his ideas and does not seem to enjoy the fact that he is trying to entertain br br funniest guy on earth
<START> i can't believe that people thought this <UNK> heap of trash was funny shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty disgust and stupidity <UNK> something about <UNK> leaves little reason to stay until the end sure cameron diaz is very pretty but that is never going to be enough to save a movie ben stiller tries hard to work within the plot and is obviously very talented but the movie is a loser br br not once were any of the scenes believable the shots were badly timed and poorly framed the <UNK> brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs i check imdb to see what they are working on just so i know what to avoid br br 2 10 the bonus is from the one time i <UNK> it's not like i'm <UNK> to humor or alone in my opinion my wife hated it too the next day we saw <UNK> <UNK> and laughed ourselves silly this movie just <UNK>
<START> you get a gift it is <UNK> wrapped the box it is in is hand crafted out of the finest wood and shows skill down to the smallest detail that is then wrapped in gorgeous paper <UNK> and hand painted by the most talented of artists the whole thing is wrapped in <UNK> made from fine <UNK> <UNK> it is a sight to behold br br then you cut the <UNK> rip off the paper open up the box and find nothing that's toys you either enjoy the <UNK> or forget about it br br the film isn't without its point and purpose war is a not a good thing well isn't that original the moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to even point it out and even that feeble insight is <UNK> by a story in which elements of war war toys in particular are clearly a bad thing until they need an exciting climax and the film <UNK> a war using innocent toys it's like someone preaching a stern condescending <UNK> only to end by saying just kidding br br but even as an empty box the film fails close <UNK> yes it is a sight to behold with some remarkable striking images the sets are imaginative and the cinematography catches the colorful scenes with skill but the images are cold and emotionally <UNK> like the screenplay the look of the film is <UNK> and at times <UNK> <UNK> and surreal it is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things yet shows them to be creations of a world that is empty and cold the film <UNK> to be funny in a <UNK> sort of way but the humor is forced and artificial robin williams as the <UNK> heir to a toy <UNK> empire <UNK> in his ad <UNK> <UNK> which only seems alien to the bizarre <UNK> structured world he is <UNK> indeed the <UNK> references and tasteless sexual innuendo that are scattered throughout are <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> fable the film is vaguely trying to be for this film to work or make sense it needs to be set in its own universe an oz far removed from kansas every time the jokes jerk us back into reality the <UNK> of the film increasingly becomes an obvious <UNK> br br it is said that this was director barry <UNK> pet project one that he had been <UNK> to get made for ten years it is sadly obvious why he had trouble getting backing like most pet projects that finally get made <UNK> murders radio <UNK> battlefield earth being great examples it seems to be a blind spot in the <UNK> field of vision perhaps <UNK> directed and <UNK> toys so often in his head that he no fresh vision for it when he finally got on the <UNK> he had already <UNK> it to death br br many of the toys featured in the film are clumsy mechanical wind up <UNK> so is the film itself
<START> i saw arthur the tv series and the books years ago and never was fond of the show very much if you're a fan of this cartoon sorry if i'm spoiling it for you but this is actually what i think lots of people liked it but i didn't br br the school kids characters seemed to fought all the time especially <UNK> and <UNK> they were nice to each other frequently but gradually i got tired of <UNK> complaining attitude towards everyone and his sister <UNK> however the name was spelled and <UNK> was an <UNK> or add like 4 year old sister of arthur who was sometimes demanding which could be why arthur got annoyed with what her routines were like her imaginary friend and her stuffed animal collection etc <UNK> friends acted like teenagers instead of what they were like in the arthur books and the parents well they didn't care very much br br the greatest cartoon was <UNK> modern life not arthur no offense
<START> if ever anyone <UNK> whether cinema is an art form you can do worse than pointing them at this movie br br quite simply it is the perfect combination of story script actors and cinematography ever committed to celluloid br br the story of a doomed <UNK> pilot who is missed by his heavenly conductor in the english fog during the second world war and his subsequent <UNK> with the <UNK> authorities or is it in his head is played with <UNK> by david niven and kim hunter and is incredibly touching especially in the opening scenes when the doomed pilot niven describes his plight to the ground radio <UNK> hunter br br the sense of <UNK> is <UNK> by jack <UNK> photography and the incredible production designs br br the supreme touches <UNK> to the heaven shots appearing in black and white and <UNK> scenes presented in <UNK> this is even mentioned by the <UNK> conductor a fantastic <UNK> <UNK> br br not only a <UNK> in british cinema but a <UNK> in cinema period
<START> 'the luzhin <UNK> is a movie worthy of anyone's time it is a brooding intense film and kept my attention the entire time john <UNK> is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender eccentric chess <UNK> and emily watson is spell <UNK> as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected russian family the chemistry between watson and <UNK> on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story all in all this movie is one of the best in depth looks at the life of a chess <UNK> and <UNK> and watson add a whole non mainstream non cliche feel to the film most people will come out of the theater thinking and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely of love stories
<START> director <UNK> walsh was like the michael bay of the <UNK> and years before that and i mean that in a positive way since i'm definitely ain't no bay <UNK> his movies are just simple high quality entertainment just like the <UNK> walsh movies were in his days br br gentleman jim is fine quality entertainment besides a first class director it also features a first grade cast with <UNK> <UNK> regular leading man errol flynn in the main part br br what surprised me was how well the boxing matches were brought to the screen they used some very dynamic camera work which also really made the boxing matches uplifting and exciting to watch with the end championship fight against john l sullivan as the ultimate highlight br br <UNK> of the <UNK> and earlier on were obviously still very much different from <UNK> being made this present day modern <UNK> often <UNK> its main subject and show his her life from basically birth till death and everything mostly emotional aspects in between <UNK> <UNK> were just made the same as movies that weren't based on actual real life persons which also means that the film makers would often use a use amount of creative liberty with the main character's personality and events that happened in his her life this movie is also not just a biography about a boxing legend but also forms a nice portrayal from the period when illegal bare <UNK> fighting entered the modern era of boxing br br errol flynn does a great job portraying the real life famous boxer james j corbett aka gentleman jim not too many people known it but flynn did some real good acting jobs in the <UNK> of which this movie is one <UNK> he also looks in top shape he also looks quite different by the way without his trademark small mustache in this movie the movie also features some fine supporting actors and some fine acting throughout br br a great and entertaining movie that also still truly holds up real well today br br 8 10
<START> i saw this film in a london cinema in 1975 and have not seen it since i found it hilarious i loved it's originality it's rare that someone makes a movie like this and it's sad too br br what i mean is i once read a book called the black hotel and as a film fan i always picture books as films kinda adapt them you know but as i read it i thought well this would make a great movie but of course it would have to be adapted to the point where it would bear little relationship to the book br br but then i thought well why sure it could never be shown on sunday afternoon tv but provided it were shown in cinemas to adults who knew what it contained where's the harm <UNK> my civil liberties were being crushed here a director should be able to make a literal film adaptation of the black hotel br br in an ideal world censorship of films for adults should not exist but sadly whilst i accept that with intelligent adults such freedom might be harmless there would always be those who would lack the <UNK> to <UNK> between fantasy and reality and who might be <UNK> on to commit foul deeds br br however it's hard to see how la <UNK> falls into that category br br on it's appearance in england the british <UNK> <UNK> it out of hand despite the <UNK> <UNK> on nudity given the film's <UNK> theme of <UNK> had the <UNK> passed any of it he'd have been looking for a new job on monday br br but in those days there was an alternative the g l c this was a local town <UNK> with a department who had the power to pass a film just for london where it was deemed audiences were more <UNK> than those who lived out in the sticks br br the film was <UNK> <UNK> and passed however it later emerged that the board consisted of just four people three who voted plus a <UNK> and on the day one of the voters was off sick thus the remaining two voters and the <UNK> sat down to view la <UNK> br br one of said voters thought like me that the film was hilarious and hardly likely to encourage foul deeds by anyone the other lacked imagination and simply thought the piece disgusting and the <UNK> didn't understand it so decided to <UNK> on the side of freedom br br when the missing <UNK> finally saw the film they too thought it disgusting but it was too late the film had received its x london <UNK> and opened to mixed reaction the g l c film censorship board was <UNK> soon after thus la <UNK> only opened in london by what could best be <UNK> a <UNK> but i'm glad it was it's great if you haven't seen it do so it's a fantasy and as such it's far less disturbing than most things you see on the news these days
<START> an american in paris was in many ways the ultimate mixture of art and hollywood musical made at the height of <UNK> powers as a musical <UNK> the film features memorable music from the <UNK> who rightly have been called the 20th <UNK> equivalent of <UNK> and <UNK> br br gene kelly was also at the height of his powers in this film though it could be rightly <UNK> that this movie was just the warm up for his best work in <UNK> in the rain <UNK> the two films are actually closely linked aside from the arthur freed connection the broadway melody segment in rain owes its existence to the incredible american in paris ballet sequence in this film this might well have been the only time a dance number is specially mentioned in the opening credits of the film and it deserved to be as it showcases gene kelly's skills as a dancer and choreographer to their <UNK> degree br br the film's cast is uniformly excellent leslie caron incredibly making her film debut shows a maturity that makes you think she'd been making films for years her <UNK> dance sequence and later her work on the ballet provides some surprisingly sexy moments <UNK> in mgm musicals only by <UNK> <UNK> work in <UNK> in the rain and the band <UNK> oscar <UNK> is hilarious as kelly's stoic pal who gets two of the film's best moments during the end party sequence which i will not give away for anyone who hasn't seen the film and one of the film's most memorable musical numbers which couples his incredible piano skills with state of the art for the time special effects br br less memorable are georges <UNK> as kelly's romantic rival though he does get a few musical highlights and nina <UNK> as leslie <UNK> romantic rival the may december relationship between kelly's character and <UNK> reminded me of the same kept man relationship seen between george <UNK> and patricia <UNK> in breakfast at <UNK> br br there are a few elements of the film that made it less satisfying for me than <UNK> in the rain the ballet though lavish and well produced doesn't really fit with the rest of the movie without giving away the plot the ballet just happens with no real rhyme or reason and unlike the broadway melody sequence it really doesn't have anything to do with the plot and in the best musicals the songs always have some sort of <UNK> <UNK> br br making matters worse is the ending of the film which happens immediately after the ballet although the ending shouldn't be a surprise this is an mgm musical after all i was hoping for a bit more movie after the ballet ended it's as if director <UNK> minnelli felt that he couldn't follow the ballet with anything else the film literally left me in the <UNK> br br that negative aside an american in paris rightly ranks alongside the best of hollywood's musicals it doesn't quite reach the heights of <UNK> in the rain but it comes close and it remains a testament to gene kelly's skills as one of the greatest dancers of all time
<START> for those who are too young to know this or for those who have forgotten the disney company went almost down the <UNK> by the end of the 1980s people were not seeing their movies anymore and the company was not producing the usual wholesome material at least no what people expected a major problem profanity br br yes the idiots running the disney movies during that decade would produce films with swear words including the <UNK> name in vain if you can believe that interspersed in these family films in fact that happens twice here in the first 20 minutes br br this movie in addition to the language problems has a nasty tone to it too which made it unlikeable almost right from the beginning thankfully disney woke up and has produced a lot of great material since these <UNK> '80s movies <UNK> is disney just under another name
<START> this is the second movie based on the life and times of ultra hung porn star john curtis <UNK> better known as john holmes boogie nights is also roughly based on his life maybe someday someone is going to do a movie on the life of tommy byron instead br br the problem is that the story is not very well told there are many law order episodes that have more twists and turns than wonderland and the director never gets the criminal case going with any kind of gusto val kilmer has two problems he is not nearly as hung as holmes is and no <UNK> this time around unlike in boogie nights and he is much better looking than <UNK> holmes br br the director does not introduce one single likable individual among the cast the racist immature <UNK> he hangs out with or his wife and the police don't get much in the way of characterization br br the best part of the movie is eric <UNK> telling paris hilton to get lost br br having said all that anyone interested in the <UNK> side of the porn business in the 1980s or true crime shouldn't miss it
<START> director edward <UNK> an old hand at visual comedy successfully leads this hal roach road show which <UNK> a fast moving and <UNK> scenario and excellent casting <UNK> a large number of <UNK> reliable performers although the film was originally plotted as a vehicle for <UNK> kelly sunny jack <UNK> stars as joe <UNK> a young <UNK> who sells his auto <UNK> business and <UNK> to hollywood where he attempts to <UNK> a screen role for the girl he loves star struck <UNK> <UNK> lawrence <UNK> who prefers using the entire m g m studio as his set does so here as <UNK> always ready for an audition is treated by a would be <UNK> cinema star <UNK> lopez <UNK> <UNK> to behind the scenes action of naturally a musical comedy featuring broadway <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> laurel and hardy provide several enjoyable <UNK> including their well known skit involving a tiny <UNK> and we watch fine turns by such as <UNK> <UNK> russell <UNK> and walter long on balance one must hand the <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> who clearly steals the picture as an emotional movie star a role which he largely creates and to the director for his clever closing homage to busby <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> when i started watching this movie i saw the dude from buffy <UNK> and figured ah how nice that he's still making a living acting in movies now a weird movie i can stand given that it's a good dose of weird like for example david lynch movies twin peaks lost highway etc and you sort of have to be in the mood for one this one however made me <UNK> remember the crazy <UNK> about there about conspiracy <UNK> that make absolutely no sense i mean come on people <UNK> who <UNK> with america to make an <UNK> <UNK> of evil powers i was surprised they didn't mention the hollow earth in this movie with hitler flying <UNK> and lizard people maybe if you had like 60 <UNK> of heroine with this movie it would make some sort of sense but seriously i don't <UNK> drugs like i don't <UNK> this movie it should be burned <UNK> and forgotten just so good ol' <UNK> might get another acting job it wasn't his acting though that was alright but the script just didn't make any sense sorry
<START> well this movie was <UNK> one of the funniest scary movie i have ever seen the effects are so bad you just have to laugh and the acting well lets say its no mel gibson but gary <UNK> who plays an police officer is so damn bad he becomes good i dont know how but he him self makes this movie a 10 you must see it if your in to horror slash movies cause its bloody and funny at the same time killer movie
<START> i am a big beatles fan my favorite <UNK> is paul and my least favorite is john i already knew quite a bit about the beatles music and the truth behind the <UNK> as well as things like john <UNK> family and paul's band wings i was curious to see how this movie would handle the relationship between john and paul so many years after the <UNK> br br i was not disappointed by this movie although the story itself is fiction many of the references that the two musicians used were very accurate these included how <UNK> <UNK> would always be with john wherever he went the wings song silly love songs being the number one hit that year and the concert on the roof of apple studios playing music from the album let it be br br the actors did a very good job in playing john and paul the accents could had used maybe a bit more work but they seemed to act a lot like i've read the two former beatles used to act like i also liked the dialogue between them which was basically what the entire movie was br br the ending at first disappointed me but the more you think about it the more you will appreciate it especially since this was how it really went in real life they also show the fantastic skit from saturday night live in which the beatles are offered 3 000 to perform on the show as compared to the <UNK> million others were offering them overall i was not disappointed with this movie it does really give you more of a feel for why the beatles broke up and why they never got back together
<START> okay like many other such films <UNK> out of a snl skit but tim meadows does a fairly fantastic job of making a 3 minute one dimensional character into a moderately <UNK> comedic movie character he drops <UNK> consistently <UNK> one liners with fair <UNK> billy dee williams is in it though his <UNK> days are long gone and the entire thing is shot pretty well true it's not great art but if you went into wayne's world looking for the gone with the wind you did something wrong enjoyable for what it is
<START> incredible documentary captured all the <UNK> chaos and misery which <UNK> over nyc on that <UNK> morning of september <UNK> intense personal and completely riveting 9 11 is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident which kind of gives it an even greater appeal up until that morning filmmakers <UNK> and jules <UNK> had been following around a new york <UNK> team <UNK> specifically on one new <UNK> in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the <UNK> training to become a <UNK> out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine <UNK> jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the world trade center and from there a simple documentary was no more br br viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero as the amazing group of fire fighters and one profoundly <UNK> cameraman attempt to <UNK> this disaster without <UNK> <UNK> follows these automatically <UNK> heroes into the tower while it's entire support <UNK> around them the raw fear of an unknown impending doom <UNK> with more <UNK> then any fictional production could ever <UNK> as we watch less and less become <UNK> and visible for those trapped inside nearly as memorable is older brother <UNK> <UNK> capturing of an entire city in the <UNK> of a larger and more <UNK> fear then anything they had <UNK> witnessed by the time we get to see the second tower collapse as the cameraman <UNK> himself from apocalyptic <UNK> we should all but be <UNK> the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly up close footage captured br br obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the <UNK> they document only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage even if it cost them their own safety br br after viewing 9 11 and seeing that it came out in 2002 i feel much more <UNK> towards oliver <UNK> recent rendition the big budgeted world trade center many had criticized the film for <UNK> <UNK> down the focus to those two survivors trapped in <UNK> and although i enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental hollywood focus it brought 9 11 all but <UNK> his film completely <UNK> not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day but the sublime transfer of motives <UNK> <UNK> that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never <UNK> the event again
<START> well this was one of those films i caught on the off chance and it was good enough for me to record when it showed up next time if like myself you enjoy many 80's horror flicks that <UNK> out a little from the norm i e not just another <UNK> of generic sequels then i think you may enjoy this when the bad guy eventually turns up in person he was definitely not what i expected to see all in all i wouldn't go out of your way for this one but if you like the genre then watch it if it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill i guess i'd give it 6 5 out of 10
<START> a must see by all if you have to borrow your neighbors kid to see this one easily one of the best animation cartoons released in a long time it took the the movies <UNK> to a whole new level do not mistake the two as being the same movie although in principle the movies plot is <UNK> just go and enjoy
<START> well it is hard to add comment after reading what is already here but i feel i must say something i wasn't exactly looking for 'a <UNK> as someone puts it or even <UNK> and guts <UNK> i have some respect for the victims relatives although i really felt the <UNK> didn't they were <UNK> <UNK> and meaningless just a <UNK> for <UNK> sexual antics br br i watched this film with the kind of morbid curiosity that makes me think <UNK> makes a guy be a serial killer ' as well as wondering the <UNK> about the dahmer story of which i know very little people here seem to think that the movie didn't have to cover the events of the dahmer story i e his history what happened when he got caught the aftermath etc but it is important you see i assume if you are american you will know all of this we do not all live in america to tell this story about such a man as he obviously was requires that at least some of the history and actual events are told shown this doesn't mean blood and guts there are ways of showing horrific things in a movie by <UNK> or clever filming without <UNK> to gore without even touching upon some of what he did i found out more about him reading the user comments on this site the movie felt like a void a moment in time with very little substance i would like to know if there is a film about the real dahmer because with its lack of direction very slow pace that never changes strange portrayal of homosexuality and the very unfortunate lack of any attempt at an ending this movie is poor i would not recommend to anyone that they waste the time it takes to watch it a definite 1 out of 10 for the acting
<START> platoon is to the vietnam war as rocky iv is to <UNK> championship boxing oliver <UNK> story of the experience of a us army platoon in vietnam in 1968 is so overdone it's laughable while most or all of the <UNK> in platoon did occur over the 10 year span of us military involvement in vietnam to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame weeks gives a horribly <UNK> picture of the war in platoon the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two us soldiers murdering civilians us soldiers <UNK> civilians a us sergeant murdering another us sergeant a us private murdering a us staff sergeant us soldiers killed wounded by friendly fire 90 killed or wounded in the platoon for stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a us soldier in vietnam is a disgrace two vietnam war films i would recommend are we were soldiers the true story of arguably the worst battle for us soldiers in vietnam and <UNK> a bright shining lie

<START> just picked up this film for a buck at national <UNK> <UNK> and after watching it i feel like i got ripped off br br i don't know that i've seen a worse film than this honestly and i would never write a negative review of a film had i not such enormous respect for the subject matter that is stephen foster and his music br br first what is it it's a musical biography yeah <UNK> of tunes by foster then interspersed here and there are these pseudo broadway <UNK> <UNK> type numbers that <UNK> more than the <UNK> <UNK> i mean somebody got paid to write this drivel secondly the real story of foster is a fascinating one why not even come close to it <UNK> what did they have on the great ray <UNK> to get him to do this film pictures of him with small boys with <UNK> what a waste of a great talent br br so friends of foster and the truth and good entertainment be afraid be very very afraid
<START> i watched this movie 10 years ago and have watched it on video an average of once a year since it's the type of movie that's timeless because the themes are universal yet the stories and conversation are so personal it's also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one <UNK> the credits roll despite the fact that there are really just two very involving characters this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and <UNK> who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality tv and now the phenomenon is rampant i love the way this movie just <UNK> the audience in its space and makes you think however jaded you may be that you are one of those characters it also made me want to ride the train around europe i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie maybe that speaks about myself my friends or just the sheer genius of this movie
<START> plot melissa is a new girl in town she's fifteen years old and her birthday is coming up in one week since melissa is beautiful every boy in town wants to hook up with her but the few that manage to catch her interest mysteriously die br br to be honest the real reason i wanted to watch this film is because dana <UNK> of friday the 13th <UNK> 3 was in it which isn't a proper reason why to rush out and see a movie when i started watching it i realized that sweet sixteen isn't a very good slasher it's really dull and boring and just doesn't go anywhere after over an hour only three murders have occurred and the story hasn't really developed in any possible way br br the movie is nicely shot with quite nice photography and good directing but just as with many other slasher flicks from the 80s the movie suffers from being too dark at times the acting is actually pretty good though and <UNK> character is easy to sympathize with even though she's a complete slut br br the story line isn't completely rubbish but it's just way too dull to keep you interested the only things that kept me interested was melissa she was stunning and dana <UNK> whose really sweet and cute in this movie br br all in all pretty dull slasher flick that doesn't go anywhere i'd definitely wouldn't recommend it to slasher fans
<START> the 40 year old virgin 2005 steve carell catherine <UNK> paul rudd <UNK> <UNK> seth <UNK> elizabeth banks leslie mann jane lynch <UNK> <UNK> shelley <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hysterically funny high concept comedy about the titular andy <UNK> wonderfully played by <UNK> second banana carell in a truly extraordinarily comic breakthrough performance sure to <UNK> him to the a list a tech services <UNK> for an <UNK> store in southern california who is found out about his <UNK> identity by a trio of well meaning yet entirely clueless <UNK> co worker buddies rudd <UNK> <UNK> each one degree funnier than the next determined to get their friend <UNK> no matter the cost what follows is an unlikely yet very warm hearted romance with a <UNK> mother the marvelous <UNK> having lots of fun here leading to add more fuel to the fires within andy a surprisingly good spirited and <UNK> raunchy romantic comedy the funniest since there's something about mary with a <UNK> <UNK> script by director judd <UNK> and carell that features some <UNK> gut <UNK> sequences including a <UNK> accurate david caruso joke <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> send ups of <UNK> a <UNK> and <UNK> the war of the <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> a true winner and an instant classic the funniest film of the year
<START> there are many problems with mystery men first of all there are too many different characters for all of them to be given complex or even interesting personalities the special effects detract from the story and are not really that special paul <UNK> is wasted in a pathetic juvenile role as a character who merely <UNK> and speaks in an <UNK> accent br br now onto the decent parts william h macy three heavenly words and his performance as the <UNK> is pitch perfect the <UNK> is an exceptionally funny character who is only mysterious and merely <UNK> out the traditional mystical <UNK> ben stiller is very amusing as well showing a weak character trying to make it into the big <UNK> of <UNK> all of the characters do and that is an area which i found <UNK> ironic that is because all of the actors are indie film actors trying to make it into the big <UNK> of hollywood br br to be honest the reason i thought it failed at the box office is that america doesn't get irony br br all in all i loved the film but i feel it would have worked better if more effort was put into <UNK> the script rather than having <UNK> cgi landscapes and effects
<START> towards the end of this thriller ally <UNK> <UNK> latter day image is used <UNK> to make up more than one <UNK> evil image she convinces one that if a nasty bette davis type role were to come her way she could carry it off brilliantly unfortunately i can't find many other reasons for seeing this if you've wondered what <UNK> looks like in a pair of old fashioned glasses but why should anyone then here's your answer for the rest sally <UNK> sex <UNK> crazy woman is really tiresome and even if you like this sort of thing more than i do you'll have to admit that the tension <UNK> badly during these scenes <UNK> drunken <UNK> of an insurance agent is equally <UNK> but at least it's a small role of the leading actors nicholas walker <UNK> no sympathy at all for paul <UNK> plight and his acting is wooden <UNK> <UNK> is better and during her scenes with <UNK> the level rises a little <UNK> <UNK> understated performance though she often seems to be on automatic pilot is admirable in itself but out of context with the rest the sets are drab the camera work <UNK>
<START> <UNK> just funny watch it br br ok they want 10 lines so there this is a spoof of 50s 70s werewolf movies lots of satire some political feels like an early <UNK> movie probably due to alan arkin but with less slap stick if you like the naked guns movies you'll like this too once again less slapstick in this one br br actually the humor <UNK> from light sexual innuendo <UNK> in a teen comedy to really poignant <UNK> political satire the transformation of the moon high school from 50s to 70s is really funny the sequence with the changing presidential <UNK> is brilliant ok maybe not brilliant but still hilarious there are tons of <UNK> cracks starting from the 50s cold war paranoia and the late 70s <UNK> br br anyway just watch the movie if you get a chance
<START> this movie is fun to watch <UNK> have much of a plot well there isn't a plot but there are good jokes and situations that you will laugh at the basic storyline is cheech is trying to have a nice date while chong is <UNK> with <UNK> cousin they smoke <UNK> go in a music store a <UNK> <UNK> a comedy club and even go into <UNK> house they don't even know rated r
<START> <UNK> murder is one of the only programs i watch regularly on tv now the way all of the main characters have something to do in each of the episodes makes it so unlike today's shows where they concentrate on 1 or 2 people per episode and everyone else is shoved to the side the way <UNK> brain works is also so obscure that you never really know what he is thinking and if you think you do you are wrong br br <UNK> murder has <UNK> a diverse range of topics not just in the cases but in each of the characters personal lives everything from racism and <UNK> to terrorists and technology br br as for it being for old people i am 24 i don't think i can be <UNK> as old yet br br i just want to know when they will be releasing all 8 seasons on dvd not <UNK> so that i can watch them all in order they seem to be doing it with lots of other programs from the same era so can they hurry it up a bit
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen everyone involved should be embarrassed everyone ice t is pitiful the dialogue is absolutely awful and <UNK> does not begin to describe the performances by every single actor in this movie the plot steals heavily from executive decision but compared to air rage executive decision is academy award material i have never been so disappointed when watching a movie air rage should be burned with its <UNK> locked in a vault never to see the light of day again anyone who has seen it should take a shower and wash the stink of horrible movie off of them the best part of this movie probably comes from the ending when the credits rolled this was easily the worst movie i have ever seen br br ice t should stick to law and order and the other people in this film should <UNK> early or commit suicide either way they should never attempt to be in a movie again
<START> back in 2004 i saw true tom <UNK> contribution to paris je t'aime when i saw it i loved it and became thrilled it became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format so much of course i wanted to watch the whole film and i would even check who was attached etc br br yesterday i finally saw it courtesy of the internet br br first of all i must say that it looks awesome the photography is beautiful in every short and shot at the worst being nothing special but still brilliant and clear later i read the trivia here and maybe it's how <UNK> in <UNK> gives more justice to all the <UNK> work my special favorites are the <UNK> de <UNK> first scene that <UNK> the sin city esquire but better for me <UNK> de la madeleine and <UNK> <UNK> but you know what the hell i like them all true or <UNK> saint denis still makes me nervous with those brilliant colours my eyes they <UNK> and <UNK> latin is gold imprisoned on silver beautiful br br yes these are some beautiful short films br br now let's get onto the content i very much and i mean very much like the <UNK> that is so successfully felt you never have have the same themes or treatment between two shorts and i think the formula is <UNK> enough to let all these artists explore beautiful and <UNK> things inside the shorts i loved coming from a simple love story into a crazy chinese musical in paris with <UNK> <UNK> into a social commentary into a terror comedy into a humble monologue i love surprises and this film has them it's great they took a chance to let all these director's flesh out things that are not usual in mainstream cinema which i have come to heavily despise it's not heavily experimental but i can breath the breathing space these people had br br i like the small time and i love the acting i love the simplicity and i love the love i like the simple feelings and the beauty and the <UNK> and in general it's a film that is very very very nice to see alone or with someone to simply feel it left me feeling very good br br there is something about the <UNK> in it it's so frank br br what i didn't like well for me there are two shorts that aren't exactly the best <UNK> de <UNK> which is good natured sure and maybe even necessary but feels too much like a commercial and <UNK> <UNK> that even though i love the acting i felt it's themes were forced but that of course is just me tour <UNK> i also didn't love but i think is probably because of my very different sensibility from that of <UNK> <UNK> i don't know if this film has a special interest for people who already know the actor's and directors and so they can delight in their interaction in the surprises look out for alexander payne in a funny role and basically in what will this director do with this great question i enjoyed it very much in that way br br i repeat now most shorts i loved and all of them together form a beautiful and energetic mix i definitely recommend it definitely so watch it if you like <UNK> beautiful love
<START> the film a universal release of a <UNK> <UNK> production is a boring retelling of the theory of breaking down the <UNK> structure of an object capturing it in a cell as pure energy and then sending it back complete to a target area there is no explanation why this is necessary but professor paul <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> actor <UNK> <UNK> devil doll thinks it's something to <UNK> his and his <UNK> pat hill mary <UNK> and chris mitchell ronald allen lives to br br during an experiment before noted dutch scientist <UNK> gordon <UNK> his machine fails due to <UNK> so he has himself projected by his secretary sheila <UNK> crisp to seek revenge of course she <UNK> up and he comes out looking like a <UNK> <UNK> with the power to <UNK> people br br with this new found power he manages to <UNK> some cockney idiots a security guy named <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> and his lab boss dr <UNK> norman <UNK> he also is able to break into a <UNK> and steal a pair of rubber <UNK> and a black coat as well br br in the end though despite hill and <UNK> attempt to help him the clown destroys his equipment and himself on the whole a completely pointless movie with no message at all br br also one of the most depressing color films you will ever see
<START> beside the fact that in all it's <UNK> this movie has <UNK> beyond all my expectations this masterpiece of cinema history portrait the <UNK> of crappy <UNK> in it's best paul johansson and craig <UNK> show a <UNK> with all there is to it as usual a woman <UNK> her true intentions the end came as surprising as <UNK> as the killing of keith scott by his older brother br br the scenes in <UNK> <UNK> are just as i remember it from my early time travels to be honest my strong passion for trash movies makes this one a must have in my never finished collection br br i recommend this movie to all the people in love with the most awesome brother cast from one tree hill br br <UNK>
<START> i am definitely in the minority opinion on this one the hurt locker has won more best picture awards from the critic groups than any other film this year however not only did i not like it i found it hard to sit through br br there is minimal plot and little character development they <UNK> bombs fight and <UNK> more bombs that is the entire movie br br but the worst part was that the camera never stops moving and is constantly shaking this has been a recent <UNK> in film making and it is supposed to make it seem more real because it has a cheap documentary look to it the camera was shaking so much it was making me <UNK> to look at the screen br br i normally don't care for war movies and the hurt locker was no exception but you don't need to take my word for it because the critics love it
<START> the film is about sir christopher strong <UNK> member of <UNK> played by colin clive and his affair with the <UNK> <UNK> like character played by <UNK> hepburn up until they met he had been a very devoted husband but when he met the odd but fascinating hepburn he couldn't help himself and they fell in love you can tell because they stare off into space a lot and talk endlessly about how painful their <UNK> love is frankly this is a terribly dated and practically impossible film to watch part of the problem is that in the pre code days films <UNK> adultery were very common plus even if you accept this morally suspect subject the utter <UNK> of the dialog make it sound like a 19th century romance novel and a really bad one at that <UNK> and with difficult to like characters after all <UNK> wife is a nice lady and did no one any harm make this one a big waste of time about the only interesting aspect of this film is the costume hepburn wears in an early scene where she is dressed in a <UNK> costume you've gotta see it to believe it and she looks like one of the <UNK> an obscure but fitting reference
<START> this show is painful to watch br br it is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show from the ever changing jobs boyfriends and cast it appears that they wanted to cast amanda <UNK> in something but had no idea what and came up with this crappy show they cast her as a teen surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy soon they realize that she needs a <UNK> and cast people in their late <UNK> to try to pass as teenagers br br how this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me somehow abc has now decided that it is a family show and thrown it into it's afternoon <UNK> on abc family
<START> i liked this movie very much because it is a true story set in the amazon a part of the world that always has intrigued me i believe a <UNK> form of the book was published in <UNK> <UNK> soon after the actual event occurred br br because i am a baby <UNK> the character and the actress are my <UNK> and for this reason i related to the film i also believe the movie is valuable for teaching survival skills if the viewer <UNK> the character's following the <UNK> that lead to the river and to the <UNK> <UNK> where she can get help as well as other survival techniques most important was her will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude in conclusion i hope viewers learn something from it in addition seeing it for entertainment br br i do wish the movie would be released in vhs and dvd soon as i should like to add it to my video collection it also should be shown more often on the satellite movie channels
<START> i can't tell you how angry i was after <UNK> this movie the characters are not the slightest bit interesting and the plot is non <UNK> so after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other hoping that the past 2 and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish what do we get a storm of <UNK> now yes i understand the references to the bible <UNK> and the underlying theme but first of all it was presented with absolutely no resolution and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible a significant portion of the population or charles <UNK> a still larger portion as a somewhat well read person i thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episode br br don't waste your time it would be better spent reading br br well anything to be honest
<START> one of the <UNK> of science fiction at least before it starts to become satire is that it be somewhat plausible i would think that an anti matter bomb would do considerably more damage than for what it was intended but i'll leave that to the <UNK> who might have seen <UNK> crisis br br it is a crisis the earth is facing because <UNK> <UNK> are getting totally out of hand they're getting close to earth so much so that it's become <UNK> hot as if the entire earth were death valley the answer is an anti matter bomb which a space ship will have to take to the sun and explode it there that will <UNK> the <UNK> off in say the direction of say <UNK> providing it's not in direct <UNK> with the earth br br who to deliver it but captain tim <UNK> and his crew that is if he can keep his mind on the business at hand and not on runaway son <UNK> <UNK> taking care of the personal side of the family problems is <UNK> charlton heston <UNK> father and <UNK> grandfather br br there's a villain here too peter boyle who is the <UNK> of a multi national corporation which in this crisis is trying to control the world's food supply for the survivors the idea he might not survive doesn't enter into his thinking he's doing his best to <UNK> <UNK> mission br br <UNK> crisis seems like a bad mix of 2001 a space odyssey and voyage to the bottom of the sea boyle seems to be taking his cue from gene hackman as lex luthor in superman apparently he's the only one in the cast who realizes he's in a turkey and overacts <UNK> br br the rest of the cast are <UNK> true blue and dull except possibly desert rat jack palance who finds <UNK> and cares for him br br the key here is that the film was directed by that noted hollywood <UNK> of flop films allen <UNK> the film gets as much as four stars for the cast involved and it was out in time for a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> joshua <UNK> first film a satire of memorable proportions is about just as the title suggests the <UNK> effect on war br br the film is about a <UNK> john cusack traveling to <UNK> not a real country <UNK> to help the american government <UNK> their message <UNK> to <UNK> leaders he meets a reporter marisa tomei and we all know what will ensue with a lonely man a hot reporter somewhere in the mix a pop star named <UNK> <UNK> gets thrown in as <UNK> is marrying one of <UNK> most important people a son of the president a subplot is created where the <UNK> must watch over this star well somewhat the film starts off with a lonely cusack in a bar no more than fifteen seconds later the film <UNK> you with it's amusing and intriguing insight on terrorism and politics the film's running time blows by you the film has a lot more action than i expected with the occasional scene of war well choreographed fights and just <UNK> scenes of murder though the story isn't much deep the simplicity of it all makes the film perfect for both the common man and movie critics alike br br in the final act of the film the simplicity of it all turns very hostile and <UNK> i thought it was executed very well but other may disagree and i could understand why twist after twist is what the ending is all about and like most films it is a true hit miss situation regardless the three writers on the film mark <UNK> jeremy <UNK> john cusack did a fantastic job creating a realistic and entertaining satire on today's situation overseas br br joshua <UNK> does an excellent job <UNK> the film's integrity not <UNK> the material to the most redundant of films which i was afraid would happen <UNK> crafted the film as perfectly as one could he created a vibrant atmosphere one that is both <UNK> harsh reality and cartoonish <UNK> <UNK> them perfectly as well as making the film feel as if you were watching it all <UNK> really gets you involved in all of the action and it pays off completely no <UNK> here hopefully he takes on more directorial jobs for he is one director to look out for
<START> this film has nothing whatever to do with the <UNK> and the title is just a come on the story concerns an imagined true and <UNK> tomb in the valley of the kings of king <UNK> i second <UNK> of the 19th <UNK> new kingdom period it is not a bad yarn and a great deal of the film is shot on location even the scenes in the winter palace hotel <UNK> in <UNK> were really shot there and not in a studio the second unit stuff is endless and they must have been let loose on egypt for weeks frank <UNK> is very good indeed as a sophisticated egyptian he should take it up as a <UNK> the film is essentially ruined by one of the world's most irritating actresses <UNK> anne down who plays the lead she spends the whole film wondering how she looks are her blue eyes <UNK> light at the correct angle do all the <UNK> lust after her etc having started life as a model at the age of ten what hope could there be for her she <UNK> everything that is most revolting about female vanity and dim witted <UNK> and to think that this film was directed by franklin <UNK> who won an oscar for <UNK> he allows this terrible actress to <UNK> and <UNK> through the film hysterical one moment <UNK> the next in a kind of <UNK> of idiocy as she <UNK> from one man to another either screaming or making bedroom eyes it matters not she is supposed to be a young <UNK> but she has never been to egypt before she takes a taxi to <UNK> and catching her first glimpse of the <UNK> <UNK> in ecstasy <UNK> they're so big ' <UNK> ok so that was the script but she takes to the <UNK> too readily giving the impression that it is her natural element which i don't doubt for a minute elements of the story are sound there is indeed a serious problem about a black market in <UNK> there true well done the novel by robin cook which i have not seen may be ok for all i know it was fun to see the name of <UNK> <UNK> as sound <UNK> on the film as i knew him pretty well long ago stanley kubrick's step daughter <UNK> is described as <UNK> i wonder what that means maybe she did some set work anyway the <UNK> in the film are pretty good actually and we get to see lots of the <UNK> museum and numerous <UNK> locations they actually go inside king <UNK> tomb i don't imagine that would be allowed today for a movie a lot of inappropriate scenes take place in <UNK> that would not go down well today but in 1981 such things were not on the agenda the music for the film is absolutely appalling worse than <UNK> anne down in fact but there were sound track elements which were surprisingly authentic one being the <UNK> of traffic noise of <UNK> which is accurately rendered in the background and would make anyone who knows <UNK> chuckle <UNK> also the <UNK> calls to <UNK> are there the whole time another touch of authenticity why didn't they get this right it could have been good
<START> i watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with a real history facts actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities anyone who watched this film now probably think of hitler as some crazy skinny lunatic who running with a gun like some chicago gangster i can only to say that there is much better films about hitler and germany in those years and that rise of evil is very much under average i can recommend german film downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of switzerland actor bruno <UNK> in a roll of <UNK> hitler
<START> guys and dolls has to be one of my favorite musical movies ever it is a very fun movie to watch and nothing more it <UNK> what people have forgotten about musicals musicals were made to entertain not to to <UNK> nowadays we have rent and chicago which are great musicals and good movies but they fail to bring us solid entertainment with no strings attached the only thing that bothered me in the movie was marlon brando the guy can't sing it was very annoying to listen to him sing and talk when i couldn't understand him if it weren't for marlon i would have given this 10 stars guys and dolls provides old fashioned entertainment that we rarely get these days watch it to have a good time
<START> ossessione adapted loosely or if it is as loose or close to the version i saw of james m <UNK> the <UNK> always rings twice with jack nicholson and jessica lange i can't be certain by first time director <UNK> visconti is no less outstanding with usage of <UNK> en scene music both <UNK> and non <UNK> and the acting i didn't know what to expect visconti to do in his approach to the material after seeing la <UNK> <UNK> and seeing how sometimes his political motivations <UNK> in a little bit but this is a totally character and emotional based drama <UNK> on melodrama however without the conventions that <UNK> down lesser ones and with the style in the finest path of the budding film noir movement visconti creates a debut that's as involving as any other neo <UNK> film neo realism by the way could rightfully be claimed as this being a <UNK> along with de <UNK> the children are watching us which that would take shape after the war although love and romance is more in play here than in some of the more famous neo <UNK> efforts it's dealt with in a bare bones storytelling fashion and it's laced with other familiar themes in neo realism the lower class death desperation br br aside from the story which is simply as it is described on this site the artistry with which visconti captures the images and then layers them with objects a <UNK> over gino <UNK> profile when in guilt shadows and darkness that tend to overcome many of the later scenes in the film usually over <UNK> and giovanna and the feel of the italian streets in many of the exterior scenes <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who would lens some of <UNK> and <UNK> films help in <UNK> the look of ossessione which is usually moving in on a character then <UNK> to read as much emotion on their faces their voices and mannerisms lovely and ugly sad and dark and romantic i think i've just <UNK> the surface on how effective it was that the film itself was moving me along even as i was in fear of the <UNK> of the two leads the two leads <UNK> <UNK> and clara <UNK> portray all the compelling truthful and near operatic emotions and the key supporting actors are also without their attributes br br it's a brilliant <UNK> adaptation and it points as a striking <UNK> of what was to come for visconti in his career
<START> what's up with robert pretentious altman was he saving on lighting everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was laughable i mean have you ever seen a <UNK> office where everyone works by <UNK> br br don't waste your time in fact don't waste your time with anything altman makes it's all a pretentious waste of film
<START> before the regular comments my main curiosity about this is not a love song is that while there's a running time listed on imdb of <UNK> minutes the dvd from <UNK> media in the united states runs <UNK> minutes any <UNK> on this is appreciated br br two friends with very rough lives take on the road for an adventure what they wind up in is just that with one accidentally shooting a girl and the two escaping by foot into the countryside rather than just a big chase the film is complicated by the the <UNK> and rather <UNK> spike behaving <UNK> and <UNK> his boom box like a teddy bear some viewers may dislike the story based solely upon the character spike but without a bit of frustration added to the story the film would have been too easy you'll notice the way the more stable character <UNK> refers to spike as big man in contrast to <UNK> kid out of control attitude and behavior frankly i too was <UNK> by <UNK> ridiculous actions especially the <UNK> can <UNK> but in a desperate situation it's apparent someone of his mentality would choose an temporary escape but <UNK> was there to keep things in check up until things get way over his head as well br br kenny <UNK> as <UNK> is a marvel and after a while i quit wondering why in the heck he would want to pick spike up from prison and continue a friendship due to <UNK> great performance after all there are many many reasons during their run that would be a good idea for <UNK> to just <UNK> spike and try to save himself i suppose <UNK> felt like a protective older brother to spike and the loyalty between the two is hard to break until things get too desperate br br while some of the cinematography is indeed artsy it does offer more flavor to story instead of just shots of the men running through the wilderness the beautiful landscapes rain and vast gray <UNK> offer a somber tone that <UNK> the feel of the tragic circumstances the score is unusual as well and the use of public image <UNK> 's song this is not a love song and as the title of the film is quite smart br br overall it's understandable if you don't care for this is not a love song as it's focused on two <UNK> personalities escaping from another man determined to hunt them down played by a cool quiet david <UNK> it's not big budget action entertainment for the rest of us that enjoy seeking out something minimal and dramatic it's time worthwhile spent and it does offer some extremely tense moments that have you holding your breath a bit br br i'm really enjoying the films coming out of scotland recently with the likes of this one dog soldiers and the devil's <UNK> i'm also a bit thankful for the subtitles offered on this dvd as the accents are sometimes lightning fast and difficult for some viewers like me to understand br br frustrating dark and often tense this is not a love song is very tragic yet engrossing storytelling br br
<START> susan <UNK> seems to have had a decent career with a few top notch credits under her belt i'm certainly glad she <UNK> back from this film which seems to have its <UNK> i'm not one of them br br i've seen better acting in high school plays than i did in <UNK> the plot such as it is involved young susan <UNK> who is ambitious to make it in the world of music and is willing to do just about anything to get there she even rejects the sincere advances of a young artist who is living out of his van off the east river played by brad <UNK> br br young mr <UNK> contributes the worst performance in the film in fact one of the worst acting jobs i've seen in a long time no wonder he's not gone anywhere br br i will say that <UNK> eye for the camera is a good one in capturing the familiar east village locations where the film was mostly shot but her work with her live performers didn't measure up i'm not sure she had that much raw material to work with br br look fast and you'll see a very young christopher <UNK> before law and order and sex in the city as a street hustler br br if you like punk rock you might sit through this for the soundtrack i'll stick to bing crosby
<START> the script for this columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980's soap opera deeply character driven films are great but only if the characters are compelling and in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel the <UNK> dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist the great lt columbo himself is no where near his famous lovable self <UNK> <UNK> self and the bride kidnap victim is a <UNK> one dimensional damsel in distress she <UNK> in fear from a tiny <UNK> held <UNK> in the hand of her <UNK> come on i could have knocked the <UNK> out of his hand and kicked him in the you know what in 2 seconds in any sense of reality this character would have at least tried to struggle or fight back at least a little and speaking of reality the story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police the police give me a break everyone knows the fbi takes over every kidnapping case this was no columbo just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar lt columbo written in and stretched to 2 hours
<START> the premise is ridiculous the characters unbelievable the dialogue trite and the ending absurd br br believe me i'm a fan of kevin kline but watching him do a <UNK> le <UNK> accent for 2 hours as a supposed frenchman is not nearly as amusing as it sounds br br for her part meg ryan is once again as <UNK> and adorable as a take your pick <UNK> doll baby puppy <UNK> whatever you happen to think is the <UNK> creature on earth she also bears not the slightest resemblance to a real human being br br this movie strikes me as an opportunity <UNK> by buddies lawrence <UNK> and kline to vacation in paris and the south of france while being well paid for it so i can't really blame them
<START> a friend clearly with no taste or class suggested i take a look at the work of ron <UNK> if this is representative of his <UNK> i never want to see anything else by him it is amateurish self indulgent criminally shoddy and self indulgent rubbish the whore <UNK> of the title is an angry low budget filmmaker who murders a bunch of <UNK> there is a little nudity and some <UNK> but no single element could possibly save this from the <UNK> <UNK> the lighting is appalling the dialog is <UNK> and mostly <UNK> and the direction is clueless i saw a <UNK> on american exploitation filmmakers during the recent <UNK> convention <UNK> was one of those featured he spoke like there was something important about his work but after a viewing of this i see nothing of any <UNK> whatsoever there is no style either and the horrible video effects like <UNK> only enhance the <UNK> not even so bad it's fun avoid
<START> best show since seinfeld she's really really funny her total self <UNK> the <UNK> gay <UNK> neighbors the <UNK> into song or cartoons make this the <UNK> show on tv one of the few shows i make point of watching the scene with the wise old black lady in the <UNK> oh wait now that you're close you do look old turns face with finger and walks away lol the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sleeping with god it's all so funny or so stupid it's just a lot of fun the shows weak points are her sister and the cop only because they're too darn normal i really can't wait until the next show something i haven't felt for any show in a long time
<START> i saw this movie in its own time period when having a baby out of <UNK> not only ruined your life but <UNK> your child as a bastard in these days of <UNK> <UNK> that may seem very far fetched but it was very true and i'm not crazy about laughing at someone who is <UNK> either between these two problems i had difficulty finding this movie funny at that time i didn't know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had i did know who betty <UNK> was and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic i loved bringing up baby but i find this movie just embarrassing i'm sure the punch at some church functions probably was <UNK> but i was the one needing a drink after watching this again the idea the girl would have to be drunk in order to <UNK> <UNK> and get pregnant just added to the misery an entire town could turn on you under these circumstances so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part of course shoot me i don't like it's a wonderful life either
<START> <UNK> <UNK> made in china is an excellent movie that depicts how two cultures have much in common but are not even aware of the influence each society has on one another david <UNK> open your eyes and allows you to see how the workers in china <UNK> <UNK> that cost little to nothing and are sold in america for up to 20 dollars when <UNK> questions americans about where these <UNK> come from they had no clue and seemed dumb <UNK> when he told them that they are made in china for less then nothing with horrible pay and <UNK> working conditions americans seemed sad hurt and a little <UNK> but didn't really seem that they would stop <UNK> the <UNK> after finding out the truth when <UNK> <UNK> the workers in china they did not know that americans were wearing them over their <UNK> and paid so much for these <UNK> the workers laughed at what the purpose was behind <UNK> and couldn't believe it this movie is a great film that gives us something to think about in other countries besides our own br br m <UNK>
<START> i enjoyed this film far more than anything had led me to <UNK> from reading other comments here i suspect it benefits enormously from being seen on a full size screen in the cinema in the company of a cheerful and enthusiastic audience i was lucky enough to have that experience <UNK> up on <UNK> of laughter from all around and had an immensely good time with this <UNK> comedy br br for it is as a comedy that it shines if it shines anywhere at all the music is nothing special in fact i hadn't realised it was a musical and was very surprised when the assembled <UNK> burst into half spoken <UNK> but i do have to admit that the half threat half promise of <UNK> what i'll do ' has proved far more catchy than it ever seemed at the time as it's still going round and round in my head br br the plot such as it is largely <UNK> around the past history of the eponymous <UNK> a <UNK> century portrait sporting a distinctly <UNK> <UNK> and fur coat her idea on the <UNK> of marriage don't quite <UNK> with those of her distant <UNK> the <UNK> angelina and one can almost hear the storyline <UNK> at the <UNK> under the strain of the production code in order to ensure that the heroine arrives <UNK> in her much <UNK> marriage bed with the right man br br the romance is <UNK> earth shattering and in fact the first few scenes played pretty well straight verge on the tedious but where script and film really come to life is in the battle of the <UNK> that follows the <UNK> of douglas fairbanks <UNK> <UNK> of betty <UNK> married angelina is <UNK> only by betty <UNK> as <UNK> pursuit of him in turn culminating in complete role <UNK> in the hilarious fantasy sequence where she literally <UNK> him off his feet this is probably the comic climax of the plot although the consequences of the <UNK> understandable confusion are worked out with a <UNK> touch in the remaining two <UNK> of the <UNK> structure and the spectacle of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> awakening is more or less worth the price of admission on its own br br <UNK> is entirely convincing in establishing her two <UNK> characters wisely gets almost all the limited singing opportunities and shares the <UNK> where the <UNK> of <UNK> dialogue in the various verbal <UNK> are concerned but in the field of <UNK> reaction she is really <UNK> by her male supporting leads fairbanks in particular is an absolute treat in a number of <UNK> sequences whose set up and humour is worthy of the silent screen br br this film is too uneven in style to be a classic varying from <UNK> <UNK> to hackneyed tedium but at its best it is quite honestly very funny indeed and brought a round of spontaneous applause and laughter across the <UNK> at the end as the lights went up out of tune with its times it may have failed to draw contemporary audiences but on this showing really didn't deserve to be <UNK> by both <UNK> and preminger the uncredited director this is no masterpiece but a thoroughly entertaining minor work and i for one found myself <UNK> in <UNK> all the way home
<START> it is one of the worst movies i've ever seen but hostel is definitely much more worse this movie is more funny and ridiculous than scary i laughed most of the time when watched it low quality effects when you gonna watch it you'll understand what i'm talking about and how low quality is that bad actors i hear of them for the first time and it seems like it's shot by an amateur camcorder so it looks more like a tv show than a movie but at least i've had the patience to watch it till the end like comedies watch it wanna horror go watch <UNK> on the grudge or some other good horror movie br br if i'm talking about the legend of <UNK> i don't even know if i can <UNK> it to a horror genre just some low budget crap br br i rate it 3 out of 10
<START> carl <UNK> lived an amazing life and <UNK> down his <UNK> on <UNK> of paper for possibly the only person who ever did anything <UNK> for him the book <UNK> a <UNK> of murder by thomas e <UNK> and james o long which came out the better part of a century after <UNK> death gives the historical context to a first generation <UNK> account of running away from home to go west and be a cowboy getting caught thrown in the boy's home getting away repeatedly and thrown into prison over and over all the time getting tortured and <UNK> as <UNK> grew huge and strong he sought to take revenge for the wrong done to him as he traveled to south america europe and africa and it didn't matter what people he raped robbed or murdered because we are all equally worthless br br this film casts skinny james woods as the rough neck mean ass son of a bitch carl <UNK> who in the film is a drunk overly dramatic and emotional and who never mentions the joy of <UNK> men and boys the film neither <UNK> on anything else particularly of note about this world <UNK> and career prisoner like robbing former president <UNK> or being released from the <UNK> prison as long as he gave his word to return in short i don't think carl would be too happy
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young french homosexual <UNK> both stereotypes and preaching it's a wonderfully <UNK> film superbly acted shot with a feel for the <UNK> town where the action takes place never melodramatic but often painfully real if anything it's almost too realistic as there's little in the way of conventional plot just scenes from a life but the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a world so subtly drawn <UNK> <UNK> might not be the most exciting film ever made but its simple <UNK> serves it well compared with the pre conceived <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> that often <UNK> <UNK> of this theme worth a watch
<START> ok don't let my summary fool you this movie sucks hard but the worst movie ever this movie was terrible in ways people shouldn't have to rack their brains to describe but it is in no way worse than <UNK> the hands of fate <UNK> horrors of spider island or a small handful of movies as a review the movie sucks it's terrible don't see it with out <UNK> or you may develop health problems but there are worse movies
<START> don't think of this movies as just another kids movie the whole family can enjoy it its a strange mix of a movie as its seems to have a movie within it but at least it does make sense at the end unlike modern films it does give you all the elements of a film decent plot good characters well it does star the muppets a list of lesser <UNK> which films would <UNK> for what is surprising is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions some sad some heartwarming some funny and some serious it all makes an enjoyable family film that everyone can watch together br br the <UNK> in the film are actually top stars of the day but there is only one true star of the film and no one dare <UNK> miss <UNK>
<START> <UNK> might just be the most incoherent and <UNK> scripted horror movie of the 80's but luckily enough it has a few <UNK> qualities like fantastic gore effects an <UNK> musical score and some terrific casting choices honestly the screenplay doesn't make one <UNK> of sense but who cares when linda blair with an <UNK> <UNK> portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and david <UNK> depicts a hunky photographer who can't seem to get laid in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo <UNK> shut lips upside down <UNK> vicious <UNK> and an <UNK> but genuinely creepy tune eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of <UNK> the young couple is there to investigate the <UNK> dark history the dysfunctional family with a pregnant linda blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his <UNK> are considers re opening the hotel and the <UNK> female architect simply <UNK> along for casual sex they're forced to stay the night in the <UNK> hotel and then suddenly the previous <UNK>  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of <UNK> jump out of a window anyway the plot is definitely of minor importance in an italian horror franchise that started as an <UNK> spin off of the evil dead the atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film there's something <UNK> morbid and unsettling about staring at a <UNK> woman hanging upside down a <UNK> and waiting to get fried
<START> here's another movie that should be loaded into a satellite fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy <UNK> to show distant possible <UNK> the best of humanity this movie is so <UNK> stupid and <UNK> honest in being little more than a rip off of the already bad movie classic king kong from 1976 that it not only manages to <UNK> that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic <UNK> but successfully predicted much of peter jackson's miserable 2005 computer cartoon bearing the same name as far as a romance between the giant here a yeti and a gorgeous human female <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> city of the living dead who is very easy on the eyes br br the film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre <UNK> <UNK> to say goodbye you can forget about sex the yeti even has a sort of giant jock <UNK> to cover up his monstrous package the result being even more amusing than <UNK> correctness but as a trade off you do get a wacky old scientist two <UNK> kids tony <UNK> in a rare turn as a <UNK> bastard of a villain a helpful intelligent <UNK> dog who gets to have her own adventure dog adventure movies were big in europe for a while and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the yeti who turns out to be the good guy glorious stuff like front end <UNK> <UNK> to look like giant ape hands a monster who's size literally changes scale from shot to shot some <UNK> horrible deaths that will make the carnage in godzilla vs the <UNK> monster look tame by comparison crowd reaction shots a plenty made up of either spanish italian or canadian extras depending upon scene you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed and some of the most <UNK> staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie br br it's here that the film won me over it's enthusiasm just for being made frank kramer is actually the same <UNK> <UNK> who brought the world <UNK> in 1968 and god's gun the year before this was a very important director in the spaghetti western and action adventure genre film scene from the 1960's 1970's and by the time of yeti he was probably delighted to get the work i would say that this is his most <UNK> movie ever or rather the one he took the most chances with and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids families the movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that <UNK> the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless or rather they are part of the fun and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldn't have worked which is exactly why peter jackson's movie sucked br br he forgot to have fun with the material and let it <UNK> the outcome using his army of stupid power <UNK> <UNK> people animators and with all it's faults <UNK> <UNK> yeti is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this which is partly to see actors in ape suits <UNK> apart <UNK> sets on sound stages not <UNK> animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space i'd rank this up there with king kong versus godzilla and it curse of the great <UNK> as one of the most <UNK> improbable giant <UNK> monster movies ever because the movie looks so fake you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get <UNK> <UNK> tossed about and <UNK> knowing that and armed with a <UNK> energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie <UNK> pulled out all the stops and delivers a full <UNK> adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small <UNK> but is the first movie i will ever share with the <UNK> someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend this is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid br br 10 10 it's about ten minutes too long but who cares you only come around once and i'd rather go out with a smile on my face
<START> while watching this movie i came up with a script for a movie called the making of 10 items or less br br producer i've got good news and bad news the good news is we can get morgan freeman br br writer that's great but what's the bad news br br producer we can only afford to hire him for one day i guess we'll have to get someone else br br writer so we hire him for one day a movie is an hour and a half long a work day is eight hours long i fail to see a problem br br producer but he'll have to spend time getting into character br br writer so we have him play a character who is essentially himself br br producer but he'll still need to understand his motivation and all that you're not saying we have him play a big name actor that's doing a low budget movie are you br br writer why not br br producer that's ridiculous but fine at least we'll have morgan freeman in our movie and i guess we have to set the movie in los angeles too br br writer of course br br producer this script is a load of crap we'd better make money on this just in case have morgan <UNK> character plug wal mart or target or one of those stores so at least someone will want to sell the dvds br br writer sure thing br br producer wait a second what's this about a tiny <UNK> with a ten items or less express lane br br writer oh i guess that is pretty weird but we can't change the title now br br i doubt my script actually bears much resemblance to reality but then neither did 10 items or less this is a case of good acting but bad writing and i hate to see it happen when watching an independent movie you expect it to try to convey some sort of message i think they might have been trying for the tired old don't let anything hold you back message that has been done to death in much better films in any case with 10 items or less the only message i got was look look at morgan freeman
<START> what ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant <UNK> of our time well he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that could've been directed by anybody available out of film school and in fact they probably would've done a better job they would've at least have put half of a thought into the dreadful script br br mark <UNK> plays an astronaut who traveled through some sort of <UNK> and landed in a planet ruled by apes gasp except this time around the apes <UNK> through <UNK> worthy dialogue nonsensical plotting and <UNK> special effects that constantly <UNK> in my mind that this money could've been put to about 10 independent films that would have been considered <UNK> next to this tripe br br as much as i enjoy the superb acting talent that is tim roth his performance as evil ape leader <UNK> is nothing more than an intense composition of <UNK> and heavy breathing luckily for him the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap dialogue is hidden behind his <UNK> and <UNK> br br and alas the always <UNK> hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and <UNK> them up at the end without any relationship development or cause and the haha we're so clever aren't we way that hollywood <UNK> references from the original <UNK> into this one sigh br br instead of seeing this spend the night in and call up some friends and rent <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or even to a lesser extent <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> about the days when tim burton was a man of vision and originality not shame and <UNK>
<START> this movie was awesome it made me laugh it make a <UNK> and most of all it has talking animals in it this movie should be seen by all kinds of people it is one of my favorite movies and i just love it so much that i just had to comment on it it <UNK> it is so heart felt and a wonderful storyline that makes up a great and heartfelt movie my favorite character is shadow this is because i think that he is the most interesting and charming i used to have a golden <UNK> just like shadow i miss him so much he was my best friend and i knew that when he died he would be in a happier place but i miss him with all of my heart this movie is the best i love it and everyone should love your pets no matter what they do <UNK> them forever
<START> the week before i saw <UNK> i saw art school <UNK> in which a pretentious student makes a film and can't decide whether he wants it to be art or violent exploitation <UNK> could be the film that he made i can see elements of much better movies in <UNK> <UNK> and natural born killers however in addition to <UNK> both those movies had good character development and coherent story lines <UNK> this movie stumbles to a preposterous end i have to admit that it had <UNK> this movie is bad from beginning to end and not particularly worse or better in any part the actors all did what they could <UNK> arquette deserves better she demonstrates that she is very talented very funny and very sexy but why does she have to demonstrate it in this turd ball
<START> a great film this and a shame that it will receive little attention outside of <UNK> circles and students who stay up until two in the morning to watch it on channel four br br the plot is a simple one but works very effectively the <UNK> between child like fantasy and hard hitting nightmare is very well <UNK> the budget looks pretty low but to the credit of those involved it doesn't show too often it also hasn't dated that much either br br i was lucky enough to tape this off the telly when it was on a few years ago and it has <UNK> half a dozen viewings it's one of those films that won't appeal to all though as usual those with a more thoughtful approach to cinema would get a lot out of this br br charlotte <UNK> puts in a good performance as anna the <UNK> brat and it is a shame she seems to have gone from the acting scene cross is also very good carrying the stature of his character very well within the context of the picture br br there are some genuinely and i don't say that lightly disturbing moments in this film both half second <UNK> and more drawn out tensions watch it with the lights out br br highly recommended br br 9 10 br br
<START> i had to shut this off after about 15 <UNK> moments br br i was hoping it might improve br br what i saw was badly acted directed written br br this movie should never even have been released directly to dvd br br the lead character who is a bride top be from hell has an huge ice <UNK> fall on her killing her she was such a revolting person i was not even sorry for her she winds up there in a sort of heaven was still repulsive i left shortly after br br eve longoria portrays her i hope i never see her again she cant even act she is just plain annoying br br paul rudd an actor who normally can do no wrong also was in this dud br br jason <UNK> no longer a teen is also present br br i do like comedies but not stupid ones about stupid people br br rating out of 4 30 points out of 100 imdb 2 out of 10
<START> this film was released the year i was born and will be like me 70 in 2007 i watched it again last night having not seen it since high school while it was full of 30's sentiment and the acting was a bit stereotyped nevertheless it was superb pearl s <UNK> story did come alive through the magic of the chemistry of <UNK> rainer and paul muni the novel which earned ms buck the <UNK> prize for literature comes alive under the <UNK> of sydney franklin which along with an excellent script <UNK> the story of <UNK> farmer wang lung whose father <UNK> a bride for him a slave girl from the kitchen of a local <UNK> in <UNK> story <UNK> success is <UNK> by his <UNK> to listen to his wife most of the time and the love of the land in the end he comes to realize that his wife like the land is the source of his wealth happiness and <UNK> <UNK> stories always had strong women cast in a critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the pre feminist world the german born <UNK> rainer brings a <UNK> but determined <UNK> chinese woman to life in her portrayal of <UNK> muni likewise captures the naive but honorable wang eventually caught between the two worlds of the wealthy and the <UNK> other classic characters include charlie <UNK> dorothy <UNK> <UNK> uncle henry from the wizard of oz walter <UNK> as the <UNK> conniving uncle and <UNK> luke as number one son but this time not charlie chan's br br a classic might be defined as a movie you can watch time and again and never tire of if that's indeed the case this film is a classic no doubt whatsoever
<START> this an free adaptation of the novels of clarence <UNK> fans of the <UNK> <UNK> films will probably feel a little at sea here and the reviews here so far reflect that but i knew of <UNK> from the novels first and never cared much for the <UNK> films once i got around to them br br christopher coppola has made a wise choice he has not made a nostalgic western instead he has approached the cassidy story as a slice of what we used to call <UNK> or what older critics once called <UNK> as the film <UNK> i found myself more and more reminded of the great hallmark theater version of mark <UNK> <UNK> it with james garner <UNK> br br both these films remind us that although films about the <UNK> <UNK> are probably always to be <UNK> for americans they need not be <UNK> they can very well be just films about what it meant to be american in that time in that place br br i never feel <UNK> to watching this film there's no effort to <UNK> the <UNK> cassidy legacy down our throats no irony no camp consequently i get a sense of these characters as having walked or ridden <UNK> across some real western america i too could have walked a hundred years ago br br given that the <UNK> of the film it positively avoids anything we have come to call style is all to its favor and the plain acting of the performers fits neatly in with this gosh it really does feel like some story told around a <UNK> on a cattle drive no visual dressing just the quirks and good humor and sudden violence that we expect from the good narration of an adventure yarn i was very pleasantly surprised by this film and if the viewer sets aside <UNK> expectations he or she will find considerable pleasure in it br br i would have given this film 9 stars but i'll give it a ten just because most reviewers here have missed the point completely and i urge them to set their memories of <UNK> aside and give this film another chance br br note 1 a reviewer complained that <UNK> shoots people dead in this film rather than shooting the guns out of their hands ala <UNK> cassidy first cassidy does shoot people dead in the novels second if cassidy were a real cowboy he would have shot people dead the problem with shooting guns out of people's hands is that they can always get another gun which happens to be part of the subtext of this very film br br note 2 i admit that i am jealous of the coppola family that they have the director of the godfather among them who can get them all opportunities to make movies that i can't but a good movie is a good movie and this is a good movie if it's by somebody by the name coppola well that's just is as it is america is the land of opportunity or was until bush got into office that's what the great american novels are all about
<START> i saw this movie not knowing anything about it before hand the plot was terrible with large gaps of information missing the movie didn't have the battle of wits feel to me the actors just <UNK> out <UNK> of nonsense at times causing me to <UNK> my teeth in agony as they <UNK> on and on the plot was predictable except for the stomach sickening <UNK> erotic scene at the end i'm not <UNK> but made me physically sick to my stomach even the ending was predictable and you could tell the detective was jude law in a costume everything from the fake accent terrible dental work costume shop facial hair everything pointed to it being a disguise the whole movie just felt like wasted time out of my life this movie had the feel of a puppet show with jude law and michael caine as puppets and the house as the window to view the show really <UNK> in my opinion
<START> this movie was so predictable its a complete rip off of those i was abused by daddy i'm gonna kill women movies stupid scenes bad acting unoriginal storyline really low budget piece of crap film br br don't waste your time people trust me br br my rating 0 5 0
<START> for anyone who has only seen disney productions beautifully animated version of <UNK> the <UNK> or even jean <UNK> surreal fairy tale vision will be quite taken <UNK> by this 1975 french but with a director from <UNK> version the plot concerns a french family of <UNK> <UNK> that is marrying into a well to do english family the major catch is that the <UNK> is carrying an ancient curse on the family the film also includes many flashback sequences potentially explaining this family curse from the opening credits to the very end it's a nearly non stop erotic fun house ride with some very explicit graphic sexual content hence the film's x rating in the u s in it's initial run which is now <UNK> the film's somewhat <UNK> sentiment at the <UNK> class will probably remind one of <UNK> <UNK> into similar territory if you have a taste for the truly bizarre and are not offended by taboo material then this film may just scratch that <UNK> for you
<START> this is an excellent fast paced thriller by wes craven nightmare on elm street who for 85 minutes leaves aside the supernatural and presents us with something even more terrifying the evil of human beings we are far more likely to encounter the <UNK> evil of jackson <UNK> than freddy <UNK> and cillian murphy batman begins does an excellent job of presenting a <UNK> friendly even charismatic killer the performances by murphy and by rachel mcadams claire from the wedding <UNK> are brilliant most of the film takes place on a very intimate level between two people their eyes their faces it is action on a small scale not the broad <UNK> of the <UNK> and it is no less compelling for these limitations the cinematography is nothing special though of course one can do only so much with a camera in the confines of a passenger jet but the dialog is excellent the story taut there are no <UNK> no subplots confuse the issue which is at its heart a battle between the main characters by keeping his focus and avoiding <UNK> wes craven is able to take what is a very minimal plot and turning it into an exciting fast paced action thriller
<START> <UNK> wayne <UNK> rick <UNK> is preparing to <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> machine to the <UNK> institution as he and his wife diane eve gordon get ready for a long weekend away from their son adam bug hall wayne's brother gordon stuart <UNK> his wife patty robin <UNK> and his kids jenny allison mack and mitch jake richardson <UNK> to look after adam while his parents are away but as luck would have it and the title would lead you to expect the grown ups are accidentally <UNK> by wayne's <UNK> ray as the kids run amok their <UNK> folks must <UNK> with <UNK> huge insects <UNK> in the carpet that look like <UNK> and other <UNK> to them this was bad like most straight to video sequels are honey we <UNK> ourselves was sort of laughable i had to laugh at that movie roach stuart <UNK> and the party bullies were even more ridiculous view at own risk
<START> no comment stupid movie acting average or worse screenplay no sense at all skip it
<START> i loved long way round and wasn't even aware of race to <UNK> until i saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket i bought it and after a slightly <UNK> will this be as <UNK> first episode i decided that it was charlie <UNK> was great as were the other members of the crew great to see him with ewan again there was a fair bit of swearing in it but that didn't bother me as for their being no mention of it on the package thats more to do with the silly <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> that the <UNK> have they should have given it a 15 just for the language alone br br highly recommended series i want more
<START> i rented this movie because i was <UNK> through the horror movie section for those movies that no one's heard of and could be a possible gem i saw this and since i'm a fan of violence and gore i got it it got the rating of em which means extremely mature thinking that this rare and high rating was totally meant for violence and everything else i got it the warning on the box said extreme violence extreme <UNK> and nudity the extreme violence struck my fancy the movie ended being a pretty tame slasher flick it had one or two gory scenes but i've seen worse in a pg 13 movie of course the amount of gore in a movie isn't all that counts right you have plot also well the plot was boring and there nothing really special about it don't rent it i speak the truth i can't imagine how someone could really enjoy it to the point where they say i'm gonna rent that again it had it's moments where it kept you going but i'm never going to see that film again
<START> my 2 year old likes the <UNK> show it seems to keep his attention for awhile the characters are interesting vibrant with primary colours and all there's not much educational content that the intended target audience could benefit from but they do seem to have a theme each show and try to teach kids about sharing and respect and other <UNK> so i like it for that it's well produced with high production values but it's really just an average show like most of the shows on tv these days we don't buy into the <UNK> angle and have our son wearing everything <UNK> i don't think we'd spend money to go to a live show if they ever came to town going to the <UNK> or the science centre is a far better experience for everyone involved and in my opinion is money better spent
<START> this short film that inspired the soon to be full length feature <UNK> madness is a hilarious piece that <UNK> against similar cartoons <UNK> multiple writers the short film stars edward the <UNK> who after being fired from his job joins in the fight against the evil <UNK> this premise allows for some funny content near the beginning but is barely present for the remainder of the feature this film's 15 minute running time is absorbed by some odd ball comedy and a small musical number unfortunately not much else lies below it the plot that is set up doesn't really have time to show but it's surely follows it plot better than many high budget hollywood films this film is worth watching at least a few times take it for what it is and don't expect a deep story
<START> c'mon people you can't be serious another case of advertising snuff when it totally isn't this isn't even remotely scary nor is it terrifying or <UNK> it is just utterly terrible amateurish <UNK> made for the next party to get the girls laid br br the gore is incredibly bad even the eye scene is far from making me want to <UNK> but just making me want to take the camera and hit those guys over the head the girl is just laying there rubber faced not moving at all it would have been funnier to use a real doll instead br br one season of i'm a celebrity get me out of here is more frightening than this one don't waste your time or your money
<START> reese <UNK> first movie loved it the plot and the acting was top notch you are emotionally involved with the characters in my opinion a must see br br after watching this movie you will see why reese <UNK> acting career has been so successful br br the other cast members do a great job also br br the movie flows extremely well there is not a boring moment in the whole picture the man in the <UNK> length is just right br br as i said earlier i think this movie was excellent i have seen it numerous times and have enjoyed every one of the viewings
<START> the cast of this film contain some of new <UNK> better actors many of who i have seen in fabulous roles this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them the fake american accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong as another review rather <UNK> noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry <UNK> with a few of the multi colour <UNK> stolen from a used car lot most of the cast appear to be from the great long running new zealand soap <UNK> street it's as if this movie was <UNK> up at a <UNK> street cast christmas party the result of too many <UNK> and possibly a bit of <UNK> imagine under siege meets the love boat staged by your local primary school and directed by an <UNK> and you get the idea br br if you are an actor i recommend you see this film as a study on how to destroy your <UNK>
<START> a truly horrible film that left me feeling <UNK> by having watched the forty minutes or so i could stand not the actors' fault but the writer director producers <UNK> etc need a very stiff talking to maybe it thinks it is profound it isn't this rape and ultra violence unlike that central to clockwork orange has nothing to say about or add to the sum of human understanding it's no straw dogs either to which i have seen it compared rather it feels like something pete walker might have turned his hand to yet even in saying that i'm probably being a bit unfair on pete walker br br revenge is a powerful human desire but the bedroom window has more to say about that and male <UNK> than this pitiful effort br br i don't think it's particularly misogynistic merely too <UNK> in its depiction of certain details the blood running down <UNK> leg post rape par example it's neither challenging nor <UNK> though i'm sure the film makers consider themselves very <UNK> just deeply unpleasant br br is this as high as we can aim is this why those involved wanted to make films i did write in here the latin phrase which <UNK> as oh the times oh the customs but the new spell check on imdb wouldn't let me post until i had removed it likewise i had to remove square <UNK> get it <UNK> imdb br br where is the <UNK> <UNK> the noble <UNK> when you look at british film the <UNK> comedies of ealing or the <UNK> brothers carol <UNK> work with graham greene on fallen idol our man in <UNK> or the sublime the third man a film which has far more to say about evil than a thousand <UNK> the work of powell <UNK> or if you want to talk about sex violence and male <UNK> look at the <UNK> <UNK> sidney lumet from an original play by john hopkins check out tunes of glory for something worth making that has something to say br br unlike the <UNK> <UNK> is alas an altogether hateful waste of celluloid
<START> <UNK> was made in 2000 but it is being released on video 5 years later for some reason i wonder why could it be the confusing storyline the incomprehensible dialogue said by oliver <UNK> and the annoying editing it's got to be i think the plot was mary michelle forbes and <UNK> oliver <UNK> go on a mystical road trip they meet a lot of wacky characters and avoid some evil ones too the movie looks great and there is a lot of style but there is no substance most movies when trying to subtle don't call attention to themselves with unanswered plot developments and weak special effects br br don't be fooled by the cover willem dafoe is in it for 2 minutes at most
<START> imagine you're a high school boy in the back of a dark <UNK> theater with your girlfriend how bad would a movie have to be in order that you would feel compelled to leave the theater and head home before it ended this movie is that bad really movies often become so bad that they're good this movie is beyond that stage of bad <UNK> it is painfully bad horribly terribly crime against humanity bad
<START> i had high expectations of this movie the title translated is how we get rid of the others after all the concept is great a near future in which the <UNK> elite has taken the consequence of the right wing <UNK> constant verbal and <UNK> <UNK> of so called <UNK> and the left wing in general and decided to just kill off everyone who cannot prove that they're <UNK> something to the establishment the establishment being called the common good but actually meaning the interests of the <UNK> <UNK> ideology br br very cool idea ideal for biting satire only this movie completely blows its chance the satire comes out only in a few scenes and performances of absurdity but this satire is not <UNK> it is neither sharp nor witty and for an alleged comedy the movie has nearly no funny scenes the comedy i assume is supposed to be in the absurdity of the situations but the situations are largely uncomfortable and over serious rather than <UNK> either laughter or thought br br the script is <UNK> with grave errors in <UNK> the action should have focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be to do such a thing but instead <UNK> of time are spent on a young woman who was the one that wrote the new laws for fun and who's trying to save everybody by <UNK> a resistance that ships people to africa all this is beside the point a movie like this should not pretend to be so serious it's a satire a political statement but it doesn't even begin to actually address the problem it's supposed to be about maybe it was afraid of going too far how cowardly that's not art it's not even real satire br br <UNK> <UNK> a very serious and by now one of <UNK> absolutely senior actors was very good he largely carried what little entertainment value the movie had everybody else nothing special well perhaps except for <UNK> <UNK> who did supply a convincing performance br br in fact a problem with most danish movies is that the language never sounds natural neither the <UNK> nor the delivery why is it so difficult to make it sound right why must it be so stilted and artificial i hope when people look at these movies fifty years from now they don't think that this was how people talked in general danish society br br 3 out of 10
<START> undeveloped unbelievable story line by the time i sort of figured out where it was going i no longer cared bad casting come on william macy as a hit man bad directing have you ever seen <UNK> <UNK> perform so badly was i supposed to care what happened to the <UNK> incompetent <UNK> john ritter character bad script really i'm not looking for a formula script but this was really awful the only really good thing in it was the kid ten lines it's not ok if your comment is less than ten lines come on whose rules are those why can't i say what i have to say in less than 10 lines isn't that kind of <UNK> why isn't it ok to have less than 10 lines of comment
<START> cliff robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers a <UNK> worthy performance here if there ever was one it's as if director michael anderson kept yelling <UNK> it down think zombie only less lively through his little <UNK> as he <UNK> <UNK> effort the rest of the cast is barely better jennifer <UNK> of <UNK> run fame is hardly seen in what should have been fleshed out as a pivotal role if the quality of the acting was three times better if some of the more <UNK> plot holes were filled and if the pacing were given a shot of <UNK> then this <UNK> might be brought up to a standard acceptable to the hallmark lifetime tv channel crowd as is its rating is so inexplicably high one can't help thinking <UNK> <UNK> are using <UNK> to catch a little <UNK> time perhaps the late night tv <UNK> are missing a major opportunity in not <UNK> it as such
<START> the blob starts with one of the most bizarre theme songs ever sung by an uncredited burt <UNK> of all people you really have to hear it to believe it the blob may be worth watching just for this song alone my user comment summary is just a little taste of the classy lyrics after this unnerving opening credits sequence the blob introduces us the viewer that is to steve andrews steve mcqueen as steven mcqueen his girlfriend jane martin <UNK> <UNK> who are <UNK> on their own somewhere witness what looks like a <UNK> falling to earth in nearby woods an old man <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> who lives in a cabin also sees it goes to investigate he finds a <UNK> a strange football sized rock which <UNK> open when he <UNK> <UNK> it with a stick laying in the centre of the <UNK> is a strange <UNK> like substance which sticks to the stick if you know what i mean it then <UNK> up the stick <UNK> itself to the old man's hand meanwhile steve jane are quietly driving along <UNK> their own business when the old man runs out in front of <UNK> car steve being a decent kinda guy decides to take the old man to dr t <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> chase as steven chase at the local surgery dr <UNK> says he doesn't know what the substance on the old man's hand is but it's getting bigger asks steve to go back where he found him see if he can find out what happened steve agrees but doesn't come up with anything upon returning to dr <UNK> surgery he witnesses the blob <UNK> him the town's police lieutenant dave earl <UNK> the teenage hating sergeant jim bert john benson <UNK> don't believe a word of it end up <UNK> steve his mates al anthony <UNK> tony robert fields someone called <UNK> miller james <UNK> of playing an elaborate practical joke on the police department however as the blob continues to eat it's way through the town steve sets about finding proof of it's existence convincing the police about the threat it <UNK> not just to their town but the entire world br br directed <UNK> s <UNK> jr an uncredited russell s <UNK> jr i was <UNK> disappointed by this the original 1958 version of the blob the script by kay <UNK> as kate phillips theodore <UNK> is an absolute bore extremely dull not making the most of it's strongest aspects the blob focuses on the tiresome <UNK> conflicts between the teenagers police in fact the majority of the blob is spent on steve trying to convince the police of the <UNK> existence for most of the film the blob itself almost seems <UNK> somewhat forgotten it only has two or three scenes for the fist hour a bit until the less than exciting climax when the adults teenagers have to work together to defeat the blob have a new found appreciation of each other afterwards <UNK> why couldn't the blob just eat the lot of 'em no explanation is given for what the blob is or it's origins other than it came from space how long did it take them to come up with that the dialogue is clunky silly as well as are people's actions decision making i love the part when a nurse named kate lee <UNK> as lee <UNK> did anyone use their real name in this thing is confronted by the blob she throws some acid over it <UNK> <UNK> doctor nothing will stop it how does she know <UNK> will stop it exactly there's no blood or violence so don't worry about that the special effects on the blob itself aren't too bad considering but it barely has any screen time moves very slowly a bit like the film in general actually the acting is terrible mcqueen is supposed to be a teenager when in reality he was 28 years old it shows he looks old enough to be his own dad same thing goes for most of the other <UNK> cast members everyone generally speaking are wooden unconvincing in their roles technically the blob is very basic dark static photography dull direction forgettable production values the blob is one of those films that probably sounds good on paper is well known as being a <UNK> but is in actual fact a huge disappointment when finally seen this is one case when the remake the blob 1988 is definitely better than the original the original blob is slow boring the remake isn't the original blob contains no blood or gore the remake does the original blob has incredibly poor acting casting decisions the remake doesn't the original blob itself gets very little screen time eating only three or four people throughout the entire film the remake features the blob all the way through it virtually eats an entire town the choice is an easy one the remake every time as it's a better film in every respect i'll give the film two stars give that wonderful main theme song one on it's own definitely not the classic many seem to make out
<START> this movie is a fantastic movie everything about it in my opinion was top notch from the acting to the directing i know mr garfield was <UNK> in the 1950's but the majority of his other films are on video if not dvd that being the case why isn't this one a friend recorded it off of tcm for me but to have it on dvd would be great for special features they could have say a marine <UNK> talk about the battle and if mr <UNK> wife or son are still alive they could be interviewed as well anyway this is a great movie and i highly recommend it if it ever is put out hopefully it won't be <UNK> <UNK> it would in my opinion just ruin the whole effect of the film the battle scene was quite realistic as far as a 1945 film would go mr garfield did a superb job of portraying mr <UNK> some actors might have been tempted to <UNK> the part of mr <UNK> <UNK> but i feel he got it just right i sincerely hope they come out with this movie on dvd someday as a tribute to the courage of al <UNK> and all the other marines who sacrificed so much for us in world war two
<START> i <UNK> maybe it's because i'm brazilian but all that stuff was too much too much love for the music too much parties too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters come on it's not so sad and the aspect of the city shown by the director everything looks too fake to me the families the relationships the music the happiness it simply sells a little taste of fake <UNK> culture i must be honest it did seduce me a little but who would not be <UNK> by that fake lives made of nice music sex and parties i'm not that stupid what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer of <UNK> profound sadness and <UNK> i liked the scene with <UNK> mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the spanish people
<START> this may have been made for the hell of it but it was most probably the worst film i've seen in years the best thing about the entire dvd would be the case i'm surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too i'm glad i only rented i suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and gothic to care about it without taking in any cgi or any other effects for that matter i hope alex <UNK> <UNK> a lesson about lighting and <UNK> to make a better film in the future that is if he is still in work br br notes to <UNK> this is extremely disappointing don't buy it
<START> this movie is suppose to be a mysterious serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl however 30 minutes into the movie it turns into a funny unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes i can't imagine anyone not laughing when cage randomly karate kicks that blonde girl or when he bear punches that old lady the lines characters and acting are all poorly done from the get go i've always liked nicolas cage as an actor but he has made some terrible movies this year this being by far the worst one yet br br i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an intense story gripping thriller if you really want to enjoy this story go rent the original however if you intend on watching it get ready to laugh at some of the lines and end scenes rather than taking them seriously that's the only way you enjoy this film
<START> i gave this 3 stars out of a possible 10 because the stories are open ended and left unexplained and because of the nauseating scenes of someone eating in an extremely disgusting way plus scenes of a <UNK> corpse br br neither of the above needed to be shown in such a graphic manner br br the film's plot such as it is concerns three loosely <UNK> stories none of which conclude <UNK> br br the bounty hunter played by bruce dern is the character that <UNK> all three vignettes br br first we have dylan mcdermott looking darn fine as a wanted criminal who is fleeing to mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter when he rides through a border town and spots a sad faced saloon girl played by helen hunt br br then we have one of the <UNK> girls not sure which one playing a western wife out on the lonely frontier who goes over to see about a neighbor woman an attractive <UNK> whom we soon realize has been out in the <UNK> a little too long br br the conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him with the final scene in the film being completely beyond rational <UNK>
<START> wasn't sure what to expect from this movie considering its amazing collection of stars and directors but in the end it didn't disappoint br br for me one of the highlights was the final episode with the american tourist speaking with a dreadful french accent which made me feel better about mine which was actually quite touching and a great way to wrap up the movie br br the story of the <UNK> and the stabbing victim was also very moving and for pure comedy the <UNK> brothers and steve <UNK> take the award the tom <UNK> clip was also impressive although rather ambitious in its scope br br however the bob <UNK> segment was totally <UNK> and the vampire story was completely <UNK> the dialogue in wes craven's section also felt very forced and the <UNK> story was completely incomprehensible br br on the whole this film is worth watching for the good bits and has a strong finish it's not too painful to sit through the bad sections they only last 5 minutes anyway br br <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK>
<START> expecting a combination of scifi and period film about <UNK> <UNK> charles <UNK> the history of computers etc i was disappointed by this movies nonsensical <UNK> and mixture of real and fabulous history it gives the impression that its writer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has no real understanding of the <UNK> technology or history <UNK> the film's subject but is working instead from a sort of fuzzy artistic impression of them this hits a sore spot with me as i've long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to <UNK> onto and awfully <UNK> science terms and ideas to the point of confusion <UNK> emmy <UNK> information waves have a half life <UNK> i'm not at all certain that half a life is better than no life at all br br this movie does worse than fail to entertain it <UNK> the only redeeming value i can imagine for it is that it might attract a viewer to learn about the subject it so badly <UNK> it's more likely i think to promote a <UNK> perception of science and technology of any degree of <UNK> as <UNK> from magic
<START> kings and queen is a <UNK> french drama that <UNK> on for an interminable two hours and thirty two minutes to no discernible point or purpose br br the film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie the first centers around nora and her struggles with various men in her life including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live the other story involves a young man named <UNK> a <UNK> who finds himself placed unfairly he believes in a mental institution through the <UNK> of an unknown third party after traveling along on separate tracks for awhile these two narrative <UNK> eventually come together when we learn that <UNK> is a former lover of <UNK> and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier tragic relationship br br with a bit more focus and a considerable amount of <UNK> kings and queen might have been a potent engrossing drama about modern day relationships it certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power and the performances are for the most part complex and touching but taken as a whole the film <UNK> and <UNK> to such an extent that quite frankly it begins to <UNK> havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on even more <UNK> is the fact that even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people we really don't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over for instance <UNK> father on his <UNK> writes a <UNK> <UNK> against his daughter's character that simply doesn't <UNK> with the woman we've been looking at for well over two hours nora is admittedly no mother <UNK> then again who is but she certainly doesn't deserve the <UNK> thrown at her by her very own father nora could be accused of being confused <UNK> a bit self absorbed at times but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place i don't think so br br perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that i was unable to <UNK> but my suspicion is that even writer roger <UNK> and co writer director <UNK> <UNK> would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here this is a well acted pretentious bore of a film that takes the viewer on a long rambling voyage through a sea of personal <UNK> a journey that leaves him no <UNK> or more <UNK> at the end than he was at the beginning
<START> it's just breathtaking in it's awfulness you really must see it br br depending on your perspective dylan walsh is either the <UNK> or the problem here since he's the only one on screen that can actually get his lines out with something akin to natural <UNK> and <UNK> he either ruins the movie by pointing up everyone else's flaws or he saves it by providing some context for their awfulness br br i'm inclined to the later view thanks to him it works as high comedy he's the 7 <UNK> in a game of dwarf basketball his skill set just doesn't apply in this context and his <UNK> is delicious br br the real treat though is ms eastwood whose inability to speak in plain english is so <UNK> i actually <UNK> her expecting to learn that she was a russian beauty who <UNK> her lines <UNK> with no understanding of their meaning but no she's just a talent free american who will leave you laughing with every line she drops whether she knew what the lines meant must remain an open question
<START> i ended up watching this movie before even going through any of the reviews on the request of a female just out of curiosity i thought let me find out if there are people who actually recommend others to watch this movie i am quite shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this website that makes me conclude that it's a <UNK> br br as far as my opinion goes i have to ask are these filmmakers retarded or do they assume that the viewers are retarded the movie is atrocious on so many levels and i'm not even talking about the story or presentation br br so these bunch of guys plus one girl the lead actress form a music band guessing from the constant presence of <UNK> it is supposed to be a rock band hell when did dancers started becoming the part of a rock band anyway let me accept it as the bollywood version of a rock band but <UNK> enough all the scores which actually had these two <UNK> doing all kinds of cool rock gestures and i am assuming they were playing the <UNK> the sound of the guitar was completely missing i simply can't comprehend the <UNK> of stupidity here br br i am just going to conclude here because it is absolutely not worth pointing out any further flaws in the movie bollywood directors seem to have no shame anymore
<START> the <UNK> see something else br br this film was highly rated by gene <UNK> but after watching it i can't figure out why the film is definitely original and different it even has interesting dialogue at times some cool moments and a creepy noir feel but it just isn't entertaining it also doesn't make a whole lot of sense in plot but especially in character motivations i don't know anyone that behaves like these characters do br br this is a difficult movie to take on i suggest you don't accept the challenge
<START> once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent <UNK> with some former co stars to clean up the town br br low key often to the point of <UNK> action comedy mostly just doesn't work part of the problem is the casting chris <UNK> as a former action hero he's not bad but he's really not believable as some one who was taken to be a tough guy as i said he's not bad he's just just miscast for what his back story is the real problem here is the combination of the script which really isn't funny and seems artificial at times and the direction which is pedestrian to the <UNK> of <UNK> there is no life in the way things are set up its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list it makes for an un engaging film and yet the film occasionally springs to life such as the in the final show down that ends the film that sequence works but because the earlier parts of the film <UNK> its <UNK> of much of its power br br i can't really recommend the film its worth a shot if you're a fan of the actors or are a huge fan of independent cinema in all its forms but otherwise this is just a disappointment
<START> <UNK> in at an interminable three hours and twenty minutes <UNK> e <UNK> is a pretty but superficial comic soap opera from india that <UNK> us with six <UNK> tales of romantic love which is at least four tales too many in my <UNK> br br filmed like a cross between an mtv music video and a super bowl beer commercial the movie is a <UNK> <UNK> of exotic settings dazzling colors sexy <UNK> high stepping song and dance numbers dream and fantasy sequences <UNK> character <UNK> corny dialogue and way over the top comical performances all pretty much standard issue stuff when it comes to bollywood happenings these days it's an <UNK> chore just trying to keep all the characters straight as they dance <UNK> and <UNK> their way through the incomprehensible storyline br br there's plenty for the viewer to feast his eyes on here not least of all all the drop dead gorgeous women but he'll need the patience of job to get him all the way through it
<START> back in my high school days in <UNK> kansas they filmed something called the brave young men of <UNK> <UNK> and the film <UNK> were rather prominent for weeks eventually we learned that the film was up the academy and was a bit <UNK> lower brow than we had been led to believe br br i had to see it since i was there and the local audiences seemed less than pleased at the showing i was 17 and thought it was a rather <UNK> attempt at a post animal house type of comedy right down to the fart jokes br br watched it many times since and my opinion has <UNK> a bit it's dumb but at times it catches a bit of the mad magazine humor at least as well as most mad tv ron <UNK> might hate it but he is nearly perfect and unforgettable for me my favorite moment would have been a brief scene on santa <UNK> <UNK> where i had <UNK> my car while i was buying some guitar strings too bad my <UNK> brief appearance usually seems to get cut for tv haven't seen the new dvd but if my old <UNK> is visible they've got a sale
<START> hands down the worst movie i have ever seen i thought nothing would ever <UNK> last action hero but this does easily the movie is about 3 single guys who meet on <UNK> to discuss their sexual <UNK> from the weekend a fourth guy who is married and that used to be a part of the group shows up and talks about what he and his wife do nothing works in this movie the jokes are not funny but they are repeated throughout the movie the big <UNK> at the end of the movie is laughable avoid at all costs
<START> first off let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie this entire movie had to have been a dare you know like <UNK> i bet you couldn't make the worst movie <UNK> with this movie they've made a good effort at achieving that title the effects are of course poor the plot dialogue is like a <UNK> of of bits stolen from every b horror movie ever made the actors i'm assuming are supposed to be in college yet parts of it especially at the beginning make it seem like they're supposed to be in high or middle school it makes no sense the scarecrow going around killing people isn't the least bit enjoyable spoiler at the end when they <UNK> <UNK> name and he <UNK> the black guy and scarecrow are both laughing probably out of relief they were on their last scene and at the cheesy dialogue
<START> the bourne ultimatum is the third and final outing for super spy jason bourne a man who is out to kill the people who made him into a killer the bourne series is one of the highest regarded <UNK> by critics ultimatum has an 85 100 on <UNK> com meaning it's status is universal acclaim and for good reason the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing br br first i highly advise you watch the bourne identity and the bourne supremacy the two fancy titled <UNK> to ultimatum there may be three different movies but in reality they are all a <UNK> of one another missing one leaves you stranded and confused just like i was you will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of ultimatum if you missed the first two but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion br br if you were lucky enough to view the <UNK> to this movie you probably had a treat watching bourne take down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him from supremacy jason bourne is played very well by <UNK> damon does nothing to deserve an oscar nod but his work here is good enough to hold it's own <UNK> adventures take place in many different cities the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times the agency tracking bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down br br i won't go into detail on the characters because they are <UNK> off of the first two movies however it wouldn't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience not every viewer is a die hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development ultimatum wouldn't have been <UNK> at all if the story was a little more up front br br it seems most people agree that ultimatum was a success of a film the movie opened to <UNK> million and box office total now is up to <UNK> <UNK> is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since august 3 it's the best action movie i've seen since live free or die hard br br good damon is solid but not spectacular very smart movie bad story is like many others
<START> its taken a few viewings for me to really wrap myself around this one but for me tears of <UNK> is one of the horror highlights of the <UNK> and as far as independent horror goes a <UNK> masterpiece an anthology horror it takes on the story of the fictional taylor <UNK> group a cult of sorts based in india whose members set out in search of ultimate self knowledge and healing of the psyche with unpleasant results that echo down the years with <UNK> segments set in india the film is made <UNK> of three stories set in germany <UNK> the aftermath of the work of the taylor <UNK> group with some pretty nasty gore at times its an interesting set up as these things go but what sets this film apart is the way the imagery is so carefully set up to develop the films horror bad things have been unleashed and the general course of the film is a look at how the quest for self knowledge and ultimate therapy brings horror to patients <UNK> and others and the film is loaded with smart visual clues to the power of the dark forces with which it deals dark forces <UNK> by time place or even personality good examples of this are found in the first story especially dealing with a journalist <UNK> a lady in a mental hospital previous to this story we have seen lars <UNK> and notably his <UNK> lazy eye we also see him healing or at least <UNK> a patient the lady mental patient of the first story is seen in the same stance as <UNK> healing a fellow patient also as she <UNK> up the <UNK> from the art class that she runs among her fellow patients one of their pictures is seen a face with lazy eye like <UNK> there are also references to folk in <UNK> roles extras and walk <UNK> having extra <UNK> <UNK> of what is going on in the film showing the badness that has been unleashed <UNK> and able to almost <UNK> others there is more to the film <UNK> than just evil within it is a film about death suffering and possible redemption too all bound in a structure derived from <UNK> beliefs in a fashion that seems like it might just be exploitation but has more relation to actual beliefs than one might expect at least from the research that i did on <UNK> writer director <UNK> <UNK> definitely deserves some significant credit for his skill in <UNK> the film as well as being thoughtful the film is pretty chilling too the soundtrack of <UNK> india and <UNK> john has a great eerie piano <UNK> and there are a couple of notable performances michael <UNK> as a sinister doctor and <UNK> <UNK> as a freaky patient especially good the third story also has a fine turn from veteran mathieu <UNK> as a faith <UNK> the biggest problem of the film is that it is not that involving a lot of the time so potential for fear is lost but these and a couple of other performances achieve involvement pretty well so the film isn't quite as gripping as it might be the acting occasionally off and the pacing too but mostly i thought it was pretty great if a <UNK> short of its possible brilliance well worth a look for adventurous horror fans i think
<START> despite a decent first season this series never came close to realizing its potential set as a prequel to the original star trek series it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer rick <UNK> who felt compelled to <UNK> limit and <UNK> the definition of what a star trek series could be which made this futuristic show increasingly <UNK> from a dramatic standpoint the actual show runner <UNK> <UNK> didn't help matters by his uninspired and tired <UNK> of previous trek episodes and <UNK> disregard of the <UNK> internal mythology it was painfully obvious early on that he was in it only for the paycheck never have i seen a <UNK> that so consistently did a <UNK> to a cast of talented actors <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> last so long it is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience even a <UNK> audience is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desires unfortunately it appears as if <UNK> and <UNK> have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at paramount that enterprise suffered from franchise <UNK> and that its core audience was did not walk away but was driven off produce a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they the audience will come br br simply put in a <UNK> universe where we are given shows like battlestar galactica and the shield the powers that be must give the viewing public a star trek that <UNK> up and is dramatically <UNK> it is just that straightforward and easy
<START> alive br br alive is a very entertaining sci fi movie from japan i have noticed a lot of disappointed film <UNK> who loved versus this director's debut film or his third film azumi i have heard they are blood <UNK> films with swords and zombies and all kinds of <UNK> frankly i went to the video store to get versus but i am just fine with alive br br if you are looking for beginning to end wall to wall action then alive is not your pick there is plenty of action however it comes as pay off for a whole hour of character driven build up personally i think it is well done and worth it br br of course some of the plot is silly as with many sci fi action films and i think the subtitles using the term foreign object could have replaced with <UNK> for greater effect this film is brutal when it needs to be so faint of heart need not apply br br they kept the budget down by for the most part <UNK> all the action to one underground building taking a cue from the cube but the film doesn't suffer for it another bonus for this film is intense gothic <UNK> that are done with great artistic flair during the many flashbacks and dream sequences br br rent this
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them off one by one in twisted disgusting ways i thought i'd seen it all until one unfortunate man here is <UNK> and then has his head set on fire <UNK> is quite the <UNK> too she takes a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> her mouth shut then hangs her upside down in the <UNK> just in time for a roaring fire <UNK> made me sick it made my eyes hurt i was ready to write it off as the worst movie ever ever ever made by otherwise competent people until the finale i have to admit i loved the ending it involves a boy and his toy tape <UNK> <UNK> by linda blair looking fantastically possessed the scene only lasts for about a minute and the movie's over but you know that old saying if you've got a great ending people will forgive you for just about anything
<START> the minute you give an <UNK> <UNK> 1 10 you have people <UNK> for your ignorant half ass ed artistically retarded blood i won't try and justify how i am not an <UNK> challenged <UNK> by listing out all the <UNK> house <UNK> i have liked or mentioning how i gave some unknown <UNK> <UNK> a 10 10 all i ask is that someone explain to me the point purpose and message of this film br br here is how i would <UNK> the film opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co <UNK> this followed by in a nutshell to save you 3 hours of pain the following a children's game show host dying of lung cancer tries to <UNK> things up with his coke addicted daughter who he may or may not have raped when she was a child and who is being <UNK> by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues while the game show's star contestant decides that he doesn't want to be a failed child <UNK> a fate which has <UNK> another one of the game show contestants from the 60s who we see is now a <UNK> homosexual in love with a bartender with <UNK> and in need of money for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> while the game show's producer himself dying of lung cancer asks his male nurse to help him <UNK> up with the son he abandoned years ago and who has subsequently become a <UNK> self help guru even as mr <UNK> second wife suffers from guilt <UNK> over having cheated a dying man and oh eventually it <UNK> <UNK> you read correctly and i am <UNK> you the unbelievably long and pointless literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than possibly to make sure the film crosses 3 hours and becomes classified as a <UNK> <UNK> br br you are probably thinking that i could have done a better job of <UNK> the movie and in turn of not confusing you if i had written the damn thing a little more <UNK> maybe in a few sentences instead of just one well now you know how i feel
<START> this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen but i really can't recall when i've seen a worse one i thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation what it really was is a soap opera and a bad one at that they <UNK> the <UNK> card to the extreme the first hour or so seems like a shouting match with some implausible scenes thrown in br br possible spoiler br br the 40 or so minute <UNK> scene with requisite black <UNK> and rain to <UNK> crash victims was lame and i thought it would never end br br avoid this one at all costs unless you <UNK> in <UNK> br br
<START> i did not like <UNK> bar from the same director br br i did not watch his other movies they came and went br br but page 3 is nicely made seems real like <UNK> from <UNK> did br br the mental sickness of the so called high society is the summary of the movie in the midst of all the sickness its difficult to lead a normal life which the protagonist <UNK> <UNK> does serious movie not to be watched with children or expecting wives page 3 of <UNK> is the usual place for <UNK> the activities going on in the parties of the rich and elite who <UNK> in much more filth then what is reported how this page 3 is also a business <UNK> is shown in the movie event management <UNK> get paid to <UNK> parties and make a rich but not famous people famous overnight by <UNK> photographs with the celebrities invited to the party br br the western culture has <UNK> into the high society of <UNK> quite deeply the movie shows it <UNK> no holds <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> starts a new journey from here
<START> this effort was like a <UNK> tv movie i don't recall this ever being released in theaters if so it must've died a quick death watching the dvd in the comfort of our bedroom it was obvious this film was meant for not much more ed <UNK> an art critic with a greed streak what a fun turn that must've been i haven't seen ed since the longest yard everyone else pretty much acted by the numbers led by baldwin except for <UNK> she had zero charisma and seemed to be <UNK> thru most of the picture <UNK> daughter had one dimension she played every scene like a lovable little puppy <UNK> line delivery of any 3 year old i've seen yet br br the chase scenes gave my wife and i <UNK> too much quick cutting and angle bashing if you <UNK> going to shoot a chase scene in <UNK> you might want a few wide shots to exploit the beauty of your backdrop right the whole story was pretty implausible and far fetched but hey we liked it better than the life <UNK>
<START> deathtrap is not a <UNK> it's a who gonna do it to who first it's so hard to describe this movie without giving anything away so i won't mention anything more about the plot as far as acting goes it is <UNK> reeves greatest role as <UNK> a young <UNK> you really see the range in his acting abilities in this movie from <UNK> <UNK> to downright frightening <UNK> is such a hard role to play and in the stage production of this i have never seen <UNK> played well on both ends of the spectrum the actor plays him as a little puppy or a homicidal maniac reeves is the only person i have seen who has the character right all the way through as for michael caine he's well he's michael caine one of the best actors of the last 50 years and in this film as good as he has ever been
<START> i was given the book version of <UNK> for my <UNK> birthday and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie but this time they were wrong at least with the movie it's over soon br br the acting in this is terrible which i expected from a film with <UNK> who plays a magical <UNK> genie that comes out of an old ghetto <UNK> which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there the kid in the film that plays max is whiny and a terrible actor he's <UNK> by neighborhood kids which i don't blame them because he's a little <UNK> bag br br the story is just plain stupid and extremely cliché about a boy who's father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him <UNK> with his father br br even at 8 years old i thought this was a stupid idea it's a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after <UNK> because it's an embarrassment and should have never been made i could <UNK> on even more about how this movie sucks but you should already know just by reading the plot
<START> saw this <UNK> recently and have to say it was the worst attempt at film making i have ever had the misfortune to see what the hell was going on with <UNK> totally <UNK> shooting at people in distress totally <UNK> slow tedious and detached worse than <UNK> long live evil dead ii
<START> while in a plane <UNK> through the large choice of movies i came across live almost accidentally oh boy what a choice br br i remembered vaguely seeing the trailer over a year ago and completely forgot about it expecting no more than another cheesy nonsense movie about a stupid reality show now i can easily say this has been a hell of a ride i don't remember last time i have been so excited terrified not sure if it was the high <UNK> playing with my senses but the suspense grow gradually through the movie until reaching a climax where you can't turn away from the screen literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nails you've got br br you will first go through a personal moral <UNK> of where you stand about the <UNK> of the show you will drift from thinking how come the human being can be so vicious to why not after all ask yourself would you do it then learn about the contestants their motives and start guessing you will then watch contestant pulling the trigger one by one and get excited even though you know the first candidate is safe br br good acting good directing with a movie experience that reminds you those old movies where you knew what would happen in the next scene but still were <UNK> for more br br spoilers couple of things i would have changed br br the casting of the contestants i have really been moved by the farmer and we should have had a bit more like him the idea of a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid it felt like you didn't care about some of the contestants although this might have been done on purpose i think the audience should have been able to associate with the majority of the contestants game rules a big <UNK> br br what happens if the <UNK> contestants doesn't die when he pulls the trigger do you seriously think the last standing guy will pull the trigger and <UNK> himself they should have given a chance to all contestants to live ie if <UNK> is a blank too then no one dies br br interestingly i haven't been bothered too much by this bad points cause i really had a good time just wish i had some popcorn with me
<START> it seems like this is the only film that john <UNK> ever directed and that he had the good sense to stop after that and stay in front of the camera this movie is a dog from start to finish and it's dull and wooden with nothing much going for it a <UNK> <UNK> war hero takes a job working for a mob boss gets a bit too friendly with the wife and then the wife is killed by the mob boss himself the war hero framed and sent to prison death row specifically now this particular prison has been <UNK> on inmates and is testing some formula that will turn men into the ultimate killing machine a zombie of course everything goes wrong and then there's all these infected people trapped in the prison some of whom are turning into zombies and the rest who suddenly just don't want to be there anymore this just goes on and on and on with nothing particularly much to show or say for itself and i stopped it before the end which seemed like it was coming a few times but no it was apparently only getting set to take off on a different and equally dull path if one watched to the end they may well become a zombie themselves so don't risk it 2 out of 10
<START> went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend the place was pretty packed and we all laughed so hard it was easy to miss lines i knew it looked like it would be good but it was much funnier than i thought it would be i liked both edward <UNK> and christina <UNK> they seemed really weird just like normal people if that makes sense i get sick of movies that show teenagers as being like cookie cutter people like jock or geek or <UNK> etc both characters were unique but still very human and normal enough to relate to i will be <UNK> this movie to all my friends and waiting very eagerly for it to be out on dvd go see this movie with your friends who can laugh at the funniest parts of life i plan to see it again in the theater and i don't go see things more than once very often
<START> and my children love it now granted i can watch it now and realize the animation wasn't that great and that the plot is trite hey if every <UNK> introduced themselves by saying i <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i think they might be laughed at but for young children it is a moral story with catchy music br br music so catchy mind you that i still had the words <UNK> after not seeing this film in twenty years i would definitely suggest this one for younger children
<START> shirley <UNK> in another <UNK> made role as the aunt to a single mom in a <UNK> working class chicago neighborhood the veteran character actress gets another work out as a <UNK> woman who won't let any set backs defeat her spirit of success the children a pre teen boy and girl are drawn to their spirited aunt <UNK> although the many magic tricks and practical jokes learned from her and applied at all the wrong opportunities eventually get them <UNK> from school br br the plot is cleverly <UNK> in the cuban missile crisis with all of the social <UNK> men building bomb <UNK> people watching news programs on what seemed to be the only tv set at a diner and a general <UNK> of <UNK> and fear in the air when a harmless miracle is blown out of proportions the climactic conclusion nonetheless makes the viewer feel good yes virginia the sun will come up tomorrow clearly a small budget production this is still a sweet little film filled with the magic that sunday <UNK> were made of with a few choice <UNK> thrown into an effective sound track the whole family is sure to enjoy this one
<START> this is of of <UNK> great early comedy films this isn't a parody of enter the dragon the main character sammo is obsessed with bruce lee and <UNK> him <UNK> well for a man of his size <UNK> story about how his fighting keeps causing his loved ones trouble then fighting oh the fighting good fast paced scenes with high impact the white guy who plays a boxer looks like he really gets hurt by one of <UNK> kicks br br the funniest bit of this movie was purely unintentional there is a jim kelly looking guy one of three experts hired to take out sammo but he was a chinese guy in <UNK> with an <UNK> wig come on didn't they have any real black people in hong kong in 1978 well i guess i've seen enough white fake as hell chinese people in old american movies too br br this is one is for any sammo or bruce lee fan
<START> i had never heard of <UNK> <UNK> until his <UNK> segment in last years tokyo and his was easily the stand out the film's three stories it wasn't my favorite of the shorts but it was the most unique and the most iconic the lovers on the bridge was the first of his full length features i've seen a <UNK> romantic film that uses image and music to communicate an <UNK> young love that <UNK> into the poetic though he's classified as a neo <UNK> <UNK> his films owe as much to silent cinema as the 60's experimental <UNK> his movies are closer to jean <UNK> in <UNK> jean <UNK> and guy <UNK> than godard and <UNK> br br in boy meets girl <UNK> 1984 debut he uses black and white and the heavy <UNK> on visual representation to display emotional states he combines the exaggerated worlds of <UNK> but based in a reality that never seems quite stable like <UNK> but by virtue of its expressions it becomes more accessible emotional and engaging like <UNK> movies br br the story of boy meets girl is simple and similar to <UNK> two following films which <UNK> this young lovers trilogy a boy named alex played by denis <UNK> who plays a character named alex in <UNK> next two movies has just been dumped by his girlfriend who has fallen in love with his best friend in the first scene he nearly kills his friend on a <UNK> but stops short of murder he walks around reminded of her by sounds of his neighbors having sex and <UNK> of his girlfriend and best friend getting intimate he steals records for her and leaves them at his friend's apartment but avoids <UNK> either of them directly he wanders around and finds his way to a party where he meets a <UNK> young woman and the film becomes part breathless and part <UNK> br br later he is advised by an old man with sign language to speak up for yourself young people today it's like they forgot how to talk the old man gives an <UNK> about working in the days of silent film and how an actor <UNK> off stage became a confident lion when in front of the camera <UNK> where the movie <UNK> its hand but the overt reference to silent film is a crucial scene since it <UNK> the style of the film silent and <UNK> with the content a <UNK> young man trying to work up the courage to say and do the things he really wants to though alex is <UNK> at first and a <UNK> of romantic words <UNK> out of him by the end he is the shy actor who becomes a lion thanks to the films <UNK> of his <UNK> feelings which aren't easy to nail down from moment to moment aside from a desire to fall in love br br there is a scene in the film where alex <UNK> from the party into a room where the guests have <UNK> their children and babies all crying in a chorus that fills that room until he turns on a tape of a children's show making them fall silent unexpectedly due a <UNK> the tv ends up playing a secret bathroom camera which reveals the <UNK> <UNK> to herself into her wig about someone she misses even as <UNK> is self <UNK> and self <UNK> of the very kind of angst ridden coming of age tale he is trying to tell the room full of whining <UNK> he's mature enough to see through the initial irony to the <UNK> in everything the film crosses even the rich old bell of the ball has a brother she misses in another scene an ex astronaut stares at the moon he once walked on in his youth while <UNK> a cocktail in silence br br though <UNK> to films before <UNK> <UNK> is a master of music knowing when to <UNK> in the dead <UNK> holiday in cambodia or an early david <UNK> song the sounds of a man playing piano or of a girl <UNK> <UNK> br br in boy meets girl when someone gets their heart broken we see blood pour from their shirt when a couple kiss on the sidewalk they spin <UNK> degrees as if attached to a <UNK> when alex enters a party an feels out of place its because the most interesting people in the world really are in <UNK> like the famous author who can't speak because of a bullet <UNK> in his brain or the miss universe of 1950 standing just across from the astronaut this film is the missing link between jean <UNK> <UNK> michel <UNK> and wes anderson whose <UNK> <UNK> and quirky tales of <UNK> all have a parallel with different visuals musical and emotional <UNK> in these <UNK> movies br br every line of dialog every piece of music and every effect and edit in this movie <UNK> with me on some emotional level some i lack words to <UNK> there are many tales of a boy meeting a girl but rather than just explore the banal details of any particular event this movie captures the <UNK> truth of adolescent passion and disappointment the other movies you want to watch can wait see this first if i were to make films i would want them to be like this in fact i wish all films were like this where the <UNK> becomes larger than life and life itself becomes a dream
<START> dana andrews is one of those actors that i've probably seen in a dozen films but who has never really <UNK> for me often <UNK> <UNK> playing the same kinds of roles and looking somewhat like the similarly underrated glenn ford he's an actor that takes some effort to really appreciate but once you hit the right film br br and this is it <UNK> moody look at new <UNK> <UNK> is as dirty and seedy as just about any 50s noir and andrews is in his element as too tough cop mark dixon who just doesn't know how to play the game to get ahead he hates criminals too much to always play by the rules early on in the film he accidentally kills the witness to a murder involving an illegal crap game set up by a mobster who dixon hates for personal reasons and he spends the rest of the film trying to cover up his involvement and bring the mobster to his kind of justice along the way he gets involved with the estranged wife of the man he killed gene tierney and also has to try to get her father off the hook for the murder br br stunningly photographed by joseph <UNK> with hard and <UNK> dialogue by ben <UNK> and a truly powerful ending with elements of tragedy and found grace in just a minute or two of time this is another noir for the ages and might be my favorite preminger film thus far it's every bit as good as the more <UNK> laura
<START> return to cabin by the lake just was lacking it must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera so within the same scene you'll have some movie quality camera shots and simple video camera shots it makes for a very odd blend i think they should have found some way to not do the home video type effect br br i think it's worthwhile to see it if you have seen the original <UNK> because then you can compare and see the differences but if you haven't seen the original <UNK> you'll never want to see it if you see this one first it will probably seem way too cheesy and turn you off from even caring about the original one
<START> the original show was so much better they should have left on a good note this movie killed the whole idea it was boring over dramatic and the funny parts were too far in between to make up the slack this movie really seemed like it was trying way too hard to be serious and that was definitely not what i was wanting from this sequel not to mention that for a long time it was just depressing about the same thing over and over again so sorry tyler perry but try harder next time this movie is just kinda dull and not that funny either sorry 4 10 stars is it br br jay <UNK>
<START> this showtime movie really deserves a far better viewer rating than a 4 5 i gave it a 10 based on the story and the acting of the two stars after reading the viewer comments i was surprised at how many folks expected this movie to be a comedy yeah i see that imdb lists it as comedy drama under genre that sure is misleading isn't it fortunately i saw the movie before <UNK> onto this website so i did not have that expectation in fact based on the synopsis of what i heard i fully expected it to simply be a drama i'm wondering if disappoint at this not being a funny movie caused so many low votes br br another factor that might have caused low votes is that this movie is very much <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> miss <UNK> is an example of another character driven movie that comes to mind someone's previous comment complained about a boring trial <UNK> danny glover work scenes seemed to distract from the real plot of the movie that is how he was <UNK> the <UNK> social climb of his family or his personal troops if you will however they served to establish credibility and justification as his right to move to <UNK> and move <UNK> in the world br br <UNK> obsession became a <UNK> he proved that he would stop at nothing to blend into the white neighborhood his <UNK> when another black person moved next door was not due to skin color it was because of everything the <UNK> represented everything that tom had left behind in essence tom had become an <UNK> cookie black on the outside but white on the inside br br the last 20 minutes of this movie are among the most <UNK> written directed and acted by whoopi goldberg i have ever had the pleasure to witness i realized that the climax of the film was not the obvious event that happened next door don't want to give it away the climax is verbal and whoopi delivers it i am still not clear if it is the conversation when she informs tom which college tom two is going to or when she releases it all in the middle of the night and tom wakes up nevertheless the denouement is great you know that life on that street will never be the same br br my favorite kind of character driven flick people go through problems some pain do their dance they grow they change and life goes on as an audience member i may learn something or be inspired
<START> if you really truly want to waste two hours of your life do the following br br 1 look through the tv <UNK> 2 find the movie <UNK> in <UNK> 3 when <UNK> in <UNK> comes on sit and watch br br and that's it after sitting through two hours of bad <UNK> dreadful and not that funny movie references and experiencing something with possibly the lowest production values ever made in recent history you will have wasted two hours of your life and wonder exactly why br br why did i do this i was stupid enough to think that this film might actually be some good it wasn't br br but on the other hand if you're old enough to remember power rangers you might spot some familiar faces during the film presumably to save on production costs <UNK> who also make power rangers decided to <UNK> <UNK> old monster costumes from everyone's favourite tacky toy <UNK> franchise throughout the film i spotted quite a few old monsters from episodes i saw from when i was a kid so i guess it could at least be said it has some nostalgia value br br but if you want to see actual power rangers monsters go watch power rangers itself it's much better than this piece of garbage and that's saying something
<START> well i get used after awhile to read comments about these movies that don't reflect my experience at all to me amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movies he was a die hard villain a no apologies villain to me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his <UNK> isn't sort of <UNK> in some way br br the kid who played <UNK> was probably over his head with this cast there i think maybe the director could have done better but to be honest the very best part of this movie was <UNK> <UNK> she is an <UNK> heroine a true veteran <UNK> who is <UNK> for every role she is offered but i must say i appreciated her contribution greatly as she played <UNK> <UNK> wife she may be given little to do but she does everything with total conviction i'm sure she <UNK> right over the heads of most of the audience br br so if you are in a habit for <UNK> for bollywood average you won't get much out of this movie but if you constantly search for something more then this might give you some of what you've been missing
<START> this is why i still have nightmares br br this terrifying film a musical was considered appropriate for children in the 1970s br br a boy leaves on a magical journey to an island the mayor of the island <UNK> allegedly a dragon looking more like a <UNK> with <UNK> to me and a magic talking <UNK> are targeted by a witch <UNK> <UNK> who was considered 'a bit of <UNK> at the time br br the <UNK> is <UNK> at an <UNK> witches convention with the witches having a gay old time the boy dresses in drag then as a <UNK> to recover the <UNK> br br not suitable for children
<START> this is an <UNK> through time via computer animation supposedly <UNK> work of over 300 artists made in the late '80s and released in 1990 this was cutting edge stuff for the day i thought it was good and quite interesting in spots br br most of the short scenes made no sense just forms <UNK> into other forms but that was fun to watch this is all about visuals not really about any kind of a story there were some strange sequences in which odd looking men creatures would dance around with birds <UNK> all of it is computer animated which was new back then even the term computer animated was not well known br br it's simply a chance to show off this new technology in short bits of cartoon like happenings with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes no words just pictures with electronic music <UNK> must have really loved this br br it's a nice intriguing 40 minutes of eye candy and head candy by today's cg effects this may have lost impact but i think you'd still be entertained by this
<START> this is in my opinion a very good film especially for michael jackson lovers it contains a message on drugs stunning special effects and an awesome music video br br the main film is centered around the song and music video <UNK> criminal ' unlike the four minute music video it is normal speed and in my opinion much easier to watch br br the plot is rather weird however michael jackson plays a magical <UNK> that when he sees a shooting star he transforms into a piece of <UNK> throughout the film he transforms into a race car a giant robot and a space ship br br the robot scene in particular is a bit drawn out and strange i found it a little out of <UNK> compared to the rest of the film br br a child is kidnapped michael tries to save her is tortured and beaten and suddenly turns into a giant robot that blows up all the bad guys a little weird yeah br br but besides the bizarre robot scene it's a very good movie and any michael jackson fan will enjoy both the smooth criminal music video and the movie
<START> the movie was totally awesome and cool the graphics was superb and it was amazing especially <UNK> was superb and awesome in the movie and he was funny and he was and sometimes he was intelligent the circus bugs are colorful and they are superb in the movie the <UNK> were also superb and cool in the movie hopper was a pure and perfect villain even <UNK> was cute when the bird comes to eat the bugs that scene was superb and good even the last scene was awesome and cool even <UNK> <UNK> was good building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare away the <UNK> when the ants are building the artificial bird that scene was good and nice i should really appreciate the creators of a bug's life
<START> <UNK> is imprisoned and sentenced to death when he survives <UNK> the government officials give him a choice to either be <UNK> at a greater degree or agree to some experiments he chooses the <UNK> and is placed in a large <UNK> cell with a bad ass criminal who also survived the <UNK> they can have whatever the want in the room within reason but they can't leave after a few days there <UNK> are cut down to one per day and the room <UNK> is set up too 100 after some more <UNK> are sounded at <UNK> so they can't sleep one day a <UNK> come into their cell albeit a <UNK> off portion what happens next i'll let you find out i may be in the minority here but i liked the build up it was intriguing to me now if the payoff was half as good as the build up was i would have rated this so much higher br br my grade c br br media <UNK> 2 dvd set extras disc 1 director's cut trailers for versus <UNK> attack the gas station and deadly outlaw <UNK> disc 2 theatrical cut commentary with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cast and crew interview making of original trailer and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this fabulous movie must be viewed knowing that millions <UNK> together 10 cents to see it and forget the gloomy day to day economic conditions during the 30's remember 10 cents bought a <UNK> of bread back then so this was a minor luxury for many people it's <UNK> to how hollywood did its best to make the usa feel a little better about itself you'll note that with the studio system in hollywood at the time many of the actors and actresses were type cast in similar movies e g james cagney william powell ruby keeler frank <UNK> joan blondell and guy <UNK> then too <UNK> of the u s military were always respected with enthusiasm and <UNK> as in the use of military <UNK> <UNK> by the great choreographer busby berkeley at the end
<START> i saw this movie after i saw blue crush and other of <UNK> movies i thought she had a bleak future in this business i was extremely wrong after watching her performance in <UNK> i was amazed in the way she captures the emotion of one a fighter but also a warrior in this movie the way she confronts her father about the treatment of her and her brother the way she conveys anger when getting hit her characters learning <UNK> in the movie of she cant always put up a wall and hide from love or that just because she has power she wont win i believe this role was fit perfectly for michelle even though she had no prior experience the director saw talent i criticize myself for not seeing the talent in her
<START> i enjoyed albert <UNK> nemesis for its cheesy action and semi complicated script a lot of people complain about the confusing plot to the first film which is probably why nemesis 2 <UNK> has a dumb as rocks plot with the same super action to carry it through br br this one gives the name of the first movie's hero alex to a <UNK> up super female sent to the past to save the future she is raised by a tribe in africa a good portion of the film only has dialogue in an african tongue without subtitles which i liked because it made it seem somewhat authentic how often do movies in this genre really try to do that it doesn't take long for the evil <UNK> to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her br br don't get me wrong this is a piece of crap not that the first one was anything great there are subplots involving <UNK> political <UNK> treasure hunting and <UNK> combat the picture is very short on brains so none of these things gets a very good treatment the picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that <UNK> down to muscle babe vs cyborg it has its entertainment value just don't expect quality or anything of the first movie
<START> <UNK> <UNK> of russ meyer film fame plays <UNK> <UNK> a woman who has found she has breast cancer so she goes to south america to get some special fruit <UNK> that is supposed to have healing powers after going down on some of this fruit which appears to be plastic <UNK> on stalks <UNK> is <UNK> with some mystical magical powers that makes her a super hero specifically the double d <UNK> note that she's also wearing a pair of <UNK> as a mask in writing that all sounds pretty good in execution well it leaves more than a little to be desired it seems that <UNK> owns a pub and a local strip joint is upset because she's taking away their business so some of the <UNK> including <UNK> also of russ meyer film fame go after her to ruin her of course <UNK> fights back in the <UNK> of the double d <UNK> watch her do a wonder woman type spin to change into her outfit and also lose her balance due to excessive <UNK> force bad jokes and lame double <UNK> fly like there was no tomorrow with the inane theme song playing over and over this comes off like a twisted 70's live action kid's show with adult content although while this is <UNK> it could probably get away with pg 13 at the worst and it's probably a <UNK> that the faded stars kept well covered this makes doris <UNK> <UNK> morgan films look positively wonderful in comparison special appearance by forest j <UNK> but so what very stupid and i'm never buying another film with joe bob <UNK> on the cover 2 out of 10
<START> i don't know what margaret <UNK> was thinking to allow this movie to have the same name as her book i've always been a big fan of the <UNK> bride and was so excited to learn there was a movie in the works i am aware that the translation of book to movie isn't perfect but this movie was the worst ever the names of the women are correct and some of the back story is correct but that is about it i feel like i lost a good portion of my time trying to make it through this movie this really should have been a mini series to tell the story the way it was written br br the actors for <UNK> tony <UNK> and <UNK> were well chosen even though i was skeptical at first about mary louise parker i only wish they'd had a better script to work with because this really had nothing to do with the book at all
<START> as an engineer i must say this show's first season started out very promising most of the applied <UNK> were somewhat plausible and the relationships portrayed between the <UNK> brothers and father gave the show an interesting edge br br but after the first season the show started <UNK> heavily most of the <UNK> and technology used in crime solving is now utter <UNK> and very laughable to all people involved in science technology for real br br the involvement from the actors still feels okay and i can imagine a fair amount of money is still going into producing each episode but in the end this has <UNK> to a very <UNK> <UNK> dish which is a mix of a grade c action thriller and <UNK> style cop show br br if you are gonna watch it go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second thereafter i would not waste my time myself i gave the show up <UNK> through season 3 br br season 1 8 stars season 2 5 stars season 3 3 stars br br let's sum that up to 4 stars since charlie doesn't know his <UNK> anymore i won't bother with the correctness of mine either
<START> hey <UNK> com is playing the elvira late night horror show on their site and this movie is their under the name <UNK> good fun to watch elvira comment on this crappy movie have fun with bad movies anyways this movie really has very little value other than to see how bad the 70's were for horror flicks bad effects bad dialog just bad movie making avoid this unless you want to laugh at it while you are at <UNK> check out the other movies that are their right now there is 10 episodes and some are pretty decent movies with good plots and production and you can watch a lot of them in <UNK> as long as you have a decent speed connection
<START> this is a must see documentary movie for anyone who fears that modern youth has lost its taste for real life adventure and its sense of morality darius goes west is an amazing roller coaster of a story we live the lives of darius and the crew as they <UNK> on the journey of a lifetime darius has <UNK> muscular <UNK> a disease which affects all the <UNK> in his body he is confined to a wheelchair and needs round the clock attention so how could this crew of young friends possibly manage to take him on a 6 000 mile round trip to the west coast and back watch the movie and experience the ups and downs of this great adventure laugh and cry with the crew as they cope with <UNK> challenges along the way and enjoy the final triumph when they arrive back three weeks later in their home town to a <UNK> reception and some great surprises
<START> holy crap this is so hysterical why aren't american comedies written like this for anybody who thinks comedy has to be dumb there is more wit and intelligence in the six episodes of this series than in a shelf of novels hugh laurie is a complete hoot i couldn't believe it was the same guy as house there are so many great lines and gags in this series you could watch each show dozens of times and still pick up on new things each time <UNK> <UNK> is hilarious as the <UNK> and put upon butler edmund this is my favorite of all the <UNK> series and tony robinson is wonderful as ever as the somewhat <UNK> heart of the series the <UNK> mass <UNK> some of my favorite lines when someone <UNK> with a <UNK> he really puts his foot in it and <UNK> explaining how he got his name and cousin <UNK> the top <UNK> salesman and homicidal <UNK> from scotland
<START> ok so guy gets bitten by a bat and then turns into a bat well sorta i can only assume this made sense to someone at the time aren't bats supposed to fly use radar and eat bugs instead of attacking humans tho
<START> i'd love to give this movie a 10 10 but in its existing state i can only go to 8 10 tops the post code editing read destroying of this film <UNK> a 2 point <UNK> br br from my very limited knowledge of film history baby face was apparently one of two movies that finally broke the <UNK> back and brought the full wrath and <UNK> of the production code into play in 1934 i don't know what the other movie was as a result the movie in its original incarnation was never allowed to be re released after 1934 it was chopped and edited to bits and no original version is known to exist today the best that we can see today is the version that tcm turner classic movies shows but that is blatantly edited in several scenes and has a really disappointing happy ending slapped onto the end br br all the above being said the movie is still pretty <UNK> great and lots of fun to watch barbara stanwyck is as always absolutely amazing and wonderful she is so beautiful and powerful she just owns the whole movie she plays a woman who's been used by men her entire life starting with her father who <UNK> her out to the local <UNK> <UNK> steel workers as well as to local politicians in a <UNK> pro <UNK> of <UNK> you don't shut down my <UNK> i'll let you sleep with my <UNK> when the father dies in a fiery explosion near the beginning of the flick the smile on <UNK> face is priceless br br after the fire stanwyck leaves <UNK> with her maid and heads to new york city she sets her sights on a <UNK> and starts literally working her way to the top starting out with the <UNK> clerk in the <UNK> department she sleeps with him to get an entry level position at the bank from there she sleeps with man after man after man including a very young john wayne using each new man to help her land a higher paying job on a higher floor of the <UNK> with increasingly powerful male bosses <UNK> sugar <UNK> stanwyck stops at nothing in her rise to the top it is great fun to see her and her maid in increasingly <UNK> clothes and apartments as stanwyck works her way up the corporate ladder stanwyck is the ultimate femme fatale <UNK> she <UNK> in this flick if you watch this movie i recommend stopping when you see the george brent character <UNK> <UNK> die in <UNK> arms skip the remaining 3 minutes or so the happy ending slapped on to the end of the movie for post code audiences is insulting to the audience's intelligence and lame beyond belief the bank board members are sitting around a table <UNK> about mr and mrs <UNK> million dollar <UNK> to the bank and how they are living happily but poor in <UNK> with former <UNK> <UNK> now working in the steel mills cut to the exact same footage of a steel plant that we saw in the beginning of the movie the end <UNK> <UNK> how lame the movie originally ended with george brent <UNK> in his suicide attempt i think that ending fits the overall mood of the movie much better than the slapped on post code ending br br i certainly hope that a print of the original pre code version of this flick is discovered during my lifetime update the original has been found and should be out on dvd and or tcm in 2006 until then i'll enjoy the tcm version and switch it off before the lame o post code ending
<START> woody allen has lost his ability to write dialogue or characters that are clearly <UNK> from each other this is the case with melinda and melinda where all the characters speak with allen's generic pseudo sophistication and have problems and points of view that are not <UNK> to anyone outside of a four block <UNK> of where allen lives they also share the same curious condition of being able to afford multi million dollar manhattan apartments that appear to have been designed by professional <UNK> regardless of their financial situation or what they do for a living br br the only character who exists outside of this dull mindset is will <UNK> as the obligatory woody allen surrogate although he does not simply come off as merely doing a woody allen impression like kenneth branagh in the god awful celebrity <UNK> lacks the charm or charisma that the real woody had when he was playing the part himself in his best movies br br the end result is another in a string of self indulgent <UNK> from a once great filmmaker who has been <UNK> in on his former reputation for years
<START> this documentary or i should say <UNK> is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be when they have full enthusiasm on something like that honestly i hate <UNK> it is <UNK> it just destroy it however something positive in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful but some of the information in this <UNK> was totally fake and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists so that is the reason why it deserves a 1 of 10 and not a 0 an example of false information would be the <UNK> idea it is true that according to <UNK> the <UNK> is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions so in that case you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach there are a lot of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the nature but not the necessary to <UNK> an animal like that to fly and the <UNK> does not appear from nothing so it is impossible anyway there is actually something worse the idea of the <UNK> this element is more difficult to find than gold and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that it is ridiculous they present dragons like creatures with low chances of <UNK> the planet earth but off course at least that explain why they got <UNK> probably <UNK> call themselves scientists but they are not people like them say lies like in this <UNK> and what is worst some people buy them but i do not think that a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this those fake scientists waste their time
<START> there are some things i can never understand such as this movie what if i were to create a really really cheap and crappy looking <UNK> and crocodile <UNK> model in <UNK> and then proceed to cut and <UNK> that into an amateur video clip having people scream and getting eaten by the same thing how can anyone even believe that an utterly fake cgi <UNK> that looks completely out of place would influence the events in this movie i know that its b grade low budget and all but the producers could do better than making a piece of crap that no one will ever seen see or sit through it just <UNK> make sense are people really so stupid that they would sit through this apparently so for laughs no this thing isn't even worth laughing at
<START> this movie was awesome not quite as good as the <UNK> <UNK> masterpiece <UNK> but still awesome i thought ashley looked <UNK> huge compared to mary kate in this film i wonder why who <UNK> thought they could <UNK> places like that and almost get away with it dad was kinda a jerk though and mom was a little too <UNK> with <UNK> head i give it 4 any one who likes this movie <UNK> check out <UNK>
<START> what a long drawn out pointless movie i'm sure that historically this film is delightful but as entertainment goes it just doesn't make the grade ralph <UNK> has been in some fantastic movies the english patient <UNK> list but this one was such a let down it didn't seem to be going anywhere his character at the beginning was so shallow and uptight it <UNK> me that his sister would ever have been interested at all don't bother paying to rent this movie buy yourself a copy of the english patient instead
<START> a surprisingly good movie it has quite a few good jokes thru out the whole movie the only negative thing is that some scenes go to the extremes to show just how stupid the two main characters are we get it stupid <UNK> get on with it br br the plot just barely <UNK> being called corny and <UNK> are always a plus <UNK> the movie for some strange reason doesn't play with that card very much even tho the plot line introduces two black haired women who act as the evil counter part of our two <UNK> br br so all in all a good movie to watch i almost gave it an 8 10 but let's not get crazy
<START> while thinking of the great escape i allowed my mind to wander back to this little gem of a movie from my childhood i had read and re read the <UNK> novel from 1949 which inspired it and when it came to the only cinema we never used that word then actually in town that showed foreign films i was first in line to buy my ticket br br as someone brought up on wartime <UNK> and propaganda films during wwii i had an avid interest in exploring the realities of that conflict as reflected in the <UNK> and stories of men who were there in person that extended later to a keen <UNK> over the years to buy any book on the subject and eventually to read the equally compelling novels of hans <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> maria <UNK> which provided an even deeper sensibility the movie versions however were unlike this one in that they rarely delivered the goods br br the medium of black and white film has never been served so well as it was in those years i have never seen any technicolor version of war that seems as authentic as do the deep <UNK> of films like the wooden horse if it is true that we are destined always to be captive to the images of our childhood then i confess it <UNK> br br and there will never be another the likes of leo <UNK> as the <UNK> british war hero on film not even sir alec
<START> plenty has been written about <UNK> the house of games most of it good i decided to <UNK> the flick to see how it held up after 17 years and was surprised at how much i enjoyed viewing it again the film's success and <UNK> probably has much to do with two principal ingredients which are always fun on film a good story and a good <UNK> mamet manages to bring his signature <UNK> and obvious <UNK> to the film while <UNK> us the audience and the mark simultaneously then he explains the art of <UNK> only to do it again etc all the while building the story the house of games now a <UNK> on cable is worth a look for first <UNK> and an okay <UNK> for mamet fans b
<START> something surprised me about this movie it was actually original it was not the same old recycled crap that comes out of hollywood every month br br i saw this movie on video because i did not even know about it before i saw it at my local video store if you see this movie available rent it you will not regret it the suspense builds throughout and the twist ending is excellent br br
<START> pretty standard b movie stuff seriously anyone who watches dragon fighter with dean cain and a bunch of people making their first movie should know better than to expect real quality or even <UNK> intelligence b movies exist to re work <UNK> that are popular if you give them even token analysis you'll wind up ruining the movie for yourself and perhaps writing some self important <UNK> review on imdb br br i liked the female lead <UNK> <UNK> she had charisma and i thought she was notably attractive it was a memorable b movie appearance unfortunately i don't see where she has made any movies since i'll watch for her again
<START> i felt <UNK> to watch this movie all the way through since i had found it in a bargain bin and bought it for my own but i came close many times to turning it off and just writing off the money i had paid for it if you are a fan of gore and <UNK> this movie is ok if there is one thing that the makers of this film know it is the creative use of fake blood and body parts for a sickening effect if that doesn't thrill you then stay away br br this movie is shot on a home video camera with grade school props and terrible actors it's dubbed from german but even allowing for that the sound is awful this film is about as budget as budget gets except for the aforementioned special effects if they had spent a little more money on actors and a real script instead of blood and guts the film might have been a little more enjoyable br br the story is about three men that land on an island inhabited by an army of tin masked <UNK> they are captured and the rest of the movie is about their attempt to escape i call this a story in the <UNK> sense since it is really a series of scenes of torture and combat strung together by inane <UNK> filled dialog br br there is nothing whatsoever redeeming about this movie unless you like mindless gore consider yourself warned
<START> we actually watched this twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time maybe we'd missed something nope what's missing was missed from the beginning of <UNK> i actually went back to <UNK> novel to see if i could find the problem and i discovered that what i thought was funny and exciting back in the day is now just so much <UNK> and fuzzy headed junk br br so the initial problem with the film was deciding to do it at all and the rest of the train wreck progressed from there absolutely nothing works not a blessed thing some beautiful exterior photography gets <UNK> by random camera placement in interior shots all of the actors look at least uncomfortable angie <UNK> looks positively <UNK> except for rain phoenix who gives the impression that she is too unaware to realize how awful her performance really is the dialog is one long <UNK> cringe scenes don't make sense from second to second and the connections between them are nonexistent and yet the movie stumbles <UNK> on convinced that it is saying something profound br br this is too bad to even be funny it is simply excruciating gus van <UNK> has done other good to great movies which i encourage you to see and i'm happy he survived and appears to have learned from this mess
<START> robot <UNK> tries hard but is <UNK> a series of fight scenes strung together robot against robot man against man man against woman the premise had potential but it seems the script wasn't really given the couple of more <UNK> it needed still it was fairly good for a science fiction action movie part of it was because the script was by joe <UNK> for those who aren't familiar with the name <UNK> wrote the award winning science fiction novel the forever war it's considered one of the very best powered battle armor novels right up there with robert <UNK> starship troopers and john <UNK> armor and this movie is really more like a giant powered battle armor movie rather than giant robots it's closer to what fans would have wanted instead of the travesty that was paul verhoeven's starship troopers which bore only a passing resemblance to the novel it was based on br br despite some <UNK> this really isn't based on <UNK> <UNK> a couple of names are all they had in common <UNK> having his <UNK> foot blown off had no parallel in the <UNK> which didn't include <UNK> death nor was the ancient <UNK> a noble warrior he was the <UNK> but also vengeful and petty even the robot jock killed off in the first scene doesn't fit he was named <UNK> while the greek <UNK> would have had <UNK> br br the effects were fairly good for the time and the budget true it wasn't comparable to terminator 2 a year later but that movie cost ten times as much the stop motion was almost as good as the robotic <UNK> in the empire strikes back and return of the jedi better in fact than a lot of ray <UNK> animation which is highly regarded but quite dated br br don't bring high expectations into this and you probably won't be disappointed it's better than a lot of other low budget flicks and even some big budget blockbuster <UNK> that have better effects but far worse scripts
<START> the only show i have watched since <UNK> why did they <UNK> it it was the only show that captured the essence of hawaii and made you feel like you are a part of it all the least they should do is release it on dvd br br i checked out similar shows but nothing has come close the cast had incredible chemistry and i looked forward to each episode with much anticipation br br they made a big mistake by pulling that show if anyone has any info regarding where i can obtain a dvd of north shore please post a few lines here thanks <UNK>
<START> this movie was so good leon <UNK> is hilarious i went out after and bought a case of <UNK> i went out after and bought a case of <UNK> i went out after and bought a case of <UNK> i went out after and bought a case of <UNK> i went out after and bought a case of <UNK> i went out after and bought a case of <UNK> i went out after and bought a case of <UNK> i went out after and bought a case of <UNK> i went out after and bought a case of <UNK> i went out after and bought a case of <UNK> i went out after and bought a case of <UNK> i went out after and bought a case of <UNK>
<START> it takes patience to get through david lynch's eccentric but for a change life <UNK> <UNK> of alvin <UNK> journey but stick with it though it moves as slow as <UNK> john <UNK> when he meets the kind strangers along his <UNK> we learn much about the isolation of aging the painful regrets and secrets and ultimately the power of family and <UNK> richard farnsworth <UNK> his career with the year's most genuine performance sad and poetic <UNK> and caring and sissy <UNK> matches him as his slow daughter rose who <UNK> over her own private loss while caring for dad rarely has a modern film <UNK> so positively about family
<START> not to be confused with the above average supernatural thriller the sentinel the sentinel was a big bore of a movie for me not delivering the consistent action a couple of critics promised on the back to me it seemed like everyone was <UNK> it and only there to make some quick cash because this felt very much like a made for tv film the sentinel is a rehash of several better films like in the line of fire this does not have any originality in it and watching michael douglas run around felt kinda silly in my opinion the main problem besides it's <UNK> had to be the poor pace i often got distracted while trying to view this movie while looking how much run time was left more then once not only the <UNK> with eva longoria who couldn't convince worth a <UNK> br br performances michael douglas is usually a <UNK> actor here is obviously going through the motions he does not convince as a man on a run or a secret agent his chemistry with <UNK> was also off i'm a big fan of <UNK> sutherland but here he is only ok nothing more then that he tries to come across as a gruff but managed to be more bland then anything else and to be honest he didn't seem that interested eva longoria parker is pretty mediocre she does not convince in her role and was pure eye candy kim basinger is pretty terrible as the 1st lady she looks bored to tears and her role is a throw away more then anything else martin <UNK> has a big part in the end but not enough to matter for me br br bottom line the sentinel is yet another political thriller that bored me to tears it's too old too tired and most importantly the lack of effort sucked not recommended br br 4 10
<START> despite the lavish production numbers and wonderful costumes this film is a chore to watch the murder mystery plot is just a vehicle to <UNK> the musical numbers on but it often brings the proceedings to a <UNK> halt besides not being very involving although there has obviously been a lot of money spent on them the numbers are badly staged and poorly photographed it's obviously a pre code film because the girls often wear very little clothing and there's even a song singing the <UNK> of marijuana the performances are all one note although it's nice to see carl <UNK> in a musical but when victor mclaglen as the police <UNK> <UNK> into view for the <UNK> time on the hunt for clues you may want to throw in the <UNK> or at least fast forward to the next number pity the <UNK> who were trapped in the cinema on its release though
<START> <UNK> boy br br ever wanted to watch a documentary about a <UNK> jerk ruining his own life and <UNK> everyone around him well they exist in many forms but have you ever wanted to watch said documentary about one who didn't ultimately succeed in doing anything despite everyone's <UNK> about how much of an artistic genius he is well you could probably just grab a camera and find someone like that in any local scene i know they're everywhere and i don't even follow the local scene or you could save yourself the trouble by spending money watching this tripe br br the premise is good and honestly it's not as if the filmmakers knew precisely where it was going considering that's one of the difficulties of doing a documentary we are made to follow two bands the brian <UNK> massacre lead by anton and the dandy warhols lead by <UNK> i've heard of the dandy warhols before watching this movie not so the brian <UNK> massacre why well from this <UNK> perspective because the brian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> refused them the ability to really make it in the music industry however instead of this becoming an analysis of the two separate bands and how one was able to succeed the focus becomes much more on anton and his insanity br br because see anton is a genius because he plays rock music he really understands the evolution of music because he plays rock music with a lot of different <UNK> his music is considered post modern retro but the future because it's rock music he wants to bring out a revolution through rock music okay so let's face it twenty minutes in and this is one of the stupidest kids i'd care to watch a documentary about br br the documentary itself doesn't really lend itself to <UNK> any of <UNK> talent because in the nature of editing down 2000 hours of material into a quarter short of two hours we don't really have the time to focus on that so instead we watch anton the genius the <UNK> <UNK> loser be a jerk for the two hours and are just told to understand that he made really great music whether he did or not i won't know because its not like the documentary had enough time to prove it what i do know is that then we're left with a story about some self centered obnoxious <UNK> running around the country calling himself a god of music and doing nothing to back it up why even bother watching that people like anton don't deserve the attention they seek the hope and admiration of all those different people and especially a post failure <UNK> to lost potential this movie plays like a two hour rough cut <UNK> special for a reason he goes on and on about the music but it's all about the image and the attention look at the guy look at how he dresses look at how he acts look at how he tries to create controversy because he can't afford marketing br br honestly the only interesting character in this film is joel and that's because of anyone in this documentary joel is the only person who seems to have any fun maybe it's because he's the <UNK> man the rest of them are all rock stars they deserve our attention and admiration and interest and <UNK> they are out there to save rock and roll do you remember when the white <UNK> were supposed to save rock and roll yeah that was because of anton and it's selfish of them not to mention me anton as an inspiration what a load people like anton are best left forgotten this documentary explains why mainstream music is so dull because music <UNK> have to deal with people like anton for a living and ultimately can only really throw their support behind someone safe and <UNK> thanks a lot anton your antics ruined music for everyone you touched whatever the opinion to the contrary is and if people in the know about anton disagree and he really was a genius it still shows how bad this documentary is that it cuts it down that way br br <UNK>
<START> a lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a <UNK> novel altman creates a suspenseful gothic atmosphere but the script is weak sporting a southern <UNK> branagh is convincing as the lawyer and <UNK> is <UNK> as the object of his desire downey is likable as a private detective duvall has a small role which does not allow him to do much with his weird character hannah and berenger round out the impressive cast after an interesting setup the film <UNK> down and does not really deliver on its initial promise but altman is always worth a look
<START> i'm guessing the writers have never read a book of any kind much less a dickens novel and certainly not david <UNK> and that they based their screenplay on another poorly written screenplay possibly an adaptation of <UNK> though just as likely anything else from which they randomly <UNK> about a third of the pages and then <UNK> the rest along with some random pages from a screenplay that someone's <UNK> grade nephew had written for an english class and for which he had received a failing grade br br if the casting was a bad joke e g richards as kramer playing <UNK> which it was then the direction and acting were the poorly delivered punch lines getting beyond kramer as <UNK> if possible ham was such a complete ogre <UNK> back and all that i was half expecting at some point to see him being pursued by an angry pitch <UNK> and torch wielding mob of villagers <UNK> was almost as much of a clown figure as <UNK> mr <UNK> <UNK> about as much terror as that muppet vampire from <UNK> street the actor playing older david was i believe actually a woman in any case looking <UNK> as if he wished he could find a mirror to see how pretty he looked and <UNK> that he looked quite pretty indeed he could <UNK> convince us that he was writing with a <UNK> pen and while we're on that subject in one of the many gross inaccuracies <UNK> by the half wit producers of this embarrassment in the unnecessary shots of david writing his story he appears to be somewhere between 18 and 21 years old when he should be in his forties perhaps the greatest <UNK> although it's difficult to choose was the invented showdown between david and <UNK> as he <UNK> a third wife in switzerland <UNK> of course by the invented death of <UNK> second wife while they were at it it is a wonder they didn't send <UNK> to the <UNK> and have him deliver sidney <UNK> famous last words it couldn't have made things much worse really it might have been far far better br br there are literally thousands of small and large sins against literature throughout this <UNK> of art and anyone who watches it runs the risk of severe and permanent damage to all aspects of their sensibility
<START> visually interesting but falls flat in the originality department this tedious <UNK> in technique wears thin after the opening battle jude law has the charisma of burnt <UNK> but in his defense this film contains some of the worst dialogue i have ever seen on the big screen in fact the script is so poor that it keeps taking you out of the film and had me thinking about work bills my dogs etc there are many moments that scream <UNK> paltrow is as wooden as they get this could of been saved by snappy film noir dialogue or over the top camp my only complaint on the technique is that black white film sorry computer would of helped because it looks like turner <UNK> black and white just a big dull cliché mess i would rather break my <UNK> than sit through this <UNK> test again
<START> this film is a lyrical and romantic <UNK> told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in a rural cuban town the year of the castro revolution it is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love br br the names cuba <UNK> and cuban blood are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film dreaming of julia makes much more sense it has more in common with european cinema than with rambo and the revolution is merely an <UNK> to people's daily lives and <UNK> that fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in cuban history br br the excessive use of the voice over narrator does <UNK> the story but the film makes up for it with <UNK> clips from hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator could br br the comparisons to cinema <UNK> and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love br br the revolution like the film julie never seems to have an ending
<START> as a long time red sox fan i just had to go see the movie it was great while there can never be enough live footage from the miracle 2004 red sox season there were great shots of some of my favorite red sox players while the movie is certainly a chick flick it has enough baseball footage from the amazing 2004 red sox comeback to make it one of my top 10 movies of all time i especially enjoyed the red sox fans that were part of ben's baseball family the scene where ben is meeting with his buddies on draft day to determine who will get seats to certain games is hilarious a must see if you are looking for a wholesome movie to watch with your <UNK> date or significant other especially if you are a baseball fan and even more especially if you are red sox fan
<START> this is a romantic comedy where albert einstein played wonderfully by walter matthau and his <UNK> play match maker to his niece meg ryan and a talented auto mechanic tim robbins the interplay among these major roles is <UNK> by a terrific supporting cast of well recognized character actors this movie is cute and fun a feel <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i have watched 3 episodes of <UNK> and i have no idea why i continue except maybe waiting for it to get better br br to me this show is just <UNK> itself off the commercials with no real humor as we sat around watching these shows we all <UNK> on what was going to happen br br the episode of the woman cave woman with a attitude was actually a big <UNK> right for us she's crude in a theater and acts tough to strangers and truth be told she needed a slap br br i consider myself a pretty good reviewer taking in everything but i must say <UNK> is comparable to the old show my mother the car i give it a 2 only because they deserve 1 better than a 1 because they actually spent money on it
<START> ok the plot is wait you got me there is no true discernible plot here just a string of <UNK> <UNK> sex scenes strung together by scenes of <UNK> taking pictures of pretty ladies sometimes a combination of the two then a demon comes around kills the men rapes and kills the women and <UNK> poetic about the meaning of life moronic special effects bad acting and bizarre philosophy aside you get what you expect from a film with a title like this i guess it would have to be someone's cup of tea just not mine as i have yet to see a good <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> directed film br br dvd extras subtitled interview with director <UNK> <UNK> part 1 part 2 is on the <UNK> of a beautiful woman dvd and theatrical <UNK> br br my grade f

<START> wow i didn't know that someone would make this movie its awful i have written down 5 things that can tell why u do not want to see this movie br br number 1 its the biggest rave ever where is the that rave i could only see a few people dancing around br br 2 when they are on the rave they can only see blood everywhere no people two ruined <UNK> and one stage and what do they do they drink br br 3 the worst actors i have ever seen the captain and his crew awful br br 4 when one of the people is firing an ordinary gun he shoots almost 30 times without <UNK> br br 5 i didn't knew every person in the world could fight as a pro must be a new thing br br i wonder what the producer was thinking this is going to be a big hit its gonna be a classic sure u dumb s t anyway don't see this movie its a <UNK> of time my eyes are still bleeding
<START> i was reviewing some old vhs tapes i have and came across the tv show john denver the muppets a christmas together this made me go to my computer and look it up to see if i could find a dvd version of this show to buy i was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on dvd the show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show i have the record and the cd but i would love to buy a dvd version of this show the tape is old and picture quality is pretty good but <UNK> the sound is not as good as the cd there is also a few other songs not put on the cd as a fan of john denver and of the muppets a dvd of this show would really be a good <UNK> if you don't have the cd it is a wonderful <UNK> collection of songs taken from that show the album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on
<START> the golden child was eddie murphy's first film since his <UNK> beverly hills cop and even though it's not as good as cop it's a fun comic adventure murphy stars as a <UNK> of lost children who's assigned a most unusual case his assignment to find the title character a child with mystical powers this movie could have been titled beverly hills cop and the temple of doom since parts of this movie plays like a <UNK> adventure kinda like an indiana jones comedy it's got comedy with laughs and adventure with special effects lots of fun br br out of four
<START> the unborn is a very very different film james karen brooke adams are in the film and they performed quite well this film is builds up <UNK> and it keeps you going though i think you must be a horror fan to watch this because of the scenes and the plot there is one brief sex scene with no nudity that could have been left out and to some people this scene may disappoint someone like me that's into the film and thinks that stuff ruins a good film but that's it when it comes to that there is a scene where <UNK> character goes nuts and kills a cat but you can tell its not real the music is very different but very good the unborn in my opinion is a really creepy film that's superbly unpredictable and that's quite strange i recommend all horror fans to this movie
<START> this movie starts presenting a somehow original idea but became a great frustration later on what is the deal of having an original start if the rest of the movie did little to avoid a clichéd plot the movie itself is very unbelievable i would like to know how exactly someone enters a clinic gets a nurse outfit kills a doctor takes out a patient in her bed puts into his chevy pickup and leaves i guess no one could answer this question so they just jumped to the other scene hiding these little details the performances are just plain bad the villain is just another annoying crazy antagonist no <UNK> totally linear character after 20 minutes of film most scenes are unbelievable seemed like they were put there just for the sake of the 90 minutes since they were totally <UNK> a doctor see a woman clearly under strong <UNK> is denied to examine her gets kicked out of the house and simply leaves quiet the ending scene made me burst into <UNK> only mickey mouse could make it more out of reality i'm giving it 2 out of 10 for the first lets say 10 minutes of movie
<START> canadian filmmaker mary harron is a cultural <UNK> whose previous films laid bare some the artistic excess of the sixties and the hollow <UNK> eighties with the notorious bettie page she points her <UNK> eye at fifties america an era <UNK> in the moral <UNK> of joe mccarthy while experiencing the <UNK> of a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade harron and her co writer <UNK> turner are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol this is a film about the underground icon of an era and how her pure <UNK> sexuality revealed both the <UNK> instincts and <UNK> thoughts of a culture <UNK> by the beauty of a nude body if the details of <UNK> life were all the film was concerned about then why end it before her most tragic period was about to begin clearly harron is more interested in america's attitudes towards sexual imagery then and now together with a <UNK> lead performance by gretchen mol and the stunningly atmospheric cinematography of w <UNK> <UNK> iii she <UNK> this goal admirably holding up a mirror to the past while making the audience examine their own <UNK> 21st century attitudes towards so called pornography as america <UNK> under a new <UNK> this is a film needed more than ever
<START> writer director tony <UNK> adapted his own play about a straight man recently widowed learning in the last three weeks he is hiv positive he tracks down the one homosexual partner he ever had brings him to an apartment and ties him up forcing a blood test on the guy and promising bloody revenge if the results come back positive intriguing idea sounds better on paper than it plays out james <UNK> captive is realistically cynical and <UNK> but the actor's own artificial mannerisms are <UNK> it's like watching a <UNK> version of tom cruise scott <UNK> has to work harder with the more challenging role but his personality turn from shy guy to <UNK> on the edge isn't convincing and neither are the conversations the two men have <UNK> gay party boy isn't <UNK> of course he's <UNK> sympathetic to <UNK> plight but he doesn't react or behave the way any homosexual man would in this <UNK> the movie isn't a cop out exactly but it is a fraud handicapped further by the bad editing the poorly conceived flashbacks the low budget production and the big finale which <UNK> of silly <UNK> and <UNK> melodrama 1 2 from
<START> this is a brilliant and well made contribution by a group of fans and considering it's made in a back bedroom on a painted green screen it's story lines are complex and <UNK> and it's characters show realistic depth and dimension the cgi created by the crew is breathtaking while it's first season might be a little shaky it's final few are well thought out and well shot some fans might have thought that the star trek franchise had come to an end with the early <UNK> of enterprise but these fans don't take no for an answer i recommend this to fans and <UNK> alike 10 10 hidden frontier crew br br make it so
<START> this is a strong movie from a historical and epic perspective while the story is simple it is pure and straightforward in truth it is the standard story of a simple honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and <UNK> men of the period br br poor vs rich honorable vs <UNK> a classic but well told tale without much of the <UNK> of hollywood <UNK> up the screen br br extra points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen
<START> hot millions is a great movie in every way a fun offbeat story with wonderful performances by four of the best professionals ever to work in the business peter ustinov is brilliant as usual and maggie smith definitely one of the greatest actresses of all time is a total delight karl malden and bob <UNK> round out the cast and are also perfect if you want a movie that has perfect casting this is it what is so impressive is the way these people work off each other in such a natural and <UNK> way creating lots of laughs and fun moments throughout peter ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances the direction photography and editing are also first rate and it's a great time capsule of london in the '60s it's definitely on my all time favorites list
<START> this movie blows let's get that straight right now there are a few scene gems <UNK> inside this pile of crap but none can redeem the limp plot colin <UNK> looks like brad pitt in 12 monkeys and acts in a similar manner i normally hate colin because he is a fairy in general but he's ok in this movie there were two plot lines in this movie one about a kid who throws rocks through <UNK> of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a <UNK> let's face it this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go the characters story lines <UNK> on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script the whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional ok scene but overall don't bother unless you love irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is rescued by everyone sounding like the lucky charms <UNK> an american fetish that has <UNK> some truly crappy movies to success
<START> i don't know how anyone could hate this movie it is so funny it took a unique mind to come up with this storyline it's not your typical alien movie these aliens are so stupid and confused you need to rent it at least once
<START> <UNK> stella dallas with barbara stanwyck hasn't exactly aged well how anyone thought a semi updated version of the story would work now is a real <UNK> perhaps they thought <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bette midler could make something out of it but this <UNK> script <UNK> her plot about a female bartender having a baby out of <UNK> and years later giving the young girl over to the child's wealthy father so she'll have a shot at a better life can't escape <UNK> old fashioned <UNK> and sentiment midler works best with a movie director who can control her <UNK> but that fails to happen here stephen collins is <UNK> as the man who changes her life but <UNK> <UNK> is well cast as <UNK> daughter this is what used to be referred to as a woman's picture a <UNK> but it doesn't pass <UNK> because it stays too faithful to its 1930's origins 1 2 from
<START> beautiful film pure cassavetes style gena <UNK> gives a stunning performance of a <UNK> actress dealing with success aging loneliness and alcoholism she tries to escape her own <UNK> ghosts <UNK> by the death <UNK> of a young girl acceptance of <UNK> of human condition though its overall difficulties is the real purpose of the film the parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling it's like if the stage became a way out for the heroin if all american movies could only be that top quality dealing with human relations on an adult level not trying to <UNK> and <UNK> feelings one of the best dramas ever 10 10
<START> this movie has so many wonderful elements to it the debut performance of reese <UNK> is of course marvelous but so too is her chemistry with jason london the score is remarkable <UNK> and pure james <UNK> howard enhances the quality of any film he <UNK> for <UNK> he also seems to have a knack for lost days of youth movies be sure to catch his score for the recent peter pan and the haunting gothic music of the village i first saw this film at about 13 or 14 and now i don't just cry at the ending i shed a tear or two for the nostalgia show this movie to your daughters it will end up becoming a lifetime comfort film
<START> if you <UNK> the first twenty minutes or so of this film you will be left with a fantastic comedy as it is i still found it to be a pretty good movie which is no small feat considering the coma i was put in by the opening scenes to put it mildly this film has a dreary beginning that wasn't even remotely funny or even upbeat once things get <UNK> however you are left with a comedy that still holds up well after more than three decades definitely worth checking out especially if you're a younger fan of lemmon and matthau who wants to see their earlier work
<START> i saw this film after watching capote and infamous it is just incredible how the homosexual relationships between author and protagonists are <UNK> in the movie the reporter is straight the protagonists are more <UNK> than gay br br the film starts slowly but on reviewing it a second time we get all sorts of interesting information from <UNK> that the writer director brooks creates br br notice the incredible cutting at the beginning where killers and to be killed are linked cutter on the phone is matched cut to perry on the phone cutter <UNK> his face is matched cut to perry <UNK> his face only <UNK> looking in the mirror and seeing his <UNK> male body sets off a fantasy of his playing a guitar in las vegas to empty <UNK> this failure fantasy matches the failure fantasy that perry tells us about his father who built a beautiful motel in <UNK> only to find it <UNK> empty br br dick talks about shooting <UNK> and the fact that the <UNK> don't know that that they're going to die we cut to the <UNK> br br perry talks his dream about a yellow bird <UNK> than jesus who attacks the nuns who have <UNK> them the nuns <UNK> for mercy he tells us but the bird slaughtered them anyway the bird lifted perry to paradise strangely perry says that he has an <UNK> to nuns god and religion this echoes later in his last words when he wants to apologize but does not know to whom br br the director puts in all sorts of what <UNK> and only <UNK> br br nancy cutter gets an offer to sleep at a friends house she is holding a horse perry will comment on a picture of her and the house later on nancy can't sleep over at her <UNK> house because her boyfriend is coming over for dinner the decision <UNK> her fate br br perry talks of bogart in treasure of <UNK> <UNK> but it is another bogart picture beat the devil which truman capote co wrote where a fictional treasure hunt is the <UNK> but dick knows that the protagonists of that film ended up with nothing dick wants the hard cash the 10 000 he thinks is in the <UNK> safe which ironically turns out to be as much as a fantasy as <UNK> mexican treasure br br cut to <UNK> clutter <UNK> a 40 000 life insurance policy he's thinking about <UNK> at the moment ironically his <UNK> is about to end in a few hours the insurance agent on behalf of the company wishes him a long life again ironic when we know what will happen in a few hours br br dick has said that they wanted no witnesses so nobody would remember them later in fact it is because they eliminated all the witnesses that they were remembered br br there was one witness the detective keeps telling dick later but was that witness the jail house friend dick perry truman capote or god the viewer becomes the witness after watching the movie br br fascinating film
<START> allison <UNK> performance is what stands out in my mind watching this film she <UNK> out the melancholy tone of the film with an <UNK> energy i would like to see more of her
<START> i have never read the <UNK> novel that this movie is based on but from what i've gathered it will be interesting when i finally do read it and i will my comments will be based purely on the film as soon as i saw the trailer i knew i had to see it and was so excited but when i finally did i was so disappointed it hurt this is because the movie itself felt so amateurish the actors were not well cast though <UNK> and <UNK> are both good actors just not here the kid actors it seemed were merely asked to show up get in the characters' clothes say the lines and make the faces the set and props were cheap and unrealistic the direction was surprisingly bad i was so surprised at the awfulness of it that i had to go online and check who directed it just to see the kind of work he had done the editing was cut and <UNK> and the plot screenplay was just that as well even though the author had been involved himself irony the building up of the tension fear and suspense was so mild it was <UNK> when the climax finally came br br i've read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it what hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing it had so much potential unfortunately the film was so technically bad it takes away from the brilliance of the story
<START> when reading a review from another user saying that it's a terrible game i could not stand <UNK> and do nothing br br well this game is great from the news clips with two real persons full of humour sense and credibility to the story i find it very good i only complain about the enemies start <UNK> when they die until they disappear and some frustrating situations on the <UNK> <UNK> missions when riding the bike here and there br br except that it's a great game with a great story good graphics excellent characters great soundtrack i recommend it surely it can be a bit old but still enjoyable at least on the <UNK> but the <UNK> version shall be the same
<START> i was glad to watch this movie free of charge as i am working in the hotel industry and this movie came lately to our movie library nothing against low budget movies but this movie has horrible acting and directing how can a movie as this one ever be made the director should be <UNK> and for all the poor actors it is for sure not a jumping board into a career please make sure that you'll not watch this movie the acting is lame the camera and directing awful there are just a few more movies out there which deserve to be called the low 10 another example would be dracula 3000 people who make money with this movie should give it to charity so at least it serves for a good reason br br in this case i would watch it even another 10 or at least one more time
<START> i thought the movie was fairly well done for a made for tv movie and it contained both a lot of action and humor i found the entertainment value worth watching and would watch it again or a similar show again i'm disappointed that sean was not credited here on imdb br br i can see a possibility for an action series based on this concept or a sequel with sean once again playing for even higher cash stakes since his life would be on the line again anyway br br i felt that sean played the role very well and reminds me of an actor by the name of matthew <UNK> who plays jack <UNK> on days of our lives the soap opera
<START> <UNK> this film hurts my head and not in a good way br br maybe it's just my growing hatred for the action genre but even as a kid when i would swallow tripe like navy <UNK> i still regarded this film with dislike now i utterly despise it br br take one fairly good fast paced story keep the title and throw the rest away instead use some half <UNK> future <UNK> storyline thats so full of plot holes the whole things in danger of <UNK> why is there a rebel base in the middle of the <UNK> what about the cameras why have clearly marked footage of what really happened at <UNK> in an <UNK> room br br the whole film screams eighties from the <UNK> awful score to the goofy shiny costumes ugh br br don't watch this film i know some people liked it but some people get off on being <UNK> on and i don't understand them either
<START> i think it was an overrated pg 13 crap at least <UNK> <UNK> performance was good and some others like <UNK> <UNK> were good too but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing the killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too the deaths were stupid boring and completely <UNK> the movie was very boring too and very overrated it wasn't suspenseful at all i almost fall asleep its another bad pg 13 remake its really a dreadful movie imo the ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring the movie is pretty slow too overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe <UNK> snow i think she gave a good performance and <UNK> <UNK> too but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake well thats just my opinion i gave it a 2 10
<START> watching <UNK> i would have liked to leave the cinema very much for the first time in my life i would not recommend to watch this movie flat main characters absolutely no development e g <UNK> the <UNK> german problem child remains a pure metaphor without any <UNK> of positive involvement despite several plot wise chances to do so uninspired actors non <UNK> plot i guess the movie attempted an <UNK> <UNK> but did not succeed camera appeared shaky rather than motivated pictures were low contrast gray and dark i am sure deliberately but the <UNK> did not add up to a convincing impression of the social <UNK> the story had certain potential though it could have made a good short story
<START> i watched this movie as a preview of a matthew barney art exhibit it certainly prepared me i almost <UNK> the exhibit and in retrospect probably should have br br aside from the score being great <UNK> and the photography rich and colorful the content was mostly tedious and predictable gee i really needed to see someone wearing <UNK> to figure out what the pearl <UNK> were up to the film was mostly a silly mixture of japanese cultural references and industrial shots of modern <UNK> technology being used in a mock hunt <UNK> the film peaks with enough gratuitous shock art to turn your stomach br br what was the point of the movie while others might argue that it is an anti <UNK> piece one could equally argue that it somehow also <UNK> <UNK> personally i think it was <UNK> attempt at flashing the audience with his <UNK> <UNK> self <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br bottom line unless you really get off on <UNK> sense of art don't bother seeing this movie the message is obscure the pace slow and the cultural references pretentious if you're after shock art you'll do better at one of the many undead movies or hunting down an old copy of hustler and taking in a <UNK> cartoon
<START> i noticed this movie was getting <UNK> well before it hit the theaters and i too didn't have high hopes for it i figured it was another you got served type of movie with some nice dance moves and horrid acting i was at the theater and deciding between this and meet the <UNK> and picked this to my surprise the acting wasn't bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good the fact that it has a lower rating than you got served is absolutely ridiculous instead of listening to the garbage posted on here i recommend going to see a <UNK> showing of this movie so you don't spend too much i think you will be pleasantly surprised with how wrong everyone has been about it when it comes to dance movies this is certainly one of the better ones with far superior acting than many of the other ones go see the movie and judge for yourself hopefully the rating will rise after it comes out on dvd and more people check the movie out instead of judging it based on comments before the movie released br br edit the movie is now moving closer to its correct rating over 1000 people have given it a rating of 9 a bit too high but at least it is helping to <UNK> the ridiculous votes of 1
<START> what the movie the 60s really represents to those of us who <UNK> around in the belly of america in those times is the <UNK> and diversity of the decade despite the exaggerated stereotyped characters the <UNK> of the issues remains clear br br not only were those radical times of change but also very confusing times two basic things changed our world then the 1964 civil rights act and the overwhelming influence of the media those two new <UNK> began social changes that soon became <UNK> br br from chaos came sensitivity from disorder came values bear in mind however that the bulk of americans were not involved in this they worked they played they watched the news and slowly they became <UNK> by the efforts and struggles of the <UNK> the civil rights workers the political <UNK> the anti war efforts the war on poverty br br the representation of the power of the press and tv in particular was well reflected although the conflict between the general <UNK> attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored and at worst <UNK> middle class americans weren't all standing around <UNK> holding baseball bats or <UNK> their <UNK> daughters they were confused too let us not forget how folk singers suddenly became protest singers and how the beatles began an <UNK> that killed the folk protest movement there are no <UNK> songs in the movie or even any mention of them br br i think if you didn't live the decade you might not have a sense of what the movie is about the overall picture is a bit dim at one point i held down a steady job while my sister lived at the <UNK> farm <UNK> and went to <UNK> at another point i was in <UNK> <UNK> and in the detroit <UNK> while she worked and played the housewife in <UNK> and <UNK> roles were constantly changing br br the movie depicts three siblings of a middle class family they represent the hippie child the political <UNK> and the active military <UNK> dad represents the typical attitudes and mom represents the voice of reason tolerance and sometimes compromise for the sake of peace br br the black family <UNK> a minister and his son <UNK> i think i assume the producers knew all the <UNK> and had to settle on limitations or else the film would have become a long boring documentary <UNK> message was that anger produces <UNK> and <UNK> produces chaos it was clearly a message directed to today's youth br br we are looking at a unique solution to social problems and also how issues <UNK> us the 60s were unusual in that way and only the roaring <UNK> compare in other words this movie has a moral after all in the end it is our collective <UNK> that survives put that in your <UNK> list br br everyone was a god a guru or a free spirited genius in the 60s it was a time of magic and madness no one will ever nail the 60s down right it was too diverse this movie is close at least we can say we are not ashamed of it that we learned and grew from it and that for once a generation shaped and changed america for the better
<START> t z post college professor receives a false letter stating he inherited <UNK> 000 now with financial means he <UNK> his life <UNK> of 4 000 and decides to finally going out live after having his <UNK> sent on a train to chicago he meets a traveling vaudeville <UNK> and decides there good enough for him to put on a show on broadway the night of the show poor <UNK> post has to hide from his <UNK> settle the relationship <UNK> between girlfriend <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and still make sure the show must go on after watching many of keaton's silent gems this one is a pain to sit through but i felt it could have been a lot worse supporting cast <UNK> todd <UNK> come off very annoying at times but still likeable a pre charlie chan <UNK> is good as the frustrated show director 90 of the script is badly written as mgm is trying to pass this off as a poor man's marx bros film where many of the sight gags fall flat from the beginning <UNK> with keaton's drinking problems at the time this movie just is a sad moment in <UNK> life rating 3
<START> i really can say i felt the movie in its right essence where the mind games from dreamy reality enter into the surreal aspect of future faced by tom cruise i didn't cared much about tom <UNK> acting <UNK> but i must say that he seems to impress at every point in the movie not simply due to an engaging storyline but also due to his self being <UNK> to the lead character they <UNK> and then speak and its beautiful however i must say this movie doesn't come under the average flick of weekend which you pick at random and watch <UNK> it carries strong sentiments and characters so don't wash this one down with your beer and pop <UNK> it certainly needs more than that
<START> this film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in california she thought it was wonderful because it was so real just the way people in the <UNK> valley are i'm from the area and i experienced the film as just the way people in california think we are i've lived in <UNK> and <UNK> and worked minimum <UNK> jobs there we laughed a lot we <UNK> with and took breaks with people our own age the young people went out together at night the older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families the area is beautiful in the summer and no <UNK> in the winter rain than anywhere else br br aside from the if you live in a <UNK> home you must be depressed <UNK> the story lacked any elements of charm mystery or even a sense of dread br br <UNK> character was the worst drawn it's <UNK> that anyone so repressed would have <UNK> to a church but if she had she probably would have made friends there i've read reviews that seem to assume martha was jealous of rose because rose was younger <UNK> and thinner but if this is the case it isn't shown all we actually see is martha learning to dislike rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender we see martha feeling left out during smoking sessions left out of the loop when social plans are made used but not appreciated and finally <UNK> and hurt br br just one more thing are we supposed to suspect kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks please this takes <UNK> against mental illness to a new level
<START> i consider this movie a masterpiece but it took me at least 4 o 5 times to see it so as to realize what a great movie it was first it describes a face of ww2 that we don't usually see in hollywood movies in particular german soldiers army and the nazi government are shown more <UNK> one of the facts that impressed me most was the mention by the end of the movie of a murder that took place in a forest in the last <UNK> that forest is the place where the final chapters of berlin <UNK> take place those are the woods where <UNK> kills <UNK> another clue for those who like the details is the representation of doors fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door or a door is opened many doors are shown in the screen opened and closed and the characters change in their personality their acts etc any time that happens have you noticed that

<START> this movie is yet another in the long line of no budget no effort no talent movies shot on video and given a slick cover to <UNK> unsuspecting <UNK> at the video store br br if you want to know what watching this movie is like grab a video camera and some red food <UNK> and film yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night <UNK> and attacking people <UNK> you've just made hood of the living dead now see if a distribution company will buy it from you br br i have seen some low budget shot on video films that displayed talent from the filmmakers and actors or at the very least effort but this has neither avoid unless you are a true <UNK> or are amused by poorly made horror movies
<START> well its official they have just killed american pie the first 3 were absolutely hysterical but this one and the others have been awful i mean the story is about two college <UNK> who battle each other for its houses i mean come on talk about a weak plot the first three dealt with growing up change and marriage which are all worthy points of development in human society br br the new <UNK> is the biggest joke i know its hard trying to compare yourself with the steven <UNK> but so no <UNK> i give this movie a 3 because there is 2 3 funny bits in the film br br the best character in this movie of course is <UNK> dad i don't know why he keeps continuing to do these poorly developed films
<START> not to be confused with lewis <UNK> alligator 1980 which actually is an excellent film this <UNK> <UNK> del <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ends the exotic trilogy sergio martino made around the end of the seventies including the rather watchable <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the not so good la <UNK> del <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> outrageously the plot of jaws the script fails at creating any suspense what so ever the creature is ludicrous and its victims are simply despicable <UNK> <UNK> lame tune poorly illustrates the adventures of these silly tourists presented from the very beginning as the obvious items of the <UNK> meal no thrill out of this rather <UNK> actually and we could find this pitiful flick quite funny if the dialogs and the appearance of the natives were not so obviously inspired by pure racism very soon the <UNK> stops in favor of a sour feeling witnessing such a <UNK> attitude we could excuse badly made films and poor <UNK> but not that kind of mentality never
<START> ok i saw this in the theaters when it came out and i don't know why i haven't seen it since but i ended up on this page because i found myself thinking about this film again i don't know why but the fact that i remember it speaks volumes br br comedy is hard much harder than any drama doing it right makes it seem easy but doing it wrong is there anything worse than a bad comedy steve martin pay attention you are falling in this category again for some reason br br elvira mistress of the dark must have done it right for me to remember this movie <UNK> done at a quick pace with tongue in cheek and knowing it isn't the <UNK> story it entertains from start to finish brain <UNK> is another that fits right in this category sans most of the gratuitous <UNK> jokes br br one point of <UNK> the ending it seems the writers director had no idea how to finish a comedy the ending tries to be a love story somewhat <UNK> the quirky fast paced dialogue up to that point then there is the <UNK> scene whereas this has to be seen male opinion it is so over the top and out of place it's like a shock one more rewrite for the ending was needed br br this is not comedy genius like spinal tap or the producers or the holy grail but if you don't try to <UNK> it and just let the <UNK> and sappy fun come to you you'll laugh i guarantee it
<START> america a land of freedom of hope and of dreams this is the nation that since its independence has <UNK> to bring democracy <UNK> and peace to the entire world for the good of all mankind there are times however when one cannot help but wish that the <UNK> would just stay on their side of the atlantic br br this <UNK> and i use that word with some <UNK> evokes these feelings with an intense <UNK> this vision of hell follows the adventures of <UNK> a <UNK> jewel thief who was created by <UNK> the severed head of marlon <UNK> onto the body of a two foot high dwarf after inadvertently dropping a large diamond into the <UNK> of vanessa a career woman who is reluctant to have children <UNK> realises that in order to recover the diamond he must <UNK> himself with her so as any normal man would <UNK> dresses himself up as a 2 year old and parks himself upon the poor woman's <UNK> where he is discovered by <UNK> the <UNK> husband of vanessa br br <UNK> <UNK> falls for <UNK> disguise despite the fact that the <UNK> has a full set of teeth <UNK> a <UNK> a knife <UNK> and the sex drive of a 16 year old even more <UNK> vanessa doesn't see past <UNK> baby wear either and actually attempts to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> this wretched assault upon the soul of mankind attempts and fails to find humour in rape <UNK> sexual assault and <UNK> however in a <UNK> attempt to <UNK> itself into a piece of <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> brothers stir in a sickening amount of sentiment and flawed morality br br the brothers dim attempt a <UNK> <UNK> of their <UNK> rapist by revealing that he had a bad father repeatedly hitting <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to develop the loving father son relationship that both he and <UNK> have always wished for as if this wasn't ridiculous enough <UNK> attempts to sexually assault vanessa somehow convince her that it is selfish for a woman to <UNK> herself with a successful career and that instead she should spend her life playing the role of the <UNK> little woman who spends her time <UNK> <UNK> out babies and cooking for her husband br br in this movie the <UNK> brothers have mixed their crass and twisted form of humour together with the clichéd sentimentality that has infected much of hollywood's recent body of work additionally they are <UNK> of the current generation of black comedians who are responsible for <UNK> african american humour into a poor and wretched shadow of itself that over <UNK> in fart jokes and crude sexual gags by rights these two should be <UNK> <UNK> from picking up anything even remotely resembling a camera ever again br br unfortunately the current artistic and moral <UNK> of american cinema means that by this time next month they will undoubtedly have filmed two sequels and be making millions of dollars from tacky <UNK> deals
<START> an unexpected pleasure as i had heard nothing about this film br br shameful since it <UNK> having a wider audience br br a wonderfully <UNK> story with a social message gently told although admittedly predictable in its resolution <UNK> acted by the principals beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film br br my recent <UNK> into chinese film shower the road home not one less has been an exciting one that i hope to continue exploring china and its people is an amazing <UNK> for film makers the king of masks can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent chinese film br br
<START> melissa joan hart shines this show is amazing there is no match except for maybe melissa in <UNK> explains it all she was marvelous in that too this is so much better than buffy the vampire <UNK> this show is wonderful
<START> i watch romantic comedies with some <UNK> for romantic comedies feature age old clichés which make a movie uninteresting typically in a romantic comedy there is a girl and there is a guy both fall in love then have troubles and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever but this movie is a different story it is really very different from the romantic comedies i have seen of lately br br there is a widowed guy dan there is a girl marie dan meets marie in a <UNK> and talk for sometime after sometime marie has to leave dan develops something for her and when this something starts to turn meaningful we get a twist marie is the girlfriend of his brother <UNK> of the circumstances dan <UNK> with marie and realizes that he loves her and even marie loves him but their love would not just be possible how it is made possible forms the rest of the story br br steve carell performs well juliette <UNK> is good as marie and every other stuff is done well it is a good movie watch it
<START> i happen to like leslie howard in his better films yet for some reason his performance in of human bondage never has moved me tremendously i first saw the film on my college campus in 1972 and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the 1930s and 1940s howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by <UNK> <UNK> as the man who was born to be betrayed this is not usually the case off hand i think of ashley <UNK> as a man who might be betrayed if he and scarlett o'hara were meant to be an item by margaret mitchell but ashley loved <UNK> not scarlett howard could play any type and a role like r j mitchell or professor henry <UNK> is not one who is betrayed br br one can make the case that philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows <UNK> to in <UNK> parallel but they are nazis who consider him a liberal <UNK> canadian fair game to double cross in wartime it isn't the same as emotional betrayal and howard does not <UNK> up as a result but faces the nazis and captures one after beating him up br br i think what the reviewer meant was that howard could be <UNK> or try to be <UNK> witness his poet <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> forrest but that character was not betrayed except by history perhaps as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by <UNK> bogart the character of philip carey in <UNK> <UNK> of human bondage is <UNK> too he is sensitive for several reasons he has an interest in art and tries to become a painter but unlike the artist <UNK> in the moon and <UNK> he has no real talent so he decides to concentrate on medical studies <UNK> by a club foot condition he has here he is a man with low self <UNK> who is set up to be betrayed br br philip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress bette davis who is <UNK> and as selfish as they come why philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film but he does find the woman fascinating and she finds him an easy meal ticket ironically in being so captivated by this slut philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him kay johnson and frances dee and are more fit to be his mate he also keeps finding himself <UNK> davis when she has affairs with other men alan hale and <UNK> <UNK> the latter a friend of <UNK> br br although <UNK> performance captures the <UNK> tendency of philip towards mildred he really does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turns on her that is why i find i never cared for his performance here it lacks any reality his later tortured <UNK> in gone with the wind that he loves olivia de <UNK> not vivian leigh has more <UNK> with a man in love but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film important she had a wide variety of parts up to 1934 like the girlfriend of the deaf <UNK> in the man who played god or the spoiled <UNK> who gets murdered in fog over <UNK> or the mouse like secretary in three on a match as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitch br br curiously her performance was not all of one note while she uses and <UNK> howard for two thirds of the film culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health <UNK> and her inability to keep any honest jobs when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks what happened to her baby she tells him the baby died and howard says <UNK> that he is glad which is hardly the response she expects in the end howard does finally get his life in order but mildred ends a <UNK> ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend <UNK> on a medical call the motion picture academy of arts and <UNK> did fail to <UNK> davis in 1934 leading to the largest write in campaign in it's history and a permanent change in it's rules but davis was established as a star in one year she won the oscar as <UNK> <UNK> in dangerous and in two years she co starred with howard again as equal stars in the <UNK> forrest
<START> first of all this movie isn't a complete disaster if you had never heard of the real story of <UNK> parsons then it might seem a reasonably entertaining <UNK> johnny <UNK> can't really be <UNK> for his performance as phil kaufman he's pretty good at looking laid back and down to earth and you can sort of root for his long suffering <UNK> michael shannon is due credit for pretty much the same reasons except he's a <UNK> <UNK> there are some good individual comedic scenes the <UNK> <UNK> crashing into the airport <UNK> door stands out but that's where the good things end and we begin to see the aspects that make this movie so truly disappointing the character of robert <UNK> as <UNK> actual father is an invention so <UNK> as to cast a <UNK> over the entire film we all know his real father committed suicide when he was young something that could surely be compared to <UNK> life on the edge by a better film maker having <UNK> as his supposed real father and not his step father would be bad enough if not for the well known difficulties <UNK> had with the man who actually flew to collect his body it has been suggested that his step father had admitted to providing <UNK> mother with alcohol as she lay dying and that this <UNK> <UNK> when he later found out about it also the controversy over where <UNK> body was buried would surely be reason enough not to <UNK> a <UNK> made up father who actually catches up to the duo and their <UNK> but then allows them to go ahead with the burning whatever the truth about the man who <UNK> got the name parsons from he certainly bore no resemblance to <UNK> character here and it is hard to see why this role was written then there's the addition of christina <UNK> as a greedy chick yet very pretty of course who wants <UNK> body back so that she can begin to cash in on his estate her character and her acting are non existent and one wonders why the director didn't just go the whole <UNK> and include a <UNK> scene between her and the chick who plays <UNK> girlfriend it wouldn't have <UNK> the tone a whole lot more when you think of the ingredients that could have been used in a good movie about parsons the shortcomings of this film are easily apparent country music being changed by a young polite southern gentleman who was also long haired drug loving popular with the ladies and ultimately self destructive real events like the <UNK> door crash and the painted <UNK> and friends like keith richards instead of these things we have to concentrate wholly on <UNK> <UNK> into <UNK> life kaufman is obviously still <UNK> up the cult status he received for what he did he certainly is a little cult from interviews it is obvious that he's delighted with the attention remember this is the man who made a remark about the <UNK> of the naked corpse of <UNK> parsons as he was preparing to set it <UNK> what he did was not an act of great loyalty but a <UNK> up alcoholic <UNK> looking at <UNK> and the director in interviews a few things become clear also it's obvious that they have no real grasp of the story of <UNK> life nor do they wish to have they want a hit movie about an event that is infamous and crazy it was an amazing life with a strange end that the end is the only thing covered by this movie shows how limited an understanding of <UNK> parsons the makers had
<START> ok let's get right to the point we have five recent college <UNK> must have <UNK> in the f word going out on a weekend camping trip they run into someone who is in need of help but instead of trying to assist him they decide to set him on fire instead nice bunch of people next some of them start go get sick must be something in the water at the cabin they are staying at however the neighbors seem to be ok oh well when things start getting really bad they lock up one their companions instead of getting help try the neighbor by the way some locals don't take a liking to them they chase one on a high speed romp through the woods for many miles until the truck breaks down somehow ten minutes later he shows up at the cabin how he could find it and how he could travel at the speed of light to get there is a mystery another of the brain surgeon type at the cabin realizes something is <UNK> so he hides out in a cave to let this blow over he then decides the next day to return to the cabin believing it must be some type of <UNK> he is <UNK> with relief that he survived he must have thought it was a 24 hour bug <UNK> he is met by some not so friendly police officers another couple decide to have sex while the flesh eating bug is working its magic and then the women realizes she needs to <UNK> her legs taking a lot of the <UNK> skin with <UNK> cream anyway you get the idea nothing makes sense here these are five people i would not want to be friends with i was rooting for the flesh eating <UNK> other characters were introduced who were also somewhat amusing but utterly unlikeable as well ninety minutes of good life wasted here
<START> this sequel is a total rehash of the first film a completely pointless movie it basically just took every single <UNK> of the first film and they <UNK> it in omen iv except with a female <UNK> this time it even ends the same way as the first one the music is too busy and <UNK> and because its pretty much a copy of omen i it's extremely predictable it's not a horrible movie it's not terribly made there is much worse movies out there this just had absolutely no point in being made the omen remake from 2006 is much worse even more pointless than this so i guess it has that if you someone pointed a gun to your head and you had to choose to watch this sequel or the 2006 <UNK> i guess i'd choose this
<START> rumors is a memorable entry in the wartime series of <UNK> cartoons starring private <UNK> the films were aimed at <UNK> and were directed animated and scored by some of the top talent from warner bros ' <UNK> <UNK> including <UNK> <UNK> chuck jones and carl <UNK> the <UNK> mel <UNK> <UNK> the voice for <UNK> and the stories and <UNK> narration for many of the films was <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> i e dr seuss the idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery using the character of <UNK> as a perfect negative example he was the <UNK> the little <UNK> who would do everything you're not supposed to do according to chuck jones the scripts had to be <UNK> by <UNK> officials but army <UNK> also <UNK> the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and <UNK> jokes certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow all for the greater good of course br br as the title would indicate this cartoon is an <UNK> of the <UNK> power of rumors the setting is an army camp private <UNK> sits next to another soldier in the <UNK> something you won't see in any other hollywood films of the era and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling we observe as an <UNK> remark about a bombing is <UNK> then exaggerated then turned into an increasingly frightening <UNK> that <UNK> the camp the imagery is indeed vivid the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a <UNK> pot while the <UNK> speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air i e balloon juice a soldier shoots his mouth off cannon style and before you know it actual <UNK> is flying in every direction <UNK> <UNK> at that <UNK> soldiers tell each other that the brooklyn bridge has been <UNK> <UNK> island wiped out enemy troops have landed on the white house lawn and the japanese are in california the visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> and private <UNK> has been locked up in a padded cell br br this is a highly effective piece of work the filmmakers <UNK> their theme with wit and startling energy and the message is still a valid one in recent years we've seen that <UNK> events real or imagined can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances because the technology has improved the private <UNK> of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via e mail <UNK> and <UNK> consequently rumors is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesn't feel at all dated in fact it may be more <UNK> than ever
<START> although there are a lot of familiar television names associated with a man called <UNK> there is nothing extraordinary about the film itself or about any of the performances in fact the only thing that <UNK> it from a 1960's 70's television series like the rat <UNK> is a bigger cast and a lot more violence br br james garner is the biggest star and apparently thought he should try to break away from all the light comedy stuff he had been doing maverick support your local sheriff <UNK> etc unfortunately his <UNK> <UNK> works against him as <UNK> is a <UNK> character written to cash in on the popularity of clint eastwood's spaghetti western character but eastwood's stuff was not this flat and uninteresting br br i suppose that a man called <UNK> could be classified as a spaghetti western although the pacing is too slow to really fit that sub genre fans of the slow paced combat television series will feel an instant connection as <UNK> <UNK> directed the film and co wrote the script with frank <UNK> throw in some then trendy slow mo shots and cross <UNK> which call attention to themselves rather than serve a story telling purpose br br the plot is the standard big heist thing insert the war <UNK> here with <UNK> plotting how to heist a 300 000 gold <UNK> his gang includes claude <UNK> and dennis weaver the problem is that while on the move the <UNK> is <UNK> by 40 <UNK> and while stopped it is locked in a vault inside the <UNK> prison i think there was an episode of <UNK> smith and jones with the same plot br br the story would make a decent hour of television but gets old very fast as a very padded feature length film garner does not allow any of his charm to <UNK> into his characterization and the film does not generate enough suspense to hold a viewer's interest br br the thing finally crashes and burns shortly after the heist when the gang <UNK> in a contrived and totally illogical card game br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> for the first forty minutes empire really <UNK> itself up it appears to be a strong confident and relatively unknown gangster flick at the time i didn't know why i thought it was good but now i do br br one of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly <UNK> i don't mind films with <UNK> and things to prove a point take jackie brown for example but they're all so terribly shallow in this but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment you literally feel a <UNK> pull in your stomach another major problem is the protagonist he is smug arrogant yet ironically enough not that bad he doesn't seem tight enough to be a drug dealing woman killer the fact is at the end of the day this film is completely pretentious not slick not clever just dull and meaningless this <UNK> mess should be avoided at all costs br br out of 1 out of 5
<START> calling this a romantic comedy is accurate but nowadays misleading the genre has sadly <UNK> into cliches too focused on making the main couple get together and with very little room for <UNK> and other stories making it formulaic and overly predictable br br the shop around the corner does not suffer from these <UNK> it manages to create a <UNK> middle eastern european atmosphere and has a strong cast besides the also strong <UNK> leads i avoid using the words <UNK> <UNK> as for example mr <UNK> frank morgan has a central role to the film and his story is equally if not more important than the romance br br the 1998 film you've got mail borrowed the <UNK> pen <UNK> idea from this film and has therefore been billed as a remake this is not correct and in fact unfair to the new movie it shares the genre and borrows a plot element but that is all
<START> i think this movie is a very funny film and one of the best <UNK> <UNK> films it also has a very catchy spoof title which basically sums up what the whole movie is about men in white the story is a spoof of many films including a will smith film as you might have guessed <UNK> in <UNK> i will not give the ending away but it has a very good ending in is very funny leslie <UNK> style humour from start to finish especially the bit near the beginning when <UNK> are in the street collecting the <UNK> garbage <UNK> also they have a pretty cool <UNK> <UNK> garbage collecting truck in that scene too the acting is not superb actually it is not very good but that is what makes the film funny it is a comedy <UNK> up i love the story line partly because it is so far fetched and partly because it is interesting to see how subtle or should it be un subtle they rip off all the other films i am great fan of un serious spoof films but i am also a fan of the real thing and with this films it is hard to decide which is better the film it mainly rips off mentioned earlier i this review or the actual film it is but also when you are actually making a spoof of comedy films it actually makes it even harder but this film carries it off successfully the two garbage men are so funny it reminds me of a tv sketch show in the uk called <UNK> <UNK> this film is a must for your collection and is one of the best most entertaining funniest best storyline national <UNK> film to date
<START> this is an amazing film both for the incredibly energy <UNK> from the frenetic flamenco dancing and from the unique way that the filmmakers <UNK> the story of the stage production with the lives of the characters preparing for it <UNK> is the only word i can use to describe the experience this is not <UNK> <UNK> by any usual standard this is not a usual film by any standard every nuanced glance every <UNK> of the foot every piece of the music is <UNK> so <UNK> that you can't take your eyes off the screen you don't need to love opera or flamenco i don't to be captured <UNK> enthralled by this film subtle and direct loud and still one of if not the best movies of it's kind because there are so few like it
<START> possible spoilers coming up you've been <UNK> br br this is absolutely one of my all time favorite musicals and movie musicals the other is damn <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hunter and ray <UNK> as we all know sometimes the <UNK> not to mention the songs of a show are lost in its transition from stage to screen this is for the most part definitely not the case here br br the sets are divine bright and colorful the characters are bigger than life and you can't help but love them and michael <UNK> choreography is absolutely stunning so glad to know they used the original broadway choreographer br br all of the actors <UNK> the ball that is have <UNK> chemistry to perfection in this film frank and marlon are absolutely believable as the <UNK> of the oldest established permanent floating crap game in new york and the most notorious <UNK> who <UNK> on even the most minute things such as his fever going up to <UNK> if he doesn't take <UNK> sweet fresh faced jean simmons is perfect for the role of sarah although it is true her singing <UNK> are not as outstanding as that of <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> de <UNK> the mission doll with a heart of gold and a drive to <UNK> all and last but certainly not least on my list anyway is miss vivian <UNK> <UNK> her broadway role as miss <UNK> the hot box lead singer and dancer who would like to finally end her 14 year engagement to nathan with marriage and rid herself of the <UNK> cold he's given her br br first off kudos to <UNK> <UNK> and b s <UNK> as they <UNK> their broadway roles as nicely nicely johnson and benny <UNK> there were never two more <UNK> <UNK> than these guys br br brando is superb as usual and though he's not got the voice of robert <UNK> or peter <UNK> you forget it as he has this sense of determination to bring all he can to his role as sky masterson luck be a lady gives me chills every time i see him perform the number especially enjoyable is hearing him say daddy i got <UNK> in my ear br br simmons is charming and pleasant in a role well suited to her looks voice and the way she carries herself you long so <UNK> for her not only to win sky or toward the end believe him but to help people overcome their gambling drinking and other sins and live a life with god her rendition of if i were a bell is splendid to say the least br br sinatra is the man he is so perfect for the role of nathan detroit and here he sings parts that sam <UNK> from the broadway cast never could terrific actor but the <UNK> was tone deaf go figure i really enjoyed the addition of the song <UNK> wish some guy would sing like that to me <UNK> cool slick demeanor <UNK> the boundaries of this movie but most importantly you want him to marry <UNK> br br and speaking of <UNK> vivian <UNK> is just sheer perfection in this role from the accent to her <UNK> out <UNK> <UNK> she's just terrific and she's also my favorite part of the entire movie she really makes you feel for <UNK> especially when she cries right before and then again during sue me i still haven't decided whether i like pet me <UNK> better than <UNK> and a peck maybe i like them equally either way she does fantastic with those as well as take back your <UNK> i'm sad that they left out <UNK> from the film she's absolutely marvelous not to mention hilarious and my favorite part of the entire film br br one of the best things about this movie is their <UNK> it's a mixture of high class and street <UNK> never do they use it's i'll or that's it's always it is i will and that is overall guys dolls is one of my favorite all time movies and musicals and it's one that you should take time to watch every time it comes on my only complaint no marry the man today now that's a good song
<START> as a fan of science fiction movies i have been aware of the matrix since its release in 1999 from the little bit i would allow people to tell me about it i assumed it was highly original and sophisticated i am also a <UNK> of alice in wonderland i could never quite figure out how i missed the matrix when it was released with the <UNK> release of the matrix <UNK> it was time to buy the dvd and watch it br br the disappointment was too great the premise of the matrix the controlling device as opposed to the movie was clever the philosophical premise of parallel worlds alternate realities is <UNK> however i could still have bought into the film as science fiction if it stayed firmly in that genre unfortunately it turned into a standard will they or won't they escape break through rescue those in need of rescue etc to make matters worse it turned out to be another martial arts exercise the problem is that science fiction and martial arts films are really two different types to the <UNK> the <UNK> of one or the other mixing the two doesn't work it is like mixing science fiction with romance you can have one or the other but not both in the same film or at least not both to the same extent in the same movie br br if there were such problems with the matrix the matrix <UNK> really <UNK> the problems at least thirty minutes of the film were either martial arts sequences or the <UNK> car chase this observation ignores the question made in every professional negative review of the movie if neo could do the superman thing why bother to fight at all the answer of course is that's what draws the young male <UNK> group into the theatre then there is the redemption through love aspect that plot device was worn out by richard wagner over a hundred years ago it was actually handled better by him in die <UNK> br br so where does that leave those who saw the matrix <UNK> martial arts fans probably <UNK> through the trite but <UNK> sci fi <UNK> science <UNK> fans were wondering why they were sitting through a kung fun fest most of the males in the audience where probably bored by the silly romance aspect of the film br br just what are you supposed to be getting for your bucks when you see the matrix franchise films science fiction martial arts or soap opera a bit of each does not make for a whole lot more of any of them nor for a satisfying film for the <UNK> of each
<START> clint eastwood returns as dirty harry <UNK> in the 4th movie of the dirty harry series clint is older but he's still got it harry was told to have a vacation after some trouble that happened because of a robbery where the memorable make my day <UNK> comes from but the city he took a vacation was worse a woman turned vigilante after a rape attack in a <UNK> and starts getting the <UNK> one by one the last movie to see sandra locke in a clint eastwood movie an improvement after the <UNK> which was a bit more of a comedy and less serious clint eastwood's <UNK> were <UNK> which are best known for the <UNK> that are worn by arnold <UNK> in the terminator worth a watch if you like clint eastwood the dirty harry films or like action crime thrillers
<START> i love this movie but the music at all the <UNK> <UNK> is just stupid br br the <UNK> game took place in 1972 that means that the protagonists <UNK> in 1972 but almost all of the music played at the dances etc is from the 1950s and very early 1960s br br having just attended my <UNK> high school reunion i can assure you that the last music to be played at a reunion or dance of former high school people is their parents' music br br i understand the difficulty of finding relevant 1970s music we all know what a desolate time it was <UNK> but it wasn't completely <UNK> and the producers of the film should have taken more care i found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film br br this was a bad director and or producer decision
<START> david <UNK> worst film even <UNK> which we <UNK> <UNK> as bad as this usually a film with a really good reputation like this one has at least some redeeming qualities which makes one understand why it might be considered a classic but after watching this i just could not get why this piece of crap was liked so much even back in 1945 i disliked the acting stiff upper lip british mannerisms story script which may be quite witty at times but totally unfunny and soundtrack the elvira character is meant to be <UNK> and attractive but was in actual fact ugly and had a weird and annoying voice just another film that has convinced me not to trust a films reputation another very overrated <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie is not that interesting except for the first ten minutes the pace and editing are a perfect introduction in an ensemble piece even better than say <UNK> park then it inexplicably slows down loses focus and starts resembling a traditional french movie only to regain focus in the end with the love relation between <UNK> depardieu and <UNK> <UNK> in the middle there are too many <UNK> and loose ends in the story several threads started are not ended br br spoilers ahead the main story is the relation between <UNK> and <UNK> he has been loyal to her after his relation with her many years ago despite her <UNK> and setting up home in <UNK> as <UNK> he now <UNK> his own life and <UNK> hers by taking the mask of <UNK> marriage having accomplished this he is buried after a freak accident literally and becomes a <UNK> he wakes only after she has burned their old picture as indication that they've <UNK> with the past and can properly start their lives again together end of spoilers br br it remains unclear what vision this director wants us to see us because there are so many other stories here illegal immigrants want to enter europe there are frequent radio <UNK> about the <UNK> of <UNK> former regime <UNK> child is <UNK> and is bitten by dogs loyalty once he meets his boyfriend whereas the girl he lives with seems to be sick of that her sister is traditional <UNK> and enters a relation with <UNK> husband it portrays <UNK> as unnecessary <UNK> despite all the building there is a strange colonial vision shining through that almost <UNK> the past it portrays islam as <UNK> and prone to <UNK> which may sometimes be true but certainly not in general in the end it can all best be described as adding some <UNK> locale and <UNK> pour <UNK> br br <UNK> and depardieu are great with this material they are so familiar they are able to spin something extra in every scene <UNK> an <UNK> body language <UNK> pride awkward behavior the movie itself is disappointing and only <UNK> the limited role of french cinema in the world nowadays with some notable exceptions of course
<START> after having seen a lot of greek movies i feel very suspicious against most of them but after watching this i felt <UNK> the movies is great without a big try you cannot claim that the screenplay is so great or the photography is perfect or something technical it's a real story and it is happening in greek rural areas in places forgotten from god the movie is like a punch in the stomach and i would really wish that things are not like this it obviously talks about the <UNK> of the greek people the ignorance to anything different the problem of this guy is not that he is an ex convicted the problem is that he is not one of these people he is different and they do not want them that's why all the good things he is doing turn <UNK> to him and also speaks about the <UNK> of the people because there are some people who are against the hunting of the king but they do not dare to say their opinion in the end you can clearly see the <UNK> of the society being religious and trying to act like god says but at the same time acting so unfairly to the king this shows how easily people <UNK> their feelings or their beliefs according to the established system in the end you can have a positive lesson from this very bad story meaning that you can understand and be part of this society only if you want to become one of them if you want to remain different and even alone you are lost and it is not far from reality i think it is tragic that the story is real and this should be a bell for everybody no comment for the main actor because he is already given an award and i believe that his play was great small comment for <UNK> plays the policeman he is like a dinosaur he has played a lot of roles and i'm sure that this role for him was very easy but he plays it so great that you cannot deny him a big bravo i definitely recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see a good greek movie
<START> i just rented and watched this movie just to see what's all the fuss about so here's what my reactions to it are it's easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors the main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her <UNK> this concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film however the movie doesn't shock or <UNK> me at all it just bored me this movie could be easily <UNK> to under 45 minutes all lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time like those scenery scenes and some scenes i described below br br contains spoiler i find the rape scenes quite tame i don't know if i have watched the cut or uncut version if there is actually such a version i also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot here's a list on top of my mind br br why don't the <UNK> rape jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are that would be an excellent time br br why don't they just gang rape her instead of <UNK> some of the <UNK> the pleasure and <UNK> <UNK> ordeal by such a long time it would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way br br i found it really stupid that the <UNK> left her in the forest and head back to her house maybe to show that these <UNK> are really <UNK> br br these <UNK> should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right they shouldn't send a coward <UNK> to do the job br br why didn't jennifer call the police when the <UNK> finally left which should be the first thing that pops up in most people's mind especially for someone who is a writer br br why didn't these <UNK> smell danger miles away when they saw jennifer is alive br br i find it really amazing that a <UNK> lady like <UNK> can pull a man up a tree and hang him ends spoiler br br but hey this movie is not without its merits <UNK> keaton is gorgeous and i get to hear one of the funniest line i have recently heard when matthew protest of going back into the house and kills jennifer why me why me i didn't even c m '
<START> saw this movie twice at community <UNK> and really loved it i work in the jane <UNK> community and feel the film really captured some of the essence and <UNK> of the community <UNK> determination <UNK> creativity in your <UNK> with a dose of desperation the writing dialogue and acting is solid and i really found myself drawn into the story of the young woman <UNK> as she struggles to pursue her goals and not lose herself in the process great dance sequences and it is not only the bodies that move smoothly and with electricity but the camera moves with great <UNK> and intelligence as well all the characters are multi dimensional none wholly good or bad and the women characters are admirably strong this is a film that has a strong beating heart and <UNK> the <UNK> spirit of youth hip hop and <UNK> like jane <UNK>
<START> spoilers <UNK> movie that shows how men in desperate situations can go so far as sacrifice their best friends and family members and not realize what monsters that they are by doing it until like in the case of bull like gypo <UNK> victor mclaglen it's too much too late br br it's <UNK> and the <UNK> of the black <UNK> irish revolt against the mighty british empire with the <UNK> british <UNK> troops on the <UNK> for wanted irish <UNK> rebel frankie <UNK> wallace ford wanted for the killing of a <UNK> soldier gypo a good really the best friend of the fugitive <UNK> is down on his luck not having a job with his girlfriend katie <UNK> <UNK> forced to turn tricks in the <UNK> red light district in order to pay her rent br br after an <UNK> gypo worked over a potential john who <UNK> to spend a few hours with katie for a <UNK> or two an angry katie tells the not so bright <UNK> that he's <UNK> her for supporting herself with the only <UNK> asset she has her body katie also tells gypo that he should wake up to reality and realize what a desperate situation that she's in telling the mind <UNK> gypo that it would only cost ten pound sterling for her to go to america and get out of the poverty of ireland gypo suddenly remembers a poster of his good friend frankie <UNK> that he just saw <UNK> a reward of 20 pound sterling thats enough money for both him and <UNK> to travel to america br br gypo going to a local <UNK> flop house and soup kitchen to get a free meal is <UNK> to run into his friend frankie <UNK> frankie tells him that he <UNK> into <UNK> to see both his mother mrs <UNK> and sister mary <UNK> <UNK> heather angel and if he can make sure that everything is safe for him to go home and later leave for his irish <UNK> unit outside the city br br all gypo can see in <UNK> face is the 20 pound sterling reward for him being turned into the police without as much of a second thought after he assured frankie that everything is all right gypo secretly goes to the police and informs on his friend who's later shot and killed in a police and <UNK> shootout in his <UNK> house br br with the deed done the chief of police hands over the 20 pound sterling much like thirty pieces of silver to an almost <UNK> gypo who takes it and <UNK> out the back door of the police station so that one one can see him you can see in the police <UNK> face and actions that he has nothing but utter contempt for <UNK> betrayal of his friend frankie <UNK> even though he was wanted for murder and an enemy of the british empire that's how low <UNK> or <UNK> are held even by those whom they secretly work for br br gypo turns out to be his own worst enemy after his betrayal of frankie as his conscience takes control of his mind gypo sees and hears everyone including his unsuspecting girlfriend katie pointing a finger and <UNK> him in <UNK> betrayal and death at the hands of the british authorities <UNK> guilty mind has him getting himself <UNK> and <UNK> drunk on the reward money that by the time he's forced to to admit his crime to his irish <UNK> army colleagues who had the almost dead drunk and <UNK> gypo on trial the money was just about gone in his <UNK> drinking and <UNK> br br whatever good feelings if that's possible that you had for the weak minded and strong <UNK> gypo was completely <UNK> when in an act of total desperation in order to keep from getting shot he <UNK> <UNK> an innocent man <UNK> donald meek in his crime of <UNK> on his friend frankie <UNK> which is quickly exposed as a total <UNK> by non other then the guilt ridden gypo himself the <UNK> is then cast as <UNK> are drawn for who would be the one to put a bullet in <UNK> head for the final gut <UNK> chapter of this heart wrenching and unforgettable crime punishment classic
<START> ten out of the 11 short films in this movie are masterpieces i found only the egyptian one disappointing <UNK> all but the mexican director chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9 11 the <UNK> <UNK> deaf people <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> aids and poverty and corruption in africa <UNK> coup and ensuing bloodbath suicide <UNK> in israel paranoia hit and state <UNK> muslim americans in the usa old people living alone and the aftermath of wwii in the hearts of asian soldiers this might say something sad about the limits of empathy in both ways the directors might feel that americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and only care about their own <UNK> while they effectively do the same with their short films br br surprising myself i found sean <UNK> piece one of the very best in the collection and spoiler ahead i also guess his portrayal of ernest <UNK> as a half crazy old man <UNK> in a new york flat experiencing his widow life's <UNK> moment when the sun shines through his window after the <UNK> <UNK> out of <UNK> way i guess this might also be one of the most <UNK> as the general american audience would see it
<START> this movie is outrageous by outrageous i mean awful i had more fun watching the paint dry at my local <UNK> store on an august day while suffering from a <UNK> and heat stroke the acting got <UNK> worse as the movie advanced and the directors use of <UNK> drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached when misty was shot to death she decided that it would be <UNK> to blink post <UNK> that was not intelligent <UNK> <UNK> wonder could have caught that with his eyes closed if you are deciding between playing with a nail gun while <UNK> and watching this movie bear in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends
<START> this review is dedicated to the late keith moon and john <UNK> br br the original drum and bass br br there seems to be very little early who footage around these days if there is more then lets be <UNK> it now a days it tends to be of a very different kind of who altogether a parody a shadow of their much better years to be fair not one of them has to prove anything to anyone anymore they've earned their respect and with <UNK> br br this concert footage for me is one of their best to command an audience of around a 400 000 plus strong <UNK> takes skill charisma wit and a whole lot of bloody good music br br we all know of the other acts on the bill the doors their last ever show weeks before jim <UNK> died moody blues <UNK> taste free and many more the point being that whoever were there it was the who that the majority had come to see this show was one year after the great hippie fest of the 1960's <UNK> the film and record had come out and so had the who's greatest work to date tommy the ever hungry crowd wanted a taste to be able to experience their own unique event to be able to <UNK> and love in the knowledge that this gig was their own to do this you needed the best of what rock <UNK> roll had to throw at the <UNK> <UNK> crowd br br at two <UNK> clock in the morning in late august 1970 the m c <UNK> ladies and gentlemen a small rock <UNK> roll band from <UNK> bush london the <UNK> br br john <UNK> body suit is of black leather on the front is the out line of a human <UNK> from neck to toe roger dressed in his traditional stage outfit of long <UNK> and long flowing hair keith in a white t shirt and <UNK> as pete had his white <UNK> suit and doc <UNK> that he'd preferred to wear br br the who never stopped their <UNK> of high energy rock for over two hours performing theirs and other <UNK> greatest tracks such as young man blues <UNK> all over and then as on <UNK> keith <UNK> the <UNK> to shut up it's a bleeding opera with tommy the rock opera the <UNK> went wild this is what they had come to hear and the who didn't disappoint straight into <UNK> and never coming up for air until the final note of tommy can you hear me amazing br br to capture a show of this <UNK> of a band of this stature at their peak at a festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the world was a fantastic piece of cinematic history br br the english dvd only comes in a soundtrack of english linear <UNK> <UNK> were as in the states i think you can get it with 5 1 at least check local press for <UNK> on that okay br br the duration of the dvd is 85 minutes with no extras which is a disappointment yes for a slice of rock and festival history this dvd would send you in a nostalgia trip down memory lane the moment you press play for some of the best who concert footage as it was meant to be live raw and in your face br br i would have given this dvd ten if it wasn't for the lack of 5 1 and some extras would have been nice br br thanks roger pete john and keith
<START> i love horror movies that brings out a real amount of mystery like say silent hill which i found to be quite good but still was missing something and movies that keeps you guessing this i thought was one of those movies at first the movie starts out with some really good suspense and builds up a good starting point for a good horror scene but after that it just rolls down the hill and from there it only goes faster and faster down i mentioned silent hill at first for a reason because i can see a lot of stolen themes from that movie in here all in all i would say watch silent hill instead of this one its better its more scary it has a lot more suspense and also the ending is a lot better and best of all you wont feel ripped off as i did with this one this just seems to be one of those i like that movie so i'm gonna re make it in my own really bad version kinda movie oh and one more thing <UNK> in a horror movie thats like trying to scare a kid with a care bear who has hug me and i will love you forever written on the stomach of it
<START> i rented this movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie i figured that you really couldn't go wrong with a concept of ex girlfriend with super powers br br but the movie was confused and pointless br br it seemed that at every turn the writer kept throwing junk in also the writer kept throwing in way too much toilet humor and sexual situations that only a teenage boy could love br br it seems that it could have been so simple to draw a story out of fatal attraction super hero but i guess not br br this is not a fun romantic comedy it was advertised to be you could not take a child to see it and you would be embarrassed seeing it a date br br if the writer could have done a basic story around the high concept and <UNK> it up the movie might have a fighting chance br br a serious waste of time br br b
<START> first of all i was expecting <UNK> heat to be along the same lines as <UNK> the wicked warden boy was i wrong in no way is this film 70s exploitation <UNK> in chains or women in prison sure the plot consists of a bunch of women in prison who wear street clothes btw quite comical but nothing happens br br there aren't strong <UNK> no one tries to seduce the warden or doctor in order to try and escape and no inmates make out there are 2 shower scenes that i suspect is just recycled footage but no fights breaks out no one is <UNK> here or anywhere for that matter aside from the lack of plot unconvincing unsympathetic and flat characters a couple of inmates that do manage to escape actually return to the prison in order to free their fellow inmates br br <UNK> <UNK> the movie should have just ended off with the <UNK> riding off into the sunset as opposed to letting this mess continue br br i feel <UNK>
<START> on the face of it <UNK> has set out to make a psychological thriller although it's not as satisfying as a classic piece in that genre there are <UNK> the tensions generated between <UNK> and <UNK> as women <UNK> but <UNK> at war over a boy they both claim are compelling however in a true european art house style <UNK> doesn't give us release of this tension as the women alternately also try to behave <UNK> towards each other the only raised voice is that of <UNK> waking from a nightmare an <UNK> irrational event in the film br br in fact if we follow the title the film is as little about its thriller <UNK> as jane <UNK> in the cut instead it is an <UNK> psychological study focusing on men the boy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> decides on a practical joke playing his mother off against an emotionally vulnerable other woman both women seem to <UNK> to him rather than <UNK> and this <UNK> the problem in the background is an <UNK> psychologist charles <UNK> swift to confront the women in his life his sister <UNK> the <UNK> or his <UNK> and so acting as a symbolic adult <UNK> to the calm and we learn manipulative <UNK> it is particularly interesting that like the father in henry <UNK> the turn of the screw denis <UNK> law <UNK> father is absent for the duration of the film <UNK> fashions an <UNK> moment out of <UNK> reaction to his return at the film's close br br read either as a thriller or as a psychiatric <UNK> this film is ultimately rather disappointing i'm officially rather fed up with <UNK> <UNK> screen method which is too buried and so i'll be looking to see her on stage before i come back to her european enjoyed <UNK> gate films again the support is good <UNK> does the cast no <UNK> though quite apart from some poor lighting and some <UNK> odd shots its as if his direction has left characterisation quite out of reach i'm thinking particularly of edith <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to isabelle who acts knowing but <UNK> <UNK> the set pieces do not link up to a forward driving plot the tension i have already referred to is not only <UNK> <UNK> but wasted in its <UNK> potential br br want to see a good contemporary french thriller go and see <UNK> instead 4 10
<START> at the end of dragon heat all i could think of was why i bothered sitting through the whole thing br br the film's premise is interesting and that as well as maggie q is what attracted me to the film in the first place but was i ever disappointed writer director daniel lee can't hold a candle to the likes of john woo <UNK> <UNK> and corey <UNK> br br this has to be one of the most annoyingly directed films i have ever seen lee is so wrapped up in his visual style and i use that phrase incredibly loosely that he fills the film with completely needless black and white stills freeze frames slow motion fast motion and other visual nonsense i suppose he did all that to make up for the lack of a good story or dialogue br br the action scenes are nothing special and play out like some <UNK> up music video more than anything else there is little to care about any of the characters including two supposedly professional <UNK> who couldn't hit the broad side of a <UNK> from the inside who are then laden with some of the <UNK> dialogue i have seen in one of these hong kong <UNK> br br the plot is devoid of any twists and turns from the initial set up everything unfolds in predictable fashion and lee feels the need to keep reminding us of the characters' back stories in case we didn't get it the first several times this is awfully amateurish writing and film making and wastes the talents of sammo hung michael <UNK> and maggie q though to be frank i am hard pressed to remember <UNK> being in any good film that was not directed by james cameron br br if you really are in the mood for a great hong kong <UNK> you are much better off sticking to some of the <UNK> john <UNK> the killer 1989 and hard boiled 1992 <UNK> <UNK> city on fire 1987 which quentin tarantino stole for <UNK> dogs 1992 or his point blank 1967 remake full contact 1992 or even check out <UNK> so close 2002 a <UNK> entertaining yet preposterous popcorn flick and there's always the terrific french police <UNK> the nest 2002 br br true most if not all are a bit over the top but they were films that remain exciting thrilling and even suspenseful they have characters we care about and mind blowing action sequences br br dragon heat on the other hand is just terribly mediocre the trouble is that lee has not made a bad action film he has made a dull one
<START> a phenomenal achievement in awfulness it's actually hilariously awful br br first off nicholas cage must now have made it to the <UNK> in the over <UNK> category in his acting class wearing new hair <UNK> and with a face that has been lifted so many times his <UNK> back ears seem to be <UNK> to touch in the back he <UNK> not only a sick <UNK> but creates a hero character that you have no <UNK> interest in br br i don't know what it is with neil <UNK> and female characters he makes females out to be totally <UNK> and evil and pays them back by having cage punch several of them directly in the face and call them all b <UNK> a few times too i've enjoyed <UNK> early films and a few of his plays but it's a strange fascination he has br br i'd give this film a 2 out of 10 solely based on ellen <UNK> performance by the time she finally makes her appearance <UNK> <UNK> through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her <UNK> it seems like all hope may be lost she deserves an oscar right here and now for saying her lines with a straight face and when she appears wearing a white <UNK> and blue white and gold face paint <UNK> about the wicker man you know that working with <UNK> and <UNK> really <UNK> her for this role <UNK> well br br this movie is so wrong headed and <UNK> that is has to be seen to be believed br br highlights include nicholas cage running away from a <UNK> of <UNK> and then falling down a hill br br nicholas cage stealing a <UNK> and looking like ms <UNK> from the wizard of oz riding around on it br br nicholas cage running around the island kicking down doors looking for the missing girl br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from a once promising acting career in a <UNK> with cage br br ellen <UNK> dancing around in a said while <UNK> br br nicholas cage screaming who burned it who burned it who burned it who burned it who burned it who burned it for no reason br br nicholas cage in a bear costume i'm not kidding running through the woods taking off the costume but leaving the bear feet on and then doing some karate moves to some villains br br and you haven't lived until you have seen the final 15 minutes of the movie and its dreadful <UNK> that looked like it was shot yesterday in your <UNK> basement br br needless to say if you can make it through this film without laughing out loud then you deserve a <UNK> there was actually a point in the movie where i stopped <UNK> to wonder if maybe this wasn't an elaborate send up of <UNK> films only to be reminded when cage would scream shout <UNK> his dialogue that he really was taking himself quite seriously br br i think this one is destined to be a cult film all over again just because it's so dreadful
<START> taped this late night movie when i was in grade 11 watched it on fast forward i <UNK> you do the same i though it would be and action film but went to a <UNK> tv type movie in the end it fits in with the early 70's social <UNK> type films glad i missed that era 2 10
<START> jean <UNK> artistic nonsense about vampires aliens and the quest for <UNK> br br the women are beautiful and the photography stunning the dialog is inane its a laughable mess great to look at but as any semblance of a horror film or thriller purely awful i'm trying to figure out if we're suppose to be scared or not at the same time is it a put on or not its an odd mix of art film and horror that never quite <UNK> and while its nice to look at it never seems to mean anything and its by no means scary even if the occasional shot or sequence creates a moment of <UNK> its well made pretentious <UNK> something to leave on in the background as a living wall paper for those who like naked women
<START> i think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first <UNK> in 1943 though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness the film is set in 1940 just before the entry of the us into the war paul lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family he's a german who has spent seven years fighting the nazis and avoiding capture bette davis is his very understanding and long suffering wife who has managed to <UNK> and raise the children without him from time to time as the film begins they are crossing the border from mexico to the usa and for the first time in years they are going to relax and stop running br br the problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems while this had a very noble goal at the time it just seems phony today in particular the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn't ring true it sounded more like anti <UNK> speeches than the voices of real children they were as a result extremely annoying particularly the <UNK> one who came off at times as a brat about the only ones who sounded real were bette davis and her extended american family as well as the <UNK> romanian living with them though he had no discernible accent br br it's really tough to believe that the ultra famous <UNK> <UNK> wrote this dialog as it just doesn't sound true to life the story was based on the play by his lover <UNK> <UNK> and the basic story idea and plot is good but the dialog is just bad at times overall an interesting <UNK> and a film with some excellent moments but that's really about all

<START> that reviewers liked this movie surprises me the plot is a <UNK> the characters are wooden michael <UNK> spends most of the film <UNK> on the other characters and <UNK> all of them no one has any redeeming quality or point of interest this is not an edgy work it is not imaginative it is not ironic it is no clever there is nothing straight forward about this tedious work that is missed theatrical release is not surprise that the this network <UNK> it <UNK> that <UNK> i definitely recommend turning to a <UNK> of the garden smart show on <UNK> or even a good <UNK> if you encountered this mess on late night television if you encounter it on daytime television take a long walk even if you walk in <UNK> you will feel better not having suffered through this <UNK> life is short this movie is long
<START> this movie never made it to theaters in our area so when it became available on dvd i was one of the first to rent it for once i should listened to the critics and passed on this one br br despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing i can see now why it went straight to video br br i had thought that with bloom ledger and rush it could have some value all have done wonderful work in the past br br the movie was slow moving and never pulled me in i failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast forward just to get to the end br br i do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for <UNK> <UNK> purposes it won't satisfy even that
<START> i saw this movie a few years back on the bbc i sat thru it how i don't know this is way up there in the so bad <UNK> <UNK> kidman baldwin and <UNK> must cringe when they see it now i think woody allen would have worked wonders with the outlandish plot and <UNK> part could have been played with gusto by leslie nelson it was on again tonight i tried to watch it again but life's too short the few minutes i watched was for the lovely nicole she was so hot around <UNK> has baldwin ever made a good movie <UNK> played his stock in trade nice but dim character the f word coming out of his mouth when the lady from <UNK> miscast ed as a detective <UNK> him of murder sounds so wrong stay well away
<START> astounding this may have been a poor attempt at <UNK> the already <UNK> omen movie but i sure enjoyed it br br that last man who commented is a fool this movie was one of a kind and the music dark jerry <UNK> himself would had applaud this movie br br great <UNK> from myself to watch or buy this film br br i collect horror movies and <UNK> so listen to what i have to say not that other idiot br br there is only one thing that do not <UNK> me the endings br br according to prophecy it is all inaccurate including final conflict and left behind br br but my conclusion being there great movies and should be seen before the great depression falls upon us and before the <UNK> take over the <UNK> too br br so signed <UNK> <UNK> a farmer with a mastermind
<START> lost isn't the greatest tv show in history but it's not far off it doesn't have the plot or characterisation of the west wing or possibly even early er however it is arguably the most continuously gripping show i have every come across i love the way i can't guess what's going to happen i love the re telling of the characters' back stories which often give rise to new <UNK> for us to see them in in some ways i want the show to last forever but i think they can get 6 7 seasons out of it before they have to end it on a glorious high the combination of the characters and their <UNK> coupled with the show's <UNK> for moving backwards and <UNK> thus <UNK> dead characters life <UNK> all adds to the overwhelming sense that this show is something very different from what we are used to it's captivating surprising and here's a little suggestion for all of you conspiracy <UNK> more than a little <UNK> keep those internet discussions going you're only adding to the plot
<START> what a piece of stupid tripe br br i won't even waste time <UNK> any of the points of this show it's not worth the time the one comment i will make is why get such a dumb <UNK> <UNK> to be the star br br there aren't many more dismal <UNK> to the <UNK> mental condition of the networks than the fact that fox has stated it will not bring back john <UNK> a decent series but will bring back brain dead drivel like joe millionaire for yet another round of killing the brain cells of the american public br br fox has lost it imho
<START> i'm sorry but this may have been scary in 1978 when it came out but in modern times it just doesn't hold up the only interesting scene in the entire movie is the opening scene where michael kills his sister <UNK> wearing his halloween mask the most startling moment in the whole film is when his parents rip the mask off to see their son killed their daughter the film goes downhill from there and doesn't pick up until the last fifteen minutes but by then it's too late we the audience have lost all interest in the story there is barely any character development and people always rave about laurie being such an exceptional heroine when there really isn't much to her i'm sorry to disagree with everyone terrified by this movie but if you want a great horror movie go watch the shining or rosemary's baby those are the two best horror films ever made halloween is certainly not in their ranks i can't believe roger ebert gave it four stars for there is no way this film could ever deserve such a high rating
<START> this is an <UNK> dark comedy from <UNK> shot perfectly in crisp black and white <UNK> <UNK> man bites dog is on fine form as roger the angry obsessive father of a family in a small <UNK> <UNK> mining town roger is a photographer who along with his young daughter <UNK> visits road <UNK> to take photos he is also obsessed with winning a car by entering a competition where the contestant has to break a record and he decides that his son michel must attempt to break the record of <UNK> walking through a door he even hires an overweight coach to train him michel dresses as elvis and has a spot on a radio show called <UNK> <UNK> where he describes mistakes in films <UNK> is friendly with near <UNK> felix a <UNK> <UNK> roger is a <UNK> figure as he pushes michel right over the limit during the record attempt which almost results in his death interspersed throughout the film are <UNK> like surreal images it's undeniably charming and well worth your time
<START> towards the end of the movie i felt it was too technical i felt like i was in a <UNK> watching how our navy performs <UNK> at sea i liked seeing that the <UNK> have fire <UNK> i guess i should have figured that out before but i never thought about it using a <UNK> to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic the acting was pretty good since they're mostly seasoned professionals but if you're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen it should be more like a fantasy comical etc everything was taken too seriously at least the movie had felix <UNK> as pilot with buck rogers the night stalker and dracula also on board the movie was filled with well known faces i understand that hollywood has to <UNK> a bit for drama but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature that's why i said it should have been more comical my pet <UNK> with movies about <UNK> travel is that everybody just casually moves about they walk around with drinks setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later just as if they're in a building or something and acting as if <UNK> just doesn't exist also i know it's a disaster movie but suspense doesn't have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something anyway the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got <UNK> after it's first screening i like lee grant but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get <UNK>
<START> one of the many <UNK> <UNK> cartoons that entertained american <UNK> during wwii bob <UNK> an <UNK> in time portrays a <UNK> flea <UNK> on elmer <UNK> dog the little guy turns into a real <UNK> while making a home on the <UNK> back but elmer warns the dog one more <UNK> and i'll give you a bath meanwhile the flea is setting up dynamite on the dog and that's not the end i noticed that in one scene elmer is reading a comic book featuring bugs bunny and <UNK> pig obviously elmer and bugs frequently co starred but elmer never co starred with <UNK> unless you count the very short any bonds today but to me the thought of elmer reading about these other famous characters from his same genre <UNK> the <UNK> nature of his world as though he knew of their existence within his universe even though they don't appear in this cartoon br br of course i'm probably going too far in my analysis i'm sure that the cartoon was intended as pure entertainment and it certainly entertains as for the i might get to like this line it sounds as though that was something that the censors wouldn't have allowed but somehow missed i for one don't actually know what it was supposed to sound like was it something sexual as for the end had i thought that i'd seen everything i would have been tempted to look for more rather than do what the cat did although it was a neat trick br br the guys behind these cartoons sure had a thing for <UNK> didn't they
<START> i first see this film almost 21 years ago when it was an <UNK> before the days of cable and satellite <UNK> i was off school with the <UNK> and i was totally wrapped in the film i have had it on bought video for about 10 years and i want to obtain a dvd copy of it david niven is my all time favourite actor and i think it is a travesty that he was over looked so many times when the oscars came around i also think that the queen should have <UNK> him as he easily did as much for the movie industry if not more than sean connery or anthony hopkins the way the film switches from black and white to colour and back again is well done and the film has such stellar actors as roger <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and an early appearance from richard attenborough
<START> guinea pig the devil's experiment is without a doubt stars on first view its a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature this movie gets right to the point you may be thinking what point the point is to satisfy <UNK> of just extreme violence and gore this movie has some gore more or less just torturing a women violently there are really only 3 <UNK> that could be considered gore i'll tell you one thing though guinea pig the devil's experiment makes hostile look like <UNK> street if you thought hostile was a crazy brutal disturbing torture flick then you ain't seen the half of it until you've seen guinea pig the devil's experiment br br movie rating 0 5 gore 0 10 br br guinea pig the devil's experiment uncut 7
<START> the competition for the worst warner bros kay francis movie is stiff i've only seen perhaps eight of them but <UNK> over broadway is the worst so far the very best thing about it is that it's short oh and the <UNK> kelly <UNK> of course are fine james wong <UNK> cinematography is not kay francis throughout looks fat faced and far less attractive than she normally does <UNK> <UNK> whom i don't know otherwise is good as a semi tough <UNK> dancer it looked more like a fashion show than <UNK> the closing shot kay francis and her child when did the child learn that kay francis was her mother did i <UNK> off walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty <UNK> on a sound stage drop is beyond ludicrous the whole film is so cheap so implausible and so <UNK> that it feels infected by a sour cynicism on the part of everyone who made it warner bros <UNK> garbage to <UNK> who don't know in warner <UNK> cynical <UNK> of them that what they're getting is garbage
<START> i really loved this film yes i know it was fairly far fetched there is no way that <UNK> car could have managed to stay on the road as well as the <UNK> with all it's <UNK> control and other <UNK> but other than that the whole film was well put together cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the cast were also pretty good with the exception of the brit bad guy he was a little too much don't you think anyway great film great cars and great acting i for one made sure my car was locked and <UNK> in my remotely controlled garage that night
<START> it was easy for sir richard attenborough to make gandhi 1982 <UNK> was merely <UNK> a story of a great individual who walked on this planet not so long ago <UNK> it must have been a lot <UNK> for director <UNK> <UNK> khan making his debut as a filmmaker to make gandhi my father <UNK> a <UNK> anti hero against an international hero both of whom were historically real individuals and ironically father and son the events in the film are mostly real <UNK> gandhi lived as shown in the film setting high moral standards for the world to follow yet these very standards overshadowed the aspirations of his <UNK> son harilal to be a lawyer of <UNK> like his father to complete his education and get a job in india and thus provide <UNK> for his nuclear family br br the film does not <UNK> gandhi and his ideals for gandhi his mission was larger than his family's aspirations he loved his family and cared for them though his thoughts for their <UNK> were <UNK> by his ideal of caring for the masses he stood for <UNK> and dignity among all persons and in his view to give special <UNK> <UNK> to his own son <UNK> other deserving persons went against the basis of what he <UNK> the film looks at an unusual case of <UNK> an <UNK> parent places <UNK> <UNK> for a less than brilliant <UNK> br br the film presents an unusual scenario that happened a son marries his childhood sweetheart <UNK> his father the father <UNK> his son's educational aspirations at several key <UNK> the fragile link between a devoted son and a father breaks as the son wants to stand on his own feet and care for his nuclear family while the father gradually becomes the father of a nation the son stumbles in <UNK> quest for identity and survival his marriage breaks and seeks <UNK> in religion <UNK> between islam and <UNK> through all his <UNK> his link to his mother remains until she <UNK> him for being drunk br br <UNK> khan is essentially a director of plays making his <UNK> into cinema he wrote and directed the play <UNK> vs gandhi that had considerable impact on the indian theater community the play and the <UNK> film were based on two <UNK> one by <UNK> <UNK> and another by <UNK> <UNK> the success of the staged play was an evident reason for the commercial bollywood actor anil kapoor to produce this noteworthy film every time a good director of plays attempts to direct cinema there is an evidence of a lack of confidence with the medium peter <UNK> is a great director of plays but less competent as a film director the opening shots of <UNK> film promises great <UNK> <UNK> harilal gandhi is brought to <UNK> hospital <UNK> <UNK> barely <UNK> that his father is <UNK> the popular name of <UNK> gandhi father to an entire nation the hospital authorities do not recognize him to be <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> son dying in poverty and loneliness apart from the dramatic opening the film unfortunately merely presents a great story and some superb exterior shots of father and son <UNK> in <UNK> for an indian film it does present some high production qualities that go hand in hand with a lack of interest for details the clothes of most indians in the film seem dust free and <UNK> <UNK> modern <UNK> of actors and even <UNK> <UNK> playing <UNK> <UNK> wife a century ago with <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of indian cinema since <UNK> khan is a theater personality he has invested much more effort in working with the actors in developing the characters rather than on cinematic details somewhat like sir attenborough another person who is also a product of theater royal academy of dramatic arts br br knowing quite well that to criticize gandhi in any manner was asking for trouble even when there was no direct criticism in the film producer anil kapoor took a remarkable decision of not putting up posters of the film at accessible heights in india <UNK> that some one could tear the poster or <UNK> it intentionally or unintentionally br br with all its mix of greatness and faults gandhi my father throws several questions at the viewer is a mother son bonding stronger than a father son bonding in <UNK> is one's immediate family less important than humanity at large does one seek <UNK> in religion and alcohol only when <UNK> troubles are encountered in this film harilal <UNK> by <UNK> runs from one religion to another while his father quotes <UNK> forgive them for they know not what they do when beaten and thrown on the ground by a south african policeman convinced of the value of religion and convincing others as well br br the film won the best actress award at the tokyo international film festival for <UNK> <UNK> shah and an indian award from critics <UNK> khan and anil kapoor have handled a sensitive subject very well and <UNK> above average performances from the ensemble of actors i do hope the international success of the film <UNK> the way for some able director to film another brilliant indian play <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> some day meeting international quality standards
<START> half the reviews were good so i took a chance for 10 sure <UNK> barnes had some sex talk but it wasn't much the whole plot later that she may be the other actress mother the documentary maker falling for the young woman is <UNK> it its not funny its not that raunchy its not much of anything but a waste of time boogie nights was based on real people that were in the adult industry this is based on nothing that ever happened in the industry it could have shocked with whats popular today in adult films mocking todays <UNK> videos and that big orgy that they had 5 minutes to shoot what a joke a bigger orgy has been done bigger better decades ago in the early 1970s
<START> ah yes the vs series <UNK> being the <UNK> it's been said before this is what you get when half of the crew fell asleep on the job unfortunately the <UNK> half did don't get me wrong this is fun but you get tired of <UNK> buttons as for the plot summary <UNK> there is no plot beat that guy at the end and win eh who plays this by their self anyway
<START> one of those why was this made movies the romance is very hard to swallow it is one of those romances that suddenly click they are in love the movie is filled with long pauses and uncomfortable moments the drive in restaurant being the most notable charles <UNK> does a credible job but for most of the movie it's just him and louise <UNK> ask yourself do you want to watch <UNK> with his <UNK> and <UNK> with her <UNK> together for a hour and half
<START> saw this today with my 8 year old i thought it was cute i agree with the other poster that it wasn't anything like the book that i can remember but we still enjoyed it all of the kids are pretty good and all in all pretty entertaining billy is the new kid who accepts a dare by the school bully to eat 10 worms in a day if he loses he has to walk down the hall at school with worms in his pants the beginning of the movie is set up to show that billy has a very weak stomach and <UNK> at almost anything hilarity ensues with a bunch of different way to cook the worms good message about standing up to bullies and of course a sappy happy ending
<START> i saw this film as it was the second feature on a disc containing the previously banned video nasty <UNK> <UNK> as blood <UNK> was entirely awful i really wasn't expecting much from this film but actually it would seem that trash director andy <UNK> has <UNK> himself this time as <UNK> of sin tops blood <UNK> in style and stands tall as a more than adequate slice of sick sixties <UNK> the plot is actually quite similar to blood <UNK> as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit and of course there is an inheritance at stake the film is shot in black and white and the look and feel of it reminded me a lot of the trash classic 'the curious dr <UNK> there's barely any gore on display and the director seems <UNK> to focus on sex with themes of incest and hatred <UNK> through the acting is typically trashy but most of the women get to appear nude at some point and despite a poor reputation director andy <UNK> actually seems to have an eye for this sort of thing as many of the sequences in this film are actually quite beautiful the plot is paper thin and most of the film is filler but the music is catchy and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes themselves as most are somewhat erotic overall this is not a great film but it's likely to appeal to the cult fan and gets a much higher recommendation than the better known and lower quality <UNK> <UNK>
<START> overall i was rather impressed with the pilot the initial first fifteen minutes were worrying as it did feel the creators were trying to create a science fiction version of the o c but this fear is <UNK> when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show steps into themes and situations that i very rarely see television tackle br br bsg dealt with themes such as <UNK> <UNK> reality death and terrorism but they were primarily subtext there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose here on the other hand these subjects are the focus of the show and i personally found myself <UNK> such works as ghost in the shell and the matrix as reference points while watching and being surprised by how well the themes were being discussed i think if you are a fan of the two i just mentioned or other films television shows which deal with the subjects i <UNK> i think you will find at least something here br br in terms of a starting point to explain how the situation we know in bsg came about i believe they handled it in a very interesting way i especially liked how they explained where the <UNK> belief in one god came from and the creation of caprica had just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to us as viewers br br the only real weak points i noticed were the relationship between the <UNK> parents and the actress who plays <UNK> <UNK> while i like eric <UNK> and paula <UNK> <UNK> together their scenes seemed to lack chemistry at this point it could simply be down to developing their characters but this is something i think needs work i also found <UNK> <UNK> to be unconvincing in her role this again could be down to experience and time needed to develop but throughout the episode her acting appeared forced and not completely confident br br based on the pilot i greatly look forward to seeing where <UNK> goes in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that bsg once did
<START> cinderella is one of the most beloved of all disney classics and it really deserves its status based on the classic fairy tale as told by charles <UNK> the film follows the trials and <UNK> of cinderella a good girl who is <UNK> by her evil stepmother and equally unlikable <UNK> when a royal ball is held and all <UNK> young women are invited read the king wants to get the prince to marry cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her but there is a fairy <UNK> on hand br br the story of cinderella on its own wouldn't be able to pad out a feature so whilst generally staying true to the story otherwise the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the fairy <UNK> uses to help get the title character to the ball become <UNK> true <UNK> the mice <UNK> and gus are the main <UNK> and their own nemesis being the <UNK> cat <UNK> their antics <UNK> generally with the main fairy tale plot and are for the most part wonderful admittedly the film does slow down a bit between the main introduction of the characters and shortly before the <UNK> <UNK> for the ball but after this <UNK> the film really gets going again and surprisingly since cinderella is the most worn down story of all time probably ends up as one of the most involving disney stories br br the animation and art direction is lovely all of the legendary nine old men animated on this picture and mary <UNK> colour <UNK> and concept art she also did concept art and colour <UNK> for alice in wonderland peter pan the three <UNK> and many many others manage to <UNK> their way on screen the colours and designs are lovely especially in the fairy <UNK> and ball scenes as well as in those pretty little moments here and there br br overall cinderella ranks as one of the best disney fairy tales and comes recommended to young and all that <UNK> the disney philosophy that dreams really can come true
<START> too many secondary plot lines without a primary one too many hot buttons are pushed without any reason they managed to stuff this boring film that does not say anything with every drama element that is out there death divorce money issues <UNK> problems suicide psychological problems drug abuse <UNK> rejected love traveling problems sex generations <UNK> robbery legal issues guns medical <UNK> deep real love  you would think that it would make for an interesting movie but hell no  all these events are secondary to something primary which is not there boring not to mention that the super deep and super long lecture to the child at the end of the film is a total nonsense pity br br oh forgot to mention the actors all of them are quite good that's what kept me from turning it off to bad their talents went to waste the film is well shot too the light the motion etc of every episode that's all in place it's just the meaning that's missing
<START> i disliked <UNK> returns and this one both of the films are absurd with poorly written characters and bad voices the voices could have been done but <UNK> returns was worst than this because of the <UNK> snowman they drew <UNK> <UNK> land was great and so was the original heartwarming drama the only good thing about this film was <UNK> the snowman was alike of the classic 60s and a funny line like when they were talking about things that are not real and then <UNK> walks by the window <UNK> <UNK> whatever he was doing but everything else was badly written and badly animated and i barely got the plot i saw the dvd cover at the library about 2 or 3 years ago and the art looked crappy so i didn't pick it up until this year because the pictures on the back looked a little touching but i played this film it was a <UNK> poorly art characters just like the dvd and it was just terrible about what's going on i watched this at night and found it dull that i fell asleep on the whole thing wait i always do that when i watch something while i go to sleep but this movie was overall boring br br overall rating grade c br br this is like another holiday special bad rip off in the <UNK> returns and this one this one is the badly 4th sequel like home alone 4 well i thought that movie was ok but home alone 3 was great but it's like a bad home alone 3 and 4 people hate like this my sister didn't watch it that much because when she came into my room to watch 2 minutes and a half of it she walked away like i hate the animation i agree to her just like the 3rd one <UNK> returns plain awful
<START> i loved this movie the characters were people that you could feel for the young man back from the service still in love with the girl he left behind tom drake is always perfect in the romantic lead as well as donna reed as the love of his life the looks he gives her as if he has been <UNK> for the sight of her as well as her <UNK> and confusion as too her feelings for him were played very well the rest of the quirky characters at the store were perfect as they tried to bring them together the most touching scene however was the young couple at his great <UNK> house i laughed in parts cried in some and thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie in fact i've re watched it about 5 times a definite must see for total <UNK>
<START> even with a cast that boasts such generally reliable names as val kilmer and lisa <UNK> wonderland fails to <UNK> any sense of depth to this film it barely <UNK> the surface of the incidents that happened on that july night in 1981 kilmer just goes through the motions as john holmes and <UNK> and kate <UNK> are both hopefully miscast in the other two lead roles as <UNK> wife and <UNK> girlfriend respectively the rest of the cast has such small roles that it's impossible to get any <UNK> from them the film also stars carrie fisher ted <UNK> <UNK> g <UNK> <UNK> dylan mcdermott and a cameo from paris hilton
<START> this will be a different kind of review i've seen this movie twice on tv and would like to have a copy because it talks about <UNK> city and the beach in the winter time which is my favorite time to be there it was the first movie i'd seen by ashley judd and she was great and i've enjoyed every other thing i've seen her in <UNK> reaction made an impression on me too as did the director victor <UNK> who has directed and written several movies about florida this movie speaks to me and i've seen nothing with which to compare it the plot speaks less to me than the surroundings well i told you it would be a different kind of review
<START> this was a must see documentary for me when i missed the opportunity in 2004 so i was definitely going to watch the repeat i really <UNK> with the main character of the film because this is true i have a <UNK> condition of the skin problem he had <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this is a sad sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder <UNK> kennedy speaks like a kid because of wasting vocal muscle and never went through <UNK> but he is <UNK> years old most <UNK> moments are seeing his terrible condition and <UNK> off his <UNK> <UNK> had quite a naughty sense of humour he even narrated from beyond the grave when showing his body in a coffin he tells his story with the help of his mother <UNK> kennedy his older brother and celebrity model and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it won the <UNK> for best editing and best new director factual and it was nominated for best sound factual and the <UNK> documentary award it was number 10 on the 100 greatest tv treats 2004 a must see documentary
<START> macy <UNK> and sutherland were as great as usual ritter wasn't bad either what's her name was as pretty as usual it could have been a good movie to bad the plot was atrocious it was completely predictable trite and boring br br from the first 15 minutes the rest of the movie was laid out like a child's paint by numbers routine the characters were stock pieces of cut out cardboard there was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely <UNK> the acting which was a pity br br finally too bad the script writer wasn't the victim especially with the <UNK> lines from the child which were completely unbelievable br br again it's only the acting that prevented a much lower score
<START> two <UNK> travel deep in the <UNK> in search for their targets a slimy south american drug lord and a prominent general br br moderately successful at building a brooding atmosphere sniper is by most accounts a very solid thriller taking it's time establishing it's characters and their plight and <UNK> in some good action sequences director <UNK> isn't always successful at maintaining the <UNK> mood and could have <UNK> the story somewhat some <UNK> here don't add up to much but this film is far better than his stallone stone travesty the <UNK> br br billy zane usually incredibly tiresome does surprisingly well as the inexperienced sniper teamed up with veteran berenger as for berenger this film proved to be his last good big budget hollywood venture he can do these kind of roles in his sleep and he's very convincing here <UNK> the role twice more in direct to dvd sequels
<START> i went into this movie thinking that it would be a neat football drama in the same vein as remember the <UNK> however i came away feeling like i had just attended a ted <UNK> <UNK> about the rapture the only thing that was missing was the request for a <UNK> at the end of the movie actually one would probably get more out of a <UNK> <UNK> than this poor excuse for entertainment at least with the <UNK> <UNK> there are quotes from the <UNK> rather than quotes from <UNK> self help pulp the plot was entirely too predictable to the point that anyone with a long enough attention span could have laid out the entire plot within the first 15 minutes of the movie
<START> <UNK> directed by christian <UNK> centers around three couples and their relationships with obsession and violence pretty good start as far as i'm concerned interesting the couples break down into a <UNK> couple two <UNK> male friends and a straight guy being <UNK> stalked by a gay man br br the <UNK> couple really don't have much of a role in the film there are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive when having sex or playing around with each other but seem to have no real purpose since the are so <UNK> my <UNK> is that they represent a more day to day <UNK> of how sex violence are integrated in a couples life the couple aren't very aggressive and it's not even shot in any kind of erotic way as characters they don't add much to the theme or plot br br the two male friends make up the bulk of the plot they engage in some gay bashing of sorts by convincing a homosexual man to have sex with them in an alley this <UNK> into violence and the violence changes them it becomes a means of sexual <UNK> and their need for violence t release grows as the film progresses the main problem i had is the violence is not convincing never once does it seem that any of the characters is in any real danger it just doesn't work given that the whole theme of the film is about the characters' relationships with violence this is a major problem unfortunately the make up doesn't help either sometimes it's okay other times it is very bad in one scene i really wondered why one of the characters had <UNK> <UNK> on his face confusing br br the more interesting pair of the characters is the stalker couple here <UNK> seemed to have more to say and was able to develop a more coherent storyline perhaps it is because the characters seem to develop more and have resolution at the end <UNK> may well have been much better if it had stuck with these two br br i appreciate that <UNK> wanted to achieve a lot with this film it is admirable most low budget flicks don't <UNK> to much i don't think <UNK> achieved want he was aiming for myself i found nothing particularly controversial or unsettling <UNK> was unconvincing this doesn't mean however that the director can't achieve something with his next film br br he seems to have something to say
<START> the acting is bad ham all the jokes are superficial and the target audience is clearly very young children assuming they have below average <UNK> i realize that it was meant for kids but so is <UNK> in the middle yet they still throw in adult humor and situations br br what should we expect from a show lead by bob <UNK> the only comedian in existence who is less funny than a ball hitting a man's <UNK> which is probably why he stopped <UNK> america's funniest home videos br br parents do not let your kids watch this show unless you want to save money on college expose your kids to stupidity and they will grow up <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is a tough cop he goes after a big time drug dealer played by henry <UNK> normally a great villain see <UNK> machine but here he is clearly dubbed and because of that he lacks his usual charisma he goes to the <UNK> places of paris and <UNK> asks for some names beats up some people gets the names goes to more <UNK> places asks for more names beats up more people etc the whole movie is punch after punch after punch it seems that the people who made it had no other ambition than to create the french equivalent of dirty harry <UNK> who was 50 here does perform some good stunts at the beginning apart from those le <UNK> is a violent episodic trite shallow and forgettable cop movie 1 2
<START> how can you tell that a horror movie is terrible when you can't stop laughing about it of course the plot has been well covered by other reviewers so i'll just add a few things on the hilarity of it all br br some reviews have placed the location in south america others in africa i thought it was in some random island in the pacific where exactly does this take place seems to be a mystery the cannibal tribe is <UNK> by a couple of black women some black men and a man who looks like a young frank <UNK> <UNK> the drums the devil god is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eyes br br one of the <UNK> moments in the film is when <UNK> find his partner hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that i assume is blood starts screaming for minutes on and on that's actually funny and then the head of his partner falls in the ground and <UNK> kicks it a bit for what i assume is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the eyes actually move br br but of course then the freak is gone when you realize the eyes moved because the movie is just bad br br i hadn't laughed like this in a <UNK> while and i definitely recommend this film for a sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do grab a case of beers and start watching this film you'll love it if you are looking for a real horror or gore movie though <UNK> bother
<START> some <UNK> friends recommended live feed to me and basically i can't really complain as the film certainly does deliver <UNK> amounts of gross <UNK> and <UNK> full of sleaze but it is of course not a very good film more than obviously <UNK> in on the latest trend in horror cinema the so called torture porn ryan nicholson tries to <UNK> every other film in this sub genre and that includes the role models hostel and saw with its sick twisted make up effects and thoroughly <UNK> shots of naked co <UNK> tried up suffering and begging for their lives there's no actual plot to describe five utterly brainless twenty something friends take a trip to asia one of them has asian roots but other than that i don't really know why they <UNK> to travel there instead of to <UNK> they're clearly not interested in the <UNK> culture and even cause a <UNK> scene when they witness a local <UNK> a cute puppy dog on the market the <UNK> subsequently <UNK> into the lurid night life and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan a simply <UNK> clearly doesn't suffice as the gangster follow them into an adult theater and gradually subject all of them to vicious torture one girl has her breast <UNK> and another poor <UNK> even has a <UNK> snake shoved down her throat <UNK> live feed is surprisingly boring despite of all the bloodshed and the amateurish production values are quite difficult to overlook even if you're used to watching independent fan boy trash cinema like this the fat bloke depicted on the cover an oriental s m <UNK> is admittedly quite cool and he's also the most talented of the whole bunch because he at least keeps his mouth shut the entire time i wouldn't exactly recommend this pile of filth but hey if you like loud hideous metal music nauseating torture footage and dim witted losers go right ahead and watch
<START> remember the name kevin <UNK> and please please never let br br him direct again timing pacing editing all hopelessly wrong br br three or four decent professionals next time guys walk off the br br set can do nothing to save this film from amateurs like alice br br evans and the kind of production standards you'd expect from br br teen produced children's shows on british tv br br greatest mystery the music a score so inept inappropriate and br br ill matched to the tone of the film that one seriously wonders if it is br br a case of <UNK> add an <UNK> that <UNK> apparently br br <UNK> from a single mike and a director who only br br <UNK> remembers to add <UNK> action <UNK> and we br br have what must be on of the greatest ratio of money to result of br br recent years
<START> i really loved this movie and so did the audience that i saw it with in los angeles after the film lots of people were crying and saying how much the film had affected them i can see why it was such a huge hit in its <UNK> sweden the film is masterfully directed and each character brilliantly drawn so that by the end you really know these people and care about them the music is very natural and the main song in the film quite heartbreaking but inspiring would definitely recommend this film for everyone to see even people who don't normally go to subtitled films definitely deserved the oscar nomination because of the profound themes of the film reflected without <UNK> in a small town community with everyday people it is a film that <UNK> us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit a must see
<START> what can i say i have grown up watching hum <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hum <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> have always been different movies are part of our lives in <UNK> times <UNK> creates something thats hard to find love and joint family that loving and great vivah is journey for a couple that are getting <UNK> marriage that turns on <UNK> and love marriage shahid has done fine work <UNK> as always brilliant amrita <UNK> quit different even though i felt that <UNK> the other to me she doesn't suit in that role we've seen her in <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and main ho on <UNK> so quit different role that she isn't in to she is been excellent in main ho on <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> but may be she could've put little more in the role anyways great going work by <UNK> this movie <UNK> the values that we forgot sweet film of the year great music and lyrics i am not sure if its a remake but anyways brilliant story that is original <UNK> movies have been brilliant all the way so we always expect something different from him great work by all the cast the crew and everybody lovely family film to enjoy with your parents siblings friends and love ones i give it 10 out of 10
<START> barbara streisand directs and stars in this very jewish story br br to have a chance at <UNK> an education <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> herself as a boy which isn't the most difficult thing to do since she already looks like a boy anyway at her new school she meets many male classmates who have no trouble at all in believing she's a guy br br don't miss the best of many moments of unintentional humor when <UNK> male friend thinks she's a man but <UNK> <UNK> to the ground sits on top of <UNK> and looks <UNK> into <UNK> eyes <UNK> br br mediocre film <UNK> story about nothing particularly interesting
<START> absolutely laughable film i live in london and the plot is so ill <UNK> it's ridiculous no one could be <UNK> on the london underground in the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of <UNK> workers down there checking the tracks and performing <UNK> etc that there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely or that it's even possible to get locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and age br br the worst that's likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get <UNK> <UNK> on them although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network another thorn in the side of the story remember in london as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the world br br if it had been set in a city i am not familiar with perhaps i could have enjoyed it through ignorance but it's not a high quality film so i just couldn't bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it for the banal little tale that it is br br i would have given it 0 10 if such a rating existed possibly the most disappointing film i ever thought i would like
<START> if you thought that the original from <UNK> was bad then try out this modern day masterpiece how could it be worse more you ask well at least in the first one you had ally <UNK> <UNK> in a sports <UNK> other than updated graphics modern day themes such as terrorists modern weapons and a sexy new voice for <UNK> unfortunately this is the same sad tired story anyone that saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene line in the story was going and for anyone that didn't see the first one well consider yourself lucky that you only watched it once maybe in another 23 years hollywood will try again
<START> i feel like i'm the only kid in town who was annoyed by branagh's performance he is a fine actor by most accounts but he simply could not pull off the southern accent i mean it was <UNK> it was as if he was trying too hard to be a <UNK> one of the previous reviewers <UNK> why u s actors were not cast in this film i second that notion it's wonderful when actors actresses wish to expand their <UNK> but it's another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained maybe it was altman but he's a such a great director br br well i really don't want to bash branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much everybody deserves to screw up here and there but it is hard to watch something so annoying that you'd rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap than sit through the <UNK> man
<START> i've watched a bunch of episodes of cold case since its premiered especially now that it immediately follows the amazing race but this was one of the best instances of writing and acting i've seen from the house of bruckheimer the casting especially of the younger officers was spot on and the script and editing the soundtrack and the acting made this episode a tour <UNK> if i were the producers i would submit this episode for emmy consideration it amazing how complete a portrait was made of coop and jimmy within the confines of s 48 minute episode that takes a lot of talented people doing their best i hope there's is advance warning of when this episode is repeated because i'm sure i'll notice a lot that i did not notice the first time around
<START> this movie was made for people who found <UNK> too serious and <UNK> to hardcore like many of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> movies of the 80's this movie is bad the sad part is that there's no punchline to that comment it's just bad and not in a funny way br br the problem with this <UNK> monster movie is that it actually tries to be funny and ends up being as successful in doing that as <UNK> <UNK> was in walk like a man what made the other 80's horror movies into classics was that they were genuinely trying to be scary but were hilarious because they failed so miserably someone must have told <UNK> <UNK> yes the <UNK> <UNK> she had a knack for comedy before she started directing this movie unfortunately they were wrong br br sure seeing a weird little mutated cross between a <UNK> and a <UNK> wearing a brown <UNK> and throwing pool balls at an <UNK> from the lost boys is amusing but not enough to save the movie br br by far the most annoying part of the movie is the paul character his paul reiser wannabe <UNK> is enough to make you start fast <UNK> from the time of his first scene until the ending credits only stopping once to see a scene where a <UNK> throws pool balls at a guy not that i did that br br so the bottom line is run don't walk to your nearest blockbuster and shake hands with the manager and thank him for not having the <UNK> to stock this pile of garbage on the shelves
<START> ealing studios a television and film production company based in west london claims to be the oldest film studio in the world though it has been consistently <UNK> out films and television <UNK> since the 1930s its golden age was most certainly between 1948 and 1955 when it produced a string of comedy masterpieces many starring the great alec guinness such well known titles include <UNK> <UNK> 1949 ' <UNK> to <UNK> 1949 ' <UNK> hearts and <UNK> 1949 ' 'the <UNK> hill mob 1951 ' 'the <UNK> <UNK> 1953 ' and 'the <UNK> 1955 ' one of ealing <UNK> most beloved films 'the man in the white suit ' was released in 1951 and starred alec <UNK> as sidney <UNK> a brilliant <UNK> who <UNK> a remarkable fabric an invention that unexpectedly makes him more enemies than friends br br sidney <UNK> is poor and <UNK> but he has scientific talent in great abundance due to his under <UNK> the only jobs he is able to get are as a janitor or <UNK> at any of the large <UNK> <UNK> where he secretly <UNK> his own experiments using the <UNK> own money and equipment after being found out and <UNK> countless times sidney is convinced that he is only weeks away from a <UNK> scientific discovery that will <UNK> the <UNK> industry encouraged by his daughter daphne joan <UNK> <UNK> mill owner alan <UNK> cecil parker takes a keen interest in <UNK> exploits and agrees to <UNK> any further work after numerous failed attempts and quite a few earth shattering explosions sidney eventually <UNK> his amazing creation an almost <UNK> white fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out br br if sidney thought that his invention would make him a hero then he was sorely disappointed the all powerful bosses of <UNK> industry headed by the <UNK> sir john <UNK> ernest <UNK> <UNK> to ensure that the revolutionary invention which could completely <UNK> their <UNK> never goes into full scale production likewise the humble <UNK> in the <UNK> union hear of <UNK> creation and also set out to <UNK> it from existence <UNK> for their jobs the <UNK> however is convinced that the ever lasting fabric will bring relief and happiness to many and refuses to give in to the demand of others despite being threatened with violence and offered <UNK> 000 in <UNK> throughout all his troubles to <UNK> his invention to the media only one person offers sidney her complete sympathy and support <UNK> daughter daphne who is engaged to be married to somebody else but falls in love with <UNK> plight anyway br br 'the man in the white <UNK> is a clever and hilarious comedy made great by a witty script written by john <UNK> roger <UNK> and director alexander <UNK> and a quirky and charismatic performance from an <UNK> alec guinness there are also a few good natured <UNK> at capitalism and of how big <UNK> can hold back progress for the sake of their own <UNK> situations though we can certainly see the arguments for either side of the debate
<START> this movie had me going the title was perhaps the greatest idea that i heard i thought it was an independent movie about a zombie <UNK> and their quest to take over the us and a group of lone survivors band together and plan to take out the zombies dead wrong it's about a psycho cop with a weakness for killing his female <UNK> gets what's coming to him when a pack of zombie women rise from their graves in order to get proper revenge as you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved where to begin with the <UNK> this cinematic disaster caused our nation br br first off the zombie women look like victoria secret models with dark <UNK> and a pale face what are zombies but mindless <UNK> intelligent <UNK> killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs these zombie women walk like <UNK> and <UNK> models they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies sure the eating and killing is there but where is the <UNK> and the horrible <UNK> although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre it makes fun of that genre and asks the question why can't zombies be beautiful <UNK> killing machines i would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage <UNK> i would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much it's an insult and as for <UNK> even
<START> this is the <UNK> collection of clichés strung together on a straight line with no discernible plot or any decent way of acting i've seen in a long time <UNK> scenes from star wars reign of fire godzilla lord of the rings and harry potter it went for an all out war on the viewer intelligence was this movie good it wasn't a movie at all br br even if it doesn't go so low to actually be funny and achieve cult status as a comedy the movie does offer some laughs the trick is to put the copied scenes in the context of their original films <UNK> can be funny talking korean the <UNK> looking snake hilarious if you compare it to a <UNK> and the evil henchman can provide a lot of fun switching back and forth between <UNK> and <UNK> bing or whatever his name was br br bottom line any pleasure derived from this movie is completely <UNK> on the state of <UNK> and imagination of the viewers not on the director writer shame on you <UNK>
<START> this worldwide was the cheap man's version of what the <UNK> under jim <UNK> junior and jim <UNK> <UNK> made back in the 1980s on the <UNK> big 3 stations during the saturday morning afternoon wrestling <UNK> when ted turner got his hands on <UNK> failed version of <UNK> he turned it into world championship wrestling and <UNK> to drop all <UNK> references all together <UNK> world wide and <UNK> pro wrestling were <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> and moved off the road to disney mgm studios in orlando florida and eventually became nothing more than <UNK> shows for <UNK> <UNK> thunder and saturday night worldwide was officially the last <UNK> program under turner to air the weekend of the <UNK> <UNK> from vince <UNK> and <UNK> today the entire <UNK> world wide <UNK> worldwide video tape archive along with the entire <UNK> <UNK> video tape library in general lay in the <UNK> of wwe <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK>
<START> can anybody tell me where is the comedy br br charlie sheen is a very weak comedian thomas <UNK> church is looking so feeble with him and the whole thing is so <UNK> br br they tried to make a live comic book which turned out to be super bloody comic nightmare and it wasn't even funny like the <UNK> scene in the bathroom it was so good with its cinematic imagination but there is nothing more except pain br br donald sutherland his relationship with his daughter br br this is actually a kind of work which they made it just to made it and earn some money from it but it became such a crime when this money would be robbed from the very us whom got <UNK> by so low art work and an entertainment had absolutely no entertainment at all br br well it would've been <UNK> if it was big production and starring brando in his golden years with a real star br br the <UNK> family in here just be aware of that br br anyone who found themselves <UNK> this movie or god <UNK> loving it then you must go directly to therapy before you become more dangerous and hurt anybody else br br brando undoubtedly is a genius but the movie isn't and he wasn't <UNK> to be one in here after reading this for sure but the main big problem is that no one else ever worked in this thing trying or wanting to be a small time smart or even good sorry i'm crying now the movie's torturing is unbelievable br br there is a scene where brando hitting mira sorvino by her shoes that was so realistic maybe he was seeing himself in her so he was <UNK> himself for being in such a crap br br for the <UNK> time this one could've been better or less worse the script till the <UNK> heist was nice and i just imagined that they'd escape to have some chase like it's another <UNK> and the <UNK> but with brando as the sheriff in fact any of those <UNK> was much <UNK> than what i've watched br br why this masterpiece didn't receive any <UNK> award you want to make me believe that there was lower movie than this i do not think so it's a situation where the <UNK> <UNK> must himself win one for his <UNK> br br martin sheen is here also as a guest star maybe for supporting his failure son but ironically the father was as failure as his son and why is that well because i hate martin sheen maybe more than i hate comic movies weren't as good as its ambition br br it's not a comedy movie no it's a horror one and i just hate horror movies especially those which have been <UNK> as comic ones br br name good thing about it hmmm well this one compared to another marlon <UNK> monster movie the island of dr <UNK> 1996 would be close to casablanca br br p s if you still want to know what are or who are precisely the bad the ugly and the very ugly in this movie just pray your last <UNK> and go watch it may god help you
<START> as a young teenager at the time <UNK> was <UNK> viewing for a generation who wanted their <UNK> and indians to have amazing <UNK> and <UNK> bang explosions br br in many ways the show was essentially knight rider in the <UNK> similar comic book technology a central character who was essentially a loner and <UNK> the concept of one man making a difference br br but in other important ways it was <UNK> very different from knight rider street <UNK> the a team and other action shows of the time for one thing the premise of the series is built not on a desire to help those in need but by <UNK> <UNK> possession of <UNK> for essentially selfish reasons as <UNK> to try to find his <UNK> brother st john and then there is the dark edge provided by <UNK> the series firmly in an 80s cold war context complete with soviet espionage and central american <UNK> not to mention the enemy within sure the a team constantly referred back to vietnam and the <UNK> status as <UNK> but it was generally done with a light touch and was rarely central to the plot itself with <UNK> the intrigue was key to the tone and direction of the show although this was ill <UNK> <UNK> as the series went on br br with <UNK> the cold war setting clearly dates the series many of the stories are <UNK> and contrived and much of what <UNK> does is clearly implausible even with today's technology but that's really not the point <UNK> was rip roaring fun it tried to tell interesting stories without relying solely on the big action sequences and it didn't sugar coat everything by miraculously <UNK> nobody died sometimes it failed but often it succeeded admirably and on a tv budget to boot br br for uk readers <UNK> sky channel <UNK> have just started jan 2008 daily re runs of <UNK> set your sky box for this blast from the past we may even get the re <UNK> re cast and sadly vastly inferior fourth season which to my knowledge has never previously been shown in the uk
<START> to this day when you speak of the japanese cinema most folks won't talk about <UNK> or the seven <UNK> or ran to the masses the japanese cinema means all those monsters we've grown to love destroying those japanese cities over and over again lots of times in battles with each other the first and greatest of these is godzilla who's come back a dozen times or more and in a few films faced the three headed <UNK> like monster from outer space <UNK> br br oddly enough in keeping with the times the special effects got slightly better but part of the charm of those old films was seeing those paper <UNK> city sets destroyed they looked so phony maybe three steps above ed wood br br some <UNK> from the future have time traveled to japan to urge that godzilla be destroyed from when he was first discovered and in fact he was first discovered as a surviving dinosaur during world war ii when he <UNK> the japanese <UNK> on a pacific island from those american troops but later on with atomic testing on bikini godzilla the friendly dinosaur just like barney became the mean machine we've grown to know in the cinema br br of course you eliminate godzilla than you give <UNK> a clear field to wreck japan so it does not become the economic <UNK> it was by 1991 when the film came out more i won't say but we all know japan is doing reasonably well as <UNK> br br like all the other japanese monster films just sit back and enjoy the mayhem
<START> the caprica episode <UNK> is well done as a pilot really this episode is the exact same content as the dvd pilot release that having been said episode <UNK> gives a very <UNK> background of the very popular battlestar galactica series both the original and the 2007 remake it significantly applies most to the 2007 series as is the <UNK> plots of sci fi of late this series explores virtual life or environment on top of this we are given much background on the <UNK> family line as well as their relationship with the <UNK> in the battlestar galactica series creator of the <UNK> to the most part this first episode revolves around the popular topic of virtual life and as is expected early life of the <UNK> and the birth of the <UNK> br br over all i rather enjoyed this episode although it was not new material for myself or anyone that has already seen the dvd release of the caprica pilot the series seems very promising as is the case with many pilots episode <UNK> leaves us with a cliff <UNK> so to ensure a follow by an audience sci fi community i'm definitely going to keep watching for resolve as well as development br br i give this series 8 stars
<START> this movie is a pathetic attempt apparently to justify the actions of mary ann <UNK> in order to do this they cast a 19 year old well probably not in order to do this there was no way they could have cast a 12 or 13 year old as the boy because the love scenes would have <UNK> everyone out if they had even been allowed to do them as they should mary <UNK> boyfriend was my <UNK> age making her a <UNK> sixth grade people the definition of <UNK> doesn't have to include many children all you need is one br br i really don't care about her upbringing or her unhappy marriage she had a responsibility to her students that she did not live up to the reason given is that she is <UNK> rejected the <UNK> and refused to take her <UNK> it's understandable then that she was not thinking <UNK> one hopes that she now understands her actions br br now that she and <UNK> are married and have two children together i pray that she is on her <UNK> and thinking clearly br br all that aside penelope ann miller was totally convincing and perfect casting for the role
<START> one can only assume that robert <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> to express delight at even the least appealing films in the tcm library as this would explain him <UNK> the <UNK> of this charming film during his introduction when i saw this on cable tv seeing as any old film on imdb receives <UNK> status from a number of <UNK> amateur reviewers i thought there was a dire need for a more honest review of this film br br this is not your father's <UNK> around the <UNK> for all my <UNK> with <UNK> got <UNK> it still <UNK> this as a remake in just about every way imaginable for those who have seen the original the flaws will only be all the more obvious br br from one of the <UNK> meet cute sequences i can recall seeing a sad slapstick attempt at <UNK> this film gets off on the wrong foot and it never really gets back in step this <UNK> only qualifies as one in the <UNK> sense of the term there are a <UNK> of instantly forgettable musical numbers and then there's judy singing i don't care while <UNK> her arms around as if in a <UNK> the christmas song she sings in the store is probably one of her better numbers here miss garland was wonderful in a number of musical films but here she seems horribly miscast the role was originally to have been filled by june <UNK> and judy is definitely unable to fill the shoes of margaret <UNK> old part van johnson also turns in a rather bland performance as a second rate jimmy stewart type the leads never achieve the chemistry of stewart <UNK> or even that of hanks ryan br br this is a film that knows some of the notes but not the music it doesn't really seem to understand why the original worked and even feels the need to add another possible love interest for van <UNK> character to <UNK> things unnecessarily the <UNK> <UNK> for the <UNK> infidelity subplot is a hackneyed plot device involving a priceless <UNK> it is almost embarrassing to watch and feels as if it had perhaps been lifted from an episode of <UNK> company by someone with a <UNK> and a <UNK> <UNK> it's really just an excuse for a keaton <UNK> even the big resolution scene between the romantic leads is <UNK> after seeing both films you'll understand why they called it 'the lubitsch <UNK> and not the <UNK> z leonard <UNK> br br avoid this and <UNK> either the original film or one of judy <UNK> earlier films unless you're an <UNK> who enjoys seeing a once great star falling down to earth
<START> <UNK> full moon a creature a huge werewolf is on the hunt not for flesh not for blood not that it seem to mind to take a bite on the way though but for a mate he is on the hunt for a girl not any girl though the girl the girl that is pure and also a werewolf although she doesn't know it yet three well check that two cops after the first scene and an old bag lady is all that can stop it or even knows that the thing killing and eating a lot of folks around full moon is a werewolf this particular powerful werewolf <UNK> is closing in on the girl if he gets her mankind is doomed now the cops has to find the girl convince her not only that there is someone a werewolf nonetheless that wants to rape her and perhaps kill her but that she is a werewolf herself and then they got to stop him br br comments this is one for the boys the teenage boys a lot of scenes with semi nude girls more or less important for the plot mostly less well i guess you need something to fill some time because the plot is <UNK> thin and unfortunately there is little besides the girls to help the plot from breaking one usually turns to two main themes nudity check and then special effects hmm well there are some things that you might call effects they're not very special though in fact to be blunt they are very bad the movie seems to be suffering of a lack of <UNK> they couldn't afford clothes for some of the girls and the effects are cheap some of the <UNK> between werewolf and human form obviously done by computer are really bad you might overlook such things but the <UNK> in itself is very crude too and you never get to see any killings just some <UNK> corpses afterwards and there is surprisingly little blood about in a movie that honestly should be <UNK> in blood br br i'm not sure what to say about actors and characters most of the times they do well but unfortunately there are <UNK> were the characters or actors just <UNK> it a few of these <UNK> could be connected with the problems mentioned above like the poor effects or the poor budget that could explain why there is precious little shooting even if the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in plain sight and not moving but hey when you're in real danger there nothing that will save your life like a good one liner br br unfortunately that can't explain moments when the cop steve the only one who knows how to maybe deal with the problem the werewolf that is runs away when the only things he can be sure of is that the werewolf is coming for the girl who is just beside him now and that he cannot let it have her but sure it let the makers stretch the ending a little more br br but i wouldn't mind seeing none of the lead actors actresses get another try in another movie br br well to give a small conclusion not a movie that i recommend br br 3 10
<START> inspirational tales about triumph of the human spirit are usually big turn offs for me the most surprising thing about men of honor is how much i enjoyed it in spite of myself the movie is as predictable and cliched as it gets but it works much credit goes to the <UNK> performances by both leads it's a perfect role for cuba gooding jr who's wonderfully restrained here we have come to expect a lot from de niro and he doesn't disappoint he creates a darkly funny portrait director george <UNK> jr set out to make an old style flick and comes up with a winner
<START> i saw paris je t'aime because a friend really wanted to see it so i went along with him going in i was indifferent about the film but leaving the theater i really <UNK> wasting 2 hours of my life sitting through this tepid production the stories are almost completely forgettable except for the fact that most of them were awful what do gena rowlands and ben <UNK> have to do with paris the endless parade of american actors most definitely gave this french film a remarkably non french feel the clichés about paris were endless yes most of them were playing with clichés about paris but by spending so much time making fun of french clichés they directly and <UNK> promoted them once more yes paris is the city of love we get it br br the worst segments were the one directed by wes craven oscar <UNK> the one with nick nolte the <UNK> one the worst the hair products one the one with juliette <UNK> willem dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of paris the vampire one when i think of paris i think of <UNK> wood the one with natalie portman which really looked like a <UNK> commercial and it was stupid the blind young man should know portman was just playing a part when she called him on and on it went it felt endless br br i didn't like the <UNK> bros one as well it really plays with those <UNK> clichés but i didn't find it funny just annoying the gus van <UNK> one was interesting but it was so slight and the punchline was obvious that it barely <UNK> br br there were only two successful segments and they were the one about the immigrant <UNK> who leaves her baby at a <UNK> only to <UNK> a baby for a rich woman nice irony there and the segment about the african who is stabbed it's the best segment in the whole film but this segment has nothing to do with paris the story could have taken place in any city around the world br br the last segment the one with the <UNK> middle aged woman was sorta interesting too but the underlying tone was bad they wanted to celebrate her limited grasp of french but the segment came off as being condescending br br the whole project felt forced and uninspired almost like the french government <UNK> this film to promote <UNK> all in all with only about 10 to 15 minutes of interesting stuff paris je t'aime was an awful cinematic experience
<START> any film with a title as ridiculous as the <UNK> should automatically attract the attention of any bad movie lover but the plot is far different than what one may expect after viewing the dvd cover the <UNK> is by no means a good movie it falls into the category of films that seem to have been and probably were filmed on a home video camera the acting is awful i haven't heard and seen such wooden acting since <UNK> 2 there are plenty of scenes with nudity and sex but they are clearly jumped into too fast the characters are morons and entirely forgettable the ending which i will not spoil can be easily anticipated after watching the very first scene due to the cheesy nature of the film nothing aside from the awful production values is truly scary awful attempts at realistic gore a driving scene where the car is clearly <UNK> etc recommended for bad movie <UNK> only
<START> i have a piece of advice for the people who made this movie too if you're gonna make a movie like this be sure you got the f x to back it up also don't get a bunch of z list actors to play in it another thing just about all of us have seen jurassic park so don't blatantly copy it all in all this movie sucked f x sucked acting sucked story unoriginal let's talk about the acting for just a second the carradine guy who's career <UNK> in 1984 when he did revenge of the <UNK> which was actually a great comedy he's not exactly z list he can act he just should have said no to this s t bag he should have did what mark <UNK> did after return of the jedi and go quietly into the night he made his mark as a nerd and that should have been that i understand he has bills to pay but that hardly excuses this s t bag have i called this movie that yet o k i just wanted to be sure if i sound a little hostile i apologize i just wasted <UNK> of my life i could have spent doing something <UNK> like watching paint <UNK> and i feel cheated i'll close on that note thank you for your time
<START> this is a well worn story about a man who marries to escape the <UNK> <UNK> then sets about <UNK> his reluctant bride it manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time we never find out for example why a woman who won the respect of an indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her <UNK> husband or why the members of her team are so eager to get a real man in the <UNK> when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own this only made sense in fifties hollywood br br there's a really stupid scene where she <UNK> him and he actually catches the whip the second time then <UNK> her off her horse never mind that the first time probably would have lost him an eye which would make it pretty hard to grab that whip then he <UNK> in a fight against her indian bodyguard where he spends the first two thirds of it getting beaten to a pulp that's some second wind later he successfully <UNK> with some <UNK> indians as they all are in these flicks after they reject her now she's his <UNK> never mind that he has zero <UNK> skills and she's been <UNK> with them for years and the way he keeps <UNK> her attempts to seduce him just to keep her keen and keep her from getting a hold on him yeah right like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trail br br finally neither of the leads is convincing in their roles madison is just a jerk who gets <UNK> lucky <UNK> <UNK> her hair and <UNK> a lot but is totally unconvincing as a fiery <UNK> the only reason you'd root for her is because you want to see madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the film's end the way that madison <UNK> <UNK> is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will <UNK> the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blow up dolls even if you do see them as dolls the total lack of suspense will bore you br br total waste of time even the <UNK> kinda dull give this one a big miss
<START> <UNK> <UNK> made some entertaining though illogical films like <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> but he made some <UNK> like <UNK> and <UNK> and then <UNK> br br this movie is one of the worst movies ever made by him the <UNK> became famous <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but the film is so bad you cringe br br the british are made <UNK> and the film looks so weird the scene in the british hotel is damn stupid br br the film has many <UNK> like amrita <UNK> amitabh and then the entire scene plus towards the climax the film becomes even worse there are more gems like the horse statue getting life the masks of amitabh haha and more br br direction by <UNK> <UNK> is bad music is okay br br amitabh does his part with style nothing different from <UNK> <UNK> type roles amrita <UNK> is okay <UNK> <UNK> is okay <UNK> <UNK> is as usual <UNK> roy is again her usual self <UNK> <UNK> is also as usual
<START> the opening scenes move as <UNK> as frozen <UNK> the attempt at dramatic dialogue only makes me wish i had better control of the fast forward control vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent or <UNK> disgusting creatures this vampire tries to seduce his prey by imitating a lost puppy i usually <UNK> a body count so there was a cat which doesn't count a bum a girl who fell out of the sky with a sword in her whatever that was about and then the plot <UNK> artists are respected for using <UNK> to create the sound of a broken arm but using the sound of biting into an apple for a vampire biting a victim is just plain silly i liked <UNK> but this movie just <UNK> so bad that we turned it off and it was so forgettable we rented it a year later only to turn it off again
<START> bernard <UNK> passed away last year and was a very <UNK> journalist cinema was one of his biggest passions he penned a vast worldwide <UNK> of films and so he was bound to <UNK> a camera at least one time in his life but the films he left garnered <UNK> reviews <UNK> <UNK> part 1996 in spite of <UNK> <UNK> sensational performance was very <UNK> in the depiction of the characters <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> 2000 was a slick affair even if bernard <UNK> delivered a perverse performance <UNK> <UNK> grave 2003 was another let down and un <UNK> <UNK> sans <UNK> is as <UNK> as its predecessors its comic potential is exploited in a flimsy way br br and however the starting idea let predict a <UNK> spiritual comedy a couple held by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who invited their friends is in full moving in a <UNK> mansion to play with their guests they pretend to part company with each other and things don't go as planned because the <UNK> of their <UNK> doesn't surprise them the two lovers start to <UNK> about the <UNK> of their couple br br in spite of lush scenery and the promising material he had at his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> directing can't manage to give life to this game with unexpected consequences the plot follows a well worn pattern with characters who have specific well known functions and masks that are <UNK> about who they really are verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat a bad editing fades a little more the film with this bad habit from <UNK> to abruptly cut many sequences even the actors' sincere <UNK> in the venture is <UNK> they seem to be bored and to <UNK> their <UNK> than to live them especially <UNK> <UNK> the audience is soon caught in a deep <UNK> br br it's <UNK> to say it bernard <UNK> films never lived up to his intentions as un <UNK> <UNK> sans <UNK> bears witness
<START> i never really watched this program before although it came highly recommended by members of my family <UNK> enough my girlfriend lives in <UNK> the filming location and she pointed out a few <UNK> when i first visited br br this got my interest going so i bought the 1st series on video and sat down to watch besides <UNK> some of the locations i found myself not in the least bit surprised once again the bbc were responsible for producing another example of the finest comedy in the world <UNK> easily ranks up there with red dwarf <UNK> towers and monty python as probably the best br br suffice to say i am hooked on the program now the characters are superb and show unusual depth while <UNK> a <UNK> realistic edge the look and feel of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes bleak feeling of the north no <UNK> to <UNK> which i have found a very <UNK> and warm place br br i only hope that it continues its originality throughout its run which based upon the 2nd series which <UNK> its <UNK> in the uk last night it certainly is br br well done the bbc
<START> when the young kevin gets the boat of his dead uncle as a gift he invites five friends of him to a trip to <UNK> island for the weekend while in the journey they drink booze have sex and play games with each one of them telling his or her greatest fear later kevin <UNK> in the open sea the engine stops and they are haunted and murdered by their greatest <UNK> fear br br yesterday my wife son daughter and three other friends joined to watch haunted boat on dvd with less than 30 minutes running time the group gave up watching this messy and boring amateurish piece of crap and we decided to see another film later i decided to watch the rest of this flick to see how bad it could be and it would have been better off going to bed to sleep the confused story has an awful cinematography and camera work with a cast that is probably studying to be actors and actresses and in the end this film seems to be a bad project of cinema school the terrible and pretentious screenplay shows a ridiculous twist in the end actually a complete mess that made me not understand what the story is all about was the girl insane and traveled alone in the boat imagining the whole situation with imaginary friends if that is true are their friend again in the very end fruit of her madness my vote is one br br title brazil <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> trip to the death
<START> bell book and candle was one of the great pop culture <UNK> of the mid <UNK> century very similar to the <UNK> we see today back in the 70's more than ten years later there were still endless references to this film it made novak a huge star put a nice item on jack <UNK> resume cast new light on jimmy stewart and gave <UNK> and <UNK> new <UNK> to explore in their careers both went on to continue to play witches and other curious old bats in film and television br br along with the 40s movie i married a witch which helped to make <UNK> lake an icon bell book and candle inspired the grand film and tv fascination with all things <UNK> that began with <UNK> and has continued through practical magic worst witch and harry potter br br what i rarely see noted is that the movie is also a rather interesting alternative <UNK> movie the story takes place over the christmas holidays and despite the fact that it is <UNK> about witchcraft actually <UNK> a great deal of <UNK> spirit giving love family self sacrifice etc br br i will always watch this movie have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90's particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season it has style substance a great cast and terrific production values and like <UNK> <UNK> it casually expresses ideas that were rather radical for its time are radical even now in both movies the female character is <UNK> and powerful and so always seems ahead of the times
<START> comments contain spoilers i was barely holding on to this show as <UNK> tv when they started the annoying music under every scene when don <UNK> was <UNK> almost a shooting per case when the very <UNK> diane <UNK> was obviously pregnant but we weren't to notice and when <UNK> was a f g triple agent but now in <UNK> episode david is trapped with a paranoid nut job who is an obvious amateur with a gun in an elevator and he can't <UNK> him a trained experienced field agent who has been 1st through the door many times and is experienced in hand to hand fighting can't take out a nut job not when said nut job <UNK> looks away drops his head <UNK> his eyes not even when he looks up at the <UNK> <UNK> wire <UNK> around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds br br then the scene came that let me know that as much as i enjoy learning from the <UNK> <UNK> but very charming charles <UNK> and his sexy sidekick love interest <UNK> my friday nights will be better spent otherwise engaged don gives david the distress word that is the code for the s t is about to go down david is ready they kill the lights drop the elevator <UNK> the nut job and br br david cannot <UNK> kill beat into <UNK> the nut job the bad guy ends up with both guns david ends up shot br br i'm done hope the <UNK> are fun
<START> this is a totally delightful and unexpected film you start by following a young person who hopes to get into the <UNK> football game between <UNK> and iran if iran win they will get into the 2006 world cup in germany the problem is the young person is a girl and girls or women for that matter are not allowed into football matches to sit with men what follows is a wonderful comedy played with <UNK> skill by a small ensemble cast the film explores the absurdity of <UNK> on the freedom of women and for that matter the young soldiers who have to <UNK> them there are some excellent set pieces not least when one of the girls must go to the toilet and of course the stadium has no <UNK> for women the camera work is of the <UNK> and in some ways this story could have been told as a stage play yet it is the small scale that gives the film its bite great cinema no probably not great entertainment for sure
<START> first of all sorry for giving even a rating of 1 to this movie nothing less than this available the film fails in every department be it screenplay direction characterization or acting br br 1 to start with the name of the movie is really c class though the movie itself match up to the name 2 amitabh bachchan tries his best to live up to the character but the weak script coupled with pathetic direction ends up making him a humorous character 3 in sholay <UNK> <UNK> has reward of 50 000 on him which was convincing here in <UNK> the figure was 100 <UNK> for <UNK> amitabh bachchan but poor man was beaten by our so called hero's and had only few men <UNK> to <UNK> with all automatic guns making a sholay like movie in <UNK> type setup in modern time doesn't look convincing 4 as for <UNK> <UNK> somebody needs to tell her that she doesn't know acting why is ram <UNK> <UNK> casting her again and again 5 <UNK> was good but there is hardly anything for him to do 6 <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who are great actors are wasted in the movie 7 <UNK> role played by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> in sholay is replaced cheaply in this movie by some <UNK> mummy <UNK> please grow up and understand that there needs to be some intellect in your movie enough of stupid characters in your movie like <UNK> and <UNK> 8 should not say anything about modern <UNK> and <UNK> pathetic to the greatest extent br br to <UNK> i was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of original classic please don't waste money and time on this movie i think watching <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which i thought was the worst movie possible would be a better idea than to see this horrible package of stupid characters bad songs and miserable direction br br thanks <UNK>
<START> very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves i can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write this film simply <UNK> of the real world the wife who is suddenly the sole <UNK> the live in relatives and their <UNK> the troubled child who gets knocked up and then typically drops out of school a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it 2 thumbs up
<START> you know all those letters to father christmas and jesus that are sent every year well it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half forgotten corner of the post office to <UNK> unless some bright spark figures out a way of <UNK> them as bizarre settings go it's a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is dead letter office having said that this is obviously an australian film as opposed to a british one if it was royal mail most letters get this sort of treatment anyway i haven't been in this flat for two years and we're still getting letters for a mr wang some female priest of the church of latter day i've never heard of you and various <UNK> for industrial equipment addressed to a <UNK> company br br dead letter office the name given to the place where <UNK> mail ends up follows the story of alice miranda otto who grows up in a seriously divided home writing to her absent father she only learns in <UNK> that her letters haven't been delivered for one reason or another so <UNK> she gets a job at the d l o and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding <UNK> immigrant frank lopez george del <UNK> slowly she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self contained world of the dead letters office to its knees br br nothing against this film but i was reminded of the god awful heather graham film committed while watching this however this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again that ain't difficult for a start this film is much more logical true the <UNK> are somewhat blatant and the <UNK> symbolism quickly becomes a <UNK> but at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel it is also well acted both otto and del <UNK> are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they'll never find while other characters are <UNK> at best part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed the other part is that when you consider <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> policy i e if you don't speak english rack off such a story is unlikely to take place in reality the other characters sadly also help to <UNK> the realism by proving to be little more than odd ball stereotypes br br despite that dead letter office is certainly something a little different it might not be to everyone's taste but i liked it yes it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes it's nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy duty swearing and nudity no chance of that in an australian film there ain't any major laughs there's no bullet time and the characters are usually one dimensional but it's the story that counts here and while it's not earth shattering in its <UNK> it's a pleasant enough way of passing the time it's the movie equivalent of a <UNK> crow cd nice to listen to now and again but you wouldn't really miss it if it wasn't there
<START> i first saw this movie when it was released in the u s in 1984 i have seen it many many times since what strikes me about the film is the <UNK> of the art of the rehearsal into the lives of the characters and <UNK> versa throughout the movie the two <UNK> and at times one is never too sure if one is watching the lives of the characters or a scene from a rehearsal this continues up to the climax of the film all these years later my friends and i still love to debate whether or not carmen is really stabbed at the end from the reactions of the other characters to the stylized murder it is open to debate the passion of the dance the quality of the acting the love of art and the brilliance of the performances all combine to create a superb movie that once again <UNK> and twists the line between life and art
<START> it's a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their <UNK> kids i felt like instead of a movie ticket i should have been given a <UNK> <UNK> br br based upon thomas <UNK> respected book how to eat fried worms starts like any children's story moving to a new town the new kid fifth <UNK> billy <UNK> was once popular but has to start <UNK> making friends is never easy especially when the only <UNK> is <UNK> adam or <UNK> who at 4 1 2 feet is a giant br br further <UNK> things is joe the bully his <UNK> face and <UNK> shirts are <UNK> he <UNK> kids with the death ring a <UNK> ring that is <UNK> to kill you if you're <UNK> with it but not immediately no the death ring <UNK> a poison that kills you in the eight grade br br joe and his <UNK> of evil welcome billy by <UNK> a handful of slimy worms into his <UNK> once discovered billy plays it cool swearing that he eats worms all the time then he throws them at <UNK> face <UNK> to win them over billy reluctantly <UNK> that he can eat 10 worms fried boiled <UNK> in hot <UNK> <UNK> and spread on a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> each meal is dubbed an exotic name like the <UNK> <UNK> delight in which the kids finally live out their dream of <UNK> a living <UNK> br br if you've ever met me you'll know that i have an <UNK> <UNK> laugh i felt like a creep <UNK> at a <UNK> whining that his <UNK> dick hurts but fried worms is wonderfully disgusting like a g rated <UNK> brothers film it is both <UNK> and delightful br br writer director bob <UNK> is also a <UNK> <UNK> to raise the stakes the worms must be consumed by 7 <UNK> in addition billy holds a dark secret he has an ultra sensitive stomach br br <UNK> also has a keen sense of perspective with such accuracy he draws on children's <UNK> and tendency to <UNK> mundane <UNK> br br if you were to <UNK> this movie the way kids do their <UNK> you will see that it is essentially about war freedom fighter and freedom <UNK> use <UNK> boys as <UNK> in <UNK> wars only to learn a valuable lesson in <UNK> international leaders can learn a thing or two about global <UNK> from fried worms br br at the end of the film i was <UNK> when two <UNK> mothers behind me looked at each other with <UNK> and agreed that was a great movie great now i won't have to register myself in any <UNK> <UNK>
<START> one of the best movies out there yeah maybe the cinematography wasn't the greatest but an excellent plot and concept great for the time and brilliant and creative ideas something different from the usual movies and great fun one of my favorites and would recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies post world war 3 and fighting in gigantic robots the actors gave a great performance and made it all worth while the sets are not amazing but simple and worked for the overall look of the film this movie is very hard to find on dvd but also on vhs check it out cause i have loved it since it came out not a mainstream flick and not like anything you've ever seen take a look and think like a child it's a great view and very fun
<START> but the opposite sorry bud i completely understand how you can be dragged into a film because you relate to the subject and you have this film is terrible the main character would give any charlie brown <UNK> a run for his money he just constantly <UNK> which is always a laugh most scenes just feel awkward with characters more often than not <UNK> across to another with a look of its your line now then i will react best british comedy please buddy have a strong word with your bad bad self at the end of the day the sun goes down and this film is awful i mean well done to the people involved they have made a film and maybe <UNK> <UNK> may be into it but people that still live here on earth with an actual sense of humour will struggle with this more than smiling at the christmas present they're <UNK> bought them was that overly harsh i do <UNK>

<START> <UNK> is entertaining in that you'll laugh a lot and cringe and probably say oh sh t and get your face away from the <UNK> hole you dumb s or things along those lines but i don't know if its really worth seeing i was very annoyed throughout the entirety with the horrible military characters who don't seem to know the first thing about combat br br yes there was more violence gore and a higher body count than the first one but i am still am <UNK> whether that <UNK> out my feeling throughout the whole movie about how ridiculous it is and not a good <UNK> like dead alive or feast my time would have been better spent watching <UNK> remake for the <UNK> time br br so go for some laughs or go for some gore but don't go hoping to come out of it satisfied

<START> vampires vs zombies starts with the breaking news that the <UNK> disease that is <UNK> across america leaves the <UNK> with homicidal <UNK> <UNK> travis fontaine c s <UNK> his teenage daughter jenna <UNK> <UNK> listen to the radio as they drive along the isolated backwoods roads to try escape the disease when travis runs over a guy who i assume is meant to be a zombie slightly further down the road he stops to help julia <UNK> stevens her teenage daughter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who are waving at the side of the road at this point there is also a third teenage girl named <UNK> <UNK> crystal sitting in the back of <UNK> car bound <UNK> to me this situation would seem strange but travis like the <UNK> he is takes it all in his <UNK> agrees to <UNK> <UNK> off <UNK> hands well i don't know actually so with a complete stranger travis drives off leaving julia <UNK> <UNK> seems like a nice girl but she turns out to be a vampire she likes to bite people turn them into vampires oh she's partial to a bit of <UNK> too travis <UNK> jenna continue to travel while some guy who calls himself the general peter <UNK> who appears to be some sort of vampire killer probably has something to do with it all but the film is such a mess it doesn't really matter i really don't know how to carry on this plot outline as my head hurts just thinking about it br br co edited co executive produced written directed by the <UNK> <UNK> vince <UNK> vampires vs zombies is one of the worst horror films ever therefore one of the worst films ever period the script by <UNK> was apparently based on a classic story entitled <UNK> by sheridan le <UNK> he should sue is an absolute mess the holes in the plot logic are so big you could drive a tank through them what is the disease that turns people into zombies why is <UNK> a vampire who is julia to her who the hell is the general what does he want where are travis jenna going how can travis run a man over yet not have the slightest bit of human emotion over it what's with the mental ward at the end there are also some confusing unnecessary dream sequences just to annoy the viewer even more there are just so many things wrong with this film the narrative doesn't make a blind bit of sense the concept is terrible never really explained properly plus it's incredibly boring i have not one positive thing to say about vampire vs zombies not one forget about any vampires fighting zombies because it just doesn't happen tell me again why is this film called vampires vs zombies br br director <UNK> has served up one of the most incompetent <UNK> badly made poorly thought out excruciatingly painful viewing experiences ever made vampires vs zombies really has no redeeming qualities at all there is not one single aspect that i can praise the gore is really fake looking there are some blood <UNK> which look like red water some really cheap <UNK> effects a half decent climax where the zombies feast on <UNK> <UNK> intestines this fairly gory scene is probably the best part of the whole wretched film but it only lasts for a couple of minutes in no way makes up for the other turgid 85 br br the budget on vampires vs zombies must have been small in fact did it even have a budget because most of it is set on a road in a couple of cars this is one of the most badly made horror films it's been my misfortune to watch the entire thing just sucks the acting is predictably awful i mean awful br br there isn't much else left to say vampires vs zombies is easily one of the worst films ever made the v next to the title on the <UNK> main page for vampires vs <UNK> <UNK> that it went straight to video well that's far too good for this pile of crap as it deserves to go straight on the nearest fire

<START> revolt of the zombies is bad there is nothing remotely entertaining about the movie it is dull lifeless poorly acted and poorly scripted i've often complained that the original dracula is a little slow for my taste well this movie makes dracula look like a roller coaster ride the <UNK> minute running time seemed like <UNK> minutes br br the story an expedition is sent to cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through <UNK> one man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him once this happens he releases the zombies under his control to horrific consequences that's it that's the whole story br br for most of the movie i was trying to figure out where i had seen the male lead he looked so familiar i had plenty of time to think this over nothing was happening in the movie just before the zombies <UNK> it hit me it was dean jagger i had seen him recently as the general in white christmas this is how i entertained myself throughout most of the movie br br i'm just glad i didn't buy the dvd for this movie king of the zombies is on the other side and it's a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie for what it's worth i'll give it a 2 10 i won't go to 1 10 because believe it or not i've seen worse
<START> i was very surprised how bad this movie was nice cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only take the movie so far i was hoping for a <UNK> of hero but this is much much worse br br this movie is why kung fu movies got a bad reputation in the first place no believable characters even within the cartoonish world of kung fu movies these characters are ridiculous virtually no plot and ridiculous story twists br br this movie is so boring and so frustrating because it reminds you of trying to play a make believe game with a child every time you think your silly battle makes some sense they <UNK> another ridiculous twist that makes no sense ah ha you only think you've got me with your super powers and 10 000 ray guns but i ate my <UNK> laced with <UNK> and <UNK> so your ray guns don't work and i'm <UNK> to your super powers tap tap no trade backs <UNK> plus one children can continue with this <UNK> because they don't really care whether anyone is listening because they are having a fun time however for the viewer especially the adult viewer this long movie is worse than a bout with bad gas br br spoilers ahead note to kung fu movie makers a if you have a knife in your back it hurts unless you are on <UNK> in which case your kung fu is not strong b if you repeatedly fall on your back which has a knife in it it will hurt more and do more damage unless it is a fake prop c when you get stabbed in the heart with a knife you die especially in ancient china where there isn't a <UNK> <UNK> around the corner d kung fu fights don't last for hours while 3 feet of snow falls and e sometimes it is worth while explaining your characters and their motivations br br in any event go watch hero again because at least within its own little world it is <UNK>
<START> dutch <UNK> aka arthur <UNK> was a real person and his rather nasty life is fairly well documented this movie which <UNK> to depict his life should have used a fictional character because the <UNK> events are too strong a departure from the facts and the <UNK> not only that it ignores some interesting details which other versions have included such as the public relations fiasco in <UNK> n y and his religious <UNK> it is true that he was executed by <UNK> <UNK> et al but that's as far as it goes the exploding plate scene which represents <UNK> carrying out the execution of bo <UNK> in his own home <UNK> by his own mother is <UNK> also there is the scene in which dutch approaches his own mother to pay protection to legs diamond it just doesn't work the character of mrs <UNK> doesn't work either this movie does not need a <UNK> jewish mother for comic relief the lame representation of legs diamond was humorous enough i'm sure the man is turning in his grave and by the way dutch did in fact personally kill people but he was not rambo or <UNK> the scene in which he <UNK> out the <UNK> is absurd i don't know maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and i just didn't get it
<START> a hilarious and insightful perspective of the dating world is portrayed in this off beat comedy by first time writer director peter m cohen the story unfolds as the four male protagonists meet weekly at the local diner to <UNK> about their dating <UNK> we meet brad a good looking wall street playboy with a quick wit and sharp tongue <UNK> a cynical sensitive writer jonathan a sexually <UNK> nice guy with an <UNK> for hand <UNK> and masturbation and eric the married guy who <UNK> his weekly encounters with his single friends in hope for some enlightenment to his boring and banal married existence the trials and <UNK> of the men's single lives in new york are <UNK> expressed <UNK> that of sex in the city and <UNK> new comedy the mind of married man and bring an <UNK> light to <UNK> the story takes a twist as the three <UNK> meet <UNK> <UNK> played by amanda <UNK> and all fall for her she <UNK> them each with her uncanny ability to <UNK> to the <UNK> they exhibit when they come to realize they have all met and fallen in love with the same woman they chose her over their friendship whipped is a realistic portrayal of the dating world one that the <UNK> failed to recognize in plain language they missed the point the <UNK> here are caricatures of real people the <UNK> are hysterical mixing satire and <UNK> and are not to be taken as seriously as the <UNK> <UNK> suggests see this movie you'll laugh from start to finish
<START> slaughter high is perhaps the most underrated slasher flick of the 1980s it is one of the few films in the genre that is enthralling throughout that being said it also relies heavily on the standard slasher formula a group of young men and women get killed one by one <UNK> until the final showdown br br the reason why slaughter high stands above most movies in its genre is that it goes more over the top marty the killer has good reason to hold a grudge against his former classmates they <UNK> him as he stood naked in a girl's locker room shower <UNK> at his <UNK> with a <UNK> and to top it off <UNK> his science lab experiment so it could <UNK> him br br so the victims in this movie are about as unlikeable as you get when they reunite years later at a high school reunion put on by marty himself you realize they haven't <UNK> all that much they're a bunch of <UNK> br br it is mind <UNK> why they would not wonder why they were the only ones to show up to the reunion which by the way is held at a school that has since fell into <UNK> and who would think it's a good idea to drink beer and <UNK> found in the abandoned building in a room that happens to have their old <UNK> as well as <UNK> on display there are many leaps of faith the viewer needs to take to enjoy this film the ending makes little or no sense and the screenwriters have a strange understanding of how april <UNK> day works the movie claims that pranks are no longer allowed after <UNK> br br in all the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre despite all of its flaws it is hard to understand why it hasn't yet found its way to dvd when so many other run of the mill slasher flicks are <UNK> with special <UNK>
<START> so i thought i'd throw in a few words about william <UNK> not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in his <UNK> <UNK> it's obvious he <UNK> up for this role and he looks pretty darn good in them or less there's an extended sequence in a cave where he has to strip down to his <UNK> there's a nice bit where he has to chase after miss <UNK> in the buff with only his hands <UNK> over his <UNK> william <UNK> is naturally a little on the skinny side but he has a nice generous handful of a <UNK> also there's a moment when he's getting out of bed that if you pause the action at just the right moment you can see the whole <UNK> if you're inclined to do so and come on half of the people who choose to watch a movie about navy men on a road trip are i'd just like thank dennis hopper for his equal opportunity gratuitous nudity can william <UNK> act heck if i know
<START> i first read the book when i was a young teenager then saw the film late one night about a year ago i checked it out on imdb and discovered no copies available i then hit the web and found a site that offers war films <UNK> glad that i did ordered a copy and sat back and was able to confirm why i wanted to see it again br br in my opinion to really enjoy the film i suggest you read get a copy of the book and then watch the film the book is no longer in print but i did track a copy down via e bay the author alan white was a <UNK> <UNK> during the 2nd world war taking part in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and this was his first book it is written by someone who knows and this fact i believe gives the book and film authenticity i have not given the film a ten only because of the nature of the ending of the film not as good as the book there are a couple of plot lines that <UNK> from the book also which is strange as the book is not about the large scale nature of war but about the individual in war the film illustrates this exceptionally well i have the copy of the book to let my son read and then the film to let him watch in that order br br if you can track it down the book and the film then it is definitely worth it and i only wish that it was more readily available for more to read and see one of my all best war films ever
<START> i first saw breaking glass in 1980 and thought that it would be one of the movie classics this film is a great look into the music industry with a great cast of performers this is one film that should be in the collection of everyone and any one that wants to get into the music industry i can't wait for it to be available on dvd
<START> i'm a big mark for the music of neil young and with that and the glowing praise the film received in many <UNK> indie press circles hit the first showing of <UNK> i could find my excitement was short lived as this turgid storyline and weak lyrical momentum left most <UNK> either asleep or disappointed br br neil says the film started as a soundtrack and the characters came to life so much that they just filmed the soundtrack not the best way to craft a story no character really has an arc and when significant events do happen the viewer doesn't cared because film technique annoyance levels are so high by that point the film is all song and to that end the characters on end mouth the lyrics as they're sung the technique works for the first <UNK> it is done and is grating on the nerves after that it doesn't feel real or fake it just feels <UNK> br br terrible acting with characters finding one mood and playing all of it poor lighting at times the only kudos i can give the film are in regard to several scenes shot as <UNK> but the technique is so used in cinema today that this film did little to further it an alright soundtrack but nothing i'm quick to buy a bad film
<START> working with one of the best shakespeare sources this film manages to be <UNK> to it's source whilst still appealing to a wider audience br br branagh steals the film from under <UNK> nose and there's a talented cast on good form
<START> i find this movie the best movie i have ever seen because it reflects the inner strength of a young girl during the second world war the movie is impressive not least because it actually happened it reminds me of the story of anne frank br br
<START> what's with the murky video in the beginning and <UNK> throughout the movie it's like someone put <UNK> water on the camera lens br br the violence and nudity might turn some people off but that along with the mostly bad acting is what makes a good cult movie i suppose br br my favorite line is delivered by <UNK> the vampire alas your breed is dumb okay no one should ever say alas in a movie line unless they're english and living in the 18th century br br the acting by the van <UNK> character and bad girl <UNK> isn't bad i also liked master little played by ron little wicked martial arts don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy it
<START> when i first heard about this series on <UNK> i have to say that out of all the shows that i have seen this one tops it all off i had to see this show and that is what i really did when i got the first volume of this show it was the best i really liked the animation and all the fight scenes were awesome i have to say that my favorite characters in the show were <UNK> and archer and of course i also like <UNK> and of course all the episodes on the volumes were interesting and very cool another thing i have to say about the series is michael <UNK> famous for transformers and others playing the voice of <UNK> he does have a cool character and i even watched the entire series all over again before watching the final volume so if you to see something good then see this show it's the best
<START> much has been written about purple rain the apparent <UNK> essential musician bio movie however i'm here to tell you that the movie does not deserve it's high praise br br first of all let's get one thing straight prince is a great musician and music is the one area where purple rain excels even the score is <UNK> and if this was shot purely as a concert film it would be a great experience unfortunately it's not and as such the movie has some problems br br first of all is the horrendous acting writing <UNK> character the kid is supposed to come off as some type of mysterious loner of few words unfortunately this just comes off as corny and <UNK> a good loner character should at least have some <UNK> moments unfortunately <UNK> character rarely has over a few words of dialog in the film and it's hard to believe that he'd get the girl this way everything just seems a little off here which is a shame because you can tell this is a character that's terribly conflicted and lives a very complicated live but we aren't ever allowed to get inside of it br br a surprising aspect of this film is just how much of this takes place in concert prince and <UNK> lives seemingly take a back seat to the performances here which i guess makes sense from a business perspective but it's <UNK> to have a 2 hour movie where seemingly half of it takes place on stage especially when the character's back stories get pushed aside for it br br so to sum it up this isn't a very good movie
<START> sergio martino is a great director who has contributed a lot to italian genre cinema and as far as i am considered his <UNK> from the 1970s are the <UNK> highlights in his impressive <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> aka the case of the <UNK> tale of 1971 is one of these impressive films martino has contributed to italian <UNK> most original sub genre and another proof that the man is a master of atmosphere style and suspense my personal favorite of the martino films i've seen so far is still the insanely brilliant your vice is a locked room and only i have the key of 1972 followed by <UNK> 1973 and the strange vice of mrs <UNK> 1971 all of which i personally like even more than this one that's purely a matter of personal taste however as la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is an equally excellent film that is essential for every fan of italian horror cinema and suspense in general br br the film which delivers <UNK> suspense from the very beginning has a complex and gripping plot that begins with the mysterious demise of a millionaire who has died in a plane crash insurance investigator peter lynch george hilton is assigned to <UNK> the circumstances the insurance company which is due to pay a large sum to the deceased man's wife soon after lynch begins to investigate a person is brutally killed which is just the beginning of a series of murders br br the case of the <UNK> tail excellently delivers all the elements a great giallo needs the film is stunningly suspenseful from the beginning the score by bruno <UNK> is brilliant the plot is wonderfully convoluted and the killer's identity remains a mystery until the end regular giallo leading man george hilton once again delivers an excellent performance in the lead sexy anita <UNK> is absolutely ravishing in the female lead the includes the great <UNK> <UNK> one of the most brilliant <UNK> of italian genre cinema of the 60s and 70s and <UNK> de <UNK> another great actor who should be familiar to any lover of italian cinema <UNK> where most of the film takes place is actually a great setting for a giallo the atmosphere is constantly gripping and the photography great and bruno <UNK> ingenious score makes the suspense even more intense long story short la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is another excellent giallo from sergio martino and an absolute must see for any lover of the sub genre stylish suspenseful and great in all regards
<START> yes keaton looks like he really did enjoy making this film with a skip in his step in his <UNK> pin <UNK> suits he'll remind you of jimmy cagney johnny keaton is the young hood who only does it to pay for his mother's high <UNK> medical bills to send his younger brother <UNK> dunne to law school no one even knows johnny kelly is johnny dangerously until later on in the film joe <UNK> is <UNK> doesn't like johnny one bit i don't like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has a nice singing dancing routine while johnny <UNK> in it i love the part when they're in the ever changing <UNK> car the cop who's calling all cars is the <UNK> from <UNK> island see this one for 1930's gangster laughs the gags in this film are hilarious but you have to catch them or you'll miss them look in the background of every scene
<START> this is a very funny ealing comedy about a community in central london who through an unusual set of circumstances discover they are not english but are an <UNK> of the french <UNK> of <UNK> br br the film features comic actor stanley <UNK> best known as alfred <UNK> in my fair lady as well as a host of other classic comic actors of the period br br the story was apparently based on a news item at the time when the canadian government officially gave a hotel room to a visiting european member of <UNK> the idea actually reminded me of the real life case of the <UNK> river <UNK> in western australia where a <UNK> <UNK> from the australian government due to a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it was never acknowledged by the western australian or australian <UNK> br br this is a great script that plays with a lot of political and economic issues rather like the tv show yes minister as well as being a great little eccentric character piece as well
<START> the <UNK> was a very interesting and entertaining film while f murray abraham was in it spoilers about halfway through f murray gets <UNK> because the <UNK> is some kind of demon like creature who enjoys living <UNK> he takes <UNK> and losers and <UNK> them further while giving them all they want in terms of success he <UNK> from their enjoyment of the seven deadly sins however part of it is that he needs to get people who may be flawed but not completely evil otherwise he cannot <UNK> their natural goodness that's what the little guy said in his barry white voice which i found both charming and amusing mostly amusing like imagine barry white if he were a little dwarf and he was telling <UNK> <UNK> dee plane dee plane <UNK> here <UNK> come dee plane all through the movie dee dwarf actually a <UNK> <UNK> talks to <UNK> <UNK> in the barry white voice saying things like it's ok to be bad you know you want it now you've committed murder you're really moving up in the world and other remarks that sound like commercials for being evil stores or something it really is hilarious in a sick way br br anyhow <UNK> <UNK> is no f murray abraham and the movie tanks as soon as murray gets the axe or <UNK> f murray brings a certain happy <UNK> to his role in this film he is a good actor <UNK> <UNK> on the other hand has a permanent happy <UNK> on his face and he looks like maybe his <UNK> english <UNK> class had never hit the <UNK> characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about the ending is really creepy and yet almost comical if this movie were a parody the ending was perfect if it was not a parody then it was creepy but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a gross out that the movie itself could not deliver the people who made this movie lost whatever it was that they wanted to do with it somewhere before the ending it just ends like they just realized that they had run out of money and had to film a <UNK> ending
<START> in what must be one of the most blood <UNK> movies ever a <UNK> is murdering people in new york and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect one can see how brian <UNK> takes some influence from hitchcock with camera angles and stuff michael caine plays a most thought provoking character while angie dickinson is basically a bored rich woman with a bad <UNK> keith gordon who later starred in christine is probably the most interesting character in the movie but you can't really understand this movie without seeing it and after seeing it you may never know just whom you can trust also starring nancy allen and dennis <UNK>
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br long time <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gets himself <UNK> to a <UNK> prison than the re opened <UNK> he claims it's to be closer to his lady but his real motives are a bit more <UNK> there he crosses paths with burke bill goldberg a <UNK> prisoner who can take care of himself <UNK> despite being less muscular is just as <UNK> and is pretty much the same but there is a gang war <UNK> between the black and hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile <UNK> of the prison when the <UNK> gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at burke but the sh t really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the <UNK> cortez robert <UNK> takes <UNK> girlfriend and <UNK> daughter hostage br br steven seagal doesn't do sequels reportedly very opposed to the idea of under siege 2 and only <UNK> to do it on the condition the film company he was with at the time let direct his own movie so despite this being a dvd sequel the lead role this time round goes to bill <UNK> steve doesn't even appear in some of the stock footage from the first film that appears towards the end but there's a reason he hasn't done much work since universal soldier 2 and that's because he's not much of an actor and not much of an action star either managing a character that begins as very dark and brooding but <UNK> turns into a standard action hero <UNK> <UNK> off dull one liners support wise veterans from the first film <UNK> and tony <UNK> have merely jumped at the chance of extra work br br this is a film that's tried to copy the style of the original quite well with the dim lighting dark shadows and rap music playing over a lot of it it does this quite well unfortunately it can't <UNK> with an <UNK> hero an equally cardboard villain and an <UNK> story that the makers do very much seem to have made up as they went along
<START> oh my i decided to go out to the cinemas with some friends wanting to watch one of those mild feel good christmas movies and i walk out disgusted the movie failed full stop paul <UNK> who i consider as a good actor played his character and roll just horribly along with vince vaughn who has always been a personal favourite of mine they try and turn a christmas movie into some new style sort of bad mixed with good but it all turned out very wrong the first ten or so minutes weren't too bad but once we saw santa it was over it didn't get any better the rate stayed the same there was no character development and certainly is one of the worst christmas movies ever invented don't watch it whatever you do
<START> i was very excited when this series premiered in 2005 the premise was very simple and appealing each episode would be a one hour mini movie directed by a famous noteworthy horror director then when i finally watched them it was a bit of a letdown some good episodes emerged from that first season but all in all it was a mixed bag i attributed it to the learning <UNK> and figured that season 2 would be a whole lot better br br boy was i in for a shock at least season one had a few good stories here and there season 2 with the exception of the black cat starring the excellent jeffrey combs was a complete and total loss to me the episode sounds like may very well be the worst thing i have watched on tv in the last 10 years and most of the other episodes aren't much better i really hope that season 3 turns this around next year but i'm not holding my breath
<START> roman polanski has made many many movies that are <UNK> his fame <UNK> me nothing stands out as a high point except <UNK> i haven't seen <UNK> in the <UNK> or <UNK> any contribution he's made to film <UNK> more than twenty years ago his work is just embarrassing safe and or dull the <UNK> frantic oliver twist the <UNK> gate pirates br br <UNK> baby must have <UNK> the end of the establishment at the time it came out it's <UNK> produced and fairly high concept for a 1968 <UNK> movie never show the baby but this is just <UNK> horror <UNK> everything is arty to the point that the plot line becomes hopelessly clear very early um thanks for that finale destroying title and on a clear day you can see the twist ending coming for days it did not sustain my interest i find that whatever this movie might have been it is utterly <UNK> by the 1960's version of what <UNK> was <UNK> is such a <UNK> distracted helpless <UNK> housewife her <UNK> is <UNK> she's irritating in the extreme there's no real ideas in it nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil br br the <UNK> is barely exploited for it eerie potential
<START> <UNK> which reads <UNK> on my box was the most amazing movie i have ever seen i thought that it was one of the best movies i have ever seen so why not a 10 nothing is perfect jamie kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look at a darker side of hollywood i have forced a few others to watch the movie and they all agreed that it was an outstanding flick
<START> i only watched this because it was directed by lucio fulci and featured <UNK> <UNK> an actor i like i was certainly disappointed br br the idea that condemned prisoners would fight to the death for tv ratings has been overdone with <UNK> <UNK> run blade runner and the new film death race which will certainly suck me in because it stars jason <UNK> br br this was just a bore for the most part the kill bike action was ridiculous the training was a <UNK> fest it just never grabbed me and made me want to care about anyone including dallas star jared martin or fred <UNK> br br pick one of the others mentioned and you'll be better off
<START> br br i'm sure things didn't exactly go the same way in the real life of homer <UNK> as they did in the film adaptation of his book rocket boys but the movie october sky an <UNK> of the <UNK> title is good enough to stand alone i have not read <UNK> <UNK> but i am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation the film directed by joe <UNK> and written by lewis <UNK> records the story of teenager homer <UNK> jake <UNK> beginning in october of 1957 it opens with the sound of a radio broadcast bringing news of the russian satellite <UNK> the first artificial satellite in <UNK> we see a images of a blue gray town and its people mostly <UNK> working for the <UNK> coal company one of the <UNK> <UNK> to the news on a hand held radio as he enters the elevator <UNK> but the <UNK> is lost as he disappears into the darkness losing sight of the <UNK> sky above him a melancholy <UNK> tune fades with this image we then get a <UNK> of elvis on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting october 5 1957 <UNK> west virginia homer and his buddies roy lee cook william lee scott and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are talking about football <UNK> football <UNK> are the only way out of the town and working in the mines for these boys why are the <UNK> the only ones who get to go to college questions homer roy lee replies they're also the only ones who get the girls homer doesn't make it in football like his older brother so he is destined for the mines and to follow in his father's footsteps as mine <UNK> until he sees the <UNK> of light <UNK> across the october sky then he wants to build a rocket i want to go into space says homer after a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother's natalie <UNK> fence homer <UNK> the help of the nerdy quentin wilson chris owen quentin asks homer what do you want to know about rockets homer quickly <UNK> everything his science teacher at big creek high school miss <UNK> <UNK> laura dern greatly supports homer and the four boys work on building rockets in <UNK> basement his father however whose life is the mine does not support him john <UNK> chris cooper believes that homer shouldn't waste his time on the rockets that the coal mines are all that matter the coal from the mines is used to make steel and without steel the country would be nothing the difficult relationship between homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships i have ever seen in a film miss <UNK> introduces homer to the idea of entering the local science fair with a chance to go the <UNK> and win a college <UNK> you can't just dream your way out of <UNK> she tells homer homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets <UNK> the models with each attempt despite the many attempts the boys do not lose their determination what are the chances of us winning that science fair <UNK> asks homer in one of their more <UNK> moments a million to one answers homer that good <UNK> replies well why didn't you say so the music composed by mark <UNK> conveys sadness and hope at the same time especially sad at a point when homer <UNK> into the mine <UNK> and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rock and roll including songs by the <UNK> and buddy holly occasionally pushes the <UNK> pieces aside to create a light hearted mood that <UNK> the <UNK> lives with the lives of the <UNK> the film photographed by fred murphy also uses colors to set <UNK> and <UNK> the town of <UNK> actually filmed in <UNK> is washed with blues <UNK> and <UNK> it's as if the <UNK> from the coal sticks to everything faces clothes houses and roads when a couple in a <UNK> red <UNK> stops to ask for directions from the boys it is obvious that they are from the world outside of <UNK> and the <UNK> coal company the book on guided missile design that miss <UNK> gives homer is red the red stands out enough against the blue gray world of <UNK> to <UNK> getting out but it is still subtle the <UNK> are fleeting hints of a world that homer only dreams of jake <UNK> expresses such <UNK> hope and <UNK> as homer <UNK> that it is hard to believe he isn't the real homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film chris cooper is also extraordinarily believable as <UNK> stubborn father who doesn't recognize or just doesn't want to admit that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive homer and everyone who encourages him in his rocket building is aware that the town is dying with the community <UNK> the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket <UNK> <UNK> again i'm sure things didn't happen exactly as the movie portrayed them but what would a movie be without a bit of <UNK> october sky has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough <UNK> to keep it real
<START> this movie was a really great flick about something that affects us all i know i've personally run into this many times thank goodness will smith has jumped onto the societal issue of text <UNK> while driving people don't do it an hour and forty five minutes is not enough time for this cause personally i wanted to throw away my cell phone after the movie i was glad to see other people in the theater saw the message and dumped their phones with the empty <UNK> of popcorn i decided to <UNK> all text <UNK> on my phone and would encourage others to do the same if you care about your family make them watch this vital public service <UNK> on text <UNK> while driving or they could kill seven people thanks for showing us the way
<START> minimal script minimal character development minimal steady camera maximum stretched scenes maximum headache inducing jerky <UNK> maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing up until the time flashes on the screen of 12 <UNK> you can fast forward and miss nothing since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing to be fair the movie does have some string music that was interesting so perhaps a music video would have been the way to go with this unfortunately that was not to be and what should have been a twenty minute short is stretched beyond belief forget about trigger man i know i am trying to <UNK>
<START> i always follow the <UNK> so when my husband bought charlie's <UNK> to <UNK> dvd home i couldn't wait to watch it of course we'd seen the broadcast of the race when the actual race was on but that never gives the background and specific teams br br if you watched long way round then you won't be surprised by the language which frankly i find more amusing than offensive br br i think the only thing that annoyed me about the dvd was charlie's hair but he had it <UNK> before <UNK> so my feminine need for <UNK> was <UNK> <UNK> i could have lived without the <UNK> <UNK> lol as with <UNK> the <UNK> was every bit as interesting as the race itself i nearly cried when charlie broke his hand and <UNK> at every <UNK> he <UNK> while training and of course the death of andy <UNK> that was an appalling tragedy but then every year there's something br br russ drives me nuts although his attitude has improved a thousand times from the <UNK> <UNK> he was in <UNK> it's great to see him get along so well now with charlie br br what i learned from this odyssey was 1 never let <UNK> prepare your vehicle for anything they had months to prepare the <UNK> and still the day before the team left for <UNK> <UNK> had only done half of things that needed to be done and the vehicle was a pain throughout the whole race 2 the <UNK> <UNK> need to put a lot more work into their rider driver <UNK> plan leaving matt and presumably a large number of other riders drivers out to dry the way they did was nothing short of <UNK> <UNK> 3 charlie has an endearing enthusiasm for <UNK> and <UNK> adventure but needs to <UNK> up a lot to really perform as he'd like and finally 4 charlie and ewan are planning another of these <UNK> called the long way down in 2007 and i can't wait to get my hands on it d if you love <UNK> and or genuinely nice <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> you have to watch this i guarantee you love it it's very entertaining br br in conclusion to simon <UNK> you sir are a hero i was so impressed by the your <UNK> <UNK> manner and the fact that you actually finished just incredible considering what an <UNK> difficult race it is and to charlie matt and the rest of the team full marks for pulling it off to think that a relatively green team could have achieved so much is truly admirable you're all wonderful
<START> it is queen victoria's misfortune to be defined as an historical figure according to her relationships with men shortly after she succeeded to the throne she came under the influence of her prime minister lord melbourne to the extent that she became known as mrs melbourne after the death of her beloved husband albert she was referred to as the widow at <UNK> and years later a long friendship with her scottish <UNK> john brown earned her the <UNK> mrs brown such is the price women paid in a <UNK> society the reality is somewhat different and young victoria goes some way towards putting the record straight depicting the queen as an intelligent and independent young woman conscious of the <UNK> in her society and at her court <UNK> have always been <UNK> of <UNK> jealousy plotting and counter plotting naked ambition and sometimes outright murder as an 18 year old innocent victoria <UNK> to her <UNK> throne thus <UNK> a positive orgy of intrigue and a power struggle between prime minister lord melbourne and his rival sir robert <UNK> lord melbourne cuts a dash in the old public school man kind of way with his finely <UNK> cynicism and his well polished gems of advice hardly surprising then that the young queen finds herself in awe of him and even perhaps a little in love an awe that he <UNK> exploits drawing a fine line between attempted seduction and attempted <UNK> as he forces his <UNK> through against victoria's better judgement into the <UNK> rides prince albert on a mission from king leopold of <UNK> keen on political <UNK> between great britain and the rest of europe at first a reluctant <UNK> he soon falls in love with the english queen and <UNK> the influence of the politicians and <UNK> the young victoria is a beautifully photographed brilliantly scored and very <UNK> movie i note that it has been <UNK> in some quarters for this <UNK> as if a movie about 19th century english <UNK> should somehow have shown the <UNK> of india and her family living in <UNK> in a filthy <UNK> i don't think so i must single out the remarkable miss emily blunt whose beauty reminded me of the young princess <UNK> hers is obviously the pivotal role and she has absolutely no trouble in <UNK> the film despite strong performances from mr jim <UNK> miss miranda richardson and miss harriet walter all <UNK> more experienced the music is suitably regal and forms a cohesive part of the whole movie without being in any way <UNK> the fact that <UNK> <UNK> more under its two great queens elizabeth the first and victoria than at any other time is a matter <UNK> might like to make more of but i suspect like prime minister margaret <UNK> really powerful women make them feel uncomfortable if you can work out why there might be a <UNK> d in it
<START> i wont go and give them my 10 bucks i went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best at least my kids enjoy it and can watch it without me worrying about what they are seeing i have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather watch the original and she thinks jessica simpson is a horrible daisy in fact she thinks she looks more like a slut than daisy duke those shorts she might as well not be wearing anything at all and since when is american pie have anything to do with the dukes shame on them for putting that nasty line in there about having sex with a car that in itself should have gotten the movie a r rating the only good thing that might come out of this is a reunion movie with the originals lets all hope so the people out there that went and seen the movie will see how it should have looked
<START> i was <UNK> when i first saw this in 1983 or 1984 steven biko is gone half way through the film but the <UNK> of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten i didn't when finally in south africa in 1993 it is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty when i was in south africa and heard the audience at a dance <UNK> in <UNK> sing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> my hair stood on its ends there is a lot to learn from this story for all peoples
<START> maybe it's the dubbing or maybe it's the endless scenes of people crying <UNK> or otherwise carrying on but i found europa <UNK> to be one of the most overwrought and therefore annoying films i've ever seen the film starts out <UNK> if <UNK> as mom ingrid bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son <UNK> <UNK> whilst mummy and daddy bland alexander knox entertain their guests at a dinner party the <UNK> tries to kill himself setting in motion a life changing series of events that find bergman spending time <UNK> compassion on the poor and <UNK> <UNK> on by communist newspaper editor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she soon spends more time with the <UNK> than she does with her husband who soon locks her up in an insane asylum for her troubles bergman plays the saint role to the <UNK> <UNK> her 1948 role as joan of arc and <UNK> does a fantastic job of lighting and filming her to best effect unfortunately the script pounds its point home with ham <UNK> subtlety as <UNK> and mom take turns <UNK> <UNK> and christian <UNK> by the final tear <UNK> scene i had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters a real step down for <UNK> as he stepped away from neo realism and further <UNK> the mythical and mystical themes of 1950's flowers of st francis
<START> i first heard about white noise when i saw the tv <UNK> before then i didn't even know it existed i watched the trailer online and decided that i would go and see it now being a fan of films like the sixth sense i thought that this film would give me everything i wanted it has michael keaton in it and he rocks unfortunately the film did not deliver it tried to be another sixth sense or stir of echoes and failed miserably it has a very promising start but the middle just drags on repeating itself and ends with a completely poor twist which any monkey could have figured out unfortunately like most scary films nowadays it relies on loud noises and <UNK> to make the audience jump this film could have been so much more it's a shame because it was a good idea
<START> this was not the worst movie i've ever seen but that's about as much as can be said about it it starts off with some good atmosphere the hospital is suitably <UNK> and <UNK> the mood is set to eerie and then nothing well somethings just somethings that clearly don't fit in and no effort is made to <UNK> the connection between the bizarre and yet not particularly <UNK> <UNK> and the hospital they've taken over i mean come on biker <UNK> some band watched a bit too much <UNK> br br my personal favorite was the head demon who looks rather a lot like a middle aged <UNK> desperately attempting menace while simultaneously looking like he'd really like prefer to <UNK> down on an <UNK> covered couch <UNK> his belt pop a can of cheap beer probably <UNK> and watch the game honestly i've seen far scarier <UNK> at <UNK> drinking coffee <UNK> scary br br the other monsters are even more cartoonish and even less scary at least on the dvd the videos give some explanation of their presence in the hospital they apparently just randomly pop up in places play some <UNK> metal and cause people to be dead a bit <UNK> a few good special effects and acting that is not entirely terrible given a lack of decent writing there's just nothing here it's a background noise movie only
<START> the scenes are fast paced the characters are great i love anne marie <UNK> acting i really like the ending br br however i was disappointed that this movie didn't delve deeper into <UNK> and <UNK> relationship it only <UNK> when they <UNK> each other
<START> from what i've read a lot of people were disappointed by this film compared to part 1 initially i could understand this but after a bit of thought i think they are wrong to be soderbergh continues his fact based telling of che's life that he started in part 1 part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from <UNK> <UNK> to an ultimately successful conclusion part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from <UNK> <UNK> to a completely <UNK> conclusion it is not <UNK> fault that these 2 parts of che's life had completely different <UNK> he <UNK> chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way the viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after part 1 than part 2 but that is the reality of che's life and not in my opinion any fault of the director the film is far from perfect it is probably too long at least in part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the <UNK> had <UNK> in part 2 they can't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture che's capture and death are dealt with well the film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in spanish <UNK> del toro is again excellent as the charismatic <UNK> so if you've seen part 1 you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in part 2
<START> here's an interesting little movie that strictly gives the phrase low budget a horrible name our physics teacher who has about nine kids creates a strange serum that causes <UNK> <UNK> students are hopelessly killed from fake <UNK> of submarine <UNK> and flying school supplies sounds like a <UNK> of classic b movies from the 50s right nope it's not an example of high camp fun which is way way off the mark a glamorous showcase of breasts and <UNK> ensues our desire for pleasure <UNK> the horror that should have had 99 <UNK> more in the first place bottom of the barrel entertainment at its best aided by <UNK> of red blood and dead student bodies atrocious movies like this would make the ultimately <UNK> guru the mad monk 1970 the work of an intelligent genius who has a <UNK> degree in film production it's an automatic f so rest easy
<START> though i'd heard that <UNK> de <UNK> was the worst brazilian movie of the decade i watched it giving it a chance after all first time director producer writer alexandre <UNK> managed to make his debut feature shot in video for just us 4 000 and though it looks even cheaper i can't begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it <UNK> in theaters with no big <UNK> or production companies behind it then as i watched it i realized why but whatever chances you're ready to give to <UNK> de <UNK> they shrink to zero within 10 minutes it's an unbelievably preposterous <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and technically <UNK> attempt to portray brazilian upper middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo nazis hooked on bad sex drugs and violence and they're made to look like <UNK> gays too made with no visible trace of talent imagination expertise or notion of structure visually and <UNK> it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on youtube only here it lasts ninety two <UNK> minutes of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and it's not even funny bad br br we've all seen the story before bored young guys want to have fun go <UNK> take drugs and everything goes wrong there's gang rape <UNK> murder the accidental death falling down the <UNK> of the mother of one of the boys culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage <UNK> moral and literal garbage get it the film is heavily influenced by larry clark especially kids and bully but <UNK> films though also <UNK> and <UNK> are high class <UNK> compared to this crap br br i don't think there was ever such <UNK> drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience's throat <UNK> grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non stop <UNK> rant into our brains by <UNK> and <UNK> you do get <UNK> minded with so much <UNK> yelling inept direction shaky camera and terrible acting going on <UNK> doesn't care a bit about technique the quality of the images framing sound recording soundtrack songs dialog sets editing etc is uniformly appalling but he's a <UNK> control freak he <UNK> the criticisms he's bound to get by adding subtitles with <UNK> <UNK> comments and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far fetched and phony it all is i could relate to that br br despite his <UNK> ambitions <UNK> seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure he can't even decide if he wants gritty realism hand held video camera etc or <UNK> <UNK> of scenes use of alternate takes etc damn he can't even decide where to put his camera there's use of <UNK> camera for the three leads the dialog features some of the most <UNK> banal <UNK> ever the plot exists simply to justify the director's profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for all you see is a filmmaker being hateful preachy <UNK> <UNK> without the benefit of a minimum of talent or technique to go with it br br it's very disappointing to find <UNK> <UNK> in this mess certainly one of the most promising young film actors in brazil with his sleepy eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> can be highly effective under good direction as in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> here he's told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under <UNK> actors in recent memory he also enters the <UNK> realm of graphic <UNK> scenes so <UNK> they look rather like web <UNK> porn br br the film opens and ends with real interviews with typical middle class youth <UNK> wants us to take those interviews as proof of what he's trying to <UNK> in fiction but he blatantly <UNK> and makes fun of his <UNK> <UNK> a highlight of <UNK> racist sexist stupid statements which only shows <UNK> exist everywhere <UNK> wants to prove that brazilian middle class <UNK> are all present or future <UNK> because they're middle class and enjoy <UNK> drugs is he saying all neo <UNK> are on drugs or that drugs <UNK> fascist behavior i couldn't tell br br with its <UNK> self <UNK> headache inducing technique and mind <UNK> boredom <UNK> de <UNK> is bad for a 1 000 reasons but above all it's <UNK> in a very <UNK> manner it gives <UNK> of brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument <UNK> de <UNK> is best <UNK> <UNK> buried and forgotten
<START> to be clear from the get go 'the <UNK> is very very very bad it suffers terribly in almost every aspect except for one the finished product is such an awful film that it's actually hysterically funny to watch this is a very low grade film budget constraints for the film should be obvious to anyone who watches even just the opening title sequence i'm not sure if much of the humour in the film was intended or not for example the movie takes place in <UNK> ' note to all <UNK> home <UNK> if the town you're moving to is called <UNK> ' keep moving stephanie <UNK> is quick to pull off her top for a pretty enthusiastic sex scene in the kitchen i couldn't help but laugh because it has intentional humour she turns on the gas <UNK> get it the sex is that hot get it and unintentional humour the unintentional in this case is the music it's like the theme music for <UNK> of <UNK> goes <UNK> break out the computer and the <UNK> i realize that coming up with music for a small production like this is cost <UNK> i really feel for them because the work here is so well <UNK> the problem is that cheap music isn't necessarily good music i haven't laughed so hard at sex on screen since <UNK> in the <UNK> with that <UNK> <UNK> song i guess they were <UNK> that poor old mr slater was a bit quick on the draw even the end credits are hilarious intentional or not you be the judge a pet dog and cat are part of the credited cast and an animal <UNK> was on set for them the boom is credited to <UNK> b stick ' and the 3rd <UNK> wardrobe yep they had a third unit is credited to k mart maybe it's just me but i think the hilarity of this more than saves the film the movie is very very bad but the goals of stephanie <UNK> her friends and family are so well <UNK> in 'the <UNK> that you can't help but like the movie they've produced 'the <UNK> is bad but not dreadful in its own sweet way it even manages to be a bit endearing it wears its flaws so honestly that you can't help but forgive them better films that try to hide the flaws are almost worse in a way i guess this is just a film that knew who its audience was and was produced <UNK> br br watch any number of movies and most of them will probably be a lot better than this some of them might look cheaper or have worse acting or <UNK> production value they may not suffer terribly as 'the <UNK> does from awful editing sound and <UNK> effects mr b stick didn't do a very good job the special effects look to be where most of the money went they tend to be more funny than gruesome although when the <UNK> is finally <UNK> at the end the make up job there is surprisingly well done br br my 4 out of 10 is a little high but the humour helped a lot this is an ideal movie to track down some night with a few friends and a few beers in hand great entertainment is to be had by anyone who seriously considers themselves b movie or low budget film <UNK> all others should probably avoid with great prejudice
<START> all dogs go to heaven is the most <UNK> animated film to have dogs in 1989 the previous don <UNK> film the land before time 1988 became a success dogs are so cute as little mice <UNK> i just want to hug them when they're cute where was i oh yes its animation is beautiful the characters are great when they're perfectly voiced and the songs are cute and touching it opened in november 17 1989 the same date as the little mermaid produced by walt disney feature animation br br the part where charlie got killed by carface was so unforgivable carface is so mean because he wanted to kill charlie shame on him the love survive song performed by irene <UNK> and <UNK> jackson was so beautiful all dogs go to heaven is the best animated movie ever
<START> i was going to say this was the worst gay themed film i've ever seen but i can honestly say this is the worst film if any genre i've ever seen br br you know you're in trouble when a movie starts with a personal note from the director asking for the audience's understanding for the many challenges facing a first time director the audio track is so bad in many scenes it's almost impossible to follow the dialogue and this from a dvd version bad lighting bad sets bad photography poor script generally bad acting all add up to make this film unwatchable i did make it through to the bad ending after several attempts and immediately gave away the dvd i <UNK> purchased i'm sure there are many challenges facing a first time director but don't try to palm off this lame attempt as a finished product i see from imdb details that this was not only the first directing attempt of richard <UNK> but also the only that's the one positive thing i can say about this alleged movie
<START> ok i'm not an american but in my humble scottish opinion steve martin is not never has been and never will be a funny man as long as our <UNK> point in a <UNK> direction phil <UNK> as sergeant <UNK> was a funny man no doubt due to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented team working characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and <UNK> situation comedies america has ever produced how anyone could have the <UNK> to even attempt to <UNK> the phil <UNK> character is beyond me to compound things the exercise was repeated in <UNK> unfunny attempt to be peter <UNK> inspector <UNK> another <UNK> attempt in my opinion to <UNK> a <UNK> unfunny career some of your <UNK> say <UNK> martin puts his own <UNK> on the <UNK> to that i would say <UNK> his portrayals will be long forgotten when those of <UNK> and <UNK> will be <UNK> for generations to come
<START> spoilers careful br br what can i say i'm biased when it comes to urban cowboy i love it and have watched it countless times and usually find out something new about it with each viewing br br i think one of the things i like about it is that urban cowboy is about working class people not rich people who live in either l a or new york well it is true except for pam br br travolta plays bud a small town texas boy who moves to <UNK> to work in the oil fields and this is when travolta actually played in good dramatic movies like saturday night fever instead of playing stereotypical bad guys good guys in big budget movies this is a really good movie the mechanical bull riding contest and two step dancing may be silly but you have to enjoy this for what it is br br bud meets sissy played by debra <UNK> with <UNK> brilliance and soon after they are married and living in their dream trailer but their relationship becomes a real life battle of the <UNK> bud wants to be a real cowboy sissy wants to be with a real cowboy but in modern times men's roles are not as clear where can bud prove he's a real man he can work his dangerous job by day and ride the mechanical bull by night he can be a urban cowboy but sissy wants to drive his pick up truck and she wants to ride the mechanical bull too so where does this leave bud as sissy <UNK> her independence she lies about riding the bull and <UNK> with the ex con and prison <UNK> star a real bull rider wes played wonderfully <UNK> by scott glenn bud is threatened and bud and sissy break up br br sissy <UNK> up with wes who <UNK> her <UNK> himself further bud becomes the boy toy of pam a rich girl whose daddy is in oil and all that implies sissy comes by the trailer to clean it up pam doesn't do that kind of thing she writes a make up letter to bud but evil pam tears it up and takes the credit for <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> uncle bob dies <UNK> at work when <UNK> strikes and causes an explosion bud and sissy have a chance at <UNK> but are too stubborn later the mechanical bull riding competition is at <UNK> and you know bud is going to win pam realizes that bud doesn't love her but sissy he did it for her wes tries to rob <UNK> but wouldn't you know that urban cowboy bud saves the day and wins back the woman he loves br br of course you may ask yourself why bud and sissy would go to <UNK> about every night and live like pigs maybe that contributed to their bad marriage or why didn't bud stay with pam she wasn't that bad and had money or why they had to kill off uncle bob or why bud and sissy had such stupid friends like marshall and jessie who were always trying to break them up marshall says to bud she sissy rides that bull better than you do but part of the fun of urban cowboy is making fun of it a little bit and saying isn't that bonnie <UNK> on the stage
<START> you need to watch this show once to have seen them all the formula is exactly the same in each episode jim does something his way he means well but he <UNK> his wife at the end she finds out that what he did was really for her she <UNK> his cheek and gives a <UNK> smile while he looks on <UNK> in fact the story lines are so lame and formulaic that i'll take a stab at one now br br episode <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> wife notices that all of <UNK> weekly pay has disappeared he then explains to her he lost it at the casino she screams and leaves the house <UNK> how awful he is then on <UNK> day he turns up in a <UNK> with tickets to a ball hence explaining the missing <UNK> she realizes <UNK> mistake and the usual <UNK> jim you're so <UNK> the end br br another very obvious item is the fact that <UNK> character is based on homer simpson who as a cartoon character can get away with being <UNK> and ignorant when this is attempted with human beings it does not work and jim just comes over as an arrogant self centered jerk br br imo the only reason that this is successful is simply because we're so many now in terms of human beings with <UNK> these days you could make a show about a man who <UNK> walls and you'd get an audience br br <UNK> and a half <UNK> on the other hand is fantastic and hilarious
<START> movie comedies nowadays are generally 100 minutes of toilet humor foul language and <UNK> kicking modern comedies appeal to the lowest common <UNK> the <UNK> and slow of brain sure an occasional good comedy will come along but they're becoming <UNK> all the time br br mr blandings buildings his dream house shows what 1940s hollywood was capable of and it's just <UNK> funny jim and muriel blandings cary grant and myrna loy decide to build a house in the <UNK> <UNK> the film follows their story beginning with house hunting <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> construction all the way to the finished home with its <UNK> <UNK> water <UNK> br br grant and loy are perfect for their roles of course grant is particularly funny as he watches the <UNK> costs zoom out of control however the film is stolen by the <UNK> wise attorney played to perfection by melvyn douglas managing to steal every scene he's in douglas is <UNK> hilarious while he watches the blandings <UNK> from crisis to crisis <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> architect and harry shannon as the <UNK> old water well <UNK> are also wonderful br br i've watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh i think it's a good film to watch when you need a lift whether you're building a house or not
<START> different film directors from different countries have contributed to the film medium a lot by their thoughts as a result we have experienced different genres when the medium is concerned <UNK> <UNK> unlike j l godard or f <UNK> believes in simple story telling <UNK> <UNK> is one of the main traits of his directorial job he has trust upon the automatic as well as critical intelligence of the viewer he does not feel any necessity to go for alienation or such things to reach to the viewers he is equally effective despite being conventional <UNK> 2006 is another <UNK> creation from him where gender <UNK> of middle east asia gets gradually clear to everybody as the simple but catchy tale of the movie progresses now a days when all of us are shouting on the issue of rights of women this movie very <UNK> creeps into our mind and ultimately becomes a <UNK> for our critical intelligence by conveying the message that the <UNK> of human rights is nothing but an <UNK> good an <UNK> <UNK> will never let the women to be <UNK> an important soccer match where the nation is <UNK> a teenage girl who understands the game well loves her nation does not have the rights to enter into the stadium to cheer for her country she is merely <UNK> to listen to the live commentary her <UNK> could not work for her as a result she had to <UNK> several <UNK> situations from the very beginning her worried father ran here and there for her daughter at the end of the day celebration came as the nation won the match which the girl could not see as she was <UNK> in the outer side of the stadium during the match time but the celebration cannot <UNK> the question of rights of women which remain in every corner of the world in different format <UNK> <UNK> has most successfully pointed to this issue of gender abuse from with in the frame of conventional film making and <UNK> as well a global tragedy has been dealt with ease and some times with humour which in turn <UNK> our being constantly
<START> this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen br br i can honestly say i have never seen a movie worse than this one br br and i mean never br br i'm a big fan of b horror movies as you may imagine i've been exposed to some of worst that the movie industry has to offer br br i was <UNK> to this movie by it's title i mean c'mon what true fan of horror wouldn't be intrigued by a title like vampires vs zombies images of the undead battling each other to the <UNK> <UNK> in my head i thought to myself this i've got to see br br well sorry to say this i wish i hadn't seen br br this movies title is very misleading to say the least there was no vampires fighting zombies in fact there is no plot if you were to ask me what this movie is all about i could honestly tell you i have no idea br br there was no plot br br there was no story br br this movie absolutely makes no sense at all br br at the end of this <UNK> i found myself feeling sorry for the poor souls who had invested their money into this project for they surely have no business sense
<START> watching <UNK> was perhaps the longest not quite 90 minutes of my life there wasn't a laugh to be had in fact i don't remember ever cracking a smile diane keaton was <UNK> unfunny as a middle aged chain smoking dog <UNK> the <UNK> overbearing mother character a relentlessly irritating woman who clearly suffers from some kind of personality disorder she is manipulative conniving melodramatic childish <UNK> and worst of all boring br br i suppose i should briefly mention the other characters but why bother it was just a long string of movie clichés the <UNK> socially inept distant relative who's just trying to break into the industry the gruff and long suffering but somehow still lovable father the mild mannered wife who just can't take it anymore but eventually moves beyond the <UNK> and <UNK> comes home the herd of <UNK> dogs who like to chew throw <UNK> while everyone is away etc br br god what a <UNK> i've never been a diane keaton fan and <UNK> only reminded me why overacting is overacting no matter how many pictures you did in your prime her attempts at physical comedy were especially <UNK> what was the director thinking br br while i like <UNK> shepard and can even sometimes tolerate <UNK> tyler their performances were so lackluster and dull that it was clear that neither actor gave a damn about this movie that was okay because neither did i keaton's endless self absorbed <UNK> was <UNK> and at times <UNK> dislike for her seemed genuine by the end of the movie i wanted to slap her myself br br awful
<START> not only is this movie a great film for basic cinematography screenplay acting setting etc but also for it's realism this movie could take place in any farm or rural setting it makes no difference if the movie takes place in <UNK> or if it would take place in kansas the story and the messages it includes would remain the same this movie shows family values and connections for an older audience while at the same time it shows youthful behavior for the younger viewers everyone who watches this will walk away with something having touched them personally i know i did the ending hits way too close to home for me not to burst into tears every time i watch it the ending <UNK> the importance of farm safety and everyone who has ever worked on a farm needs to see this film not paying attention and <UNK> gets you into dangerous situations br br
<START> first ever viewing july 21 2008 br br very impressive screenplay and comedic acting and timing in this film now 40 years old it has lost none of it's power neil simon displays excellent insight into human nature and relationships as well as how to create genuine comedy from unusual situations jack lemmon and walter matthau give great comedic performances neil simon was inspired by actual events in his own life to write the play this film is based on br br one of the best written and acted hollywood comedies of all time br br surprisingly only nominated for 2 academy awards best adapted screenplay and best film editing hollywood rarely awards comedies no matter how well they are made
<START> ok so after watching this <UNK> movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes off my life here is the basic summary genie comes out of ghetto boom box gives this kid with shaggy hair 3 wishes the kid wastes his wishes on i forget what <UNK> sucks at <UNK> and i guess thats it br br so mainly i laughed i cried but mainly i laughed at the <UNK> comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of an <UNK> player <UNK> and boy with shaggy hair br br i highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their close friends and are in serious need of a good laugh br br i'm going to give it a 3 out of 10 only b c the movie is based off of 3 magical wishes br br if i had 3 wishes one would be to <UNK> this horrible movie and for everyone to pretend like hollywood didn't waste money on making this
<START> i literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie granted it's shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not but this movie <UNK> any <UNK> of long <UNK> and what not that may prevent many from just not caring about a shakespeare based story br br the largest <UNK> to this production is the complete <UNK> of the characters often during character's <UNK> it's nearly difficult to <UNK> who's lines are who's granted i believe this movie is dubbed in english certainly they could've <UNK> voice actors which could've added a bit more drama to these classic literary lines br br it would be difficult to rate this movie greater than 1 although perhaps that's based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget still it's absolutely painful and boring if you insist on hamlet do yourself a favor and read the book again 1 10
<START> i went to this movie expecting an artsy scary film what i got was scare after scare it's a horror film at it's core it's not dull like other horror films where a haunted house just has ghosts and gore this film doesn't even show you the majority of the deaths it shows the fear of the characters i think one of the best things about the concept where it's not just the house thats haunted its whoever goes into the house they become haunted no matter where they are office buildings police stations hotel rooms etc after reading some of the <UNK> reviews i am really surprised that critics didn't like this film i am going to see it again this week and am excited about it br br i gave this film 10 stars because it did what a horror film should it scared the s t out of me
<START> wwe has produced some of the worst pay per views in its history over the past few months <UNK> sunday survivor series and december to <UNK> were appalling to say the least and so it was relying on its b brand show <UNK> to attempt to end the year on a high note <UNK> had two major gimmick matches in the last ride and <UNK> matches three <UNK> were on the line and an interesting main event in the shape of a tag team war featuring <UNK> and john cena against king booker and <UNK> however it was an <UNK> to one of those championship matches that brought us not only the match of the night but also now a match of the year candidate when teddy long gave us fans an early christmas present t lo changed the wwe tag team championship match from <UNK> london and <UNK> against to regal and taylor to a four team ladder match including <UNK> and the hardy <UNK> br br i am not going to <UNK> on this match too much as nothing i can say would be able to do it justice this has to be seen to be believed there were many high spots and many more brutal <UNK> and awkward <UNK> the one move i have to talk about however was the one that took joey <UNK> straight to the <UNK> room <UNK> through the contest jeff hardy jumped onto a ladder that was set up in the see saw position with matt hardy holding both members of <UNK> over the opposite end of it to take the full force unfortunately for <UNK> he didn't get his hands up to protect his face and took the ladder full force in the nose and left eye this was vicious his face was instantly a mess for all to see and not surprisingly this ended <UNK> night early we found out later he suffered a broken nose and cuts under his left eye be warned this is not for the faint of heart the ending to this roller coaster of a match came after paul london managed to grab both championship <UNK> for the victory i have been watching wrestling for almost 15 years and it doesn't get any better than this match unbelievable br br the night opened with only the 4th ever <UNK> match kane took on <UNK> in a good match but it was all about the visual and not really about the action there were a few close calls with the flames for both <UNK> but in the end it was kane who forced <UNK> onto the flames after they both ended up outside the ring <UNK> ran around the ring whilst his butt was on fire and there was a sick part of me that laughed watching this may i suggest to michael hayes that <UNK> comes out next week on <UNK> to johnny <UNK> ring of fire br br the other gimmick match of the night and the second match of a triple main event was an all out war last ride match between mr kennedy and the undertaker this was a stiff match from start to finish and was the best of the series undertaker and kennedy have had yet the used <UNK> <UNK> and one scene had the undertaker thrown 15 feet from the <UNK> set onto what was suppose to be the <UNK> floor unfortunately it was plain to see that this was nothing but a crash <UNK> and crowd didn't pop for this the ending came after a <UNK> by the dead man to kennedy on top of the <UNK> followed quickly by a match winning <UNK> br br in other notable happening from the card chris benoit defeated <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> in another stiff match this was a very good bout with benoit hitting 8 german <UNK> on <UNK> at one time benoit was also considering whether to put <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> or not luckily he came to his senses and let her go this led to <UNK> attempting the roll up only for it to be <UNK> into the <UNK> for the <UNK> br br another cracking match on the card was the <UNK> championship contest between the longest <UNK> champion in wwe gregory <UNK> and jimmy wang <UNK> featuring a lot of high flying and dangerous spots some of which took place outside the ring this was a match much more deserving of the crowd response than what it got <UNK> put it best when he <UNK> the fans in <UNK> virginia for sitting on their hands during this one and at one point even started a boring <UNK> <UNK> picked up the duke after a <UNK> type <UNK> with his knees to <UNK> resident redneck br br the boogeyman <UNK> the <UNK> in a worthless match i hate the boogeyman with a passion only worth listening too for <UNK> <UNK> about <UNK> <UNK> is comedy gold br br the last match of the night was main event number 3 world <UNK> champion <UNK> and wwe champion john cena teamed up to take on <UNK> and the champion of <UNK> king booker there was no way the match could top the tag team championship match from earlier on but it entertained none the less the match would have been more memorable had it been given an extra five to ten minutes but how many times have i said that about wwe matches this year already it was king booker who was <UNK> at the end of the match after a big <UNK> br br so 2006 is over for the wwe in regards to it's pay per view schedule it started the year on a terrible note with new year's revolution but ended on a high one with <UNK> this ladder match will long be remembered as one of the greatest ladder matches of all time my hat is off to all eight <UNK> who but their bodies on the line to give the fans one hell of a match
<START> it's remarkable and quite <UNK> how writers and directors continue to make great movies out of one of the oldest and most over used story lines in cinema dog bite dog is basically not much more than just the simple story of an lone <UNK> <UNK> chasing a brilliant criminal only <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his film from the rest by being extremely violent relentless this is <UNK> one of the <UNK> and most <UNK> movies i've ever seen with an atmosphere of constant <UNK> and characters that seem to come walking straight out of hell not even the <UNK> in chan <UNK> <UNK> trilogy of vengeance with the exception of <UNK> perhaps or any other infamous cat iii film ever released were as sadistic and brutal as some of the events depicted in dog bite dog <UNK> is a young and ruthless <UNK> assassin who lands in the crowded streets of hong kong to eliminate the wife of an <UNK> judge in a restaurant when the police arrives at the place young officer <UNK> sees how <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the scene of the crime and follow him the first actual confrontation between the two <UNK> dogs results in a gigantic blood bath as <UNK> mercilessly kills several <UNK> and even <UNK> long time friend and colleague from then on begins a thrilling and action packed cat and mouse game between the frustrated cop and the professional killer the latter also saves a young girl from the constant sexual abuse of her father and stays with her at her shed in the local garbage dump what makes this routine action thriller so fascinating apart from the explicit violence are the main characters' backgrounds <UNK> the hit man is a <UNK> orphan and has been trained to fight kill for money ever since he was a child he knows no <UNK> has no mercy and barely speaks a word <UNK> the cop became particularly ruthless and <UNK> ever since his role model father also a cop lies in a coma after a drug related incident <UNK> doesn't question suspects and witnesses he yells at them and he's prepared to sacrifice everything in order to stop his brand new nemesis people with a weak stomach or <UNK> nerves are advised to stay away from this film because the cruelty and shocks featuring in dog bite dog can easily cause <UNK> it's not the type of violence where <UNK> heads and chopped off limbs fly through the air but more like the intense and utterly disturbing type where people attempt to crush their opponents mentally as well as physically the filming locations are effectively dark and eerie and the extremely sober music makes the already harrowing tone of the movie even more <UNK> the performances are terrific i wouldn't be surprised if edison <UNK> and sam lee treated each other like enemies on the film set as well because their on screen hatred and disgust feels a little too legitimate dog bite dog is a powerful and unforgettable film highly recommended if you can stomach it if you fear you can't just wait a few years for the inevitable american remake which will <UNK> <UNK> the premise a little
<START> as a <UNK> fan i enjoyed this movie very much it introduces new legendary <UNK> as each movie does and adds depth to the relationships between its characters i however do not expect those who are not <UNK> fans to enjoy it this includes most adults some of the lines were corny but that can be somewhat <UNK> when dubbing the movie over to english the animation was beautiful although there were a couple parts that did not look good and although the villain is kind of corny i think that the movies have done a good job of <UNK> through different types of villains and i guarantee you that they aren't all like this one those who did not like it i say to each his own but <UNK> fans will love it
<START> because 99 out of 100 times the producers <UNK> through their teeth or someone else's to get you to rent or buy their mercifully <UNK> br br shock o <UNK> cinema proves the truth of this yet one more time with the release of feeding the masses a possibly well <UNK> but utterly inept and dismal entry into the zombie genre folks this is not only low budget film making this is very low budget film making by a bunch of people who i'm sorry i know they have families who love them will never ever be in variety in any significant fashion this is one <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> folks and not just because it's cheap br br the acting is mediocre but i don't blame the actors they had no direction they had no direction because the script was a half baked zombie fantasy with no sense of real cinematic storytelling characterization is thin at best no thanks to weak dialogue and <UNK> direction have i mentioned yet that the script and the direction are pretty lame they are there's no drama no tension no great character moments nothing the whole premise of government <UNK> of the media is <UNK> on <UNK> commercial breaks and an <UNK> storyline that defies rational analysis and <UNK> <UNK> to its ridiculous finish <UNK> fields would not be pleased br br how could the government <UNK> the truth of a <UNK> zombie <UNK> when the reality of it would be apparent everywhere why would they give it more than a <UNK> try in this day and age of <UNK> cameras with <UNK> access what could they possibly hope to accomplish for more than a day or so at best now if they were covering something up like their own <UNK> but feeding the masses never explores such possibilities instead it <UNK> on absurdity and poorly staged events to dig for laughs and or significance praying its audience won't notice the near total lack of production value beyond basic film making equipment did anyone in this film get paid i hope the actors did if only for their time wasted on career blind <UNK> like this one at least the <UNK> got to rack up some legitimate work experience br br even zombie fans will find little to gain from feeding the masses the gore is remarkably tame for no <UNK> of its rank and there are no distinctive set pieces or memorable effects they're all <UNK> forgettable in fact <UNK> has nothing to fear br br even junk like the aussie <UNK> undead was miles ahead of feeding the masses sorry guys back to the drawing boards and take your <UNK> marketing with you
<START> i am not a usual <UNK> on this website but seeing how underrated this movie is i <UNK> myself to write some comments and remarks about it i had fun watching this movie perhaps because cat is everything i wish i could be i am not going to post spoilers or reveal plots but there's are things that i really found amazing the way she <UNK> people it's just so divine this is a very underrated movie i lack of arguments here i usually go enjoy and then speak little about it when you go to the movies is to have fun and i really enjoyed the <UNK> i stayed in the dark room a must seen over and over again until the delight fades away let's try not be so critical about it thank you for reading
<START> robert de niro cuba gooding jr hal <UNK> and all the rest of the actors and actresses in men of honour have combined to make this a fine movie mark <UNK> wrote the <UNK> so you know the music is truly fine too br br but after <UNK> a slew of goofs <UNK> and over dramatic heart string <UNK> right from the start i had to make a <UNK> to ignore them and sit back to enjoy the film if you can do that it really is good br br the story of carl brashear a true to life hero is inspirational enough to last a lifetime look him up on the internet the entire story is more amazing than the film as the director admitted in his comments there were only three african american u s navy <UNK> in world war ii however none reached the status of u s navy master diver carl brashear was the first african american u s navy master diver and he was the first <UNK> diver to ever be <UNK> or <UNK> as a u s navy diver <UNK> applause br br on the negative side of the movie's ledger should i tell you of only one of the many <UNK> yeah i'll mark this comment as containing spoilers and do so the early pivotal scene where the helicopter hits the radio <UNK> and sinks into the sea they'd never have had the time to suit up a full mark v diver even if he were the legendary master chief billy sunday in time to be only a couple of minutes late saving the pilot br br so for <UNK> goofs and over <UNK> i <UNK> men of honor from a perfect 10 down to a 7 br br will hollywood ever realize that the <UNK> truth is so much better that their over dramatic approach to story telling i doubt it too bad
<START> four words account for why this film was made she done him wrong the huge commercial success of that mae west vehicle convinced the studio <UNK> that gay <UNK> <UNK> were a <UNK> <UNK> here we are rewarded with a fast moving well written romp which neatly targets the personalities of its stars br br wallace <UNK> and george raft are excellent as friendly rivals jackie cooper is a little harder to take but it is fay <UNK> who steals the film with her stock in trade damsel in distress with a strong director as walsh proves himself to be <UNK> could carry a lot of punch and she is utterly believable as the object of both raft and <UNK> affection br br lots of atmosphere beautifully designed this is a forgotten film worthy of revival
<START> why take a show that millions of us watched and loved as children and make a complete joke of it they ask why hollywood isn't making the money it used to because they put out garbage and pay actors huge amounts of money to be garbage men and ask us to pay 10 to see their garbage the tv show was what it was good people in bad situations where the good <UNK> boys come out on top it wasn't gone with the wind but it was fun this movie is garbage hollywood can't come up with anything original so they take something that was good and ruin it for some i only hope that this movie makes <UNK> less than it cost to make the only one's to have any fun with this crap are the guys who got to drive the general lee the audience is the victim br br don't see it watch the reruns of the tv show instead they still hold up 20 years later
<START> words really can't describe how bad this film is i thought <UNK> was bad but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good <UNK> <UNK> moment here and there to stop you from <UNK> off this is just laughable terrible script poor direction awful acting and you know what i can't think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isn't too long if you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment book yourself in at the dentist and have some root <UNK> work far more enjoyable and much better value for money assuming that you need it incidentally i need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review please do not buy this movie it is terrible
<START> i caught this on the dish last night i liked the movie i traveled to russia 3 different times <UNK> our 2 kids i can't put my finger on exactly why i liked this movie other than seeing bad turn good and good turn semi bad i liked the look ben chaplin has through the whole movie like i can't <UNK> this is happening to me whether it's good or bad it the same look and it works great ending 7 10 rent it or catch it on the dish like i did
<START> i had not seen the movie trailer when i went to see the movie instead i based my <UNK> on a friend's opinions now i like chris rock and his comedy but this movie just falls flat on its face br br during the movie rock delivers a couple of funny jokes but unfortunately the movie is sorely lacking in comedy the movie seems want to <UNK> both laughter and love into one and it that <UNK> it fails the love story in the movie is straight forward luckily but it <UNK> too much from the movie by making rock serious and bland after all the movie is first and foremost destined to be a comedy where laughter should be the primary concern not much of that in the movie br br the plot is also pretty uninteresting as a whole some parts were <UNK> altogether if the supporting cast were meant to be funny they certainly didn't do a good job the couple of angels from heaven tried to make a couple of jokes which were dry and dull <UNK> first <UNK> couple of <UNK> were also bland if there's one thing they did do right though they made rock seem funnier by comparison
<START> five deadly <UNK> is not as bloody and violent as story of ricky or super ninjas but it features some of the best hand to hand fight sequences in hong kong film history director chang <UNK> creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece this movie launched the careers of the five men who play the <UNK> <UNK> lo plays yet another bad ass he would go on to be in super ninjas <UNK> <UNK> who is philip <UNK> would go on to story of ricky and hard boiled any chop <UNK> fan can <UNK> this but i still think it ain't as good as super ninjas also made by chang <UNK> but all chop <UNK> is good and this is one of the very best
<START> a mix of ninja stuff mixed with a sub james bond storyline the result is incredibly awful and boring being just the stage for endless gun battles i can't believe this was released in theaters <UNK> this movie
<START> obsession comes in many <UNK> and exists for a variety of reasons for some it may be nothing more than a <UNK> disorder but for others it may be an <UNK> of survival lack of <UNK> combined with an inability to <UNK> even the <UNK> <UNK> of daily life or the basic social <UNK> may <UNK> even a genius to <UNK> embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone and in extreme cases the object of that satisfaction may become a <UNK> obsession driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very <UNK> of his <UNK> and as we discover in the luzhin <UNK> ' directed by <UNK> <UNK> a high level of intelligence will not <UNK> a satisfactory resolution to the problem and in fact may actually <UNK> the situation obsession it seems has no prejudice or <UNK> moreover it gives no quarter br br at an italian resort in the <UNK> alexander luzhin john <UNK> is one of many who have gathered there for a chess <UNK> the winner of which will be the world champion luzhin is a master of the game but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since <UNK> to be a game to him rather it is his obsession that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total <UNK> in seemingly all areas of life and <UNK> him to cope with the subtle <UNK> of his immediate family so luzhin is a genius with an <UNK> <UNK> a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very <UNK> that man is <UNK> stuart wilson <UNK> former mentor who after an absence of some years has suddenly <UNK> and made himself known to luzhin br br <UNK> is an <UNK> <UNK> presence to luzhin and once again life threatens to <UNK> him not only is he about to face a <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after <UNK> hours but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life his feelings for a young woman he's just met at the resort <UNK> emily watson and genius though he may be dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace as well the curse of his entire life br br to tell <UNK> story <UNK> effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess and as his background is established it <UNK> the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life for the scenes of his childhood <UNK> <UNK> them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into and <UNK> the present more <UNK> setting of the resort the transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled and with the pace <UNK> sets it makes for a riveting yet <UNK> presentation that works extremely well she also <UNK> the menace produced by the presence of <UNK> <UNK> on the drama rather than the suspense which ultimately serves to <UNK> the overall impact of the film making <UNK> tragedy all the more believable and unsettling br br the single element that makes this film so memorable however is the affecting performance of john <UNK> for this film to work luzhin must be absolutely believable one false or <UNK> moment would be disastrous as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately it doesn't happen however and the film does work because the luzhin <UNK> creates is <UNK> honest and true to life he captures <UNK> genius as well as his <UNK> and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real it's a performance equal to if not <UNK> geoffrey <UNK> portrayal of david <UNK> in shine ' and when you compare his work here with other characters he's created from sid <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> to pete in o brother where art <UNK> ' to al <UNK> in box of <UNK> ' you realize what an incredible range <UNK> has as an actor and what a remarkable artist he truly is br br as <UNK> emily watson is excellent as well turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely though she has to be somewhat <UNK> to relate to luzhin watson manages to do it in an <UNK> way that is entirely effective most importantly because of the detail she brings to her performance it makes her <UNK> relationship with luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story you have but to look into <UNK> eyes to know that the feelings she's conveying are real it's a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor br br the supporting cast includes <UNK> james vera christopher thompson <UNK> peter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> brady anna mark <UNK> <UNK> father kelly hunter <UNK> mother alexander hunting young luzhin and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> well crafted and delivered the luzhin <UNK> is an emotionally involving film presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man's <UNK> to man we don't need a movie of course to tell us that there is cruelty in the world but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget <UNK> as we all have the ability to effect positive change and to make a difference in the lives of those around us i rate this one 9 10 br br br br br br
<START> expecting to see another <UNK> movie with a mean mother superior <UNK> and torturing her charges flavia turned out to be much more than i had anticipated br br it actually has a feminist storyline though i don't think such a term existed in the era in which the movie is set it certainly wasn't <UNK> women and the jews and the poor are very <UNK> and locked into <UNK> spots in society throughout the story sister flavia <UNK> <UNK> witnesses the <UNK> of her time until she just can't sit there any longer and actually does something about it albeit with disastrous results br br the pre credit sequence has flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield she sees an injured evil muslim soldier one of the few still alive and tries to assist him before she can her hate filled father <UNK> the soldier and waves his head in her face great family dynamics huh after this her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice though scenes do involve violence rape and nuns i would consider this more of a historical drama than <UNK> br br indeed many of the ingredients for a trashy exploitation piece are there but the acting camera work storyline and music are too good to keep it down in that level most nun films i've seen usually have the basic premise of a good girl somehow winds up in a convent where the mother superior is a supreme bitch that likes to whip people and or make their lives a living hell br br flavia spends much of the first part of he movie <UNK> questioning all of the atrocities happening around her much of her <UNK> is forgotten when she becomes <UNK> with the strong spirited but slightly loony she likes to pee outside like me but it's a lot easier for guys sister agatha when a group of muslims attack their <UNK> flavia and agatha do not <UNK> in fear like the other nuns their <UNK> actually function as their <UNK> of the cruelty and near slavery of the <UNK> in fact it is a christian not a muslim <UNK> that <UNK> dear sister agatha br br it is <UNK> death that sends flavia on her violent <UNK> against those who have <UNK> her her father treats her like dirt her muslim lover <UNK> her at a very <UNK> time i don't want to give out too much of the rest of the story but be prepared to be shocked <UNK> and <UNK> at the conclusion this is a great film so don't be put off by its <UNK> reputation as a trash epic plus how on earth could a movie featuring <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> go wrong i am not familiar with <UNK> <UNK> other works but sister agatha is a hell of a character br br i have read many great reviews of the <UNK> us release but i love my german x rated <UNK> dvd copy it isn't <UNK> 16 9 but actually has a little more picture information on all of the edges than <UNK> release br br and there are also many great wise or funny lines of dialogue many from sister agatha br br why is god male the father the son and the holy <UNK> they're all male flavia br br these men are afraid look at them sister afraid their power will be taken away from them sr agatha regarding christians fleeing after the muslims arrive br br woman where are you going the <UNK> can do nothing to you that the christians haven't done ha ha ha sr agatha to a group of fleeing christian women br br lord bless these <UNK> for putting fear into these pompous christians flavia br br does it take the mere sight of a <UNK> to make you h t your <UNK> sr agatha br br closing message flavia <UNK> not yet a muslim no longer a christian was <UNK> as a runaway nun the idea for the film came from events which occurred during the <UNK> <UNK> of italy culminating in what even today is remembered as the <UNK> of the <UNK> at <UNK>
<START> this film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie i have ever seen it is about as fun as doing hard <UNK> labor with stomach <UNK> the movie starts out bad i would rate the first few minutes of the film a 1 10 and then it get <UNK> worse minute by minute the only way to rate it at all would be some kind of <UNK> <UNK> negative number that grows for ninety long minutes unfunny is not a real word but it best describes the humor in this video somehow the video manages even to make cute scantily clad females and sex look grotesque and <UNK> this movie is amazingly bad i would say it would be better to be locked up with the titanic theme playing over and over and with <UNK> character from escape from la <UNK> on in your ear than to watch this movie the sequels are not nearly as bad if you have to rent a troma film get <UNK> and juliette or combat shock i would rather watch 5 tony little <UNK> back to back than to see class of <UNK> high again don't get me wrong it took some kind of criminal genius to make a movie this terrible and if ever a movie deserved an award for being awful this is it
<START> i thought the racism and prejudice against carl brashear was grossly <UNK> for hollywood effect i do not believe the u s navy was ever that overtly racist i cannot imagine a full captain the commanding officer ever telling his chief to intentionally <UNK> anyone certainly not at the risk of his life and there has never been a chief petty officer as <UNK> prejudice against everybody but <UNK> as <UNK> character no chief as <UNK> and drunken as he was played would have ever <UNK> to master chief in the first place cuba gooding saved an otherwise badly done movie
<START> i saw this movie about a year ago and found it to be completely laugh out loud funny a real winner in my mind it had the <UNK> of a stupid comedy but indeed had an actual plot as well much like the hit comedy <UNK> in fact it had a few serious moments <UNK> between hilarity when stiller shot <UNK> horse an <UNK> sober moment you found yourself laughing at his bumbling antics you can actually find common ground there as i'm sure many people have done something they wouldn't want a friend to find out about <UNK> your friendship should end br br when i found out how much people disliked this movie i was completely <UNK> that absolutely terrible movies like <UNK> dynamite had ratings higher than it makes me wonder about the sanity of people on imdb take my advice and rent it if you don't find yourself laughing at least once i'll compensate you the rental <UNK> d
<START> i had seen this film way back in the 80's and had nearly forgotten it when i noticed it was on tv again and watched it i remembered having liked this little sleeper when i first saw it and i liked it even better on second viewing br br all of the actors especially robert duvall glenn close <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> forrest and jason <UNK> as the twelve year old boy who feels responsible for the accidental shooting death of his older brother are superb the film has a very genuine feel to it an understated quiet deeply moving story of a family <UNK> with grief the dialogue is sparse but telling and the <UNK> acting is outstanding sort of like a simpler rural version of ordinary people sans psychiatrist but equally impressive family dynamics br br the stone boy is well worth the time and emotional energy involved in watching it
<START> suggesting nothing less than a movie length version of the 1970s tv hit love american style <UNK> out with flashes of nudity <UNK> 1973 is a lighthearted piece of fluff that somehow still manages to entertain and the lead character here tara b true really is some kind of <UNK> a <UNK> not flight attendant who's so good looking that even her <UNK> <UNK> has made a pass at her and with a hunky boyfriend in every <UNK> this <UNK> <UNK> gal really does put the lay in <UNK> what with her <UNK> surgeon beau in new york her playboy with gangster problems in miami and her <UNK> challenged rock star dude in l a tara sure does keep busy and when she's not <UNK> these guys of all their <UNK> <UNK> as the viewer learns she's <UNK> to be taking a karate class mile high <UNK> <UNK> off <UNK> and <UNK> attending <UNK> pot parties and stopping a <UNK> attempt on her airplane as i said lighthearted fun and surely good for a night when you're feeling somewhat brain dead and just want to <UNK> out in front of the tube future <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> does bring some vacuous charm to her role as tara and the film looks handsome enough to please <UNK> <UNK> '70s <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and mary <UNK> aka candy <UNK> are wasted here in very small roles but still get to do what they do best show off their <UNK> though the picture is never <UNK> out loud funny and doesn't really have many thoughts in its <UNK> head it does succeed in being consistently amusing and i suppose that is something strange that the end credits should call attention to ms <UNK> body double however don't think i've ever seen that before
<START> i can't imagine anyone would ever in a million years want to watch this movie not because it was one of the worst ever made it wasn't but largely because it's about 20 years old and oh so out of the mainstream i was trying to find out where i saw an actor before and this popped up so yeah a kid stops playing little league because he doesn't like <UNK> this <UNK> major media attention and a quick resolution to the cold war the end a fantasy to be sure but one so <UNK> it would make john lennon <UNK> since terrorism has replaced communism as the <UNK> that scares the hell out of us this movie really has no relevance except as an <UNK> look back at those times the writing acting and film craft are similarly undeveloped the reason i rated it as highly as i did was because i watched this movie around 50 times while i was 5 6 years old and still have a little place in my heart for it but i now realize that it doesn't quite cut <UNK> so if the law of large numbers holds true and someone eventually does decide to check out this movie realize that there are much better ways to spend your time but also much worse ones i will <UNK> from a john q <UNK> for now
<START> i thought this was a great idea but boy was it poorly executed we do get a broad sense of how complex and challenging the <UNK> <UNK> of a show are but virtually no <UNK> about any of it works the producers don't seem to have found any way to tell a story or give the viewer a through line which is not to say they didn't try but having the <UNK> relate a synopsis of the ring cycle as the <UNK> narrative does nothing to tell us about the job of physically <UNK> an opera br br we see lots of things happening but are told little about what it is that the people are doing and why there's little sense of who is who or how the various production <UNK> fit and work together for instance several times we hear about a problem of some sort one expects then to see the problem and its consequences and or how it gets resolved but instead the filmmakers generally just cut to something else generally pretty generic footage of people pushing stuff or talking into <UNK> br br overall the film ends up feeling more like a <UNK> of images that you'd see run under the closing credits of a show rather than anything worth watching for its own merit
<START> i rented this flick for one reason tom <UNK> i respect his work but this was a real let down i had horrible clichés half of the film was naked women so called fallen angels running around trying to act scary oh and then there was the occasional blair witch black and white motion <UNK> camera scenes <UNK> character was really awful horrible script and you got to love these lines they use is anyone there who is out there this isn't funny no but your acting was i wish i could give this flick a 0 oh the names of the characters judd molly ally <UNK> but they did leave out anthony the breakfast club reunite in the forest of unforgivable acting
<START> this has to be some of the worst direction i've seen the close up can be a very powerful shot but when every scene consists of nothing but close ups it loses all its impact br br tony scott has some very beautiful scenery to work with the backdrops of mexico the <UNK> the beautiful estate where anthony quinn lives and the dusty towns <UNK> rolls through on his journey for revenge unfortunately we only catch quick glimpses of these places before the camera cuts to a picture of a big giant head even the transition scenes where <UNK> is driving alone across mexico quickly cut to a close up br br the score is over dramatic and <UNK> <UNK> every emotion we should feel the story itself should have been handled much better among other things too many people pop up out of nowhere to help <UNK> along it's just bad writing br br it's a typical thriller storyline but many others have taken the same premise and done outstanding things with it <UNK> no way out had a somewhat similar storyline but it was a much better movie br br the ending was completely <UNK> and suffered from the most melodramatic <UNK> of the film this movie was never going to be great but if we saw more of mexico and less of giant heads this film might have been watchable
<START> incredibly intriguing and captivating i found it impossible to turn away once i began to watch i am usually one of the <UNK> critics but to me this film was just brilliant strange as this may sound i could almost smell the air and feel the <UNK> of the locations br br from a cinematographic i thought there was great use of light and <UNK> from the orange glow of the summer light down to the plastic wrapped couch all had a distinct air of realism to me br br from a character perspective i thought the notion of victor vargas as almost the <UNK> that <UNK> the story was quite inspired each of the other members of the family having a more complete background simply caused greater intrigue in the main character himself br br beyond that having known someone just like the grandmother and having been on the receiving end of just such a situation i can say the situation felt particularly realistic the <UNK> the accent the cooking and even down to the comments made felt so authentic to me br br i think this film worked for me because i began to watch it with no expectations and found it completely <UNK> and brought back memories of teenage emotion well worth a watch
<START> this movie is a riot i cannot remember the last time i had such a great time at the movies i've seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny but this one is wall to wall great lines i think best in show is the last movie that i laughed so hard and so much in the movie was non stop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up other than that it's a constant <UNK> of one liners and goofy situations i'd like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the <UNK> movies where you don't get all the jokes the first time around you have to see it two or three times to get it all in br br as far as the actual film goes it could have used a better edit it's choppy at times but we have to be <UNK> for that all the characters are great it's not like an adam sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke i think i will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable no victims in this movie also thank god they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend catherine <UNK> plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film you just wish that women like her really existed she's not a 10 like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is <UNK> than julia roberts overdone <UNK> br br if you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it i assure you the trailer does not do it justice they do not give away all the good jokes just some of the mediocre ones br br oh and one more thing i hope critics put this on their top ten list many of them complain that comedies don't get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don't put it on their list this means you ebert
<START> a fascinating look at the relationship of a single father in 1998 and a single mother in <UNK> tied together by a time traveling teenager reminded me of somewhere in time richard <UNK> <UNK> time return as rendered by christopher reeves and jane seymour
<START> fido is to be <UNK> for taking a tired genre zombies and turning it into a most original film experience the early 50s atmosphere is stunning the acting terrific and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning suddenly the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars <UNK> era dress art <UNK> furniture and zombie servants it would be very easy to dismiss fido as cartoon like fluff similar to tank girl but the two movies are vastly different fido has structure a script that tells a story and acting that is superior make no mistake this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed highly recommended <UNK>
<START> this isn't exactly a great film but i admire the writers and director for trying something a little different the film's main theme is fate and small seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future in some ways this reminds me of the film <UNK> doors though instead of focusing on one random event seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion plus an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene like he's some sort of <UNK> being but there's absolutely no explanation of him in the film like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in the <UNK> <UNK> br br the dvd jacket shows just audrey <UNK> this is capitalize on her success in <UNK> though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role the pace is <UNK> the acting fine and the conclusion isn't bad at all the only reason i didn't score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and i think the movie could have perhaps been <UNK> up with a few less subplots
<START> there is so much that can be said about this film it is not your typical <UNK> of course there is nudity and sex with nuns but that is almost incidental to the story br br it is set in <UNK> century italy at the time of the <UNK> of <UNK> christians at <UNK> the battle between the muslims and the christians takes up a good part of the film it was interesting when everyone was running from the muslim <UNK> that the mother superior would ask why do you fear the muslims they will not do anything that the christians have done to you certainly there was enough torture on both sides br br sister flavia <UNK> <UNK> is sent to a convent for <UNK> her father in the process she witnesses and <UNK> many things the <UNK> of a <UNK> the rape of a local woman by a new duke the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> herself when she ran off with a jew the torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax being <UNK> on the nun and her <UNK> cut off br br sister flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble as she questions the male dominated society in which she lives she even asks jesus why the father son and holy ghost are all men br br eventually she joins the leader of the muslims as his lover and they sack the convent here is where you see more flesh than you can possible enjoy at one time but tragedy is to come she manages to exact sweet revenge on all including the duke and her father but finds that the muslim lover treats her exactly the same she is a woman and that is all there is to it br br i won't describe what the holy men of the church did to this <UNK> at the end but it <UNK> the torture of saw or hostel by decades br br <UNK> fans will be satisfied with the treats but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to <UNK>
<START> i have seen my fair share of comedy and <UNK> movies but this one is so original so fresh it will make you wonder why you always walked right pass it in the video store murphy has some pretty raunchy jokes but this is just too funny to pass if only every movie could be this funny it should be called <UNK> minutes of the most incredible comedy murphy is a comic genius in this film and will make you say this is the guy that did dr <UNK> he <UNK> about the ice cream man shoe throwing mothers his aunt with a mustache racism and everything else you could possibly think of and the ones you <UNK> please if you ever see one comedy in your life this is it if only all movies could be delirious
<START> i took my 10 year old daughter to see nancy drew over the weekend and found myself thoroughly entertained first off it was clean and i mean by my standards the majority of kids' movies today are full of crude toilet humor and gross out jokes to <UNK> cheap laughter from the pre teen crowd nancy drew is smarter than that however and the humor is subtle and clever br br the title role is played with a refreshing <UNK> by emma roberts who is <UNK> and polite without ever becoming annoying unlike the brady bunch movie where the <UNK> characters are <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> style is treated with respect and dignity it's a great moment when the la style conscious girls with their paris hilton <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> by the <UNK> owner while nancy in her penny <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> pattern dress is <UNK> this movie <UNK> the we need to <UNK> this wholesome girl <UNK> so many hollywood movies take nancy remains true to herself and her values throughout br br the mystery is just tense enough at times to be engaging there were several suspenseful moments where my daughter <UNK> grabbed my arm but there were no gratuitous shock scenes it's all based on tension and mood and is a lot of fun the supporting cast is good particularly marshall bell as the creepy caretaker there are some great cameos by eddie <UNK> chris <UNK> and bruce willis and many moments that will make adults smile br br this film deserves better ratings than some have given it not only was i glad not to be dragged to yet another computer animated film where talking animals <UNK> and pass gas all over the place but i was also very entertained had i been there without a child i still would've enjoyed the movie this is one dvd that will have my daughter's name on it under the christmas tree
<START> this movie is awesome i watched it the other day with my cousin jay jay he said it was alright but i think it <UNK> i mean it's so cool ted v <UNK> is so brave and smart he made a movie totally unlike those terrible hollywood films like the matrix and stop or my mom will shoot it could have been better though i like ninjas and pirates i also like that big <UNK> that the funny man wears i think he's the coolest guy since that domino pizza <UNK> guy not only does this movie look really cool like those out of focus movies my dad made of my birthday when i turned 6 but it tells a complex tale with dozens of characters that seem to be totally unrelated but they all meet up in the end it's genius how this web is woven to make everything meet up i wish ted v <UNK> would make a sequel but it needs more aliens and a pirate
<START> the idea of making a film about the beatles sounds doomed idea as no production can catch the idea of the actual historic beatles then it is perhaps best not to try to recreate the past but to produce an <UNK> that works best with the other available beatles material this is exactly what <UNK> of the <UNK> offers to us the simple story known to us without any <UNK> br br spoilers here on br br be warned that not everything is that accurate as some beatles <UNK> might expect the beatles are seen performing songs that hardly were even composed by that time the beatles perform ask me why p s i love you and even don't bother me the beatles <UNK> should see that if the beatles on the film only performed songs that they actually did at <UNK> the younger viewers might not anymore recognize the beatles they have learned to know them of that original <UNK> <UNK> only johnny b <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> love me tender are <UNK> br br the guys who play the beatles in this production <UNK> look like the originals but the rest of the film still make good viewing as the film is for the rest fairly accurate the guy who plays lennon does it good and the rest of the band are not bad either brian <UNK> is great and the moment when he <UNK> pete best from the group is probably the most memorable scene in the whole film also as a bonus you get to see the original <UNK> club in the film
<START> i liked chiba in street fighter and i figured hey no matter how stupid this movie will be i'll at least get to see him kick some ass right wrong this is a dull dreary mess of pointless talking half <UNK> <UNK> and meaningless scheming there are few action scenes of any kind even fewer martial arts scenes and the few that are are shot and edited so poorly that you can't even make out what in the world is going on the dub is also atrocious and perhaps the idiocy that is this movie is best illustrated by the fact that it supposedly features the italian mafia except they're all japanese avoid like the plague you would see better martial arts by looking through the window of your local <UNK> karate class for five minutes
<START> simply put this is the best movie to come out of <UNK> since well ever evil dead eat your heart out hatred of a minute was some of the <UNK> and best cinema to be seen by this reviewer in a long time i recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of a head trip or a good case of the <UNK>
<START> this movie tries to hard to be something that it's not a good movie it wants you to be fooled from <UNK> to end but fails from when it starts to get interesting it falls apart and you're just hoping the ending gives you some clue of just what is going on but it didn't br br
<START> yet another die hard straight to video rip off with cardboard <UNK> how many more of these god awful cheaply and badly made rip off of the more popular action movies of the late 1980's and early 1990's are there still lurking out there for the record not that you will care really this one is yet another blatant rip off of a combination of die hard under siege and speed 2 complete with a full <UNK> of clichés and predictability br br the non <UNK> villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out gun <UNK> thugs who are <UNK> by various means as the film progresses the hero naturally is an ex cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional <UNK> but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son br br the supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between florida and mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry  this goes <UNK> to explaining how come they appear to be <UNK> around on a rusty cross channel ferry  in new zealand the acting is as wooden as the deck the script <UNK> the one liners predictable the villains utterly inept and the plot has holes in it you could <UNK> a boat through br br there seems to be a never ending tide of this sort of rip off straight to video rubbish <UNK> the late night <UNK> of television and the dvd bargain <UNK> of <UNK> everywhere although even this film is so bad it has yet to see a dvd release yet but give it time is there any chance of something at least half <UNK> made semi believable and most important original no i thought <UNK>
<START> what an entertaining movie astaire and randolph scott are in the navy astaire has to woo back ginger in san francisco while scott must be <UNK> that harriet <UNK> is worthy of being his wife everything works out fine br br it's sometimes <UNK> and i can see why that scott's romance with <UNK> is unnecessary and slows the plot down especially painful are <UNK> singing of sappy love songs i could have done without her singing right enough but i found the romance rather touching <UNK> enters the movie as a music teacher wearing a pair of <UNK> no makeup and the <UNK> clothes known to man or beast no wonder scott avoids her until she <UNK> herself <UNK> under the <UNK> of her sister ginger and a <UNK> lucille ball the problem is that after her <UNK> she looks like the same <UNK> plain woman as before only with a <UNK> outfit it's tough enough for a <UNK> guy but at least a man can become wealthy and powerful and popular then he can collect women anyway even if he looks like <UNK> the dog faced boy but what does a plain looking woman do the same <UNK> to romance aren't open to her henry <UNK> had <UNK> did margaret <UNK> it must be terrible to be an ordinary woman in a culture as cruel as <UNK> as a kind of a <UNK> i must mention that randolph scott was <UNK> to be <UNK> by hollywood <UNK> who needed some nonsense to chew on and it's kind of amusing that he has the following line in this film when he's putting <UNK> <UNK> off women don't interest me sister the movie probably gives more quality time to ginger rogers than any of her other films with astaire and she's marvelous she's beautiful sexy a talented actress and dancer and the script gives her good comic lines too let's kiss and make up suggests astaire let's just make up she says that will give you something to work on it's also the only film she made with astaire that gives her a solo number during an audition choreographed by <UNK> pan her performance is accidentally <UNK> by astaire who slips some <UNK> <UNK> or something into her water and she <UNK> through her number <UNK> being too <UNK> for the time br br as a dancer i'd make a terrific circus elephant so my opinion must be taken as that of an amateur but i think their dances together are the equal of any they put on film their first during a dancing contest let yourself go is the most wildly <UNK> of any i can remember and the only dramatic <UNK> let's face the music and dance must be among their finest the last step as they exit is startling br br i like the film for reasons with personal <UNK> i remember seeing it for the first time in a theater in downtown san diego next to a shop called the seven <UNK> that <UNK> to sailors i was in uniform at the time and was impressed with the treatment of the naval careers of astaire and scott what i mean is here we have this <UNK> musical comedy which <UNK> absolutely nothing to historical reality and yet unlike most of their other <UNK> pays its <UNK> anyway jumping ship astaire calls out for a water taxi i had just taken a water taxi <UNK> myself the uniforms are correct to the period unlike say those in on the town and they're worn properly hats down to two finger <UNK> above the <UNK> and not <UNK> back and there are two incidents in which astaire runs into a problem with naval authorities and they're both handled with perfect seriousness and are thoroughly believable an officer stops astaire from leading a jazz band during <UNK> and reports to the captain they were playing when the call was sounded sir i'm certain no <UNK> of discipline was intended it's what an officer a good officer would say and nobody laughs br br the series was getting a little <UNK> by the time follow the fleet was made so instead of putting fred into high society and a <UNK> they turned him into a <UNK> chewing <UNK> instead it was a good idea and the dance numbers are up to the concept
<START> a particularly <UNK> example of italian cult cinema with a nonsensical title to boot if anything the alternate the mark of satan is even less relevant to the plot this hybrid of gothic horror and giallo with a strong dose of <UNK> only <UNK> a flat sort of atmosphere throughout  actually matched by handling which is downright dreadful here we get the usual group of people an acting <UNK> stranded on an island to which they were invited by a count  since he had become <UNK> of the leading lady a dead <UNK> for his missing <UNK> the characters are pretty much stereotypes middle aged but dashing hero played by <UNK> <UNK> stuart and whose family history bears more than its share of violent tragedy <UNK> heroine <UNK> companion <UNK> mae west and <UNK> the most annoying of the lot a meek but devoted stage manager forever <UNK> by one and all for his <UNK> behavior a couple of lesbians a mysterious <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who for once gets in on the action if you know what i mean an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> star <UNK> <UNK> though for what it is worth this is really an ensemble piece a religious fanatic of a butler an <UNK> <UNK> etc while the film is not by any means unwatchable the atrocious dubbing <UNK> pace shoddy production with the scenes depicting the raging sea lifted from some black and white film and the fact that the murders only occur within the <UNK> half hour do not help matters besides <UNK> <UNK> score though pleasant in itself comes off as <UNK> modern under the circumstances that said the revelation proves a surprisingly elaborate one considering there is surely no <UNK> of suspects here
<START> if i could i would give zero stars for this one but unfortunately i have to give one br br there is no single scene i could laugh about but the game didn't make me laugh either so if you're some ill retarded folk go to your local cinema watch this movie and give it 10 stars like some people here already did br br but for me in a movie where children are shot dead to achieve humor good taste goes over the edge this was the third time i wasted my time to see a boll movie and it was definitely my last br br 0 10 i'm ashamed of being from the same country as uwe boll br br please please keep him from making more movies
<START> i reflect back to the days when i held my boyfriends hat to smell him into existence in my time alone when i was 16 the little moments of this film are so accurate and right on pace with what is going on in the minds and hearts of young girls during those coming of age teenage years now at my age i want to <UNK> to them about their decisions and how life during those times are not as important as it all seems in those moments that if they can be patient in their youth and wait to experience the <UNK> of life both <UNK> and internal that life would be so much <UNK> but then again young people today are faced with some <UNK> that i never had to deal with a youth br br the three main characters well played by all three actors <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> anna simpson <UNK> and melissa <UNK> maria give us the very believable depiction of a piece of reality for young girls living in <UNK> situations they have <UNK> family lives all being raised by single mothers with expectation of <UNK> whose father is present but not <UNK> supporting her day to day the have <UNK> educational systems and lack direct contact with achieving role models these situations <UNK> affect them and is their reality but all this is of no great <UNK> concern to these young women in their day to day they except their plight and focus on the same things young girls all over the world are concerned with finding true love in a male having good friends that you can depend on gaining some respect love and responsibility from parents and enjoying life this is were this film cross the race age and gender gap <UNK> upon it by its characters and the setting in which it is <UNK> br br the director and writer <UNK> explains on the dvd how each of scenes got into his head by just <UNK> young people of that age that lived in those types of <UNK> plus you add three up and coming actresses who are not so far removed from that time in their own lives that you get a real good <UNK> of reality and acting at its best the one thing i know about african americans and <UNK> is that there is always a spiritual family member or neighbor that is in the <UNK> or near ground believing in a better day and better life and future in spite of the present situation and is role <UNK> that to some extent this was never touched in the movie in order not to <UNK> and i understand that but it also <UNK> the culture to having no hope in anything other than themselves br br the hope factor i now think about my future and where i have come from and say as <UNK> did today is a good day ' yes poverty still exists racism <UNK> and any other <UNK> that we can added yes some of each of these young girls actions <UNK> the <UNK> and are self destructive everything around them is <UNK> but none of those actions past or neither present nor their environment leaves them without hope for a bright future i was left with <UNK> hope of each of the characters and a deeper desire to be a role model in the life of some young girl on the edge of making a destructive decision i suppose that is the value of film it should not only entertain but cause each of us to think reflect and then act in some positive way to make this world a better place br br
<START> here we are two <UNK> from a distant futuristic world arrive on earth one is on a desperate mission to <UNK> a life another is an <UNK> killing machine determined to eliminate the woman who will give birth to the <UNK> of an entire race br br so what could we call this killing machine it's almost like he's some kind of <UNK> or <UNK> sort of like an <UNK> or something what's the word i'm looking for something that <UNK> things <UNK> br br anyway the <UNK> who <UNK> <UNK> the white <UNK> he stole from luke skywalker in favour of local clothing finds the young woman first and <UNK> her with a future born hero to be the evil <UNK> <UNK> kills some <UNK> and steals their guns and clothes then attempts to locate the woman by visiting her <UNK> and asking around by looking <UNK> into people's eyes and repeating her name <UNK> br br then begins a desperate race for survival as the seemingly <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the couple across the countryside at some point he may <UNK> boots and a motorcycle but i'm not sure br br perhaps in an exciting finale he will attempt to crush them under the <UNK> of an enormous <UNK> truck full of acid then the truck will crash they will be saved but no he will then re emerge as strong as ever he will kill the <UNK> and pursue the girl into a meat <UNK> plant where in a terrifying finish he is pushed into a large piece of industrial <UNK> <UNK> and destroyed once and for all br br but maybe i'm <UNK> too much after all i did stop watching this movie after mr <UNK> magically <UNK> sean young by kissing her at a bar then tells her the child will be born in 3 days br br the costumes and effects are great in this movie i loved them the first time i saw them on star trek next generation too sean young does another great turn as an <UNK> <UNK> and career sweat <UNK> stephen baldwin is also on board as <UNK> fat cop boyfriend not sure where he fits into the plot though maybe he's an <UNK> from a different james cameron movie
<START> i'll be quick to address the matters of the film here it was a very engaging story about the destructive qualities about all <UNK> passions a young italian woman who cannot emotionally connect with her <UNK> political radical fiancé due in part to her <UNK> attitudes and <UNK> approach to life finds <UNK> and passion in a new young lover whom she <UNK> on an <UNK> sexual relationship with the <UNK> rage <UNK> and passions that <UNK> around in the atmosphere of the story equal the <UNK> quiet that seems to <UNK> the two leads it lends the film an unsettling mood that <UNK> through all the political <UNK> that is otherwise lost on the viewer unless you have a deep knowledge of italian politics during the 80's i found the film compelling what ruined it somewhat is a gratuitous <UNK> sex scene that the actress performs on the male lead it isn't <UNK> and leaves little to the imagination there are other scenes of sex in the film which i do feel were necessary because they outline the madness and loneliness that the characters live in but the <UNK> sex scene i feel <UNK> the focus on the actual story it was smooth <UNK> up until that point and once the infamous sex scene appears which caused much <UNK> back in its day it's like hitting a <UNK> it's jarring and unnecessary and i am in the camp that believes that the film would not have been <UNK> any if the scene had been removed from it and what's unfortunate is that this particular scene may <UNK> people from watching this intriguing film which i believe is worth a viewing because there is so much going on underneath the surface emotions and further <UNK> layered in the subtext br br overall wonderful film <UNK> by a much not needed sex scene
<START> you can tell a <UNK> grade production a mile off  distinctly british in style epic in conception <UNK> by international all star casts usually set in exotic <UNK> it's a formula that grade and his company <UNK> employed throughout the 70s into the early 80s resulting in titles like the eagle has landed <UNK> and raise the titanic in 1977 grade produced march or die a remarkably old fashioned foreign legion adventure that models all the characteristics mentioned above directed by the usually <UNK> dick richards  who <UNK> the acclaimed farewell my lovely just a couple years earlier march or die is an unfortunate disappointment br br a company of foreign <UNK> led by the harsh <UNK> general foster gene hackman is sent to <UNK> shortly after world war 1 their mission is to protect an <UNK> party <UNK> by the dedicated <UNK> <UNK> max von <UNK> the <UNK> are carrying out an <UNK> at the ancient city of <UNK> but fear an attack from arab <UNK> following the <UNK> of an earlier <UNK> group foster is not happy with the assignment  he does not consider historical <UNK> worthy of his men <UNK> their lives this creates ongoing tension between himself and <UNK> who believes that the <UNK> should sacrifice their lives to make the <UNK> possible the problems <UNK> when a beautiful woman named <UNK> <UNK> catherine <UNK> <UNK> along with the <UNK> she is hoping to find out what happened to her father a <UNK> <UNK> by the <UNK> when they wiped out the first <UNK> team her presence <UNK> desires amongst the <UNK> none more so than gypsy thief <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hill a charming and courageous rogue who initially shows indifference towards his <UNK> colleagues but gradually grows in stature things climax with a huge battle at <UNK> with <UNK> of united arab <UNK> <UNK> against the handful of <UNK> as they desperately try to defend their lives br br on paper the star duo of gene hackman and <UNK> hill seem a <UNK>  hackman is the <UNK> oscar winning character actor hill the handsome but limited italian heart <UNK> from numerous low budget spaghetti westerns one expects hackman to act his counterpart off the screen yet <UNK> it is hackman who gives the weak and <UNK> performance while hill raises his game to surprisingly high levels the film is <UNK> shot on desert locations but the pacing is awfully slow and few of the characters are worth caring for maurice <UNK> music is <UNK> flat too  very disappointing from the guy who gave us the lawrence of <UNK> score it is remarkable that anyone had the nerve to try an old fashioned adventure of this type in the 70s it was a genre that <UNK> in the 30s and had been all but forgotten during the <UNK> decades sadly the <UNK> doesn't really pay off  this homage to the <UNK> flicks of old becomes more of a <UNK> than a march
<START> as a huge baseball fan my <UNK> of this film is how realistic it appears dennis quaid had all of the right moves and <UNK> of a major league <UNK> it is a fantastic true story told with just a little too much disney for my taste
<START> if you liked the grinch movie go watch that again because this was no where near as good a <UNK> movie translation mike <UNK> cat is probably the most annoying character to grace the screen in recent times his voice accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful <UNK> sound which is about the only laughing i heard at the theater not even the kids liked this one folks and kids laugh at anything now save your money and go see looney tunes back in action if you're really looking for a fun holiday family movie
<START> clara <UNK> is wonderful as the title character of the film essentially a film about a spanish american girl who moves to spain with her mom at the time of the spanish civil war it turns out the mother goes home to die and she is left with her grandfather she also makes friends and experiences much in a short time <UNK> juan jose <UNK> is at first a <UNK> to her then they become close the film is shot beautifully <UNK> in soft colors mostly carol <UNK> for her dad who is a pilot in the war and you can feel the love <UNK> has for him while the war itself is kind of taken a back seat in this film it <UNK> the character's lives i think you'll like it see it especially for clara <UNK> who does a great job as carol she is definitely one to watch
<START> tight script good direction excellent performances strong cast effective use of locations br br paul <UNK> gives a detailed subtle performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously br br there is an interesting moral emotional journey happening with his character ben turner and it <UNK> with the journey <UNK> by amanda burton inevitably they cross over who has done what br br the examination of why both in the past and in the present rather than who might have <UNK> a more interesting <UNK> story but hey who's complaining br br
<START> this timeless <UNK> <UNK> in this movie and in my heart so many years have i waited to see this eternal story i was not ready perhaps it is possible that my sensibilities would not have appreciated its power so i now <UNK> welcome it into my soul with <UNK> br br my respect and admiration for paul muni has been long his is now a legendary <UNK> but now i have finally discovered the priceless gifts of <UNK> <UNK> splendid talents oh how many faces can speak as did hers some have said that it was <UNK> from her silent years and this well might have been but her speech is <UNK> enough when it is given a chance she <UNK> deserved her oscar br br this movie is in an epic in the most classical proportions all parts equal necessary and perfect <UNK> may walk away if they wish but they would be <UNK> a storytelling which stays with one a lifetime br br the good earth <UNK> one in ways that one does not expect but all will not come from it with the joy that i did but i can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years br br do not <UNK> me with mere <UNK> regarding the race of the principal players these are expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with utter perfection but i dare a million score of newer films to tell pearl <UNK> story with such <UNK> power conviction and grace br br if any modern artist would dare to re film this masterpiece i warn them that they will never come close to the <UNK> <UNK> which still <UNK> from the core of this telling time will not <UNK> this effort nor will progress improve upon its greatness
<START> the eternal jew der <UNK> jude does not have what we today would call the <UNK> of a <UNK> document rather than <UNK> experts or sources to support what it says it simply says without opposition what it wants us to believe one will <UNK> that american <UNK> of that period were also much less <UNK> than would seem <UNK> to a modern audience often <UNK> <UNK> scenes and passing them off as actual news footage add to this directed propaganda the fact that filmmaker <UNK> was preaching to the converted not so much asking <UNK> europeans to hate the jews as <UNK> the feelings so many of them must have held already in order to have allowed the holocaust that followed the weakest link in the film's logic shows in its rat <UNK> <UNK> it goes on to explain the behavior of rats and then adds something to the effect of well jewish people are like that too similarly it <UNK> jewish people as ugly by showing ugly jewish people in comparison to attractive <UNK> the accompanying leap of faith is that ugly is bad the film appears to <UNK> itself a few times for example by attacking western <UNK> who portrayed old testament characters as light skinned europeans thereby the text admits that so called <UNK> <UNK> is in fact an <UNK> aspect of christian culture it also shows ghetto jews willingly living in roach <UNK> filth despite the supposed treasure they've <UNK> and then flip <UNK> by saying that these same <UNK> live in wealth and luxury as soon as they leave the ghetto incidentally who wouldn't the use of scenes from a well known american film house of <UNK> shows an equally <UNK> <UNK> of logic first the film is <UNK> as having been made by jews then it is apparently used by <UNK> to <UNK> the <UNK> of jews the aforementioned <UNK> of poverty by ghetto jews shown as a means of avoiding <UNK> although the <UNK> character's spin is that jews are <UNK> <UNK> finally the <UNK> film is once again <UNK> for <UNK> that the famed <UNK> family invented the checking account this apparent <UNK> in whether the american footage is shown positively or <UNK> might become <UNK> with repeated viewings but at first sight it makes for some murky <UNK> for all of eternal <UNK> <UNK> i was at first surprised that the imdb viewer rating for this film is as high as it is just shy of a 5 to date i'd say the reason is that <UNK> documentary value has <UNK> its original purpose offering us unintentionally a look into the lives of european jews as they would not be seen a few years hence needless to say the film's very badness also provides an historical insight into bad or simply evil filmmaking as a <UNK> tool about this time i should expect director <UNK> to flip flop once again <UNK> forward to say that's what i meant to do all along the scenes depicting animal slaughter are particularly gruesome and show same as decidedly <UNK> contrary to the intent of <UNK> law to prevent animal suffering i would like for someone who has seen the film and has some knowledge of these <UNK> to comment on whether the portrayal is accurate
<START> this is yet another bad movie that you should probably avoid watching the plot could be a lot <UNK> than it actually is and would be better made as a blockbuster type movie br br the acting leaves something to be desired though you can not quite place your finger on what it is br br this is one of those that you watch on late night tv perhaps on usa simply because you can not get to sleep watch it if you want but do not expect too much from it
<START> simon pegg plays a rude crude and often out of control celebrity journalist who is brought from england to work for a big american magazine of course his winning ways create all sorts of complications amusing fact based comedy that co stars <UNK> dunst looking rather grown up danny huston and jeff bridges it works primarily because we like simon pegg despite his bad behavior we completely understand why <UNK> dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent screw ups i liked the film its not the be all and end all but it was a nice way to cap off an evening of sitting on the couch watching movies br br 7 out of 10
<START> shore leave is mostly an average star trek adventure nothing wrong with the episode though i simply think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans it is lightweight entertaining nothing more however i'm glad to see that a tv show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious <UNK> conflicts in this episode kirk decides to grant his crew some time off and a landing party is <UNK> down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation as usual the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be there are some action and tense moments but most of the story is played for laughs good but <UNK>
<START> out of all the princess stories disney has put out there cinderella probably has the most enduring appeal i can't really say why but for some reason generation after generation <UNK> her to the top of their lists as a little girl i wanted nothing more than to be cinderella with her glass <UNK> it was my absolute favorite costume br br honestly i don't think there is any story that more realizes the <UNK> of the human heart than cinderella who has never wanted to run away from the <UNK> of daily life and find someone who sees you as no one else ever had the story is older than the english language and somehow it still rings true br br as for the characters if nothing else disney can make a wonderful villain lady <UNK> is evil to the t in a wonderfully <UNK> not overtly physical way her cutting tongue and eyes do the work for her she doesn't need <UNK> of <UNK> to strike fear into your heart the animal friends tend to <UNK> especially that idiotic gus i would have <UNK> had he met his fate in <UNK> jaws cinderella herself was no <UNK> making some <UNK> <UNK> remarks at times however she just lacked the drive to make her entirely sympathetic sure she was nice and fed animals but what was keeping her at that place we never know even if she only became a maid in another house at least she's be getting paid and have a shot at respect it seems the only reason things work out in the end for cindy is that everything sort of falls to place in her lap she never works for her dreams that she sings so <UNK> of br br which brings me to the music which is lovely as ever <UNK> woods has a lovely rich voice probably my favorite of any disney heroine some big standards <UNK> here a dream is a wish your heart makes so this is love <UNK> <UNK> boo br br cinderella is a wonderful heartfelt story with a ton of musical highlights while it is lacking in some character development it does provide some classic villains and excellent voice work if you are feeling sick at heart pop it in it'll warm you up and make you hum <UNK> <UNK> good br br quote of the film br br surprise surprise duh duh duh happy birthday
<START> silent night deadly night 5 is the very last of the series and like part 4 it's unrelated to the first three except by title and the fact that it's a christmas themed horror flick br br except to the oblivious there's some obvious things going on here mickey rooney plays a <UNK> named joe <UNK> and his creepy son's name is <UNK> ring a bell anyone now a little boy named derek heard a knock at the door one evening and opened it to find a present on the <UNK> for him even though it said don't open till christmas he begins to open it anyway but is stopped by his dad who <UNK> him and sends him to bed and opens the gift himself inside is a little red ball that <UNK> santa arms and a head and proceeds to kill dad <UNK> maybe he should have left well enough alone of course derek is then traumatized by the incident since he watched it from the stairs but he doesn't grow up to be some killer santa he just stops talking br br there's a mysterious stranger lurking around who seems very interested in the toys that joe <UNK> makes we even see him buying a bunch when <UNK> mom takes him to the store to find a gift for him to bring him out of his trauma and what exactly is this guy doing well we're not sure but he does seem to be taking these toys apart to see what makes them <UNK> he does keep his <UNK> from <UNK> him by promising him to pay him in cash the next day and presents him with a larry the <UNK> toy for his kid but of course larry is not a good toy and gets out of the box in the car and of course well things aren't pretty br br anyway eventually what's going on with joe <UNK> and <UNK> is of course revealed and as with the old story <UNK> is not a real boy <UNK> is probably even more <UNK> and naughty because he suffers from <UNK> a smooth plastic <UNK> so that could account for his evil ways and the identity of the lurking stranger is revealed too and there's even kind of a happy ending of sorts <UNK> br br a step up from part 4 but not much of one again brian <UNK> is involved and screaming mad george so some decent special effects but not enough to make this great a few <UNK> from part 4 are hanging around too like clint howard and <UNK> hunter but that doesn't really make any difference anyway i now have seeing the whole series out of my system now if i could get some of it out of my brain 4 out of 5
<START> this film is exactly what its title describes an attempt to get you to buy into what the writers have to offer br br first it's kinda fun to see the 1996 style toronto i remember with all its silly <UNK> <UNK> clothes and attitude it really hasn't changed any just a nice safe cheap <UNK> little urban <UNK> that makes a great meeting place for international film types it's also amusing to see kenny and <UNK> head to l a and find out that it's toronto all over again only with a strange assortment of beach <UNK> musicians fortune <UNK> and yet more <UNK> film types br br i don't see pitch as a film to be enjoyed it's not entertainment unless the viewer enjoys watching someone's aspirations being <UNK> i take pitch as a warning that power and money is really held by studio <UNK> and production houses would be and successful writers musicians and actors are still mere <UNK> even when they reach the big time br br so kenny and <UNK> are trying to sell you a warning buy it or don't but the message is still there
<START> i just came back from hong kong on my summer vacation and saw the legend of zu i thought it kicked a s it was so creative and unique it's the <UNK> tiger hidden dragon with a lot less drama even if some thought there was too much special fx yeah right you can't complain about the cast zhang <UNK> and <UNK> cheung are so fine the legend of zu kicks a s
<START> mistress of the craft <UNK> works as an agent for the london branch of <UNK> <UNK> 17 which <UNK> in i think occult criminals she possesses the eye of destiny good in her hands dangerous if anyone else got it br br <UNK> 17 has caught a <UNK> from california hyde no relation to dr <UNK> detective lucy <UNK> of <UNK> flies to england to bring him back to the us <UNK> is the connection to the earlier witchcraft movies having been played by stephanie <UNK> before in witchcraft 9 in part 7 <UNK> was played by another woman in 6 <UNK> was a man br br <UNK> part in 9 was not terribly big but she's one of the main stars in this one though she's left behind her high heels and short <UNK> she still has revealing tops in this one and this time around she has nude and sex scenes <UNK> is pretty appealing in the role br br as usual there are a number of sex scenes an anonymous <UNK> has a fatal <UNK> with two vampires the <UNK> and head vampire get it on with some <UNK> <UNK> finds an english pal and <UNK> and her boyfriend make love br br the main recurring character of the witchcraft series will <UNK> does not appear in this one although <UNK> mentions him to <UNK> 17 agent dixon in a conversation about vampires she also phones her partner detective garner parts 6 7 and 9 though we don't hear his end of the conversation br br hyde is <UNK> from jail by a group of vampires led by <UNK> for a <UNK> ritual having something to do with a god named <UNK> i think hyde delivers all of his lines in a very flat manner while <UNK> overacts to a campy degree the fight scenes are terribly choreographed br br the audio in the movie was pretty poorly recorded and poorly edited additionally some dialogue gets lost under <UNK> music or <UNK> cinematography isn't great either having the movie set in and actually shot in the uk was a bit of a novelty though at least for this series br br wendy cooper is very good as <UNK> attractive certainly but more importantly she's easily the best actor in the movie bad fight scenes notwithstanding i'm quite surprised her filmography is so small if there's ever a witchcraft <UNK> and i would bet there will be they should bring her back even if it means flying her to california br br witchcraft x is available on its own or in the dvd collection <UNK> than hell along with witchcraft <UNK> and two unrelated movies
<START> well no i tell a lie this is in fact not the best movie of all time but it is a really enjoyable movie that nobody i know has seen br br it's a buddy cop movie starring jay leno and pat <UNK> mr <UNK> with some fluff story about a missing car engine prototype or something but that doesn't matter the reason this movie is fun is because of the interaction between the two leads who initially dislike and <UNK> each other but in a shocking twist of fate end up becoming friends the whole culture difference thing is done quite well in that it's fun to watch it's completely ridiculous but in a cheesy and enjoyable kind of way the soundtrack is cool once again in a cheesy 80's kind of way it suits the movie i've been trying to find one of the songs for ages but as i'm working from memory of what i think a few of the words were i can't seem to find it br br another thing this movie has is the most fantastic pay off of any movie ever but i won't give that one away oh no in conclusion i'd take this movie over 48 hours most of eddie <UNK> <UNK> including beverly hills cop and whatever buddy junk jackie chan or martin lawrence have to their names if you're looking for a buddy cop movie and are getting fed up with straight white cop meets zany <UNK> black cop give this a shot you might be pleasantly surprised <UNK> this turns the whole formula upside down with straight japanese cop meets zany <UNK> white cop br br i'm giving this 7 to be honest i like it more than that i'd rather watch this than a lot of stuff i'd give 8 but i guess i know deep down that it's some sort of insanity that makes me like this movie
<START> my father was the warden of the prison he is retired now <UNK> in this documentary and i've grown up around the prison life so perhaps my views will be totally different from everyone else who watches this movie i will say this the filmmakers who brought us this <UNK> minute miracle are fantastic artists and even better people they were brave enough to a show up and tell this story b get inside these inmates minds and hearts and c do all of this <UNK> responsible to their art and more importantly responsible to the inmates and staff of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> complex they should be <UNK> without end for this work to take <UNK> hours yes hours of footage and be able to cut and <UNK> it down to <UNK> riveting minutes is nothing short of extraordinary and they have my <UNK> respect br br i saw this film under circumstances that only a very very few were able to see it i was at the <UNK> screening i was in the same room with these men as they watched their hearts being <UNK> out on screen i saw men crying on television crying in the chair in front of me and let me tell you it was a very profound experience these men have committed horrendous crimes in some cases yet have found ways to try to redeem themselves even if they view themselves as <UNK> how many of us have the courage to do this how many people could do what they have done in such a harsh environment to see them react to the film was an experience i am <UNK> grateful for and i will never forget that i thank the men who allowed me this glimpse into their lives i thank my father for making all of this possible and i thank <UNK> films for taking the time to pour their blood sweat soul and tears into this project br br this movie will change everything you think you know about prison life and the inmates held within it <UNK> is not real television is not real <UNK> behind <UNK> is
<START> standard paint by numbers monster fare filled with a bunch of routine plot devices from big creature movies it's like somebody had a deck of cards with plot ideas from other movies written on them which were <UNK> and dealt whatever plot lines and characters came up in the deal were then tossed into the script br br characters are so cliché ridden that you can play a game of guess who ends up as a monster meal after less than ten minutes into the movie and probably get every single one right including the order that they will get <UNK> many of the characters are so obnoxious that you root for the creature to shut them up some of the main characters include a billy idol clone who <UNK> with sharks a <UNK> brat who flashes <UNK> a capt <UNK> guy with a <UNK> and <UNK> girlfriend who does sleazy dances at a bar oh and a big big beast in need of anger management therapy br br along the way people argue a lot pretty girls run around with wet t shirts couples make out on exotic <UNK> explosions occur ruins of a <UNK> appear and <UNK> faced pirates drop by br br amusing for the most part but one thing bothered me the <UNK> by characters when other people were killed after one violent demise they make one liner jokes i could almost hear <UNK> shots br br overall ok if you have 90 minutes to waste and you want to laugh at a so bad it's good movie otherwise you may want to skip this one
<START> this film was the most longest film and the record breaking film for sure it had 30 actors after <UNK> <UNK> 2002 i guess no one had the guts to do something like that br br the film as the title suggests is based on the <UNK> war but the problem is there are too many characters and the romantic subplots and the songs of many characters are boring br br even there are too many cinematic liberties like killing people with <UNK> wonder which soldier does that br br direction by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> front of border music is okay br br amongst the huge cast ajay <UNK> stands tall saif is very good in his part and also it's his first film with kareena <UNK> is likable <UNK> <UNK> has his moments <UNK> is wasted <UNK> is okay <UNK> <UNK> does his part well rest are passable <UNK> is good <UNK> is okay rest are passable
<START> my rating refers to the first 4 seasons of stargate sg 1 which are wonderfully fresh creative and <UNK> when the cast stepped through the gate you never knew what lay on the other side starting around season 5 the show took a different focus still good but different br br the series follows the adventures of a team of humans and one alien who regularly venture into a <UNK> transport device called the stargate the <UNK> of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie stargate in which the device is discovered during an <UNK> dig in egypt br br the episodes are light innocent and easy to watch and very creative many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci fi movies of their own what happens next was always unpredictable br br the characters on which the show rests are also well defined and brilliantly performed their tone is serious but the dialog is <UNK> with incredible wit and humor they are simply fun to watch br br starting somewhere around season 5 the series started to <UNK> into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single <UNK> the <UNK> then the <UNK> the plots become more complex a lot more political <UNK> oriented and <UNK> the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature br br one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> episodes they are simply can't miss shows they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasons br br if you are a sci fi fan watch a few episodes of the first 4 seasons and you'll likely be hooked if you like <UNK> story lines between two <UNK> sides you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to
<START> i'm <UNK> years old and i've spent as much of my life as i can remember a fan of horror and sci fi films be they silent black and white no budget or big budget there are very few of them that i can't find something to like about that said i'll give this movie credit for good gore and creature effects but that's all this is a case of effects over story truth is we live in a time where there is very little left that hasn't been seen in a horror film <UNK> for a film of any kind to really entertain it must have a good original story a good story can overcome poor effects and bad acting but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie this movie doesn't even have good acting only good effects so unless you can only about the gore pass this one up
<START> based on a true story of how a man ahead of his time the great 19th century american poet and <UNK> walt <UNK> made a significant contribution to how western medicine treats people with psychological problems br br interested in the treatment of people with psychological problems he began to associate with psychiatric workers and patients after seeing the psychological methods of the time <UNK> and <UNK> cruel methods walt rejected those methods and treated patients with compassion and dignity <UNK> other people to do the same the story of <UNK> interactions with psychiatric workers patients and <UNK> is full of drama good humor and wisdom
<START> when i was 11 grease 2 was like crack it was a <UNK> shameful <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> experience my sister and i would watch it <UNK> it and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another so if you are an 11 year old girl and you reviewed this film as brilliant or fun or better than the original grease you have your <UNK> adolescent <UNK> to blame and you can rest assured that this <UNK> <UNK> with utter rubbish will pass br br if however you are not a little girl you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that grease 2 was anything but an inane <UNK> <UNK> embarrassment for all who <UNK> in its production distribution and or <UNK> br br for the sake of criticism i will <UNK> the film now by explaining why it <UNK> br br 1 in a well executed musical the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters in grease 2 with a few <UNK> exceptions to the music is <UNK> pointless most of the songs appear to relate <UNK> innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way score tonight <UNK> do it for our country and <UNK> without making one <UNK> statement about any of the film's characters or themes plus all of the music is <UNK> stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the <UNK> semblance of an ability to sing or dance br br 2 the t birds should be <UNK> and if not at least somewhat likable but instead each of them is an annoying <UNK> <UNK> loser in the end when johnny <UNK> offers michael the sacred t bird jacket and <UNK> him into the gang michael should kick it to the ground spit on it and duck away to <UNK> <UNK> any part of his body that was touched by it but of course he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling <UNK> there is no greater honor than to be one with the t birds br br 3 since michael is beautiful smart kind <UNK> and above average in <UNK> his musical <UNK> notwithstanding it is <UNK> that stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask stephanie on the other hand is a <UNK> slack <UNK> bubble <UNK> <UNK> dirty <UNK> wearing <UNK> rude and trashy <UNK> so aside from being pretty i guess she <UNK> no likable characteristics thus audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of michael's attraction to her br br i could go on and on but i didn't want to mention the gross <UNK> to its predecessor since there are apparently so many <UNK> out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair i will say this though to those of you who think you want to <UNK> this mess for old <UNK> sake grease 2 is an experience akin to re living your first kiss only you are <UNK> now and kissing a <UNK> <UNK> 13 year old kid with <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed trust me
<START> sydney lumet hasn't had a box office hit in 20 years and yet at <UNK> has managed to <UNK> out a tight well cast suspenseful thriller set in his old <UNK> ground new york city how he got insurance let alone the budget after all those <UNK> is a mystery also the story is a pretty grim one and the characters are not particularly likable but it held me on the edge of my seat till the final scene br br two brothers with <UNK> financial problems <UNK> to rob a suburban jewelry store owned by their elderly parents the only victim is going to be the insurance company the robbery goes awry and two people die most of the film is concerned with the aftermath the action is non linear and seen from the main character's <UNK> points of view but it is not difficult to follow what is not so easy to work out is the back story  how did the brothers get into such a mess there are clues  the younger brother being the baby of the family is his <UNK> favorite while the older brother seems to be carrying a lot of <UNK> about his relationship with his father and vice versa but that hardly accounts for him becoming a heroin using murdering <UNK> br br as the scheming older brother a <UNK> philip seymour hoffman <UNK> the film but he is well supported by ethan hawke as his <UNK> <UNK> younger brother albert finney as their father seems to be in a constant state of rage but then the script calls for that marisa tomei as the older brother's cheating wife at the age of <UNK> puts in the <UNK> performance i've seen in many a year the film literally starts with a bang but we are out of that comfort zone pretty quickly br br i don't know the origins of this story by first time scriptwriter kelly <UNK> but i suspect that like <UNK> great 70's film dog day afternoon it is based on fact  it's too silly to be untrue lumet is just about the last of those immensely versatile old time <UNK> studio directors who with immense speed were able to direct just about anything that was put in front of them some great films were produced that way as well as some classic <UNK> this isn't a classic of either sort  it's a well crafted piece of downbeat entertainment it will probably leave you feeling that you were lucky not be a member of a family as dysfunctional as this one but still wondering as to how they got that way we do know the parents were happy but we see so little of the mother and hear so little about her it is impossible pick up on her relationship with the boys there is also a daughter whose presence seems redundant well like <UNK> we have to conclude that each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way
<START> or at least one of the best i think this is a very fun and very cool game for the <UNK> <UNK> is up to his usual <UNK> yeah it's a dumb word but the only one i can think of and mario must stop him again this game is very fun to play and contains lots of nostalgia to me the only bad thing about it is the graphics which are awful to today's standards but everything else is pretty good especially the little mini games you can <UNK> it's the second best <UNK> game the first best is <UNK> bad fur day that i recommend to any mario fan or any fan of platform games it beats out mediocre super mario sunshine any day br br 9 10 or a
<START> spoilers wow this is a bad one i did a double take when watching an old star trek episode the other day it was the one where everyone gets infected with that space sickness and then go a bit nuts and there was stewart moss a k a the unlikable <UNK> of it lives by night he played the first <UNK> infected who dies from <UNK> depression all i could think was that he'd watched his own movie too many times that's what caused the depression this movie is full of truly unlikable people there is no redeeming character in the film not one it's very hard to feel bad about dr <UNK> turning into a bat or whatever he actually turned into because you just don't like him and you don't like his shrill <UNK> wife or the nasty sleazy sgt ward or dr mustache love so why would you <UNK> any time or energy in this movie where there is no empathy with the characters there is no reason to bother caring about it not to mention the horrible cinematography which made it look like they'd filmed the movie through <UNK> and the five <UNK> bat special effects many of which appeared to be pieces of paper thrown into a fan to <UNK> <UNK> of bats flying not the worst film i've ever seen on mst3k but down there in the bottom ranks definitely
<START> like wearing a hair shirt positively absolutely without a shadow of a doubt one of the worst movies ever pure torture zero stars out of ten one long tedious <UNK> pretentious self conscious theatrical and <UNK> artsy scene after another intended to be <UNK> and <UNK> the soul <UNK> it is instead <UNK> <UNK> br br half naked father and son <UNK> and <UNK> to each other like lovers <UNK> erotic is the point loud and clear ok so what br br repeated more than once by the son is the line supposedly lifted from lives of the saints a father's love <UNK> a loving son lets himself be <UNK> the parallel to god and his son christ is heavy handed irrelevant and <UNK> like everything else here br br some reference points to the theme of russian <UNK> mother and son 1997 the return <UNK> <UNK> 2003 little <UNK> james gray 1994 <UNK> fathers and sons and of course <UNK> the brothers <UNK> br br credits in english indicate intended international distribution meaning that the excuse cannot be used that you have to be russian to understand this mess br br this is nowhere near as accomplished or compelling as <UNK> last russian <UNK> 2003 br br as in his mother and son an equally powerful <UNK> some scenes are filmed from <UNK> mirrors though not as interestingly the film is almost <UNK> shot from start to finish through <UNK> <UNK> making it as visually as it is dramatically numbing a soft focus <UNK> only adds to the drugged feeling br br an annoying soundtrack <UNK> on never <UNK> up like a tape loop an old radio constantly plays in the background russian romantic melancholy <UNK> endlessly as themes based on <UNK> the presence of a sound designer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of course that all those irritating little sounds radio static noises <UNK> and such are designed br br it's hard to believe someone <UNK> <UNK> actually wrote this thing it all seems as <UNK> as traffic as if improvised by bored actors popping out of <UNK> into <UNK> br br modern art has finally succeeded in <UNK> the thing without being the thing so that what we behold is the idea of the idea empty as a shell but not even a shell merely the idea of a shell could one ask for a better definition of <UNK>
<START> another of my <UNK> into the bargain bin this movie gave me exactly what i expected a load of trashy horror complete with screaming ladies br br it all started so well i liked the little intro with the <UNK> about the young couple being exposed to a nuclear blast and was totally absorbed right up until the first person caught fire br br from then <UNK> the film <UNK> into outright silliness and at times became almost embarrassing to watch when the heroine turned out to have been <UNK> with the same condition as the main character the ability to light one's own <UNK> without the aid of a match it seemed almost as if someone had thrown the idea in at the last moment that'll be good you can almost hear them say as for the almost psychic link between the main character and the nuclear power plant well br br the movie came across as cheap <UNK> if you pay more than <UNK> 50 for it you've been done
<START> besides the fact that my list of favorite movie makers is 1 stanley kubrick 2 god <UNK> 3 the rest this movie actually is better than the book and the tv miniseries though this is an easy feat considering the director the flawless filming <UNK> the acting and kubrick's all time number one skill the music make it the masterpiece of horror i watched the tv miniseries a few years ago and liked the story and i had my hopes about this when i got a hold of it it blew me away it is far better than i ever imagined it it starts slow kubrick trademark and has a lot of <UNK> that builds up the suspense the intro scene is a classic by all means and i watched it about 20 times just for the <UNK> atmosphere it <UNK> to the whole film also the film doesn't offer a lot of gore it has just enough and it is by no means tasteless a trend that i hate in recent day horror films just watch it
<START> this movie started slowly then gained momentum towards the middle however the fact that the movie ran over two nights broke that momentum at its peak the second part really got interesting but then gave way to a simply pathetic ending playing football in the yard really could it get any more sappy and <UNK> now i hear plans for a similar movie based on the '70s i won't make any great efforts to tune into that one if it's anything like the '60s
<START> what a lovely heart warming television movie the story tells of a little five year old girl who has lost her daddy and finds it impossible to cope her mother is also very <UNK> only a miracle can <UNK> their <UNK> which all viewers hope will <UNK> samantha <UNK> is brilliant as the little girl's mum as she was as the <UNK> in jack and sarah worth watching if you like both samantha <UNK> and happy year tear <UNK> movies ellen <UNK> is as always a delightful grandmother in this tender and <UNK> acted movie <UNK> <UNK> the little five year old is charming and a most convincing young actress the film is based on a true story which makes it so touching mermaid is a tribute to the milk of human kindness which is clearly illustrated and clearly is still all around us in this difficult world we live in mermaid gives us all hope by <UNK> that there a lot of lovely people in the world with <UNK> of love to give james <UNK> <UNK> scotland u k
<START> no mention if ann rivers <UNK> adapted the material for the house next door from her 1970s novel of the same title or someone else did it this lifetime like movie was directed by canadian director jeff <UNK> having read the book a long time ago we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television you know that when the critical moments <UNK> the commercials which of course one can't find in this version we watched br br the film's star is lara flynn boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a <UNK> because of the <UNK> transformation this actress has gone through from the new <UNK> to other parts of her body ms boyle is hardly recognizable as <UNK> kennedy the character at the center of the mystery this was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera that goes for the rest of the mainly canadian actors that deserved better br br the film has a feeling of a cross between desperate <UNK> with the <UNK> wives and other better known features combined with a mild dose of creepiness the best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting
<START> i saw myra <UNK> when it first came out in 1970 i was a healthy 20 year old at the time who loved movies and really liked <UNK> <UNK> on top of that i had read the gore <UNK> novel it was based on and thought it was very funny i saw the movie at a local drive in and about half way through i was sorely tempted to turn the <UNK> of my car on so that maybe i'd die of <UNK> <UNK> and not have to see the rest of this <UNK> of a movie it wasn't smart or trendy it was gross and sloppy all the actors were tone deaf and the director didn't have the slightest idea what he was doing the casting of mae west was one of the worst casting choices in movie history as one reviewer here said her role had nothing to do with the movie or book her character in the book is sexually beaten up by the young stud which would never do for the legendary ms west oh no the plot is changed so she sexually beats him up very believable from a <UNK> year old woman who looks every day of her age i could go on but why it was an awful movie br br <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> weeks is broken apart missing her lover she is not able to overcome her love for him that is lost in the past she hires a stranger douglas davis and gives a list of her mistakes to him with things to fix but time is <UNK> and sometimes the cure for the pain is a tragic end br br the first point that <UNK> in the cure is the stylish cinematography that <UNK> black and white with color the <UNK> and sharp screenplay is capable to develop a tragic and bleak tale of love with an unexpected plot point in the very end in less than eight minutes the soundtrack is beautiful but the volume is a little loud and associated to the fact that english is not my native language in some moments i needed to repeat some words <UNK> by the narrator the unknown lead actress has magnificent performance and is extremely gorgeous i hope to have a chance to see her again on the screen last but not the least the debut of the director and writer ryan <UNK> could not be better my vote is nine br br title brazil not available
<START> i don't remember this film getting a cinema release over here i only saw it when it came onto cable the film deals with the <UNK> of children into killing machines specifically one person the way he gets replaced and dumped literally into an off world community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feels br br seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be rambo in space and would have been happy if it was br br i'm certainly happy it <UNK> kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional <UNK> the scene where he's sitting outside the compound shows this albeit the decision for two slow mo <UNK> <UNK> from the moment br br this is not a classic sf movie in the way that <UNK> alien silent running <UNK> run or <UNK> were however it is unfortunately the nearest i've seen to it in a long time br br he changes in the movie to a believable degree he <UNK> crack arnie one liners he <UNK> become snake <UNK> and there is no <UNK> happy ending br br that's why this film <UNK> do well it <UNK> follow formula and among a 18 25 year old target american audience that's unforgivable as it was <UNK> what they expected to see br br fear and discipline br br always
<START> there is not a single sympathetic character in this entire movie is it the lawyer played by kenneth branagh that we're supposed to be pulling for well let's see we learn he's a <UNK> defense attorney who gets criminals off on <UNK> he treats his <UNK> like cattle gets them involved in his own personal crisis in the process getting one of them killed <UNK> the safety of his kids threatens his ex wife's new boyfriend tries to strong arm the police and school <UNK> and all this for what because he was thinking with his little head i was really pulling for the father and his gang to beat the <UNK> out of the lawyer and <UNK> him in the swamp it would have made for a far more satisfying ending
<START> to all the reviewers on this page i would have to say this movie is worth seeing so it was made in 1972 so what the fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time people who didn't study culture of the decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball compared to the modern series left behind ' which is made for our time right now it does look <UNK> however the only <UNK> part of the movie is the fashion which again was over 30 years in the past but the message that is sent in this film is very powerful and carefully <UNK> there is just so much to say but i refuse to say it for fear of spoiling it so go out and see this film if you don't like the message that it sends then you have issues that need some attention
<START> i still can't believe that wes craven was responsible for this piece of crap this movie is worse than deadly friend the plot is stupid the acting is mediocre and the film is deadly dull i don't know why wes craven hates his debut last house on the left an absolute masterpiece of the genre and likes probably this turkey don't get me wrong i really like some of his movies but it was a real torture sitting and watching this
<START> an ok flick set in mexico about a hit man scott glenn who <UNK> a ride with struggling american writer and his mexican girlfriend after a hit he pays them to take him to the border  but things get out of hand br br it starts well enough but quickly struggles and dies br br spoiler br br the eventual relationship twist is badly set up and difficult to believe an absence of passion and essentially no reasoning behind her leaving one man for the other made it ridiculous and the ending was predictable and dull br br end spoiler br br harvey keitel is the us agent on the hit man's trail but he seems a little confused as to how boring and slow the script is
<START> la <UNK> y la <UNK> is a symbolic spain film everything that in this film occurs has a symbolic meaning it is totally different to the usual movie that one has access br br this film is good but it will be good only for the people who want look for the meaning of everything in the film's tale i must advice that this is not a <UNK> film br br please enjoy
<START> sisters in law is made by the same directors of the rather curiously fascinating <UNK> iranian <UNK> which was as exactly as it stated as we got a glimpse of divorce court in iran now they've turned their attention to the court system in <UNK> africa what's great about this court is that 2 of the <UNK> are women which is unusual for such a country like this anyways they deal with plenty of men used to getting their way around the women but this film is remarkable in the fact that it appears that women has made great <UNK> in society with divorce legal and women's rights being recognized so the judges often <UNK> the men for behaving in a primitive way in these times not to say that the women who appear at the court get the <UNK> treatment one of the prime focuses of the film is a case of child abuse done by an aunt the judges waste no time in <UNK> out at the woman with fury and who said that justice isn't served anymore with these 2 behind the <UNK> they often carry out maximum <UNK> ya you go girl
<START> in where the sidewalk ends otto preminger <UNK> dana andrews and gene tierney surely in hopes of <UNK> the magic of his laura but they're wildly <UNK> films set in different <UNK> of new york not to mention at opposite <UNK> of the noir universe a fine <UNK> of the gothic <UNK> over the <UNK> manhattan of laura with its erotic obsession and faint <UNK> of <UNK> where the sidewalk ends is pure urban <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> a town of basement apartments steam rooms and parking <UNK> br br but it's every bit as fine a movie as its <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in the <UNK> noir laura by contrast one of the <UNK> of films from 1944 which the french first dubbed noir ' was still very much a sophisticated murder mystery daylight enters only on very temporary <UNK> and director of photography joseph <UNK> makes the most of the <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> and the el this is quintessential big city specifically big apple noir like several others from the <UNK> crop of 1950 like side street and sleeping city and the <UNK> stranger and edge of doom br br as the movie opens police detective dana andrews is on the carpet for his brutal ways particularly his <UNK> towards crime boss gary <UNK> whom we learn was set up in business by <UNK> <UNK> do well father when an out of <UNK> is stabbed to death at a floating crap game <UNK> by <UNK> the hair trigger andrews <UNK> up a witness causing him a fatal crack to the skull <UNK> by a steel plate <UNK> in the <UNK> head realizing that his <UNK> already on the line andrews <UNK> the body in the river after making it look like the suspect had taken a <UNK> br br of course that's far from an end to it the corpse is discovered his estranged wife turns out to be tierney and all the evidence starts to turn toward her father tom <UNK> a hack driver who happened not only to have been <UNK> the same mean streets the night of the murder but to have ample reason to want his abusive son in law dead but the <UNK> loner andrews finds in tierney a <UNK> to his better nature he tries to <UNK> her father while still keeping his own involvement in the whole <UNK> business a secret br br not so <UNK> as laura the script for where the sidewalk ends by ben <UNK> shows a <UNK> of its own in a second dressing down his superior tells andrews look at you all <UNK> up like a <UNK> <UNK> br br but while laura spread its attention over half a dozen characters here andrews is all but the sole focus even <UNK> role is far less central than her half <UNK> laura and andrews may never have <UNK> his performance here it's tight <UNK> and <UNK> but never more <UNK> than when his face is <UNK> <UNK> the anguish to which his own <UNK> has brought him he's a <UNK> up <UNK> who can find release only through the safety <UNK> of violence he even <UNK> out against his loyal partner bert freed to be sure he finds too swift a road to redemption though the agency of his beautiful co star but that was the style of the times and a <UNK> up ending does little to <UNK> this new york story of violence corruption and urban <UNK>
<START> are you kidding me a show <UNK> someone who opens <UNK> and <UNK> for a meal how talented do you have to be to do this she may be able to cook but it is not portrayed in this half hour stomach <UNK> painful production i know she has a martha stewart esquire empire so does warren <UNK> but i don't see him with fake <UNK> opening <UNK> of cream corn and <UNK> br br she has a nephew named <UNK> <UNK> stop talking about anyone a name that stupid br br more time is spent on table <UNK> than actual cooking who has that kind of time <UNK> should be on your <UNK> not on my tv this show should be on cartoon network not food network
<START> the star of this film is the screenplay attention to detail for the period in dress language social <UNK> we don't hurt women and the politics are remarkable it is a reminder of <UNK> to day the subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an <UNK> viewer and the choreography of these action sequences is superb perhaps this film is to close to the bone of reality to earn the support it should have received it is like a <UNK> of increasing violence with well paced pauses of peace and <UNK> between each step a great film
<START> let me first state that i enjoy watching bad movies it's funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones this film is bad in a <UNK> <UNK> way this vehicle for sam <UNK> <UNK> ego doesn't just border on talentless <UNK> it has <UNK> the very meaning of the words this should forever be the <UNK> for bad movies sort of the <UNK> line for film mr <UNK> writes directs and stars as blunt object arthur <UNK> battling <UNK> wives and the christian forces of evil as he and his partner ben dead behind the eyes sheets struggle for marital <UNK> as a <UNK> i believe gays should have a right to get married ben arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of <UNK> the portrayal of all things christian are so ugly and ham <UNK> trademark <UNK> that you can't possibly take any of them seriously <UNK> brother victor the bible <UNK> jesus freak is so horribly over the top evil <UNK> gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role that's because sam <UNK> <UNK> was also casting director the worst of it all is sam <UNK> himself when you think leading man do the words <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> come to mind sam also delivers lines like <UNK> pizza cold and usually wrong the final <UNK> you suck at writing directing acting and casting that's the ed wood <UNK> crown <UNK> you horrible little man
<START> ever this is the bottom i am not joking the theater should've had a warning of some kind <UNK> all hope <UNK> who enter <UNK> would've been fitting br br i don't have the words to describe accurately the hell that this movie is its <UNK> stupidity even fails to <UNK> this movie is definitely aimed at some of the slower <UNK> in the <UNK> the story was blatantly stolen from a 10 minute bugs bunny cartoon and then stretched like mr fantastic to 90 excruciatingly painful minutes br br i remember when the <UNK> were funny i guess the <UNK> of hollywood for them to produce produce produce are to blame for the <UNK> that <UNK> out at a consistent rate i'm sad and offended that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of kick in the balls jokes with a thin plot based on a cartoon br br i disliked nearly everything about this movie i won't spoil anything but the baby is actually a midget with marlon <UNK> face poorly <UNK> over the <UNK> body what i did like was the ending not the movie's resolution but the actual end where we all stood up and walked out br br i gave this movie one star but it clearly deserves less i don't feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script is worth a star this does deserve a <UNK> and i pray to god it gets it br br when are people going to learn if you stop paying to see this idiocy they will stop <UNK> it out <UNK> is a reasonable alternative to this film avoid it at all costs you have been warned
<START> i anticipated the release of the film as much as any fan of the broadway play i waited and read reviews for months about the award winning performances i mean with the star power of eddie murphy jamie foxx <UNK> <UNK> danny glover the movie couldn't be less than 4 out of 4 stars right wrong i was definitely disappointed by the finished product the film did not match up to the publicity hype it was given and the only saving <UNK> were eddie murphy <UNK> <UNK> rose and jennifer hudson br br eddie murphy's james <UNK> performance <UNK> the movie just when it hits its multiple <UNK> and jennifer <UNK> performance <UNK> you to pay attention each time she's on screen her performance of and i am telling you was the only time that i felt the hype was deserved you <UNK> as she <UNK> her no good man to let her stay in the group and in his life as many reviewers have stated she steals the movie from the more experienced actors and deserves all the <UNK> she's receiving for this performance <UNK> <UNK> rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedic talent br br jamie foxx and <UNK> <UNK> on the other hand <UNK> through their performances <UNK> acting skills for this film seemed to <UNK> his extraordinary ray performance and <UNK> <UNK> was on an extended fashion photo shoot or video <UNK> posing and <UNK> her way through the movie her performance wasn't strong enough to make you care about her character at any point in the film br br the movie was too hyped 30 minutes and 1 song <UNK> heartfelt solo to jamie foxx too long br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make kevin bacon disappear sadly they stopped there they should have continued to make the script disappear then the silly set and finally every visible element of this film because there's nothing else there to show br br gary thompson and andrew <UNK> are listed as the writing credits for this film i don't really think they exist i think they bought this script at scripts r us where you buy a standard blank monster movie script and just fill in the <UNK> there's a monster stalking us let's split up they actually let's split up in this movie hit alien giant bug monster invisible man with <UNK> not dead yet burn huge rabbit shark invisible man in <UNK> fire not dead yet you know the standard stuff even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie <UNK> glasses <UNK> with something like paint were handled badly br br what is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie they psychological issues for the subject the <UNK> of the mind due to the process treating an invisible subject and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been far more interesting had there been any desire to save kevin bacon in the end it would have been a much better movie all in all it <UNK> br br i would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie but i don't want to do any spoilers suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they don't think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than
<START> 15 years ago power rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations especially that of the youth when i was a 3 year old kid living in the <UNK> i would watch this show every friday on <UNK> <UNK> channel 2 over there when the movie came out in 1995 it was all shock and awe to me when i watched it with my dad and 2 <UNK> my grandparents even sent me a <UNK> box full of power rangers stuff including the easy to build <UNK> figure and the stuffed toys of the rangers i even played the video games and loved only one of them <UNK> fighting edition which was really sad anyway it was the show that set a stepping stone on my interest on robot series especially anime <UNK> series like gundam now that i'm 18 i'd like to think this show is pretty cheesy to me now to prove this i took a trip down memory lane by buying a 2 set dvd collection with <UNK> the movie and <UNK> a power rangers movie and watched both of them i was like ugh how awful just another junk in the attic for me for all of you people of my generation this is not a show that you'd want to watch over and over again i'm not saying to leave it behind for the rest of your life but occasionally is not a bad thing now is it instead of power rangers i'd recommend something like mobile fighter g gundam highly recommended ninja <UNK> <UNK> aka ninja robots or even the original <UNK> shows that were the basis of power rangers
<START> i bought this a while ago but somehow neglected to watch it until last night i do like juliette lewis although i'm indifferent to brad pitt after this viewing i have to admit he's a perfectly fine actor his character was entirely believable and i didn't think brad pitt at all br br unfortunately i can't say the same for david duchovny i'm an x files fan and i had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie as i'd thought it was made a few years later i like duchovny but found his character a little two dimensional here except where he's doing voice overs that part was strong seemed in character good <UNK> etc otherwise i kept thinking agent <UNK> which is a pity br br michelle forbes was a treat why haven't i noticed her before i'll be looking up to see what other roles she's done and seeing those <UNK> i am slightly concerned about stereotyping re lewis this film and natural born killers a firm favourite interesting though to see a contrast of characters in <UNK> she's a willing <UNK> whereas here she <UNK> the violence and tries very hard not to acknowledge <UNK> dark side until it's thrust in her face br br i enjoyed this film almost <UNK> apart from <UNK> character not seeming fully formed and perhaps being washed out somewhat by <UNK> it was perfect i was also pleased with the ending glad that the innocent heroes did not die yet they had to suffer first it was realistic tense disturbing br br if you like <UNK> you may well like this movie and vice versa
<START> the premise of the movie has been explained and if you've gotten this far you don't me to pretend that i'm a movie critic with that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low i'm a fan of takashi miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with <UNK> 2 and 3 and some others many br br the movie seems to get a free pass because it is a takashi film and nothing takashi does can be wrong this is a <UNK> approach to cinema for the rest of us we'll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying and yes this does take away from the film the pace of the film almost reaching levels of <UNK> and the acting well hmmm br br if one is a takashi fan you'll see it regardless to peak your interests it lacks any originality see the <UNK> story or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one br br as it has been pointed out this is the first film miike has been credited with co writing but that doesn't mean much as non of what we'd hope would be miike's personality would <UNK> over into the screen all we get are some of the token miike shots <UNK> the director of photography br br the movie had the potential to be something great the premise is not a difficult one to run wild with but this one seemed to have been run into the ground br br my suggestion is if you're just getting into miike is go with some of the standards like <UNK> <UNK> and audition then movie into his works like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rainy dog bird people of china
<START> vampires sexy guys guns and some blood who could ask for more moon child delivers it all in one nicely <UNK> flick gackt is the innocent sho who befriends a vampire <UNK> hyde their relationship grows with time but as sho ages <UNK> <UNK> breaks his heart it doesn't help that they both fall in love with the same woman the special effects are pretty good considering the small budget it's a touching story <UNK> with human emotions you will laugh cry laugh then cry some more even if you are not a fan of their music see this film it works great as a stand alone vampire movie br br 9 out of 10
<START> i looked forward to seeing this movie when it came out since i was a huge snl fan when my boyfriend and i went to see it the people coming out of the early show were yelling don't waste your money but of course we had to find out for ourselves br br while there were a few funny bits laser <UNK> 2000 root boy slim most of it felt like it could have been severely edited down to an amusing 1 hour show it was pretty bad br br when the opera singer came on many people got up and walked out this made me laugh because i realized that <UNK> was just <UNK> people's buttons on purpose with this movie or else he was just insane whatever you don't need to waste your time watching it it's that bad
<START> i saw this film at the toronto international film festival i loved this and not just for the obvious reasons <UNK> is a documentary about a group of blind <UNK> teenagers who attempt to climb one of <UNK> <UNK> sister peaks now this kind of thing is usually a can't miss inspirational moving pretty standard right and even if the film were just that i'd still have liked it but it was so much more blind herself german <UNK> <UNK> established a school for blind children in <UNK> in a culture that sees <UNK> as a curse as evidence that a person did bad things in a previous life many of the children at the school have been <UNK> their whole lives and at best are a burden to their families as part of their education <UNK> shares with them the story of american <UNK> <UNK> the first blind person to reach the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> she sends him a letter <UNK> him to come and visit her students instead he comes up with a plan he'll <UNK> an expedition for them to climb 23 000 foot <UNK> <UNK> and provide all the <UNK> and equipment <UNK> finds six willing participants and this is when the fun starts br br <UNK> team are mostly american mostly male and mostly <UNK> as experienced <UNK> they're type a personalities very <UNK> ho and goal oriented <UNK> is european female and blind and the students for her are more than a project no matter how well <UNK> additionally the students are <UNK> and not old enough or confident enough to always stand up for themselves as the expedition unfolds they become <UNK> in between the two adult sides wanting to please both while at the same time wanting to gain the confidence that comes from accomplishment as an additional <UNK> other than being blind that is they are speaking english as a second or in most cases a third language and struggle to understand and make themselves understood br br when it turns out that none of the students have any climbing experience and that some are much more <UNK> than others it begins to unravel <UNK> original plan for them all to reach the <UNK> together as both students and teachers begin to suffer the effects of high <UNK> decisions must be made as to whether to continue on or to send some down the mountain among the effects of high <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> and you can see how this <UNK> the conflict between the adults at the risk of <UNK> on one side are those for whom the destination is all and on the other are those who just want to enjoy the journey i won't tell you how it all turns out except to say that this was one of the most surprising and thought provoking stories i've seen in a long time br br the film also weaves bits of each <UNK> story into the narrative and this was sorely needed since once on the climb the kids tended to keep their heads down and their mouths shut with all the drama going on around them that wasn't surprising the <UNK> are by turns charming and heartbreaking and i found it very strange that i found myself closer to tears at the beginning of the film than at the end this was contrary to my expectations and another pleasant surprise br br in addition to all the human drama to cover director walker and her small crew had to <UNK> with the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> conditions herself <UNK> equipment up the mountains and hoping it wouldn't break down as with all great documentaries the filmmaker was just lucky enough or smart enough or prepared enough to be at the right place at the right time and she's captured a very special story that has as much to say about people who want to do what's best for the kids as it does about the kids themselves
<START> now my friends films like la <UNK> aka the beast or o <UNK> only can be done in the old continent in this film we see all horses dirty sex <UNK> kind off gorilla non sense dialogs etc etc etc in the serious terms now its an allegory that men sometimes could be <UNK> visceral and brutal <UNK> <UNK> the director shows us the loss of innocence sexual violence rape and brutality its a astonishing cinematic experience bizarre and full of grotesque scenes for all fans of european shocking exploitation i recommend this film if you like this one i recommend <UNK> against the invisible man and <UNK> states
<START> this <UNK> guy is a real genius the movie is of excellent quality and both entertaining and <UNK> br br i didn't know what a weather girl was before i learned it here
<START> but i got over it to me it seemed that even the author of the book <UNK> caroline i felt so sorry for the character louise and she was constantly compared with <UNK> who was evil i just felt the comparison was a bit harsh and un realistic really though the movie was bad i wouldn't really see it unless you're ready for a big let down
<START> truly terrible pretentious endless film director <UNK> seems to be <UNK> with the pretty face and figure of his actress <UNK> and who can blame him but maybe just maybe he should have focused his attention a little more on making a good engaging film i hate it when a sex film poses as an art film just to become more respectable the frequent occasionally hot sex scenes are the only reason for this movie's existence whether or not they are worth sitting through the rest of the picture is strictly a matter of taste
<START> the premise while not quite ludicrous was definitely ridiculous what should have occurred by the second encounter with <UNK> was that <UNK> should simply be wasted house hires some guy and de <UNK> <UNK> in real life <UNK> would have been <UNK> up for <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> episode would have been exposed in court providing motive and opportunity and the <UNK> lawyers would have made <UNK> out of <UNK> and the particular department he worked for he would be in prison as would anyone <UNK> in the <UNK> of house chase <UNK> cameron wilson and <UNK> the <UNK> would have won house a tasty <UNK> enough to keep him <UNK> with <UNK> well into his old age while <UNK> would wind up somewhere driving a cab trying to <UNK> himself by doing good for people for two years before people <UNK> to the fact that they'd seen it all before
<START> this very strange movie is unlike anything made in the west at the time with its <UNK> emotions and net of visions dreams and startling images its effect is both beautiful and unsettling the actors are choreographed more like dance than acting it contains the only dream sequence i know of that actually resembles a real nightmare sorry <UNK> fans
<START> what can be said really the tenant is a first class thriller <UNK> with equal amounts of suspense and full blown paranoia it's an <UNK> plotted film every detail seems included for a reason even though the plot seldom makes sense and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable <UNK> polanski a meek polish man who has <UNK> an apartment due to the previous <UNK> suicide to guide us through a world of <UNK> fear and <UNK> after an apartment warming party thrown by a group of obnoxious <UNK> <UNK> comes under <UNK> seemingly inexplicable <UNK> by the fellow <UNK> in his building the rest of the film chronicles his mental <UNK> and gives us a <UNK> <UNK> k on par with the later efforts of david lynch the tenant however is more brooding and sinister laced with unexpected comic relief fine performances and a truly haunting score it's a movie that's better experienced than described so hop to it
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> fantasy movie using circa 1979 ideas of what <UNK> <UNK> romance for 13 year old girls script pacing and direction are uniformly awful action sequences defy belief characters speak with the <UNK> <UNK> one usually finds in films aimed at the under 10 set but also includes multiple sexual references involving <UNK> character as well as graphic deaths br br the movie wants to be a comedy on some level but is never funny an adventure picture but plot and action are insipid and a children's movie but introduces <UNK> and child rape as real possibilities it also wants to be a buddy picture a coming of age picture a ghost movie an indian spiritual movie a <UNK> and a western the overall affect is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist <UNK> <UNK> is a complete waste of time unless you want to see a good many terrific shots of the grand canyon that it manages to do just fine
<START> this is not a good movie too preachy in parts and the story line was sub par the 3d was ok but not superb i almost fell asleep in this movie br br the story is about 3 young flies that want to have adventure and follow up on it the characters are lacking i truly do not care about these characters and feel that there was nothing to keep an adult interested pixar this is not br br i would have liked to see more special 3d effects also i <UNK> like to see more fly jokes than the mom constantly saying lord of the flies pretty sexist in showing the women as house wives and <UNK>
<START> the story behind this movie is very interesting and in general the plot is not so bad but the details writing directing continuity pacing action sequences stunts and use of cg all <UNK> and spoil the film br br first off action sequences they are all quite <UNK> most consist of someone standing up and getting shot making no attempt to run fight dodge or whatever even though they have all the time in the world the sequences just seem bland for something made in 2004 br br the cg features very nicely rendered and animated effects but they come off looking cheap because of how they are used br br pacing everything happens too quickly for example <UNK> is trained to fight in a couple of hours and from the start can do back <UNK> etc why is she so <UNK> none of this is explained in the movie as <UNK> she wouldn't have needed to be able to do back <UNK> maybe she couldn't since she had wings br br also we have sequences like a woman getting run over by a car and getting up and just wandering off into a deserted room with a sink and mirror and then stabbing herself in the throat all for no apparent reason and without any of the <UNK> really caring that she just got hit by a car and then felt the secondary effects of another exploding car are you okay asks the driver yes i'm fine she says <UNK> and <UNK> br br i watched it all though because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting but in the end the poor execution made me wish for anything else blade vampire hunter d even that movie with vampires where jackie chan was comic relief because they managed to suspend my disbelief but this just made me want to shake the director awake and give the writer a good talking to
<START> stylish moody innovative revenge driven bloodbath also cheesy of course and <UNK> very cheesy it reminded me a lot of the big heat because it has the revenge plot set off by the exact same event and the girl comes around to the good guy's side because of the same bad behavior by the bad guy it's sad there's no gloria <UNK> but so fantastic that it's <UNK> <UNK> and not glenn ford could there be anyone as beautiful as <UNK> going around in a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> yet he's totally tough and icy cool no one nowadays can touch him though someone like jude law could try i guess hard for any girl to look good with him the music was funky and perfect and there were several excellent car chases and those aren't generally my cup of tea especially one willy <UNK> one in the woods people also met their <UNK> in creative and bloody fashion for instance in a <UNK> <UNK> but beyond the cheese the overall atmosphere was affecting and expertly pulled off more creativity excitement and <UNK> in that forgotten movie than most of what i've seen lately
<START> i had heard and read so many good things about <UNK> that i was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable series like <UNK> sopranos or mad men but that slowly <UNK> away with each episode i watched from season one didn't make it past the first six episodes br br the writing was unoriginal contrived and the portrayal of blacks embarrassing the dialog felt forced like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip it was a rare moment when i actually <UNK> an <UNK> laugh br br the characters never developed enough for me to care about them they were selfish and unappealing i absolutely hated the addition of the brother in law who should have been <UNK> away on to catch a predator and the <UNK> of the <UNK> daughter quinn from the cast by sending her to <UNK> school in mexico was so unoriginal and cliché i had to conclude the writers were testing the viewer's loyalty br br episode after episode i liked the characters less and couldn't get past many of the technical flaws in the story line br br add to that i heard that season two wasn't as good so i lost all motivation to continue to watch this play out br br if you're a fan of good casting and writing i suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like unless of course you're stoned and then all <UNK> are off
<START> <UNK> i think that line was from the old movie posters br br this is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the <UNK> here's a tip any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading in the future is going to be fun this means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you br br in this case in the future means that instead of fighting wars nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine well that's never terribly clear but it's probably something really important there are good guys obviously <UNK> i e us and bad guys <UNK> and there are big stop motion robots br br sadly the effects budget was pretty slim so we don't get to see a lot of the big robots there are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes and then a big space fight near the end the space fight is especially nice as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget br br with said money now spent the climactic fight <UNK> into and i'm not making this up two guys hitting each other with sticks i can always get a laugh in a bar by re <UNK> the final scene complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads br br like i said it's dumb that's why i bought the tape
