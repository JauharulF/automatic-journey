<START> <UNK> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the <UNK> for the film is better than the film itself my girlfriend and i watched it this past weekend and we only continued to watch it in the hopes that it would get better it didn't br br the picture quality is poor it looks like it was shot on video and transferred to film the lighting is not great which makes it harder to read the actors' facial expressions the acting itself was cheesy but i guess it's acceptable for yet another teenage horror flick the sound was a huge problem sometimes you have to <UNK> the video because the sound is unclear and or <UNK> br br it holds no real merit of it's own trying to ride on the <UNK> of sleepy hollow don't bother with this one
<START> along with in the army this ranks as one of <UNK> <UNK> best movies if there is such a thing while the whole west coast meets <UNK> culture clash isn't anything new this film proves to make the story a little more entertaining with the wild and unpredictable antics of a then fresh shore while the change in values probably would have gone in the other direction the whole concept was rather entertaining not only was <UNK> interaction with the family hilarious it also had carla and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she'll always have the <UNK> in my book in two ravishing and early roles one of those films i have no problem watching when it is on tv
<START> i've tried watching it twice though i haven't been able to make through either episode for me it's basically just not funny i can tell where i'm suppose to laugh but i can't i've never seen the original so i'm not comparing i also love comedies including off the wall comedies like married with children and family guy but this show just <UNK> do it for me the jokes are lame and flat and the acting is mostly annoying the commercials made it look interesting but it isn't they're trying too hard to be different and <UNK> to force the humor that style usually doesn't work too well i don't think this show finishes the season of course i could be wrong
<START> i was prepared for a bad movie and a bad movie it is so i guess i shouldn't complain <UNK> tom gay poster boy robert has so many issues he doesn't know if he's coming or going i wouldn't have stayed but for the pretty girls serious anna no nonsense angie emma sarah as the star of the movie within the movie and then there's <UNK> soul mate wild eyed <UNK> <UNK> she reminds me of <UNK> <UNK> and gina <UNK> if you've got to remember these are fine memories she looks good even in the most ridiculous outfits and i mean ridiculous even by berlin standards i wonder whether i'd have liked this movie when i was the characters' age my guess is i wouldn't watch out for indie <UNK> and max of der marie performing as street musicians feeling no pain
<START> this is fairly typical for the sci fi channel one dimensional characters a ridiculous plot and terrible special effects we've got some alien <UNK> puppets loose on a train and lou diamond phillips does his best with what little he's given to <UNK> out a performance and save the day everyone else in this is utterly <UNK> the ex wife who goes through the time <UNK> cliché of first <UNK> lou then of course comes to love him again at the end the obnoxious state senator who gets <UNK> early on and a <UNK> of dull security guards who run around a lot then there's an <UNK> terrorist who is in this movie for absolutely no reason whatsoever except to provide us with 3 more running around he spends the whole middle part of the movie hiding in a box br br the special effects really deserve their own paragraph we start with a <UNK> that flies through the air <UNK> flames behind it at about 100 miles per hour according to the physics of this movie if you <UNK> the posted speed limit in your car atmospheric <UNK> may cause you to burst into flames then it lands on the hood of a car coming in sort of like a ball landing on a floor i guess it really doesn't damage the car much just <UNK> up the hood a little bit later on lou gets in a helicopter and goes chasing after the train even though the train only had a two minute head start it takes a good half hour to catch it the cgi is so bad that the helicopter looks like it's as big as the hills it's flying over then it flies into the side of a mountain this effect must be seen to be believed it looks like they took a jar of <UNK> and threw it against a wall then <UNK> the flame effect over the helicopter about 10 times too big no wonder the helicopter couldn't pull up in time it was carrying five tons of <UNK> then the <UNK> terrorist eventually blows himself up but instead of exploding in all directions like most explosions do he explodes <UNK> like a cannon aimed into the air then there's the whole deal with not being able to stop the train because that would allow the little aliens to get off but it appears that the aliens can actually fly faster than the train is traveling so why this would keep them on the train i have no idea br br overall if you've got a couple of hours that absolutely need killing and it's down to this movie or reruns on the food network well come to think of it some of those <UNK> are kind of cute usually these movies have at least one or two things about them that make it possible to sit through them maybe there's a sexy girl some t a or a character that actually has some personality or some suspense or well something i really didn't see any of that here
<START> normally i would applaud a movie that tries to do something different or original in a genre it is obvious that this movie is some sort of parody on ninja movies and i really did my best to enjoy the movie but i just couldn't the jokes aren't funny enough i've seen my share of japanese movies and most of the times i like and understand the humor used in those movies red shadow is just silly the characters that are portrayed in this movie know that this isn't a serious movie and show that all is about the fun look at the characters from parodies like hot shots or scary movie everything they do on the screen is done with a straight face and never fall out of character and because of this certain scenes become funny and hilarious in red shadow the actors never achieve that the shadow supposed to be very skilled and deadly sadly the actors don't do their best in convincing us of their talents they don't do things with a straight face the jokes would have worked better if they did the bad choreography of the action scenes also damaged the viewing experience for me i like humor in martial arts movies as long as the action is good red shadow just fails in that department so what is left to be enjoyed well the music <UNK> was uplifting it had to be as the action it self never is exciting and there are some short dramatic scenes that are good but simple the use of humor lack of story and depth make me think that this movie is meant for children but i do wonder if children actually would like this movie waste of time
<START> trite and <UNK> the one liners almost made me cry my 4 year old left the room and ended up doing a puzzle i don't know what age group this was written for but the writer himself herself didn't even want credit as for the song it's mildly amusing at least it was a decade ago there are many christmas movies to watch although i've seen some many more times than this they are still enjoyable whenever this comes on i try to encourage my child to watch something else one positive note that allowed a vote of 2 instead of 1 is that it encourages good moral values that would have been <UNK> if anyone were watching
<START> this is truly abysmal i just got a copy of disco <UNK> from outer space after hearing good things about it and i have to say this was just so incredibly unfunny and bad it will leave you <UNK> and <UNK> how this ever got made br br i mean what was it is it that this is typical late 70's humor i don't think so this is just so bad and believe me i don't mean so bad it's good either this is a collection of extremely unfunny skits as if you are watching cable tv sure enough this was an hbo program and to think this may have been considered groundbreaking is scary br br there is one somewhat pretty girl in it and there is some old <UNK> footage of the ny <UNK> hockey team which is fun to see even though i am a <UNK> ny rangers fan but they even mess that up as they try to get some humor out of two hockey players <UNK> on the ice as if they are dancing and even worse reverse the <UNK> of two hockey players fighting to make it look like they are having sex oh how funny in one slight bit of <UNK> there is an interview a hockey player named <UNK> who resembles ny <UNK> <UNK> but they even blow this by having him wear a rangers jersey well maybe that was intentional who knows br br the bottom line is disco <UNK> is just so blatantly horrible so unbelievably bad you will definitely feel cheated after watching this and wasting almost an hour of your life you'll wonder what possibly made the makers of this garbage think they had something funny here and you'll also wonder why these skits can't even come close to the worst saturday night night <UNK> incredible just incredible
<START> i kept watching it because it seemed like the plot was going somewhere when it <UNK> got there i was very disappointed i'm going to tell you what really happened in the next sentence but maybe i won't maybe i'll just imply something will happen the writers lacked any imagination this is not even a b movie it's a made for tv b movie
<START> it´s a joke right lynch could not get produced this as a tv show he was out of money so what to do well he received somehow some dollars and completed the pilot and created this mess by just mixing everything together how can anybody see a failed pilot for tv as an cinematic masterpiece br br and now everybody is guessing about the deeper meaning well wake up there is none like in that other tv series by lynch what was the name again same <UNK> there build up a mystery and then come up with nothing i guess lynch will repeat this concept until people will realise the emperor has no clothes br br in germany there is a comedian called he dressed up as an opera singer and performed some new art songs singing complete nonsense like this br br the wolf the <UNK> on the <UNK> br br it´s a classic now br br anyway afterwards he discussed it with the audience and they were talking seriously about the deeper meaning of the wolf <UNK> relationship br br you people giving this movie a rating of 8 0 in imdb com you people could be one of them br br so <UNK> say it all together br br 0 10 <UNK> j connor
<START> one of the worst shows of all time the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and <UNK> for the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible <UNK> the bad ass girl who are these actors never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show the stories were as unbelievable as the actors lame would be the best way to describe it somehow this show makes a slug like ice t more believable as a cop and he wrote the worst song about cops ever recorded
<START> yes i know that this movie is meant as a comedy and the humor is over the top but the theme about people getting less intelligent in future time might not be so far fetched i cannot say that it will happen but if we don't take proper care of our educational system than this could be a possibility i have noticed that some schools aren't teaching facts anymore like history <UNK> basic stuff the focus is more on learning practical abilities the theory behind most subjects may be boring but is essential in understanding how things work in the movie there is this ridiculous example of people growing <UNK> with in <UNK> of water well we can laugh about it but if you never been taught that water contains <UNK> necessary for plants to grow so how would you know to me this is a scary notion so now you understand why this subject isn't funny anymore it could be that mike judge is making fun but at the same time is warning people for a real disaster if education doesn't improve fast am i taking this movie too seriously yes of course to each his own fun i loved mike <UNK> work <UNK> and <UNK> and office space in these he was able to be critical and funny at the same time in <UNK> i missed this most of the events are too absurd and as i said earlier very scary i do think if you are in the mood you will like this movie
<START> just watched on this early experimental short film directed by william vance and orson welles yes you read that right orson welles years before he gained fame for <UNK> the war of the worlds and his feature debut citizen kane welles was a 19 year old just finding his <UNK> besides vance and welles another player here was one virginia nicholson who would become first wife she plays a woman who keeps sitting on something that rocks back and forth courtesy of an african american servant paul <UNK> in <UNK> during this time a man welles keeps passing her by courtesy of the scene constantly repeating i won't reveal any more except to say how interesting the silent images were as they jump cut constantly that's not to say this was any good but it was fascinating to watch even with the guitar score by larry added in the 2005 print i watched worth a look for welles <UNK> and anyone with a taste of the avant garde
<START> hey guys and girls don't ever rent or may god <UNK> buy this piece of garbage i have rarely seen a film in any genre as bad as this one the acting is actually worse than me and my friends did when we were 7 and in the 1 grade had to act in front of all parents and siblings in fact we would have been taken up to <UNK> for the oscars if we were to be compared to the actors in <UNK> the story is terrible the makeup is terrible the filming is terrible the set is terrible the directing is terrible etc i can't actually find anything worth the money spent to see this film maybe except all the cats which my girlfriend thought were kind of cute please use your money on other things than on this film i couldn't even see the last 15 20 minutes of the film it was that terrible if anyone really liked this film i would really like to hear from you and i will try to see if i can get you some <UNK> at a <UNK> office near you br br 0 out of 10 actually below if possible not worth the dvd or tape it is on
<START> fans of the pink <UNK> naked gun or get smart will certainly enjoy this farce that won one <UNK> and was nominated for four more br br jean is agent <UNK> <UNK> a man who wouldn't know a clue if it hit him upside the head he is also a reflection of the <UNK> attitude <UNK> of the west br br all of the russian spies nazis and muslim <UNK> around him are just as stupid but there is and the princess to keep things interesting br br <UNK> uncanny ability to pick up languages play musical <UNK> the first time he picks them up and sing like a native are all more impressive than <UNK> tricks but he is still stupid
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br former new orleans homicide cop jack jean claude van damme is re assigned to <UNK> a small but violent town in mexico to help the police there with their efforts to stop a major heroin <UNK> operation into their town the <UNK> turn out to be ex military lead by former commander benjamin meyers stephen lord otherwise known as from east <UNK> who is using a special method he learned in afghanistan to fight off his opponents but jack has a more personal reason for taking him down that draws the two men into an explosive final showdown where only one will walk away alive br br after until death van damme appeared to be on a high showing he could make the best straight to video films in the action market while that was a far more drama oriented film with the shepherd he has returned to the high kicking no <UNK> action that first made him famous and has sadly produced his worst film since <UNK> it's nowhere near as bad as that film but what i said still stands br br a dull predictable film with very little in the way of any exciting action what little there is mainly consists of some limp fight scenes trying to look cool and trendy with some cheap <UNK> mo <UNK> up effects added to them that sadly instead make them look more desperate being a mexican set film director <UNK> <UNK> has tried to give the film a robert rodriguez <UNK> sort of feel but this only adds to the desperation br br <UNK> gives a particularly uninspired performance and given he's never been a robert de niro sort of actor that can't be good as the villain lord shouldn't expect to leave the <UNK> anytime soon he gets little dialogue at the beginning as he struggles to <UNK> an american accent but gets mysteriously better towards the end all the supporting cast are equally bland and do nothing to raise the films spirits at all br br this is one shepherd that's <UNK> right from the flock
<START> i agree with what so many others have said about the shallow and offensive nature of this film's examination of racism it is <UNK> to me that so many people seem to have been fooled by its <UNK> i want to comment on the matt dillon character as an example of what's most <UNK> about this movie here we have a man who <UNK> with the film's underlying message that we're all a little racist effectively rapes a woman in public <UNK> <UNK> her husband and deliberately <UNK> him to make a move that as he well knows will lead to his arrest or even death he does all this after pulling the couple over without any legal cause but because as we come to understand they are black and wealthy and he is a hurt little boy who is now the police and can therefore do as he <UNK> this behavior is not a little racist this behavior is evil it is disturbing to me that this extreme of racism is held up next to another character's behavior <UNK> her paranoid stereotypes about gang violence to illustrate that everybody's a little racist later we're <UNK> fed some tripe about <UNK> poor old dad and how black folks drove him into the poor house is this supposed to explain or worse excuse this behavior and is <UNK> character meant to redeem himself by committing the utterly <UNK> and unbelievable laughably <UNK> act of saving the woman he sexually <UNK> the very night before please the fact that so many people seem to feel some kind of self <UNK> admiration for this film makes me feel sad about the <UNK> of our understanding of racism and our apparent lack of commitment to <UNK> and ending it
<START> racing <UNK> <UNK> as tommy callahan <UNK> drinks and suffers <UNK> while <UNK> feelings for <UNK> brunette <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> madsen and blonde <UNK> diane <UNK> as annie <UNK> <UNK> matters are ms <UNK> race car boyfriend warren as eddie <UNK> and her father jan murray as pete madsen who encourages the reckless drivers cow eyed performance is sometimes enjoyable however her drunken driving scene is unnerving thunder alley provides <UNK> more <UNK> excitement than its predecessor <UNK> 500 1966 be warned it isn't much a wild party scene featuring some mild strip <UNK> is the film's low highlight
<START> hell to pay is a bit bloody for my taste even though it is no worse than many films nevertheless i did enjoy the parade of seasoned stars and the western scenery all but the story line was very weak and i couldn't really see the point of it all however the music that <UNK> the movie more than makes up for the lackluster film br br where did the guys <UNK> <UNK> who wrote this music come from they are awesome from the moment the music begins it is by far better than anything i've heard in years i think it may be the best i've ever heard even though i wasn't thrilled with the action taking place on the film the music <UNK> the exact emotion that was needed for each scene i was transported in time to the old west during the opening credits and really felt like i was re living those old days through the music br br this movie is definitely worth a purchase and a viewing for the beautiful music and a trip down memory lane to see the old western stars once again
<START> eugene <UNK> 4 and a half hour <UNK> play brought to the screen in less than two hours the <UNK> combination of symbolic dialogue and gothic melodrama hasn't aged very well and the cast has some difficulty with it especially norma <UNK> nina and ralph <UNK> <UNK> clark gable as ned <UNK> comes off better but mostly because his is a gruff character not given to the philosophical <UNK> of the others which better fits <UNK> range once the plot <UNK> down to the love and the audience <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> the film does become more enjoyable the technique used here for the <UNK> is another problem on stage the action <UNK> while the actors spoke their thoughts to the audience here they're done as <UNK> you'd think that would work better but since the action no longer <UNK> the actors are forced to pause speaking and <UNK> at the camera to match the emotions in their thoughts plus it's difficult for any movie buff to watch this film and not think of <UNK> <UNK> hilarious parody version in animal <UNK> added to these <UNK> are some cuts made for censorship reasons <UNK> <UNK> is soft <UNK> and there is no mention of her getting the abortion that is more central in the play and a wretched score uncredited that sounds like background music to a turn of the century <UNK> o'neill called this film a dreadful <UNK> of attempted and idiotic censorship and although strange <UNK> is nowhere near as great as his later the <UNK> and long day's journey into night it certainly deserved better than this
<START> in my opinion this is the best oliver stone flick probably more because of influence than anything else <UNK> stuff full of dread from the first moment to its dark ending
<START> some movies are not for everyone this accurately describes movie shame at only 18 i still have what i guess you could call a minor form of add and well i watch movies to be entertained shame was a movie with a very interesting premise of trying to convey the effect of war on the common people it however fell short of <UNK> this for me i don't know if it was the subtitles black and white filming length of the movie or the fact that it took two hours out of my studying for a huge chemistry test but i did not enjoy it i understand it is considered a great movie and very important in the history of cinema however i think as my teacher pointed out not everyone has liked or likes it i guess i just wish it finished all of its many side plots maybe the translation lost something but i felt there were <UNK> little off shoots that never met a conclusion you would meet characters and never see them again or really understand why they were included in the movie my overall recommendation for this movie is that it's worth seeing but only to form your own opinion on it whether or not you like or dislike it it is necessary to respect the point that it is trying to convey
<START> this is a perfectly watchable adventurous movie to watch with a great cast and a good story based on true events br br it's interesting to note that the story of the movie is based on true events it's above all for most part an adventurous story with all of the usual ingredients you would expect from an adventurous movies set in an <UNK> world so lots of sword fighting good old fashioned honor religion and a rich proud country but the movie is also filled with humor to make the movie a light and pleasant one to watch br br the constant cutting back and forth between the <UNK> plot involving sean connery and <UNK> <UNK> and the american plot line involving theodore <UNK> brian keith wasn't the best possible approach in my opinion the two things have totally different <UNK> totally different characters it are just totally different worlds of course both story lines are connected and focuses on the same thing but the contrast between the two worlds is just too big to let it work out it doesn't at all times make the movie feel connected and a bit disjointed the american plot line is most of the time more political while the plot line is purely adventurous and action filled in the end you could perhaps even wonder what the whole point or <UNK> in this movie was seem that john <UNK> is just a big admirer of him often the american plot line would take away most of the pace out of the far more interesting and more action filled fast paced plot line after all john <UNK> always has been at his best as an action director br br it isn't until <UNK> way through that the movie fully gets on steam the most and largest <UNK> action of the movie then kicks in especially the large scale end battle does not disappoint i wish the entire movie was like this that way this movie would had also been a better known one no doubt br br the movie has a great jerry <UNK> musical score that is perhaps way better known than the actual movie itself the movie is also a good looking one with great production design and nice looking action and battle sequences in it <UNK> the movie only costs 4 000 000 to make but that is really hard to believe considering the settings and size of the movie i mean john <UNK> his best known movie conan the barbarian cost about 20 000 000 to make but was a far more campy looking one and was less impressive on its scale br br quite funny to see an <UNK> speak with a big fat scottish accent but hey it's sean connery so you just simply tend to accept this he suits his role well so does <UNK> <UNK> it's always hard for a female character to come across as believable and work out in a movie such as this one but she manages also john huston plays a great role in this movie br br a perfectly fine watchable movie br br 7 10
<START> this is a pretty good documentary i'm not a <UNK> i don't particularly like <UNK> or <UNK> culture but somehow for about 2 hours this movie made me interested in the subject br br i wouldn't call it the most intriguing film of all time but for some reason when those guys were talking about how they started their <UNK> <UNK> and were <UNK> in those empty southern california <UNK> i was interested br br i should also add that the music in this film was pretty good too i don't sit around yearning to hear more 70s rock bands but it seemed appropriate for what they were talking about
<START> what makes this movie so damn bad is it the lame sub par juvenile humor could it be the horrid trendy suck ass music perhaps the uninspired go nowhere story or maybe even the fact that <UNK> <UNK> gives her worst acting performance ever and to add insult to injury keeps all her clothes on throughout the length of this steaming turd <UNK> regardless no matter what the reason this film sucks the fact remains that it really really does i have never wished i could be watching a movie with dean cameron in it instead of what i was watching in my life but <UNK> school is a masterpiece of comic genius compared to this travesty br br my grade f br br eye candy <UNK> buffy tyler and suzanne all <UNK> their tits br br where i saw it <UNK> on demand
<START> i am a usually a very generous <UNK> on imdb and don't bother commenting on movies i did not like but this was just lame i actually turned it off 15 minutes before finishing it to watch this is it because my <UNK> wanted to i just chose the lesser of two <UNK> br br if you want to watch this movie picture this film as a collection of worse than average horror stories like scary short stories that you find in an issue of <UNK> <UNK> in the waiting room of your <UNK> br br i did not expect anything particular terrifying or funny i am not the i want to see blood type of person but this movie is neither horror nor comedy nor entertaining in any other way br br it's probably more scary funny and entertaining to look at the movie poster of you've got mail for 90 minutes while drinking tea br br conclusion a horror comedy for people between 4 and 7
<START> so i decided to watch the entire puppet master series and had just watched parts 1 3 which i thought were all excellent they had a unique charm to them and a certain intelligence that i really appreciated about a year ago i even saw puppet master vs demonic toys which of course was bad but still a terrific guilty pleasure and fun to watch br br from the very beginning of this film i knew it was in trouble the cheesy power rangers style egyptian skull villain who watches the puppets <UNK> through his <UNK> glass came straight out of left field all of the <UNK> to this franchise in this story were completely absurd suddenly we have a grand assortment of all kinds of new and random characters and plots that are a far cry from the first three films i seriously doubt that when the first puppet master was being penned the writers had visions of someday seeing an egyptian power rangers villain <UNK> monsters annoying twenty somethings who seriously can't act and are supposed to be brilliant scientists but never say anything intelligent and a lame puppet who's head can <UNK> into the ghost of <UNK> br br another thing that greatly disappointed me in this film was that it completely ignores what happened in the last entry part ii since iii was a prequel suddenly the puppets are back at <UNK> bay <UNK> back in their case minus blade and <UNK> for some reason is willing to help his puppets again he betrays them in part ii for his love of elsa this isn't explained at all and so with that and all of this other junk thrown in i was no longer amused br br i'm a huge fan of ridiculous b movies a <UNK> if you will i even collect laser <UNK> of rare b movies you can't find on dvd and so it takes a lot for me to say that this was one of the most absurd movies i have ever seen in my life i still love those puppets the original ones blade <UNK> <UNK> and the rest and if they had only stuck with what they had rather than trying to fix something that wasn't broken well the series might still be alive and in good health that being said even though the reviews aren't so great i'm really interested in checking out puppet master retro sounds like an interesting one that pays great tribute to the original themes
<START> decent action scenes but the movie is <UNK> with a slow convoluted storyline nearly non existent dialogue that leads to minimal character development and a seriously horrible storyline br br did i mention that the storyline made no sense but in its defense the action scenes were impressive enough even if they leave you scratching your head as to why they just happened br br there's not much else to say about the movie it's a slick mindless action adventure that makes no sense whatsoever it's like watching a worse version of the matrix and skipping all the storyline and dialogue
<START> no one is going to mistake the for a good movie but it sure is a memorable one once you've taken in myrna <UNK> performance as the hot blooded gypsy girl you're not likely to forget the experience when this film was made the <UNK> beautiful miss loy was still being cast as foreign <UNK> often asian and usually sinister she's certainly an <UNK> here it appears that her skin was <UNK> and her hair was <UNK> in most scenes she's <UNK> and wearing little more than a <UNK> and a loose fitting <UNK> <UNK> while in one scene she wears nothing but a <UNK> <UNK> i suppose i'm focusing on miss <UNK> appearance because she is by far the best if not the only reason to tune in to this <UNK> <UNK> and to keep watching you sure won't be attracted by the dialogue which is hopeless in one typical passage <UNK> out the window at the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> poetic always the <UNK> they sing weird and sad when the big sun have breath of fire that burn and when the pale moon look from behind cloud and breathe air cold as death they sing poetic or what lovers of purple <UNK> will have a field day i can't help but wonder though if in her later years miss loy preferred not to recall her involvement with this project br br like so many early <UNK> this one was an adaptation of a recent broadway success the stage version opened at the street theatre in november of <UNK> and ran for over a year the play <UNK> a famous episode involving the <UNK> and theater critic robert who was known to have an <UNK> to characters who spoke in thick <UNK> or <UNK> english according to a much repeated <UNK> mr <UNK> <UNK> through the opening portion of this show the spanish village setting moved to a village in <UNK> for the movie for some reason gave the actors <UNK> to practice their accents with varying degrees of success but <UNK> patience reached its limit when during a family dinner sequence a door burst open and an actress dressed as a gypsy girl <UNK> into the room shouting help help he <UNK> me she then threw herself at the feet of the mistress of the household and <UNK> me me good girl me stay here at that point mr rose and announced to his companion me bobby me bad boy me go now and left the theater br br the film version offers numerous examples of <UNK> humor but never comes close to <UNK> level of wit the melodramatic plot concerns the <UNK> family father <UNK> mother maria and son paul a student at the nearby college we would consider this <UNK> family upper middle class as they are <UNK> with servants and all the <UNK> of life but their comfortable existence is abruptly thrown into turmoil when a gypsy <UNK> arrives in the village and their home is <UNK> by yes the <UNK> gypsy girl she arrives at their door during the storm of the title <UNK> <UNK> emotions i <UNK> the girl is fleeing an abusive relationship and begs for <UNK> after considering the matter the <UNK> family agrees to hide her from her angry lover who shows up shortly afterward but is turned away becomes a servant in the household kindness <UNK> the family's decision to take her in but soon enough that conniving little good for nothing has paid them back by <UNK> every able <UNK> male in the <UNK> starting with the servant peter then working her way up to son paul breaks up paul's relationship with his fiancé <UNK> played by loretta young still a teenager causes him to <UNK> out of school and then <UNK> him to buy her jewelry by stealing the <UNK> of the family's maid lena <UNK> <UNK> lena for her part is still mourning the loss of her own fiancé peter <UNK> and tossed aside by when she turned her <UNK> to paul ultimately sets her sights on the <UNK> and i suppose if the running time had been longer she also would've gone after uncle dani maria the village priest and god knows who else br br i guess it goes without saying that a scenario like this one easily lends itself to parody but during its first half the nonetheless <UNK> the <UNK> fascination of a daytime soap we watch <UNK> as the bad girl works her spell on the men folk and <UNK> havoc like an irresistible force of nature almost like a storm ah <UNK> another metaphor but as the plot <UNK> <UNK> on the campy fun fades during the later scenes is de <UNK> and the focus switches to the dysfunctional dynamics of the <UNK> family and after awhile these people get to be a real drag the son in particular behaves like an absolute <UNK> yet the parents never acknowledge this or face up to their own shortcomings everything we're told is the fault of that no good tramp br br the men of the cast are dull aside from miss loy the only actress who can handle performing in <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> terrific as usual the mother of the <UNK> household is played by alice <UNK> a longtime silent star who was out of her element with speaking roles and who retired soon after this loretta <UNK> fresh <UNK> provides a nice contrast to <UNK> <UNK> but her line <UNK> are so awkward it's kind of endearing no there's only one reason to watch this flick and that's herself i can't think of another actress who could've played this silly role and managed to come off half as well i'm not an objective <UNK> however i have a desperate crush on myrna loy and will watch her in anything even the
<START> i can't think of anything i repeat anything positive about this movie the whole 1 hour 45 minute movie could be <UNK> into a short 5 minute movie in most scenes there is absolutely nothing going on and it seems just the camera was left on recording on purpose only to increase the time of the movie all you see is someone in the background walking around or watching tv with no specific subject or even talk what so ever i just feel i've wasted <UNK> minutes of my my family's and my <UNK> weekend for nothing if a movie is poorly made or the scenario isn't great that's whole another story at least it leaves you something to discuss about but about distant i just have to call it a movie because it was motion pictures recorded by a camera br br if you haven't seen it imagine a <UNK> min long movie based on two three lines of story what will you end up with 5 of content and 95 of <UNK> that's exactly how distant was at least for us actors did a great job acting roles that had nothing special in them they barely talked or showed any special emotions i picked up this movie in the comedy section of a store relying on what i read on the back of its cover i'm still wondering what was funny in it other than our face after watching the movie
<START> the movie was slow the dialogue between actors actresses felt flat and basically there was no development of the characters in the story br br omar <UNK> <UNK> around with a mad look on his face the entire time <UNK> and basically looking annoyed with everybody danes has no on screen magic and <UNK> character is a that nobody would want to hang out with even if they were paid to do so br br throw in the weird scene where <UNK> has to dance with an old man and you have what quite possibly could be the worst movie in cinema history br br i watched it on satellite thank goodness i didn't pay for it and wished i hadn't br br do yourself a favor and go sort your underwear and <UNK> <UNK> if you need something to do but are tempted to watch this movie when if it comes on your tv awful movie if you ask me and i generally have something good to say about just about any movie out there
<START> one of warner brothers best and highest <UNK> films during the thirties was this charming family drama about a widower who lives with his maiden sister raising four daughters but not four every day type daughters all of them have been trained by their musician father on <UNK> and one as a singer they do make some beautiful music together even if it is for the long haired set br br you can watch the <UNK> variety of roles that claude <UNK> played over the years and still marvel as he shows you yet another aspect of his creative personality the <UNK> <UNK> captain in casablanca is as different as the scientist gone mad in the invisible man as the patient and wise job in mr all the same man and all so incredibly different br br here he raises the four girls with love seasoned with a little at their <UNK> to accept modern music the lane sisters and <UNK> page may know <UNK> but they're <UNK> cats as well and can beat daddy eight to the bar every time and if <UNK> gets a bit too <UNK> than aunt may <UNK> can put him in his place br br with four daughters <UNK> at the time you know that's going to change all the sisters develop romantic interests in dick <UNK> frank <UNK> jeffrey <UNK> and john garfield of course the <UNK> process does get a bit complicated and one of the sisters suffers a tragedy but it does promise to work out as the film ends br br four daughters is also known as the debut film of john garfield other than a tiny bit part in <UNK> parade years earlier garfield had no other film roles but he'd been acclaimed on the new york stage for his performance in golden boy and warner brothers signed him and found the perfect film debut role as the cynical musician who just can't quite get a decent break in life it earned him a best supporting actor nomination in 1938 but he lost to walter brennan for kentucky br br this film was so popular that it practically <UNK> a small <UNK> industry for jack warner sequels with cast members like daughters courageous four mothers four wives all <UNK> up at the box office before world war ii and warner brothers remade it with frank sinatra and doris day playing the parts that john garfield and <UNK> lane <UNK> now those two made some beautiful music br br still a timeless mold was created in four daughters and the film holds up 70 years after it was first seen
<START> i love aaron carter but even i expected pop star to be predictable but i was so wrong aaron carter was really funny in it and a great actor also the actress who played jane was a brilliant actress every one who i no who watched it loved it br br the music in it was also really good br br the my favourite lines from the film is you cant send me to a public school mom im a and take your time <UNK> come to you br br although the endings kind of cheesy all the good chick flicks do this film is great and a proper good chick flick that i can watch over and over again
<START> i saw this last night at the <UNK> film fest and holy god was it bad from the script to the editing to the acting to the cinematography none of it worked not to mention the set design costumes were so <UNK> wrong for the time period it <UNK> the years from the late 70s up until 2006 or so even john hurt who's usually an amazing actor was so over the top ridiculous granted <UNK> crisp is an over the top guy to begin with but hurt was given nothing to work with here i don't know much else to say except the audience i saw it with absolutely loved it so maybe it's just me but audiences love anything at film festivals when they're sitting next to the director and all the actors it's not a very accurate test of how good the movie is or how well it will play personally i thought this movie was terrible on the other hand it was so terrible that it was hilarious get drunk and give it a shot when it's on hbo in 2 years if it ever makes it that far
<START> as betty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> secretly watches her <UNK> husband del aaron being murdered by the vengeful charlie and wesley morgan freeman and chris rock her <UNK> sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera in a state of complete denial and <UNK> betty escapes both physically and mentally from her <UNK> small town life to search for dr david greg kinnear the handsome and loving hero of a reason to love a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in los angeles <UNK> to reality betty arrives in l a and becomes nurse betty as she tries to belong in the hospital world of her dream lover meanwhile the <UNK> charlie and wesley track betty down convinced she is a dangerous witness who also knows about their <UNK> <UNK> with del br br nurse betty creates comedy and suspense by <UNK> its main character's extreme innocence and optimism with the evident <UNK> and violence that surround her by clearly defining the <UNK> difficult life nurse betty <UNK> its character's tendency to turn away from reality thus while offering a comment about the popularity of the soap opera within the film nurse betty also makes a comment regarding the <UNK> addiction to television and its celebrities in addition nurse betty benefits from the effective manipulation of its <UNK> mental state particularly in those scenes where she cannot <UNK> between dr david the character and george <UNK> greg kinnear the actor who plays him <UNK> <UNK> to recognize george as an actor leads to funny <UNK> which stress the <UNK> of her <UNK> state however in spite of these <UNK> nurse betty suffers from the <UNK> characterizations through which the narration <UNK> for example while charlie and wesley are consistently portrayed as a comical pair the brutality of their actions <UNK> any sense of appreciation or acceptance the viewer might have initially experienced similarly although the initial scenes establish del as a <UNK> man the <UNK> and violence he experiences with his murderers <UNK> all the <UNK> and violence he caused his wife betty br br finally toward the end of the film charlie <UNK> awkward <UNK> as he develops an obsession for betty an obsession which results in noble feelings of love and which ultimately destroys him consequently since the characters' roles as victims lack <UNK> the story's <UNK> <UNK> seem random and <UNK> all in all nurse <UNK> rather than creating suspense <UNK> its characters and <UNK> its plot br br
<START> my friend and i rented this movie for 3 99 at blockbuster if i'd have known how absolutely horrible this movie was going to be i wouldn't have paid a <UNK> i had no warning for this <UNK> the acting can't even be called acting the inevitable sex scene is awkward and you can tell that both girls feel completely uncomfortable doing it and the male villain god who couldn't tell he was going to attack emily and the musical <UNK> my lord this movie makes me want to cry never rent this in fact if you happen to look upon it <UNK> out your <UNK> this movie isn't of god it's from hell i'm just gonna take the last couple lines to write blah blah blah cause i really don't want to continue on with this review
<START> was really looking forward to seeing a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> but this was total garbage cinematography was terrible shot way too tight was almost viewing the grand canyon through a <UNK> <UNK> editing was cut cut cut not even smooth more like a bad student editor don't know if did the screen play but the dialog was terrible really like val <UNK> portrayal of doc holiday in <UNK> <UNK> but what in heck was he doing with this character in <UNK> moon i have no idea even looked like it was shot on a sound stage using the old bonanza sets how can the director of the original <UNK> <UNK> gone so wrong with this where was his head can't say much for the acting either it's a shame to have messed up such a beautiful western that could have been but more like they rushed this one just to get it in the can have read other reviews and see that others felt the same way not even curious to watch the next few nights cause it would be just a waste of time like the first night was br br 2nd post ok since nothing else was on tv i must be honest and admit that i watched the last 2 nights of <UNK> moon and i will be honest to tell you that i didn't make it to the end of either of the last 2 episodes because i fell asleep i can only admit that i was watching the two main characters very closely and i could pick out some mannerisms that steve did while portraying the character that <UNK> did such an excellent job with so i must give credit for that as for karl portrayal simple dead meat can only say again that i was very disappointed only because i cared so much for the original <UNK> and like others have <UNK> my feelings for a truly great western
<START> i usually really like lawrence and being in australia i haven't seen much of his stand up so when i saw this at my video shop i thought yeah i'll have a look i wish i hadn't seen it now obviously lawrence had a profound experience that opened up his mind and i guess he wants to share this with others but this was neither the time nor the place br br this whole experience seemed like a <UNK> speech in hell it really did i believe the catch phrase of the night was ride it until the <UNK> fall off which he <UNK> with just plain <UNK> jokes revolving around sex and sexual organs br br don't get me wrong i don't mind crude humor but lawrence lacks the gift of <UNK> it up in the fashion of eddie murphy richard prior or robin williams lawrence was just plain <UNK> the only time i laughed was when he <UNK> his experience with the law and his <UNK> in the hospital if there were minus points i would give them
<START> this film took up three hours including commercials on the history international channel last night but it felt like three weeks it wasn't the cheap <UNK> and unintentionally funny depictions of the bombing of <UNK> it wasn't that the film is stripped of almost all context surrounding world war ii it wasn't even that the bombing itself was often made to appear as nothing more than a major <UNK> for a goofy love story no it was the wooden <UNK> characterizations that sucked the life out of the story oh and the fact that if it is possible for a movie to be <UNK> then <UNK> is that movie perhaps a better title would have been <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> would have experienced it br br it is especially the latter point that so <UNK> was the bombing of <UNK> a war crime the makers of this movie believe so but in the typically <UNK> way that germans have come to approach world war ii they can't bring themselves to say so without <UNK> about peace and no more wars anywhere like they're mother <UNK> and also typical of german towards the british in particular there is an <UNK> effort to <UNK> before <UNK> while <UNK> all the guilt for <UNK> on to one person arthur harris br br did i say one person well not quite at the beginning of the movie there is an <UNK> from the leading character anna with whom we are all supposed to sympathize damned americans she screams while watching as far off bombs fall and a few minutes later a radio voice <UNK> <UNK> about the american terror bombing being inflicted upon germans br br note the word terror got that it's really the americans behind the <UNK> <UNK> of german civilians no matter that the american <UNK> for almost all the war in europe was the <UNK> bombing of industrial and war <UNK> sites no matter that it was the british who <UNK> adopted area bombing of <UNK> targets in germany before the germans had themselves even targeted english ones no matter that the americans bombed during the day suffering more <UNK> in the process than the british in order to hit <UNK> targets while the british bombed civilians under the cover of night no matter that the americans essentially were brought into the true terror bombing campaign kicking and screaming against it no matter that most american officials from <UNK> to gen <UNK> opposed <UNK> civilians while <UNK> and his <UNK> couldn't wait to do so br br no in <UNK> both the germans and british except for <UNK> harris are innocent of a <UNK> it is <UNK> created by the evil americans and only the might and power of a love story between a german nurse and a <UNK> british <UNK> pilot can adequately explain the truth of the atrocity right br br oh by the way for the younger and likely less well read readers of imdb the first and still so far only major literary effort to give a thoughtful voice to bombing was the <UNK> novel penned by kurt <UNK> an american <UNK> in <UNK> at the time of the bombing i guess <UNK> couldn't find a pretty nurse for billy <UNK>
<START> <UNK> once described rival composer <UNK> work as having some wonderful moments and some awful quarter hours <UNK> it seems can also be described this way it has many great episodes but in between them are countless filler episodes the entire series consists of about <UNK> episodes of which i'd say at least <UNK> are filler or some sort of subplot i didn't bother to count and i wouldn't be surprised if that number were in fact higher though br br some of these filler episodes are actually quite enjoyable though many are quite silly or dull nonetheless the constant <UNK> start to wear thin after the first few seasons as the plot ends up <UNK> at a <UNK> crawl for most of the series character development too slows down greatly and by the later seasons the cast has become quite resulting in increasingly stale jokes particularly those concerning the monk who's ironic traits start out as mildly humorous but grow tiresome when the jokes associated with them appear repeatedly br br however all of that isn't to say that <UNK> is a bad series it just isn't a great series the way <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for example is generally considered to be as something to watch at the end of a hard day it is nice but it could never be confused with high art
<START> based on a joke once told by jim <UNK> that's what i've read at the end of the closing credits well mr <UNK> gotta have an awful sense of humour then this film is terrible really i loved the first two chapters of the <UNK> party massacre series the third film was quite useless but completely watchable compared to this piece of crap there's not even a <UNK> killer and the plot the acting the characters the locations the events everything is boring absurd and laughable the only good reason to watch this turkey are the girls if this film were a porn i think it would have worked really much better the film lacks gore too the first scene the one in the <UNK> could be <UNK> and the scene with the <UNK> guy knocking at the door lasted one second some moments of slight thrilling can't save a nonexistent plot <UNK> <UNK> johnson seems to be the only real actor here i found him the only bearable character in this movie oh there's a nonsense part with <UNK> stevens who performed linda in the first <UNK> party massacre the police bother her to know more details about the killer but what we get is only some footage from the first film not a dialogue neither a monologue or anything from this still traumatized grown up girl who's forced to revive the worst 30 minutes of her life as she says giving us no clues at all about the murderer br br watch at your own risk
<START> why i disliked the movie apart from the sheer <UNK> of the actors themselves is that someone might actually believe such crap br br first of all the second coming of christ will be at the end of words and when jesus christ will come on judgement day he will not come as he did before in human form he will come in his full glory as god and we shall be judged not only for our sins but also for the consequences of our actions everyone will secondly i have seen the eternal gay pride illustrated in this movie with the all <UNK> i read the bible last night and it's not written anywhere well it is <UNK> <UNK> on 3 different occasions that men who make love to other men or women who make love to each other as if man and wife should be killed because these will never <UNK> the kingdom of god as they are foul if it truly were for us to follow the bible word for word there would be <UNK> now wouldn't there but i think <UNK> people does more harm than this would that was the in the old testament br br there are lots of <UNK> in psychiatric <UNK> who think they are the son of god but to make a movie after it truly makes you think of how many idiots out there can make a movie
<START> i was <UNK> to see this flick before reading the <UNK> reviews and user comments posted here why firstly because mick humour can in my humble opinion be pretty crass and over the top <UNK> by his ill <UNK> of a television show some years back and secondly because good aussie comedy films are sadly as rare as the tiger br br <UNK> mick has restrained his natural comedic <UNK> in this surprisingly watchable movie who would have thought that a <UNK> club would provide the setting for one of the funniest australian films in years the cast is excellent with familiar local old <UNK> all putting in believable performances br br interesting to see john clarke playing the villain in this piece it's a one dimensional part but <UNK> still adds a touch of class as always good to see <UNK> lucy also getting a <UNK> or should i saw <UNK> uniform on the big screen she's a real talent pity a number of her <UNK> were <UNK> her own material is a lot <UNK> interesting character though <UNK> reporter on a local <UNK> how low on the journalist food chain can one get br br <UNK> may not be the funniest film i've seen this year but it's certainly an enjoyable <UNK> well worth a look lots of other people obviously agree with me as it's headed to be the biggest <UNK> australian film this year good to see someone finally make a quirky gentle comedy without trying to <UNK> the laughs like so many australian <UNK> before it br br finally a bit of trivia if you're wondering which aussie rules team mick supports check out the flag on his also look out for his old partner in crime tony martin doing the <UNK> in the final <UNK> scene br br br br
<START> for reasons i cannot begin to <UNK> dr <UNK> cameron george <UNK> begins <UNK> <UNK> blood into his dim witted <UNK> glenn strange the result  is transformed into a hideous as hideous as someone with a bad wig and <UNK> teeth can be killer beast dr cameron uses to get his revenge against those in the scientific community who <UNK> at and <UNK> his ideas and why wouldn't they dr <UNK> <UNK> than a <UNK> br br overall the mad monster is one dull and poorly made poverty row thriller there's really only one positive i can come up with to write about in the mad monster george <UNK> can be fun to watch as he plays the mad scientist about as well as anyone his dr cameron is a regular loony he has no <UNK> about killing he has entire conversations with people who aren't there and as with most mad scientists he <UNK> in god's <UNK> actually i'm not sure anyone <UNK> him of this but it fits but beyond <UNK> there's nothing here to recommend everything else from the monster effects to the supporting cast to the music is plain old bad there are far better examples of poverty row horror from the 1940s than the mad monster
<START> the mayor of hell has the feel of an early dead end kids film but with a much harder edge and very few light spots <UNK> the first appearance of the dead <UNK> by four years james cagney has a full screen opening credit even though technically the of the movie's title is actually portrayed by frankie <UNK> one of several boys sent to <UNK> school during the opening scenes character is jimmy smith a young tough who's <UNK> by <UNK> cagney and is elected to the position when <UNK> takes a chance at <UNK> conditions at a state <UNK> br br warner brothers made a lot of these types of films attempting to provide a conscience of sorts in an era that only too well knew about the effects of crime and poverty this movie is quite gritty with no apologies for ethnic stereotyping as in the <UNK> <UNK> of a black father in court or the way a jewish kid gets to run a candy shop in the <UNK> school the rules at the <UNK> are simple enough work hard and keep your mouth shut step out of line and you answer personally to warden thompson dudley <UNK> br br <UNK> role in the story seems somewhat ambiguous since even though he makes a serious effort to improve conditions inside the <UNK> on the outside he's still <UNK> in control of a criminal <UNK> the film's attempt to <UNK> this <UNK> falls short in my <UNK> the finale attempts to wrap things up in a neat package as <UNK> <UNK> the outcome of a near fatal shooting of one of his henchmen not exactly the kind of role <UNK> one would look for in a film like this br br warner brothers would <UNK> some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake titled crime school featuring <UNK> bogart in the cagney role and billy <UNK> in the frankie <UNK> part if you're partial to the dead end kids you'll probably like the latter film better since it also offers familiar faces like leo <UNK> <UNK> hall bobby jordan and gabriel <UNK> however the ending is somewhat <UNK> in that one too with <UNK> warden character involved in a cover up of a prison <UNK> both films offer a romantic interest for the lead characters in <UNK> evans is a <UNK> minded nurse that falls for <UNK> character br br curiously a lot of james <UNK> early films aren't <UNK> available so you'll have to keep your eyes <UNK> for a screening on turner classics or source the film from a private collector personally i can't get enough of this kind of stuff and find intriguing points of interest in the films of all genres from the thirties and forties
<START> dumb is right tom and jerry reach their goal of a non stop air flight to africa but then worry about mixing in with the natives they put on <UNK> crash the plane try to survive on an airplane wing floating in the ocean and then survive the wild animals once they get on land br br having read a few reviews before seeing this i knew what to expect it was simply these two guys doing their <UNK> and andy <UNK> impressions offensive to blacks of course but that's the 1930s for you some of their lines were funny some were stupid the main fault i had with this cartoon was the audio as it was often not easy to understand what these two guys were saying br br in all a curiosity piece but don't let the racism stop you from checking it out at least it gives you an idea of how times have changed for the better
<START> i'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here first is from the view of if someone sees the movie and never read and may not ever read the book the second is from someone who has br br movie without book from a movie standpoint it was an okay movie nowhere near as good as either of the <UNK> but much better than and i'm not just talking plot line either the visual effects were <UNK> in many of the parts though the wolf transformation was very nice the characters has very little development and vivian didn't even seem to truly care that her love was killing off what was left of her species some of the other characters could have had more air time like the five the plot was way to similar to underworld for my tastes br br movie with book as many have stated other than the title character names and a few minor parts the movie and the book are nothing alike in the movie gabriel was a lot older and was the father of <UNK> thus <UNK> was once his mate in the book <UNK> was about 24 never <UNK> with anyone since wolves mate for life <UNK> is trying to win his affection and <UNK> was the mother of not <UNK> another important thing is the location the book took place in <UNK> also why they moved from west virginia is very different the movie has it being fault and her entire family was killed due to it in the book the original leader of the five named <UNK> killed a girl from their school hunters <UNK> down the wolves and killed many of them father included forcing them to move also mom was a major character br br one thing from the book that would have made the movie better would have been the dance for those who don't know it's the ordeal where all the <UNK> females of the pack fight to see who is the one to be the mate of the new leader since earlier there was a fight for the males vivian won it trying to save her mother from <UNK> who is a horrid evil woman in the book and thus was supposed to mate with <UNK> there was no prophecy anyway if you've read the book and you liked the book i highly suggest not seeing this film
<START> i saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie br br that is something that i have not done since i have never fallen asleep at the movies br br i love the original and have seen it several times and recommend it to everyone this may have been the problem but i do not think so because there were a couple of bright spots that showed if done right they could have made this movie work br br bette was under used and anne was over used and miscast br br i do not know why english or anyone for that matter let this go out in that condition br br they billed this as a sex in the city but better not a chance i liked sex in the city a lot and was disappointed by this movie br br so do not waste your money on this movie go see anything but this
<START> this movie is so unreal french movies like these are just waste of time why watch this movie even i did not know why what the well known sex scene of half siblings although the sex scene is so real and explicit but the story it is based upon is so unreal what is the use of it then can you find easily in life half sibling doing such things br br did i learn something from this movie yeah some people are just so fond of wasting time making such movies such stories such non sense but for those who like <UNK> <UNK> in life or simply a life without hope then there you are you've got to see this movie br br only one worth <UNK> though catherine <UNK> she's such a strikingly beautiful woman
<START> this is one of those films that you watch with a group of people you will have the best time it's really really bad like <UNK> bad but without the quality of <UNK> br br you've got the best mix of bad actors bad director and bad script here everything that can possible be wrong that can make for an entertaining evening you have here the first being the tag line is a bunch of teenagers these people are as much teenagers as my grandmother br br the director has zero sense of suspense or tension the 30 year old teenagers are standing around and the monster comes out and attacks and this pretty much happens throughout the movie when the monsters are revealed there is no suspense building up to this or surprise or anything it's more like when you were kids pretending to be chased by monsters and just kind of made up stuff as you went and when i use the word monsters i <UNK> more like a couple guys in halloween masks bought at the 99 <UNK> store br br there is no doubt this script was <UNK> off in a couple days no <UNK> and i can only imagine how bad and poorly <UNK> it looked on the page because it was clearly written by an amateur with no clue it's another example of one of the bad things about this day and age anyone can make a movie br br but of course the best bad thing about this film is the acting it's as bad as you can get there isn't one person in this who has the slightest skill at acting and the lead is the absolute worst he delivers every line in this <UNK> manner without any expression and you have to wonder how someone this bad could possible get a part in any movie no matter who he knows when he had to cry when his girlfriend was killed it was one of the funniest scenes i've ever seen in a movie watching these people <UNK> some of the awful dialog is very very funny but when the black guy said tell her tell her i love her before his death scene there was a huge laugh among our group funny funny stuff br br my only hope is this movie gets bad enough ratings to take its place where it belongs in the imdb lowest rating 100 movies we can do it folks br br ps is it any surprise that the one great comment this movie got in here was from someone in virginia who has one comment only on this movie and nothing else and guess where the movie was made virginia i've said it before and i'll say it again people who work on the movie should not be allowed to comment on it
<START> hammer house of horror <UNK> time is set in rural england on <UNK> farm where <UNK> musician david winter jon <UNK> lives with his actress wife mary <UNK> gee is currently <UNK> the music for a horror film one night while looking for his dog billy david finds a mysterious woman in his <UNK> calling herself <UNK> patricia quinn she claims to be a witch who has transported herself from 300 years in the past to now obviously rather <UNK> david has a hard time believing her so he locks her in a room in his <UNK> calls his doctor charles ian to come examine her however once he arrives they enter the room <UNK> has disappeared charles puts it down to david drinking too much but over the next few day strange disturbing things begin to happen to david mary br br <UNK> time was episode 1 from the short lived british anthology horror series produced by hammer studios for tv originally aired here in the uk during september 1980 the first of two hammer house of horror episodes to be directed by don <UNK> episode 13 the mark of satan being the other i actually rather liked this as a series hammer house of horror dealt with various different themes were all <UNK> to each other except in name <UNK> watching time is a sinister effective little tale about a witch the script by anthony read benefits from it's slight 50 odd minute duration moves along at a nice pace the character's are pretty good as is the dialogue there are some nice scenes here i liked the way it never quite reveals whether david mary are going crazy or not i think it's a well structured entertaining reasonably creepy horror themed tv show that i enjoyed more than i thought i would br br being made for british tv meant the boys at hammer had a lower budget than usual if that was even possible as such there is no gorgeous period settings here as in their most well know frankenstein dracula films although the contemporary english setting does give it a certain atmosphere that you can relate to a bit more another tv based <UNK> is that the exploitation levels are lower than you might hope for there's some nudity gore but not much although i didn't mind too much as the story here is pretty good it's well made for what it is <UNK> experience on their feature films probably helped make these look pretty good the acting is good as well with genre favourite ian making a bit part appearance br br <UNK> time is a good start to the hammer house of horror series as a 50 minute piece of british tv it's pretty damned good now why don't they make show's like this over here anymore
<START> wow i just have to say this show is super cool i fell in love with the show from the beginning the idea of the show is very original and very <UNK> it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give lauren graham and <UNK> they're simply wonderful i'm especially a big admirer of lauren graham she's not just a pretty face she's a monster of an actress as well i'm not saying that <UNK> isn't a wonderful actress as well i just happen to like lauren better anyway it's a real delight seeing them on screen <UNK> with words in the words of the immortal jim carrey b e a

<START> i have seen it a few times and get completely glued to it every time it is very suspenseful and intense to describe it sounds boring but it is amazing it is the kind of movie where you need can't miss a thing but if you <UNK> it in it sticks with you long after it ends now thinking about it i don't even know what stone was trying to make us see just the story of alan green i don't think so it was a look at ignorance stupidity self <UNK> and a guy just <UNK> his grip maybe he had more grip than the <UNK> though i didn't like barry but still seemed worried about him for some reason i was <UNK> at why i couldn't get him out of my mind when the movie ended i wish i could see inside <UNK> <UNK> mind for this one
<START> to start off i love steven seagal the man is a genius but recent movies leave me to wonder is he trying anymore his latest movies show almost no effort on <UNK> part in out of reach its too obvious that his lines are dubbed over what seagal does in this movie is not only a slap on the face to his fans but even more to jean claude van damme and his fans in the 2nd scene or so when he <UNK> to <UNK> line into the drug dealers <UNK> to steal the <UNK> and money it shows him set up the gun and hook it on a <UNK> sign your might be saying to yourself so what does this have to do with van damme ' well that scene was stolen from a jean claude van damme movie called the order rent both watch both compare both and you will lose respect for seagal not only was today you die garbage but it was dare i say an insult <UNK> <UNK> moves are still good but why isn't he doing great movies like marked for death or above the law hes still got the moves and the attitude i'm just left wondering <UNK> seagal why ' there are such idiotic scenes in his newer movies that have nothing to do with the storyline and such idiotic story lines on top of that i hope the up coming black dawn movie will be another exit wounds or beyond justice because these last chain of movies he made especially today you die really made me wonder if he has the stuff to make more great action movies like double team please don't watch this movie unless you hate seagal if you love his movies don't watch this it will make you question his future in the action film genre
<START> i just saw this movie for the second time with my 8 year old daughter and i remembered why we liked it the first time all these people who say it is bad are too uptight and critical it is simply an entertaining little movie it's not supposed to change the world i thought all the actors did a great job with their characters except for jeremy jordan as guy he was a <UNK> who looked seriously in need of soap and <UNK> if he is supposed to be the hot guy in their school then they've got slim but i <UNK> drew barrymore was delightful as usual and david arquette was even enjoyable and i usually can't stomach him if only because of those stupid at t commercials molly shannon is always entertaining and <UNK> <UNK> did a great job as a tortured brain some parts were actually painful to watch reminding me of high school even though i thankfully didn't get made fun of it made my heart <UNK> for those who do movies like this are actually good for children to see my daughter made several observations about the cruelty of some of the students and how wrong it was this movie is appropriate for anyone and a good way to while away 2 hours if there's ever a time you want to see a lighthearted little movie with a happy ending where you don't have to think very much then this is definitely a consideration
<START> harrison ford plays sergeant dutch van <UNK> of the district of columbia police department he tries to get the bad guys but doesn't do a very good job when we meet up with him he's trying to catch a corrupt undercover officer <UNK> scott thomas plays a new <UNK> senator kay chandler trying to get she's running against a candidate who has plenty of money the last thing she needs is the death of her husband she's a politician she can't be <UNK> down by feelings br br this story moves slowly and painfully i was looking at my watch every five minutes wondering when it would be over the story gets lost in details the director sydney <UNK> didn't need to put in we don't want to know about police <UNK> they throw in some insight to politicians and the <UNK> they do for <UNK> after seeing the movie i'm still wondering why they got involved <UNK> doesn't anybody <UNK> anymore don't you need more than two weeks to even consider going with someone else br br it was good to see actress comedian chicago native and second city <UNK> bonnie hunt her role isn't necessarily comic relief but she was the only one i wanted to see more of do yourself a favor wait for it on video if you want to see it at all
<START> i am so excited that greek is back this season looks really <UNK> im glad that <UNK> is trying to get serious about school but is still involved in the <UNK> its really funny that she wants to go into politics that they're <UNK> her talent ' i loved <UNK> new <UNK> it makes him look more mature they should <UNK> head as well all the guys are hot but <UNK> is definitely the <UNK> i cant wait to see more of him i'm especially interested in what happens between <UNK> adam rusty i also love rebecca she's really pretty i actually think that rebecca <UNK> should hook up go for it <UNK> join my team
<START> i really love action adventure films and this is one of the best of course we love the stars of this genre bruce willis sly stallone clint eastwood kurt russell arnold <UNK> and the rest but its the story that really counts the best are somewhat <UNK> but we can tolerate those that are a little over the top as in the comic book style of action the more twists and turns the more dire situations the heroes are involved in and the more shocking moments in the film the more we action adventure fans enjoy them in the line of fire has all the elements required for a rip roaring action thriller it has clint eastwood as a near retirement secret service agent whose one bad moment of failure <UNK> him it has one of the most evil despicable <UNK> villains in john <UNK> the type in which you can't wait to see him get his due it has <UNK> russo as the <UNK> interest ' it has twists and turns an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor it is extremely well paced by director <UNK> <UNK> and even has a score by the great <UNK> <UNK> this one is a real roller coaster ride of a thriller don't miss it
<START> low budget but still creepy enough to hold your interest in another take off on the familiar frankenstein story this movie is also known as lady frankenstein the <UNK> frankenstein sara bay fresh from medical school arrives at her father's estate to find that he is still up to his old tricks baron frankenstein joseph <UNK> is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to carry on the family tradition by creating herself a lover this is closer to being an eerie melodrama than horror flick supporting cast features mickey <UNK> paul paul <UNK> and herbert a rainy night could <UNK> the atmosphere still a fun watch
<START> well i've enjoy this movie even though sometimes it turns too much to a stereotypical situation i didnt understood at this time if the punishment park has exist in the past but i think the matter <UNK> really here br br you have to look at this movie in a different manner it shows how much violence you can find in our world it reminds us that we live in a world who is lead by violence and that nobody can escape from it if anyone refuse to take his then you will be thrown out of our society all our history is made by wars we should never forget this in fact its only when we will finally accept the truth that maybe we will change and understand that our intellectual skills have improve so we could use them to find others ways to resolve our problems br br in 2 words this movie is a must see maybe it will help us to accept the truth
<START> red <UNK> in his first starring role plays <UNK> <UNK> who plays 'the <UNK> on a radio show he writes the murder mysteries and as 'the <UNK> <UNK> them joseph jones conrad <UNK> is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone he kidnaps <UNK> his girlfriend ann <UNK> and another girlfriend virginia grey he tells <UNK> to write out the perfect murder or his girlfriends get it br br very funny and enjoyable movie fast moving it's only <UNK> minutes a good script and perfect casting really puts this across <UNK> is very good in his first starring role very funny fast handsome and intelligent <UNK> is excellent as the evil jones <UNK> and grey are lots of fun as <UNK> girlfriends all three of them play off each other perfectly their verbal <UNK> is the highlight of this <UNK> also fun to see eve <UNK> in a small role br br well worth your time
<START> this is a film with a lot of potential well done and acted with a rather week and inconsistent script a young woman with two children moves to her mother's <UNK> apartment because the husbands flat on top of the <UNK> where he cuts up stolen cars is <UNK> their son's <UNK> husband ends up in jail when an ex <UNK> stolen car is <UNK> to his shop ex pat ends up being kind generous and naive and rather cardboard and we learn next to nothing of him but ends up with the girl who <UNK> up despite being sexually satisfied only by her husband i expect this film to be successful in czech where it will be welcome due to its obvious premise them ex <UNK> may have money they may even get our women but they're old soft and our women want to be satisfied we may be poor but now if only could keep satisfied so she would not need to play with herself or if he already had an existing family in italy but that would <UNK> things
<START> i love most movies and i'm a big fan of sean bean so i thought that i would at least like this movie also i'm canadian and this is a mostly canadian movie so i was prepared to cut it some serious slack nothing could have prepared me for the garbage that is <UNK> steve <UNK> as an action hero give me a break the acting throughout the movie was so bad i am going to have trouble sleeping tonight i now have only two wishes in my life br br 1 i hope that you never have to sit through this movie 2 i wish i could get those 6 hours back oh wait the movie's under 2 hours it only seemed like 6 hours br br don't watch this seriously
<START> for people who are first <UNK> in film making i think they did an excellent job we have to support the <UNK> industry especially coming from up north it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs it's a feel good film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents the film has just opened i do hope it does well people should support this little film i think this ' person is very bitter about something and getting too shame i say well done to all those a drink on me i look forward to you next venture
<START> directed by jacques <UNK> cat people out of the past night of the demon and written by phillip dunne how green was my valley anne of the <UNK> is a quite interesting adventure pirate movie its main character of captain anne <UNK> is based on a real woman pirate anne who actually lived and <UNK> through 18th <UNK> atlantic br br the film begins with the sea battle where <UNK> jean peters pirate ship attacks a trade ship that was on its way to europe from the south america as a result a treasure of great value is captured along with a handsome french officer pierre la <UNK> louis who is taken prisoner anne ends up falling in love with him and apparently her feelings are <UNK> but it's only till she sets him free when she discovers that he has a beautiful young wife molly debra <UNK> with whom he pretty much in love with anne begins planning revenge on both of them but in an unexpected twist of fate ends up making a great sacrifice in order to save them instead the pirate movie cliché figure of black also makes his appearance here this time played by thomas <UNK> br br though anne of the <UNK> probably appears to be no more nor less than a <UNK> of pirate movie clichés it still has its classical moments in beautiful visuals and sea battle sequences filmed in technicolor as well as in some aspects of the story and most of all in personal touches in directing of all of it by jacques <UNK> 7 10
<START> this film is perfect for over the top cheesy zombie lovers its a film you can laugh at from the acting to the terrible zombie action that being said i gave this a 4 outta 10 for effort <UNK> horror is a hard genre to make going down the list the bad points of this film were as following br br bad make up terrible sound and sound effects really bad continuity cheesy dialogue one song played through the whole film <UNK> couldn't act and in my opinion one of the worst i've seen terrible ending racist moment and stealing <UNK> character named br br the good points good costume police officers seemed to have the best acting <UNK> the actors with less lines or small roles did appear to be better good attempt with gore br br i don't wanna bad mouth the film its funny to watch <UNK> of these bad points and i think thats what makes this film ok if it was any better i don't think it would of made any difference but it wouldn't be interesting to see a remake with all the same cast as i believe they have possibly improved over the last 7 years
<START> this was my first <UNK> <UNK> movie i've watched and i have to say i was shocked i don't mind gore in generally but this isn't even gore it's real <UNK> for some of you a couple of scenes may be impossible to see and i mean really disgusting leaving aside these aspects the main ideas revealed here and the dialog are quite brilliant when you are given a strong argument against bringing a new life into the world and the manner in which it is given you can't stop and take a minute to think about it the actors did their job well representing general masks of a few people found at the bottom of a <UNK> society the movie is full of <UNK> but i'll let you figure them out don't watch it if you want to have a <UNK> relaxing time i recommend this movie to all those of you who want something to think about or simply watch something different of what you find in your average cinema
<START> by far this is the worst halloween movie ever made the acting is bad except for paul rudd and donald <UNK> the girl who played <UNK> forgot her name was ok but overall this movie was basically a big letdown nothing moved the story forward it lacked substance and the scares that made halloween and <UNK> so good all and all skip this movie it's not worth the price of rental
<START> i've seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it br br the conversations between and her mother plus and matthew are very touching the community is shown very <UNK> and as as it usually is br br although certain things could have done with a bit more explanation if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in the first place the scenes following matthew being found in his car would be more understandable br br luckily <UNK> releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understand br br i would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in london and is not longer available to see i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it
<START> i think there's a reason this film never came close to hitting theaters it was probably my neighbors down the street who filmed this movie with their mother's video camera the acting is very amateur this movie is definitely not something you would want to watch unless you were extremely bored the actors even seem to double as directors and crew members with no <UNK> whatsoever should the director s and or actors choose to continue with their <UNK> of making movies i would definitely advise them to brush up on their skills and perhaps take a few ok many classes on film making and acting
<START> well now here's the thing for this movie to work you'll have to accept the following a woman who's murdered is alive again at the end of the movie a detective stops <UNK> the dead woman's fiancée because a newspaper reporter asked him not to and that same reporter smitten by a good looking blonde <UNK> into night court for suspicious behavior winds up getting married to her in exchange for the judge letting her off the hook are you following me on this i can't tell you how many times i <UNK> and <UNK> the picture to repeat scenes that just didn't make any sense in the end the blonde <UNK> <UNK> and the reporter richard <UNK> remained married but i have no idea how they came to that decision in fact i can't figure out how the film maker came to the decision to make this flick oh i suppose there's some entertainment value here for just the sheer nonsense of it all but it would have been nice if even a couple of the pieces fit still i'm not ready to add this one to my top ten worst list i think that night club scene with the <UNK> ladies might have saved it but why was it in the movie i just don't know
<START> i read the book before watching the movie and it left me emotionally <UNK> but i felt that it truly transported me to afghanistan a culture i know very little about i had great hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint i watched this with someone who didn't read the book and he also enjoyed it they had to <UNK> some things in the movie but it was a well acted and well shot film it leaves you thinking about the movie long after it is over you feel for the characters and their <UNK> i highly recommend this movie to those who like emotionally <UNK> drama and want to experience <UNK> culture there are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch it is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life under a <UNK> regime
<START> i was laughing so hard most of the time i had people glaring at me because they couldn't hear over my laughter i literally fell out of my seat at a specific point br br i'm a bartender and <UNK> for a living in the real world note my use of the term real world sadly it always has to come first and whenever i tell someone i play it's usually followed by one of two questions 1 what like d d i played that back in junior high br br 2 really i've been looking or a group forever have room for another very rarely do people not know what d d and <UNK> are br br that having been said almost every person who watches this movie can get something out of it even if you aren't a <UNK> chances are there is something in your life you geek out about that can be made fun of in a light hearted way and that alone means you can relate to the <UNK> in this flick it's just light hearted happiness in an hour and a half
<START> yes <UNK> and coburn are great and it's interesting to watch them although coburn seems rather restrained and dull here it's enjoyable to view seattle victoria and salt lake city of 1970's and the period cars and clothing that's all the good in this boring film the dialog is incredibly bad as is most of the acting ray and <UNK> motivations seem forced and unlikely i've seen this training to be a <UNK> routine several times before there's a long build up leading to nothing better to catch an episode of streets of san francisco or one of the many great crime caper movies to name a few there are <UNK> story remade as dirty rotten <UNK> the <UNK> hill mob the <UNK> paper moon the <UNK> and best of all house of games
<START> if you value your life in any way shape or form you will do yourself a courtesy and pass by this seemingly interesting movie on the dvd rack br br i know what you're thinking i saw the preview and it looked great however <UNK> beware i fell into the same trap one of my friends expressed certain <UNK> to watching this movie but i forced her to sit it out oh how i regret that decision br br like most horror movies the movie starts out <UNK> in a sunny mexican resort where two couples are <UNK> to an ancient <UNK> ruin by a fellow resort goer upon arrival they are disturbed by the appearance of two jungle people who are all but oblivious to their <UNK> shouts as if this isn't ominous enough the tour group casts aside large plant growth and declares an <UNK> path consumed by <UNK> a perfect route to their destination i guess it wouldn't be much of a movie if they <UNK> rational decision making and turned around just then but well this wasn't much of a movie anyways br br after some <UNK> the the resort goer brought a friend stumble upon the ruins and at once their doubts are <UNK> by its beauty and history that is until frantic <UNK> people emerge from the jungle armed with a vengeance for no reason in particular shouting in an <UNK> language since when are brutal verbal <UNK> <UNK> by calm <UNK> language don't ask me but nonetheless the cast tries anyway to no <UNK> obviously suddenly the sixth trail member <UNK> is <UNK> with several from the <UNK> and all hell breaks loose a <UNK> finishes the job and the horrified <UNK> <UNK> quickly up the ruin br br now if there was ever a plot to this movie it ended here the introduction took at most 20 minutes and it was unfortunately the best 20 minutes of the movie on top of the ruins the now realizes they are stranded by murderous locals and proceed to make countless good decisions one of them being to use a <UNK> rope to lower one of their members into the <UNK> of the ruin needless to say the <UNK> is seriously hurt and then trapped within the ruins and the two girlfriends are <UNK> injured trying to rescue him br br the rest of the movie continues with no real horror only only blood and gore as displayed when one girl <UNK> a plant growing within her out <UNK> of blood and then again when <UNK> legs are cut off only to have the same <UNK> from within the girl <UNK> him later br br my only <UNK> in this movie were <UNK> the very attractive <UNK> tucker playing jeff mcintire grow increasingly more <UNK> and <UNK> and sitting long enough to <UNK> that almost all of the cast dies a horrible gruesome death their <UNK> pain seems an adequate <UNK> for the time suck that was this movie br br supposedly the storyline goes that the ruin is an ancient house of of dangerous spirits with an evil flesh eating plant to ward off and <UNK> unlucky <UNK> unfortunately i got no such warning from screaming <UNK> plants and the only evil thing relating to this movie that i am truly horrified by is the script writer
<START> the scientist charles and his wife or assistant <UNK> receive some objects and a skull from an ancient indian cemetery and while cleaning a <UNK> they are attacked and murdered by a mysterious being the <UNK> man then a military squad <UNK> by captain <UNK> michael <UNK> seeks out two groups of four soldiers each that <UNK> in the jungle they face the <UNK> man shooting him while he kills each soldier then the <UNK> man goes to a power plant and captain <UNK> explodes the facility destroying the supernatural being br br i bought <UNK> man on dvd expecting to see a funny trash but i found an awfully boring annoying and senseless crap with shoots and explosions the <UNK> story is totally <UNK> and does not make any sense and the military team is composed of <UNK> <UNK> in shooting the supernatural <UNK> man until they are totally slaughtered their leader is also the most stupid with the blow up of an entire facility in the end to destroy the supernatural rip off of the <UNK> warrior predator on dvd it is possible to use the fast forward button along the movie and <UNK> the suffering of the viewer my vote is two br br title brazil <UNK> man
<START> this is an excellent film full of complexity themes and great dialogue the characters are well drawn with phil the biggest loser of all time br br adam character is the most vicious thing i've seen on screen since alec <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> hitler in <UNK> the last ten days ' br br i just wish they'd all got away with it but without giving too much away there are some situations you just cannot lie your way out of
<START> <UNK> shines as <UNK> the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strictly <UNK> family her brother david is so <UNK> by their father that it's a surprise he's able even to tie his shoes rather than asking dad to do it for him br br other reviewers have already <UNK> the plot so i won't rehash it i will however point out that <UNK> who is pregnant by david is also married to him this is not an out of <UNK> <UNK> which would have been horrific by <UNK> standards the two are secretly married but father having been paid by david's father tears up their marriage <UNK> br br death scene with <UNK> in <UNK> is a truly heart <UNK> experience and highly charged with emotion this scene alone is worth watching the movie for but there's far more to the plot than that why on earth aren't modern movies made with the same attention to the story
<START> this movie was one of the worst i've ever seen it did not left out a single one could imagine about a hollywood so called thriller the protagonist is a loving father a private investigator who is engaged in a special task finding out if a suspected snuff movie is real br br certainly he <UNK> involved deeper deeper run by <UNK> sex theatres are his field of investigation as he's searching for the murderers of the woman in the snuff movie <UNK> by a smart he read a book employee he's catching up with a murderous bondage film producer and his personal <UNK> who are responsible for the film and what do you expect they are portrayed as the simple evil no need for explanations backgrounds history they are the bad ones and he's the boom killer of the killers end of film is it that bad yes i'm afraid so br br ironically machine the mega <UNK> who did the killing is even pointing at his ridiculous character in the last scene our hero forces machine to put off his leather mask yep of course he's wearing one and <UNK> that machine looks just like the normal <UNK> 15 guy from the street then machine says <UNK> i'm not a monster my parents never abused me i had a nice childhood i just love to do what i do br br i just love to kill people yeah sure everybody loves killing people <UNK> it's not only the total lack of character what made this film so boring it's also it's ugly i have to kill these people attitude which makes you sick in one scene our hero has tied up one of the killers and tries to shoot him but he can't so what does he do he calls the mother of the killed woman says that her child is killed and asks her whether she loved her child so much that she wishes to see the killers dead the mother cries yes she'd love her child he goes back to the tied killer and <UNK> him br br to come to the point this film is breathing the foul air of supporters certainly the police does not play any role in it in a ridiculous form against pornography does not take it's characters serious and wastes your time with a stupid plot probably the only good thing about this film is that it does not try to pseudo psycho analyze even that would be too much plot br br don't waste your time with this br br
<START> it's a shame barry <UNK> infamous sir les <UNK> character had it's film debut in this under <UNK> spy comedy br br this film reminded me of the beatty hoffman stinker <UNK> 1987 <UNK> should have learned from the mistakes that film made if your going to change <UNK> on a concept don't use spies like <UNK> the first 20 minutes or so offer a promise of something different it would have been great to see the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> around in the world of australian politics one of characters even point out that <UNK> is of date with the current times you'd think could of had a field day making commentary on the hawke government i can just picture a scene with <UNK> and in a drinking contest but instead of a film that might of been clever and even a biting look into that world we get <UNK> running around the world as james bond trying to save the world from bio chemical weapons that runs out of steam before the half way mark br br disappointing
<START> excellent drama about 2 <UNK> spoiled <UNK> who go <UNK> of the federal government each for his own reasons one a <UNK> just wants to score some bucks for his next fix but the other has a far more sinister agenda <UNK> in part by a <UNK> of his father good performances and a hot script makes this a winner
<START> as a long time resident of western <UNK> i have an intimate knowledge of this topic and found it to be so <UNK> captured on film kudos to the producers of this epic and what a great legacy to the school children for years to come br br the attention to detail and realistic depiction of this complicated web of events make it a one of a kind production br br viewers will find themselves <UNK> by the storyline and captivated by the storytelling br br <UNK> greene is magnificent as the <UNK> br br bravo
<START> the <UNK> 2 out of 10 blair witch meets the cave and gives me a headache br br i have something to ask all film schools could you please teach future directors how to hold a camera steady <UNK> the camera around like aunt betty with 12 drinks is headache inducing br br also film is primarily a visual medium directors may want to point their <UNK> in the general direction of the action film also requires light to work perhaps a light source should be employed so one can see the action on the screen i know it is a cave movie but there is absolutely nothing frightening about watching pitch <UNK> for minutes at a time br br for that matter showing the film upside down doesn't indicate confusion on screen it <UNK> confusion in the editing booth br br a last note to the director i'm sure there was a good reason to have a horribly fake cgi <UNK> i honestly can't for the life of me think of one br br now on to the screenwriter try to make at least one character likable i'd prefer two or more but one decent person i can root for or care about might help also if you are going to have flashbacks make them relevant to the story br br if you are going to have a surprise ending it is probably best if it doesn't <UNK> every single thing that comes before it and try adding some fancy <UNK> terms to a cave movie you might have wanted to start with <UNK> br br the <UNK> is a pretty bad film poorly shot with a confusing improbable and <UNK> ending
<START> after i saw this i <UNK> that it was most likely a chick flick afterward i found out that <UNK> mother wrote the screenplay so that pretty much confirmed it however a chick flick can have some appeal to men this one does not and really seems not to appeal that well either to women looking at the dismal box office <UNK> one item that i believe both <UNK> agree upon is the stupidity of the the scene in the movie <UNK> an <UNK> is made between the pain of <UNK> to the pain of a <UNK> being <UNK> w o <UNK> though men do not <UNK> the pain of <UNK> we understand that it is a painful process yet it is a natural pain whereas an <UNK> certainly is not women understand this even better i suspect some woman was trying to make a feminist statement that is in poor taste in fact a lot of things in this movie are in very poor taste though movies nowadays are known for having poor taste this one really excels in that department this could have been a good movie that shows the struggles of dylan thomas during wwii and how strong the sentiment was against men who somehow managed to avoid serving in the military then <UNK> screen writing mother tries to show how this sentiment was used against dylan but really <UNK> this instead we get a chick flick about how two young mothers bond together sort of in a way perhaps somehow of note is the fact that a soldier the husband of the friend of <UNK> wife is sent back home after serving in combat yet it is unclear if the war has ended a lot of things about this movie are similarly unclear and though i have stated that already i will do so again as it seems to be the central <UNK> of this mess
<START> great subject matter director and cast somehow adds up to a truly abysmal film told in that flat semi documentary style that was so popular around the time this film was made and hello this is not a film noir the lackluster overly complicated over populated story has no arc no focus point little excitement and <UNK> from one scene to the next with no discernible purpose other than as a valentine to the supposed and highly <UNK> <UNK> between the american and mexican <UNK> on the issue of illegal <UNK> br br the scene that made me hate this film is when <UNK> and mitchell make a daring escape from their <UNK> race to presumably save injured partner from being murdered by a <UNK> with a gun driving a piece of farm <UNK> <UNK> says something like quick we must try to save him but instead of doing so they lie on their <UNK> and watch in agony for about 5 minutes of screen time as the machine bears down on murphy and finally runs him over or so we assume the machine simply stops another <UNK> <UNK> the presence of the two <UNK> and shoots at them as they run off again scene over the whole thing is so horribly filmed and utterly <UNK> there's nothing worse than a protagonist ostensibly <UNK> though he's off screen for over half the film who doesn't even try <UNK> <UNK> do something br br i know it's anthony mann but hell not all of his films are classics people how bad does an old movie have to be around here to get anything lower than a 6 rating
<START> okay i'm sorry to the cast and crew for this review but this movie is by far the worst i've seen yet first off the acting was okay it could of been better especially in some parts but it was okay then there was the <UNK> video camera which they used the violence was pretty good if it were paced faster it would be awesome but they didn't sigh scares the scares were well written in the script but not well done for instance spoiler here in the <UNK> a girl is half way in it and the other half is in the dark bottom area of the <UNK> house then she gets it the monster <UNK> her down and then you hear <UNK> guts getting ripped out the scares could have been better if the music wasn't ripped from a cheap horror sounds cd the blood effects were pretty good but the blood was like that of kill bill k b pulled it off because it was meant to resemble old kung fu movies but when the crew can't tell the difference between red and pink it's sad the ripped up bodies in the movie were good but the scarecrow costumes were something you would see for 25 bucks at a halloween store don't let the cover fool you the costumes suck my overall grade is a 3 10 if you are interested in independent movies are easily satisfied or just have 3 bucks burning a hole in your pocket go to blockbuster and see the horror of failure
<START> i caught this during a brief run in a philadelphia theater despite its local <UNK> and its relation to a hometown tragedy namely the beating death of eddie in 1994 i really have to come down hard on this movie the director for reasons best known to himself decided to shoot the entire film <UNK> style with <UNK> <UNK> cameras and cuts such technique might work for the scenes of jarring violence but is utterly inappropriate for the rest of the material which makes up the majority of the film a <UNK> down the sidewalk a brother to brother discussion on a <UNK> hell even a kiss on a first date are all shot style distracting this viewer from ever being able to enter into the drama martin also <UNK> his narrative by <UNK> in far too many topics besides the birth of mob violence we get <UNK> alcoholism divorce racism <UNK> abuse did i miss anything no doubt a better cast and a better focused direction would have <UNK> these threads together as martin surely intended to demonstrate how one moral flaw leads into and <UNK> a host of others but good intentions do not necessarily a great film make just a <UNK> mess martin i know you're from my town and i'm down with you man i really am just do a better job next time like you did in two plus one
<START> i liked it better than house party 2 3 the cast was hilarious and cool at the same time chris who directed the film has a very humorous cameo in it as a car <UNK> look for his mom who plays the lead character john john's grandmother and you can hear her rap the title song down to the last minute at the end of the film as the credits roll she's very funny and a really good actress as well the young actors who star in it the main trio and who in reality are part of the music group did a superb job before this film i had not paid much attention to this r b group now i'm a fan the music number in the house party scene alone is worth checking out the movie i was pleasantly surprised i loved it
<START> gorgeous annie belle in her prime stars in this adventure sex movie she wears her hair in a buzz cut that is <UNK> <UNK> she and her boyfriend are visiting some <UNK> asian paradise they have decided to keep an open sexual relationship which is played out on their journey to find a secret society tribe where the people live one year and then are <UNK> in some kind of ceremony the scenery is gorgeous deep vast green <UNK> and <UNK> are explored the imagery is very similar to that of the movie black <UNK> it is rich and colorful recommended
<START> i completely disagree with the other comments i too saw this film at an early screening and found it quite enjoyable robin williams is in top form true the tone is familiar but it is williams of good morning vietnam smart funny on point after too many dark turns williams is finally back to what he does best the supporting actors give great performances especially laura <UNK> and chris walken chris plays himself as usual but as the agent to the next president he was a delight each time on screen lewis black plays only himself basically but he is wonderfully well used here there is also a fun turn by jeff goldblum the movie is more than what the trailer suggests as well the movie is funny but it is not a pure comedy as suggested it has a bit of a thriller line which everyone should seriously consider especially if you pay attention to the newspaper
<START> betty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lives her life through soap opera a reason to love as a way to escape her <UNK> husband and dull life after a shocking incident involving two hit men morgan freeman and chris rock betty goes into shock and travels to la believing that she is destined to marry the show's main character greg kinnear br br nurse betty is that rare thing a lesser known film with an all star cast and a <UNK> <UNK> com plot that surprises with it's terrific script and spot on acting indeed such a plot makes one question the r rating but it's <UNK> all right the shocking incident that sends betty over the edge is a tad too graphic compared to the light amusing comedy that is to come and feels like something out of a different movie but at the same time it is necessary to <UNK> show <UNK> transformation into the <UNK> eyed lovable nut job she becomes br br as we go along with betty on her journey director neil <UNK> works some extraordinary magic which makes the movie unique and high above your <UNK> standard comedy of error an example of this would be <UNK> first meeting with her crush she <UNK> her heart out to him and he plays along thinking she's <UNK> for a part on the show even as we are aware of the ludicrous nature of <UNK> <UNK> the music <UNK> as she speaks giving us the audience <UNK> emotional perspective we almost believe what she is saying yet we understand that her mind is <UNK> whereas other filmmakers would try to accent the <UNK> of the situation to <UNK> every ounce of possible comedy out of the scene <UNK> is sensitive to his main character and treats her with the <UNK> sympathy and understanding br br the banter between the hit men played by freeman and rock is priceless the excellent script <UNK> out clever line after clever line for them to riff off of freeman in particular is excellent as always pacing himself as his character slowly and <UNK> falls in love with his own ideal of betty not even truly knowing who she is or what has happened to her aaron once again shows <UNK> in the <UNK> role of <UNK> no good husband and he is almost <UNK> the other revelation here is kinnear whose portrayal of the star is not too <UNK> there's a tendency to lay on the celebrity bastard cliché as <UNK> as possible and kinnear <UNK> instead <UNK> him with a pompous yet restrained self importance despite simply being a soap star br br the soap opera is realised so well it could almost exist <UNK> and co hit the nail on the head with this one and a good thing too if the soap opera had been too satirical a large part of the film would not have worked to do a days of our lives spoof as seen in friends would have been the wrong move for this movie the dedication to detail pays off as the style and feel of the soap opera begins to bleed into <UNK> reality more and more while keeping with the overall unintentionally comedic aspect of the genre the scenes on the set feel real as opposed to some films in which the atmosphere feels so <UNK> you wondered why people who do it for a living can't get it right br br the neat resolution of the final act while being a tad predictable is wholly satisfying overall it's a shame that after <UNK> directed this wonderful film the mainstream came calling for him to direct the abysmal remake of the wicker man a fine example of a man so totally above the material given to him unfortunately one cannot <UNK> him of all responsibility br br if you haven't seen nurse betty it's something to discover if you have it's worth a re visit there is a charm to nurse betty that is <UNK> even if it may not leave you thinking that much afterwards a hidden gem nonetheless
<START> br br very slow plodding movie with a confusing story line the movie's only hope of keeping the audience interested is the gratuitous nudity thrown in at regular <UNK> ellen <UNK> is miscast and her looks do not hold up when she is on screen with the much younger <UNK> wilson not sure what this movie was about
<START> unimpressive and extremely low budget sci fi without any charm and appeal even the scenes related with the fall of the <UNK> are stolen from other movies with the same plot it's just a bad rip off of <UNK> with and deep impact with morgan freeman mr hopper seems to be anxious to slip away from this pointless and dull sci fi entry br br i give this a 2 two and don't say i'm not a good guy
<START> i would like to say that i absolutely loved <UNK> tales to me it was one of the original horror flicks with a twisted ending as if the <UNK> of the movie weren't scary or weird enough you have the ending it's a very awesome movie and i'm so happy that it's being released on dvd on august <UNK> i will not hesitate to get my copy on that day i don't think the movie received all the credit or recognition it should have because all these other movies came out shortly after and was acknowledge but if it weren't for my brother telling me about the movie i wouldn't have known which stinks because in my opinion it's far better than any scream i know what you did last summer or any other horror for that time so i hope that you are able to see the movie yourself and at least be able to see the difference i loved it and being a horror movie <UNK> <UNK> tales was like <UNK> for me
<START> sorry i couldn't disagree more with the last comments frankly i thought this was worse than carry on <UNK> enough said last film for the usually brilliant charles who looked out of place as the humour had move on to the highly witty level of on the <UNK> films of which were being made at the same time were frankly funnier barbara <UNK> was embarrassing a character like one of your <UNK> <UNK> friends who still thinks she's <UNK> on holiday with some non <UNK> of a <UNK> c he ain't the series miraculously on with like carry on behind and carry on england carry on dick wasn't bad but really with this film the end of the series was <UNK> a pity because up to this film i cant think of bad film before this
<START> i've been <UNK> to write a review of this film for some time but only now have i actually managed to get my thoughts down for the of others br br i never had the pleasure of seeing this film on the big <UNK> which is a shame as it is often visually stunning but i have <UNK> it on video numerous times over the years enjoying it immensely every time it definitely is on my personal list of favorite movies and for more than just starring <UNK> sutherland and kevin bacon two of my actors to watch ' br br perhaps i appreciate this film so much because it appeals to my slightly off <UNK> taste in entertainment i like my movies a bit left of center unpredictable and fresh and whether or not you <UNK> the story line of the film you have to admit it is different br br everyone has different tastes and opinions but my impression of some of the negative reviews of this movie is that the viewers never really saw past the surface level of this film they got caught up in <UNK> why would there be green lighting in a subway ' or why would medical students pull such a stupid stunt ' and failed to see the artistry and psychological depth of the piece br br yes there are some medical and technical aspects that do not make logical sense but if you are willing to suspend disbelief just a tad this can be a very engaging film br br first a note about the artistic quality of the movie some have complained about the murky lighting and the illogical nature of the sets but for me the use of <UNK> lighting techniques the plastic and sheet <UNK> sets the unusual settings in old buildings and <UNK> dripping <UNK> the use of <UNK> rain and <UNK> <UNK> all add a poetic flavor to this film a haunting beauty that suits the dark nature of the questions being asked about life death and forgiveness br br i will focus on just two examples in an alley scene a change in lighting allows for certain elements of the set to come dramatically into focus then to fade away once lighting returns to normal it is an innovative means of conveying a shift in the <UNK> of the moment and works beautifully we are also allowed to see the interior of the character's apartments contrast the warm wood bright colors golden lighting and <UNK> comfort of rooms with the stark white void of <UNK> both are <UNK> of the characters themselves <UNK> lack of reflect our lack of knowledge about his past and his carefully constructed mask that keeps his companions at a distance his past we come to learn is one of chaos and conflict he has determined to leave that behind in favor of an <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately the <UNK> is also <UNK> of his relationships with others a realization he comes to along his personal journey of self discovery in this film br br is not your typical horror film nor is a typical drama or suspense movie it is rather more of an <UNK> of all having the best elements of all genres <UNK> in a complex suspenseful plot br br this is an ensemble piece and the cast does an excellent job of breathing life into their individual characters your immediate impression is that the characters are each representative of a well established the female ice queen the slightly neurotic the playboy and the socially conscious nice <UNK> etc however as the film progresses and the characters are further fleshed out they take on multiple <UNK> and depth br br most interesting of all is <UNK> character of nelson nelson is not a character that is easy to like indeed he is a bit of a b <UNK> a master <UNK> who definitely places self interest above all else yet sutherland plays him with a hint of <UNK> that lends him a certain appeal as events unfold you come to realize that much of <UNK> unpleasant personality is a <UNK> a protective mask behind which hides a very uncertain and vulnerable young man <UNK> by a terrible secret br br by revealing bits and pieces of <UNK> complex personality throughout the film the writers directors and cast gradually lead you towards a greater understanding of and sympathy for him the character who started out as a <UNK> becomes important and <UNK> in his own right as you learn to his previous behavior in light of new information your journey of discovery with nelson reflects the characters own <UNK> towards self understanding as they too come to realize that everyone has value and everything we do matters ' br br which leads to my final comment although many of the posters here have picked up upon the theme of <UNK> death few seem to have touched upon what i see as the main premise of the movie the importance of forgiveness and the need to be <UNK> of all you do because it does matter ' br br
<START> documentary content amazing man amazing movement he started amazing stories most of them yet to be really told br br celluloid treatment <UNK> ad sorry ain't got nothing else to say about this but that you can say all you want about the dire circumstances in the <UNK> but if you attempt to support that claim with flashy and <UNK> images and camera work of that life the <UNK> necessary to show this life as an <UNK> filmmaker goes out the window and with that goes the <UNK> of the narrative besides that the time space <UNK> in the film is all off and i'm not necessarily against that in films as a tool but here it serves only to confuse the viewer into wondering what was said when thus leading me to the question is this a documentary or a <UNK> br br <UNK> com
<START> if there was justice in the cinematic universe director lewis would never be allowed to set foot on a movie set again it would seem <UNK> that anyone who spent two full decades in an editing room where <UNK> started his movie career could be so utterly devoid of any sense of pacing or dramatic staging but this film is <UNK> evidence br br as bad as it is it is <UNK> so from the opening scene where a nurse is clad in a costume appropriate only for a porno film or a skit on a mexican variety show the viewer is compelled to see just how low it can go the answer isn't far away as in the next scene we move to a funeral <UNK> where the next stunning fashion statement comes in a sexy off the shoulders black dress worn by one of the <UNK> br br <UNK> inappropriate <UNK> isn't the film's only flaw the dialog is a treat for <UNK> of bad writing you turn my tears into wine is a <UNK> gem the actor deserves an oscar for delivering that one with a straight face br br the director <UNK> every <UNK> scene with what is possibly the soundtrack score ever recorded which <UNK> from embarrassingly <UNK> in the dialog scenes to cheesy wannabe in <UNK> scenes br br the script introduces characters with no rhyme or reason and story beats are <UNK> out as if with a broken br br let's not forget this is a horror film though our characters find themselves in a forest <UNK> <UNK> dr <UNK> and his two scary who are supposed to be some kind of but look exactly like valley girls with fake blood beneath their <UNK> i've honestly seen scarier make up on eight year olds out trick or treating on halloween br br and again we get a <UNK> of the costume <UNK> <UNK> as valley <UNK> one <UNK> around in a pseudo victorian while her buddy wears a <UNK> ensemble that might have been almost <UNK> in less hip <UNK> of the 1980s br br dr <UNK> makes the big fashion statement though looking like a cowboy who got lost in the woods on his big black <UNK> clad from head to toe in black s m leather br br if this sounds intriguing by all means check it out there is plenty of side splitting and <UNK> dialog like the precious <UNK> graveyard scene or the intellectual <UNK> on br br to be fair the cinematography is good considering what was put before the camera and the actors <UNK> with wildly extreme results to make something from a <UNK> heap of clichés and <UNK> you do have to wonder if they were really really stupid or just <UNK> desperate not to walk off the set after catching one glimpse of the ridiculous looking villains with their 99 <UNK> store weapons
<START> i don't understand why more people have not commented on this other than the fact that perhaps not very many have seen it it's an amazing cast of characters one after another after another all done by the guy who wrote the play if you don't like filmed plays you may not like this after all plays usually don't look good on tv but it's a one man show that will have you paying attention throughout highly recommended
<START> a college professor is working on creating zombies and wouldn't you know it things go horribly wrong next thing you know the whole campus is <UNK> thank goodness there's a pair of uber <UNK> trained for just such a situation too bad they must be accompanied by a group of moron <UNK> lead by a <UNK> he doesn't even bother trying to play a military guy he just responds to his superiors as if he were <UNK> da <UNK> in da hood the high point of this part of the movie is the locker room scene the male and female moron <UNK> share the same locker room and apparently military <UNK> require all females to wear black <UNK> and <UNK> hey if you can't make a good movie at least you can have women in their underwear my <UNK> off to the film makers br br so after much discussion of how well prepared these moron <UNK> are for the job <UNK> afghanistan iraq they all get killed off in fairly short order their biggest downfall seems to be that it never occurs to them to turn any lights on a typical encounter has them walking into a room and seeing someone at the far end human or zombie can't tell flip on the lights no moron <UNK> <UNK> requires them to walk up to the person making sure to hold their gun in such a way that it can be easily knocked out of their hand and well you know the <UNK> the demise of sergeant major <UNK> is especially fun my favorite scene involving a <UNK> in any movie i've ever seen luckily and again hats off to the filmmakers the <UNK> babe among the moron <UNK> manages to survive her and the female uber <UNK> both wind up in tight t shirts for the remainder of the movie now this is how a military operation should be performed there's a bunch of running around <UNK> my humorous stuff like the uber <UNK> being unable to get through a simple grating it obviously is a thin piece of <UNK> that you could easily put your fist through this <UNK> a plan to rub zombie guts all over themselves and even though we've seen nothing in the movie to indicate that zombies locate their prey by smell they're good enough to immediately begin <UNK> the zombie guts and let our heroes go br br a few other funny bits the paris hilton gag the can you hear me now gag and the fact that although the zombies immediately bite secondary characters main characters are able to fight their way through dozens of them without being on another chuckle is provided by mr who can't seem to <UNK> the word toe no <UNK> br br overall it's somewhat amusing could have used some more interesting characters but for a sci fi channel original i was mildly impressed
<START> i received a copy of this film from a friend for my 21st birthday which he had obviously picked up for <UNK> from a bargain video bin br br never have i been so frustrated when watching a film it was tedious adam west was wasted literally and in retrospect i cannot recall a single thing about it my lack of enjoyment grew to such an extent that the second the credits rolled we <UNK> up the <UNK> and hung the tape around the living room just for good measure we set fire to the cover
<START> <UNK> edge is not a pleasant film to watch but it is an incredible one having viewed it many years ago i truly think it would still have the ability to shock were it to be re released or remade or something perhaps no movie ever made has captured the of young suburban <UNK> like this frightening movie given that this is based on a true story it is even more disturbing very well acted and just unpleasant at many times to watch but also a little known masterpiece and a <UNK> important film should be a mandatory to watch shown <UNK> in all fantastic
<START> the sounds in the movie were so mundane and ridiculous seriously <UNK> on the door <UNK> for about 30 minutes really <UNK> your teeth and makes your head hurt br br i love bad <UNK> more than the next guy but come on no blood on our hands being said about a million times by matt character and when matt <UNK> character shoots the bum the lead character which i fail to remember his name because i don't really think anyone cares gets blood on his hands literally br br the background music with the heavy metal guitar <UNK> an a <UNK> for about 5 minutes isn't my idea of music come on i was having the worst headache by the end of this garbage
<START> this show is terrible i cannot get over the complete waste of great talent this show contains this is not entertaining <UNK> acting it's just a cheap attempt to throw someone famous comedic actors onto a stage and have them perform a poorly improved scene i have actually done <UNK> work as an actor and this show is not <UNK> br br what the audience is actually laughing at if they're actually laughing at this show at all it looks quite fake is the embarrassment of the guest star being lost like a deer in <UNK> the dumb completely unrelated things they come up with are what people laugh at and if it's not part of the scene the actors will tell them that it's wrong i find this show is disgrace to the art and makes me cry for shows like whose line is it anyway which had great talent great <UNK> games and on top of everything else didn't make me want to change the channel
<START> being an <UNK> non stop over the top explosive melodrama this movie is one of the worst action flicks ever produced and utterly unbelievable in every way the pace is constantly fever pitched and all the action and the actors are <UNK> by total <UNK> it is <UNK> unwatchable and a <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> on the careers of everyone involved br br the wildly exaggerated attempt at excitement <UNK> itself resulting in a movie where you just go come on all the time the setting and the events are impossible to take even remotely seriously i can only rate this abomination a 1 out of 10 br br if you want to see a good <UNK> movie see deep impact which is intense sensitive and thoroughly engrossing everything <UNK> is not
<START> spoilers feeling alone and needing <UNK> as well as love frances austen sandy dennis keeps all these emotions inside as she goes through life as a popular young single lady who has many high class friends but for reasons of her own deep <UNK> she keeps them at arms length as for frances male friends non are anywhere near her age so that she won't have any reason to have any romantic involvement with them br br one early evening as frances was entertaining some of her friends she spots outside her apartment window a young man michael burns sitting alone in the cold <UNK> rain feeling that he's homeless and alone after her friends leave frances goes outside to the park and offers the young man shelter at her place until the rain <UNK> and even to stay over for the night at a guest bedroom that she has you can see right away that frances is more interested in just having the young mans safely out of the cold and rain then she wants to have him as a friend lover or even play toy all for herself and as the movie progresses you see that you were right br br a really amazing performance by sandy dennis that in a way is very much like that of kathy <UNK> academy award performance in the movie misery that was made in 1990 some twenty one years later frances thinking that the young man was alone and homeless and later when she meets him mute sees the perfect person for her to have as a true friend he's in no way her equal or better then her like the friends that she has doctors lawyers indian <UNK> and thus is totally <UNK> on her it later turns out that the young man is not the lonely and homeless person that frances thought that he is it's when she slowly finds out that he really doesn't need her as well as him <UNK> her instead the other way around it sets off something in mind that turns out to be a <UNK> of murderous proportions br br a really weird film by director robert altman that goes deep into the depths of loneliness and depression of the human mind actress sandy dennis is perfect as the dr <UNK> and miss hyde personality in her acting as the lonely but at the same time dangerous frances austen and it's a pity that not only didn't she get an academy award for her role in the film but wasn't even nominated for it br br like most robert altman movies there seems to be a lot of <UNK> among the actors in the movie and ad <UNK> dialog especially between the young man's sister nina <UNK> <UNK> and her boyfriend nick david garfield the only thing in the movie that i found confusing is when we see frances go to a city clinic to have a full <UNK> and tells the doctor that she expects to get married very soon was her husband to be the young man staying at her apartment but besides that the movie sticks to the story pretty well and the ending is a real shock to the audience as well as the young man when he finally in the end realizes that frances is not only a bit off the wall but <UNK> insane as well
<START> has a <UNK> reputation within <UNK> circles and now i know why br br is based on a manga title which unbelievably is allegedly better than the film and follows the bizarre events a <UNK> in an isolated japanese town i'm not about to tell you anything that happens in this film because it is an absolute must see movie i watched it for the first time last night and i was blown away it shot into the my top movies of all time and leap pans <UNK> as the best fantastic movie literally and that has been released in the last decade br br this movie is very <UNK> in nature without <UNK> having any direct connection to the <UNK> it has been made in the same way that <UNK> composed his stories it exudes power as an aura of not quite right <UNK> <UNK> through a brooding phase to dread and ultimately horror through subtle <UNK> changes in the soundtrack and the cinematography this is indeed a weird tale par excellence br br simply stunning
<START> i think i am some kind of road runner fan i don't care how predictable it is i laugh anyway is predictable most of the time although it is pretty ingenious at the same time as well of course the road runner is chased by the <UNK> and of course the <UNK> fails to catch the road runner with every new attempt the plans the <UNK> comes up with are very funny you see exactly where it will go wrong and you will not disappointed well one time you are sort of disappointed what you think will happen does not but it makes the joke even funnier br br if you like the road runner shorts you will love this one the predictable gags work and the animation is great and pretty original at times
<START> i wanted to love this film so badly i really did but it was a horrible disappointment br br i read jennifer novel in 1996 and was enthralled by the story in fact it remains one of my favorite books of all time mind you the book had much more depth than this movie in plot and emotional <UNK> it made you care about the characters it painted a complete picture of <UNK> unlike the utterly poor characterization of the young girl in the film br br though beautiful and showing some promise in her <UNK> career <UNK> <UNK> was as flat and hollow in this performance as was the script and christopher <UNK> wolf was just an awful choice for the role of wolf both physically and what an awkward looking couple wolf should have been more of a dark brooding character and more physically <UNK> like he was in the book what's more the chemistry between the two actors was painfully forced br br cameron diaz however deserves <UNK> praise for her performance she took an <UNK> mediocre script and gave her character life a real spirit she is simply gorgeous and her careful mannerisms make her very believable as a hippie it's too bad her talent was <UNK> on this forgettable film br br in the book to movie category this is a dreadful translation almost as bad as message in a bottle with kevin <UNK> but don't get me started on that one br br i am not usually so harsh in my <UNK> but i was so disappointed here because i really cared about the story and wanted to see it told right it did not deliver br br
<START> i rented this movie because i noticed the cover in the video rental store i saw nolte <UNK> madsen 40's time setting and thought hmm can't be too bad unfortunately after watching it my impression was not too good br br its kind of a <UNK> ripoff but the worst part is that other than nolte the other members of the squad didn't get enough screen time but its a decent movie to see once i guess and <UNK> role was small enough that she wasn't given a chance to be a <UNK>
<START> <UNK> high is one of my favorite movies ever i think i saw this movie years ago on late night tv with my mother when i was little and i thought it was so funny this movie was also referred to as a black american <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is wonderful as <UNK> and lawrence hilton <UNK> is great as friend there are some other great characters in it as well and this movie has a lot of humor packed into it from the beginning of the movie where goes to home to get ready for school to the sad ending of funeral this movie is one that will get you laughing all the way there are a lot of scenes in this film that i like a lot the scene where another one of <UNK> and friends go to the <UNK> with them and gets the <UNK> <UNK> thrown on his shirt very gross but funny as well the first scene in the street corner <UNK> the quarter party at this girl's house which became a disaster due to a fight and some others are wonderful to watch this movie even has a wonderful companion soundtrack album which is packed with a lot of wonderful <UNK> hits and artists from the early 60s only 6 songs on the soundtrack were done in <UNK> while the rest were from the '60s the movie is mainly about two friends who dream about getting away from their <UNK> and rough neighborhood after high school but their <UNK> seem almost out of reach due to their innocent joy ride in a stolen car that two other <UNK> were responsible for and relationship with his girlfriend brenda played by <UNK> davis almost gets put in <UNK> go out and rent or buy this movie and be ready for a load of comical entertainment get the soundtrack too it is a lot of fun as well
<START> spoiler warning br br we've all heard the boy who cried wolf legend but what if the wolf was a person in the modern world well it might be something like big fat liar <UNK> year old jason <UNK> frankie from malcolm in the middle is always lying to keep himself out of trouble one day he is <UNK> to write an english <UNK> but it winds up in the hands of sleazy film maker marty wolf paul <UNK> who plans to turn <UNK> story into a hollywood blockbuster no one believes jason when he for once tells the truth and he ends up in summer school however jason is determined to prove to his parents the truth and travels to l a with his friend amanda <UNK> when wolf refuses to admit he ripped off his story jason plans to make <UNK> life a living hell b f l is no masterpiece but it's a nice way to spend 90 minutes of you're time i wished they could've made it a bit longer though and there aren't that much pranks although they are clever enough i like the pool <UNK> the best i might not have liked this as much as i do if it weren't for paul <UNK> he is simply hilarious in this if you have 90 minutes to kill try this out you might just enjoy it
<START> a bunch of mostly obnoxious and grossly unappealing teens go to a creepy remote <UNK> old <UNK> located nearby a cemetery to attend an anything goes all out halloween party being <UNK> by freaky occult obsessed oddball <UNK> <UNK> and her vacuous boy hungry friend <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> beer <UNK> sex happy <UNK> hold a <UNK> as a joke very bad idea 'cause the desolate old dive is naturally said to be haunted by demonic spirits of course that ill advised <UNK> <UNK> those decidedly grumpy and hostile evil spirits who <UNK> kill and possess a majority of the kids turning them into ugly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> faced murderous <UNK> who <UNK> the usual grisly havoc throughout the duration of an especially long dark and harrowing night of pure terror br br yep this is essentially your <UNK> <UNK> graphic and <UNK> wall to wall cheap shock ridden evil dead rehash <UNK> with closed off there's no easy way out claustrophobic single self confined setting outrageously excessive splatter set pieces an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> score a total sense of laden grim and in your face manic <UNK> cinematography the expected <UNK> rush inducing <UNK> hand held camera work smooth <UNK> tracking shots <UNK> camera angles even the camera on a <UNK> doing a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> degree figure eight fortunately kevin s slick assured stylish direction keeps the extremely <UNK> and derivative proceedings <UNK> along at a <UNK> clip moreover <UNK> gives the film an attractive polished look and effectively creates a certain <UNK> energetic and <UNK> grotesque spooky <UNK> carnival <UNK> atmosphere br br however steve <UNK> <UNK> gory and imaginative make up effects are the true star of the show <UNK> highlights include disgusting fat <UNK> hal who played a similarly irritating <UNK> a hole role in the immortal <UNK> babes in the <UNK> bowl a <UNK> around the same time having his tongue bitten off <UNK> <UNK> a whole tube of <UNK> in one of her breasts and <UNK> a guy's eyes out while she's making love to him double a <UNK> teen couple getting <UNK> while doing exactly what you think in a coffin the chick has her neck <UNK> while the dude has his arm chopped off <UNK> setting her hands on fire and in the film's single most nasty scene a mean old man has his throat <UNK> from the inside out after eating an apple piece laced with razor <UNK> the rock score likewise <UNK> and then there's <UNK> incredibly wild sexy and <UNK> demon dance a <UNK> number accompanied by a <UNK> <UNK> light and startling jump cuts that <UNK> choreographed herself okay so this overall doesn't amount to anything more than a completely mindless and pointless albeit quite nicely <UNK> and <UNK> vulgar hunk of <UNK> sleazy fright flick junk but if you're in the mood for <UNK> brain dead <UNK> horror <UNK> this <UNK> crass and juvenile <UNK> does the trick just fine
<START> the early films of the dead end kids before they were re <UNK> the <UNK> boys were all very entertaining and well produced films from warner brothers despite their being rather formulaic they still had excellent writing acting and hold up well over time do not confuse these with the cheap <UNK> boys films from <UNK> pictures despite the presence of <UNK> hall and leo <UNK> these films were several <UNK> below the earlier films in regard to quality br br the film begins with tough guy john garfield winning the lightweight boxing championship unfortunately shortly after this he's on a drunken <UNK> and is blamed for a murder he really didn't commit the problem is that he was so loaded that he wasn't sure he didn't kill the man so he runs away and lives the life of a <UNK> eventually he meets up with <UNK> may <UNK> and the dead end kids as well as a lady you just know will become his girlfriend given time br br where the rest of the film goes was not all that surprising but because of the quality of the film it doesn't seem to matter garfield and the kids are at their best and this is a film sure to please all but the of viewers
<START> art house horror tries to use unconventional <UNK> to cover the fact that this is just another serial killer <UNK> which ultimately relies on pornographic <UNK> of teen sexuality and violent gore the <UNK> come across about as well as they do in every piece of australian writing book or film since 1960 surprise surprise the <UNK> have a dark <UNK> and the plot is as contrived as any you've seen the <UNK> would never know about this guy one of the filmmakers says about joel character but he was completely plausible as to what he was serial killers don't all have <UNK> over their eyes and <UNK> down their <UNK> they look like the guy next door another <UNK> in pornographic violence who sees a serial killer in every street but the real <UNK> of this film is in the fact that it's a genre film that nobody saw backed by substantial <UNK> including some from film <UNK> that's government this got a run at the underground film festival in melbourne and had to rely on kindness for a very short release season what is the doing funding genre flicks even if they are <UNK> and <UNK> unconventional why are these nasty movies <UNK> beautiful punishment no through road being made in the first place richard co encourage their creators to believe they're giving the masses what they really want as opposed to what the culture elite in government funding think they want the truth is that these brutal and forgettable <UNK> earn far more critical acclaim and win far more obscure awards than they're due
<START> all <UNK> on the fact you'd probably <UNK> make the cut for second string need to save it if more guys out there took their sorry to the gym for once maybe <UNK> have a chance well maybe take shawn <UNK> hook <UNK> for a perfect example and i stress the word perfect put that in your <UNK> and smoke it you couldn't look better <UNK> shawn
<START> dark waters has to rank as one of the most <UNK> moronic movies ever made i had expected at least some passable entertainment because john rhys davies was involved and after seeing this movie i can honestly say i <UNK> my opinion of mr davies <UNK> br br why the acting is incredibly poor an excellent actor like davies should have <UNK> more from the cast and the director it was painfully obvious that mr davies was just clock watching and hoping the check would not <UNK> to say that he just showed up would be an understatement but at least he did show up the rest of the cast looks like they <UNK> it in from their respective jobs at the various los angeles <UNK> where they work as <UNK> talk about a cast of <UNK> this is the kind of cast that never appears in movies again they act as if they were <UNK> while waiting at the <UNK> office br br what about the special effects store bought <UNK> <UNK> a cheap rubber suit and cgi effects that look like they came from my 1980 <UNK> game i have seen some horrible special effects used on sci fi channel movies but this stuff looked like cut and <UNK> done at the <UNK> by child i expected mr <UNK> and <UNK> bob would show up at the end to battle the not to mention that all the accounts of the creature describe it as a small <UNK> like <UNK> it would have been a good film for a <UNK> like character instead we get a gigantic <UNK> creature that is shown walking with stop action <UNK> up effects that are laughable the is in one place and then it <UNK> at super speed down the hall and it is worth a few laughs just to see this
<START> everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here this is simply a run of the mill demons on the loose <UNK> havoc slasher but without the passion that <UNK> the original br br there's nothing new in the story in fact it seems like they ignore the first one altogether here the demons run loose in a high security apartment building and naturally kill most of the residents in grisly fashion the makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time around although the actors weren't exactly brilliant in demons in demons 2 they're actually a lot worse you don't care about these characters at all the plot is nonexistent the music poor apart from one simon <UNK> song it's not scary in the least it's just not that good br br easily the worst film <UNK> <UNK> has been involved with and <UNK> <UNK> also <UNK> has a cameo in this film not a very funny one br br maybe 3 is too high a rating but at least i could watch it all and didn't think of stopping <UNK> my advice stick to the original
<START> i was <UNK> <UNK> by this terrible film br br the main action of the movie is nothing special it seems there's a tribe of snake <UNK> people in a remote mountain region of northern china where women rather than men are the leaders and decision makers i suppose among some men this is enough to make a horror movie anyway occasionally chinese men would wander into the village take a fancy to the local girls seduce them and then abandon them unfortunately for the men the women had put them under a spell derived from snake <UNK> which would make them die horribly in 100 days their <UNK> like a pregnant woman's with live worms and snakes if they did not return br br forget the cover of the us video this has nothing to do with vampires though there is one inept blood drinking scene the title itself is only <UNK> appropriate is the latin <UNK> meaning to lie beneath and it's the root of the word <UNK> a female demon who would seduce men in their sleep actually it's the men who are the here br br but it's not the main action of this ludicrous film that's so <UNK> it's the little side incidents i'll overlook the slaughter and <UNK> of an <UNK> that's performed on screen the participants seem very experienced as though this is an unpleasant duty they actually do in real life and i'm sure they really ate the animal afterwards though i <UNK> having the act thrust in my face as entertainment br br what i wish i could overlook or had overlooked are the numerous totally <UNK> shots of an <UNK> man who from time to time <UNK> the story by eating living animals he starts the movie by <UNK> apart a live snake with his teeth in the course of the movie he <UNK> a bug a lizard a <UNK> i had to leave the room after this and a whole mouse i stopped watching at this point and lost my <UNK> for days let me stress that this was totally unexpected and had nothing to do with the movie unless it's a cynical reference to love as it's portrayed in the film a blind selfish <UNK> survival <UNK> that tears apart the helpless but then again i'm probably just to get the <UNK> out of my head
<START> i am willing to tolerate almost anything in a sci fi movie but this was almost <UNK> while a few of the special effects are very cool landscapes this is no rather a disjointed weird mother daughter relationship with sci fi concepts thrown in the acting wooden framing and shooting <UNK> film school and with hand to hand combat scenes funnier than any hong kong <UNK> movie this film <UNK> the plot line is convoluted and the devices used to move the plot along narrator unexplained scene jumps and plenty of <UNK> ex <UNK> <UNK> the idea that writer <UNK> director is not a good idea save your love of sci fi for something else instead of losing a bit of it here
<START> i would recommend this as the most successful attempt so far to make a movie on soviet <UNK> war and it is very honest and responsible picture starting from small details of uniforms and weapons up to human relations war routine and central asian landscapes it's been shot in just after the the <UNK> <UNK> which happened in 1989 not in 1985 the italian star mr <UNK> was just perfect in the role of major other characters looked also very natural especially always drunk club managing officer the scenario seems a bit <UNK> in the end but it might be an impact of the civil war in which had started right during the shooting of the film all movie team had to escape sometimes even under fire the last scene is purely type of behavior and reminded me the final phrase from one famous samurai movie we've won all battles but lost the war it could be also a metaphor of <UNK> collapse the great country allowing to shoot itself to the back by the small offended child
<START> the best screen performance ever by george c scott the screenplay by the irony <UNK> dialogue is near perfect <UNK> where do you train your <UNK> <UNK> ' <UNK> is wonderful as the <UNK> angel who saves scott from doom as is the whole cast it's a hilarious and serious movie it is a movie of the period the 60's but it is not in any sense dated what it is about the chaos and <UNK> of the system vs the sanity of the individual is timeless and the we <UNK> nothing we cure nothing monologue delivered <UNK> actually as no one else but scott could with its references to <UNK> and other of modern science could literally have been written this morning br br
<START> almost 4 years after the events of <UNK> if asked what comes to mind about that day most people would probably comment on things such as the sight of planes crashing into and the collapse of the twin towers the scores of people being killed acts of terrorism and <UNK> mixed together etc everyone who was alive at the time will never forget that day yet for most of us the memories although moving are not on a personal level now comes an extraordinary film which gives everyone who did not lose a friend or a family member a chance to become involved at a personal level in just what we lost on <UNK> this is a film that needs to be seen
<START> a very good offering from hbo <UNK> <UNK> is becoming a much better dramatic actress with each effort i hope to see this attractive lady in more challenging roles in the future instead of the <UNK> roles she has been stuck with in the past
<START> even a awful 1 is to much for this film everything form start to finish made you cringe i don't think it would be possible to <UNK> more overly clichéd moments into one piece of mind numbingly numbingly waste of film br br prisoner cell block h meets thunderbirds hell even expressions were more life like than his son br br i haven't even finished watching this and i'm on here now oh no the cheesy <UNK> of 3 actors and a backdrop done by a child with <UNK> premiere this truly is the end of my i've started so i'll finish watching it phase br br oh joy the credits have come to rescue me and relax
<START> despite john <UNK> statements in interviews that this was his favorite role of his career be cool proves to be a disappointing sequel to <UNK> witty and clever get <UNK> br br travolta delivers a pleasant enough performance in this mildly entertaining film but ultimately the movie falls flat due to an underdeveloped plot unlikeable characters and a surprising lack of chemistry between leads travolta and uma thurman although there are some laughs this unfunny dialog example which appeared frequently in the trailers kind of says it all thurman do you dance travolta hey i'm from brooklyn br br the film suggests that everyone in the entertainment business is a gangster or <UNK> to be one <UNK> it to organized crime in get <UNK> the premise of a gangster going legitimate by getting into movies was a clever fish out of water idea but in be cool it seems the <UNK> has entirely gone crooked since then br br the film is interestingly casted and the absolute highlight is a delivered by the rock whose character is an aspiring actor as well as a <UNK> where he a scene between <UNK> union and kirsten dunst from bring it on vince character thinks he's black and he's often seen dressed as a <UNK> this was quite funny in the first scene that introduces him and gets tired and embarrassing almost immediately afterward br br overall be cool may be worth a rental for john travolta die <UNK> of which i am one but you may want to keep your finger close to the fast forward button to get through it without feeling that you wasted too much time fans of get <UNK> may actually wish to avoid this as the sequel is devoid of most things that made that one a winner i rate this movie an admittedly harsh 4 10
<START> this is a really really bad movie however it's good to laugh at the horrible ideas and special effects the plot centers around an <UNK> space agency that discovers a <UNK> planet that <UNK> directly opposite the earth they send a mission they have been to mars and have yet to discover this planet is anybody stupid enough to fall for this to the planet and can you believe it it's the mirror image of the planet they came from most everything is predictable from that point honestly from the title of the movie you can guess just about everything the only surprising thing here is a space program run by there really can be no excuse for the plot concept or execution so it's good for a laugh or maybe if you are in an altered state of consciousness
<START> oh f <UNK> hell where should i start first of all this show is just another stupid american non funny so called comedy which has pathetic acting and very very poor humor the american way of laughing track business makes the whole thing even worse how come i can hear laughter yet there's nothing funny happening pretty stupid eh this show is only for those american people who haven't ever heard that there are far more funnier better and <UNK> comedies not only in great but also in america the simpsons for example i simply can't understand what is so good about <UNK> that it has lasted for long a while in television it has nothing new to offer it <UNK> the possible viewers in so many ways and it simply isn't funny at all i could have lived with the fact that there are so bad shows as <UNK> but why the hell they had to run it here in <UNK> if i see few seconds of this horrible show the rest of the day is ruined for me take my word and believe me this show sucks ass even more than these kind of american comedies usually does this is simply horrible do yourself a favor don't ever watch this peace of sh t br br well i leave the commenting for those who now this language better thanks for your possible interest
<START> i caught this show a few times when i was young and it was playing <UNK> my parents loved it and now in <UNK> i feel what they feel this show did what the original limits and twilight zone new and old couldn't do this show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas br br i still cannot believe jonathan and brad wright did this those guys were producers on stargate sg 1 the show kept the audience <UNK> in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere this is what was not there in the new twilight zone rod <UNK> coming in added to the <UNK> forest coming in <UNK> the mood br br the ending whether good or bad made for a scary time you could never predict what was going to happen i am still trying to find the seasons on dvd
<START> this turned out to be more of a women's romance soap suspense film than what i hoped it was simply a tense thriller yes the final 20 minutes were suspenseful but much of the previous 75 <UNK> on being just plain tedious br br <UNK> was a little too subdued not playing his normal intense character natasha richardson sports somewhat of a dumb look most of the time and her character was very unappealing br br the story is so so it's not as bad as i'm making out but it sure isn't anything i'd watch again and the back of the vhs describing this movie was misleading
<START> ali g earned his fame on the small screen though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either ali g is a hilarious laugh a second fun fest just like on the small screen he has lost none of his character or stupidity at all and behind all that none of the film is brainless fluff either a human side to ali is revealed during the film the idea of ali g running for <UNK> is a brilliant fresh and funny one and the <UNK> stupidity of gangster man is mixed well with the stern harsh world that is politics the film is also full of brilliant new characters and instead of just interview after interview we get a proper comedy film that never gets repetitive or boring so why didn't i give it ten stars well the ending was funny but also <UNK> and failed none of it made sense and in parts the film became offensive in trying to be funny but that's ali g for you if it isn't offensive it isn't itself and it is totally and utterly ruined ali <UNK> big screen debut was a success in my belief and should have got into the 6 7 average rating range on imdb but it could have got worse as well and people are bound to have mixed opinions especially on a film such as this br br on the whole ali g is hilarious british comedy at its best and funniest and most clever a great job 9 10
<START> this is probably one of those films too many commented but <UNK> this is probably one masterpiece of spanish cinema like some masters piece 15 days with you could be the better now and them re from others films of long time ago could be midnight cowboy but could be also les <UNK> du <UNK> or a realistic and non spot look but most realistic <UNK> this hard story has place to humour love and obviously dramatic sense in the new social spanish cinema this little diamond could be the <UNK> of the italian neo realism mixed <UNK> the best ken <UNK> films br br probably the better film i discover in the last 10 years
<START> it seems to me that a lot of people don't know that blade is actually a superhero movie on par with x men <UNK> <UNK> and the likes what all these heroes and in the case of x men hero group have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of marvel blade was originally a normal person in a blue outfit who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring so boring in fact that the character was <UNK> and in fact never used in the marvel universe at least until he was <UNK> br br david did a stroke of genius when he took the character of blade and turned him into a leather clad dark knight he can't take all the credit though and much of this must go to stephen as well who with his distinct visual style brings out the best of the character the blade character wesley snipes is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with batman like darkness snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in bringing out the <UNK> and inner demons of the character he is however a pretty rigid actor both in voice and in <UNK> and is only interesting enough for one film which is clearly seen from the inferior sequels kris kristofferson is good as well and really brings the tormented character of <UNK> to life with energy and sense of timing wright however is fairly weak as a leading lady making her character relatively flat and lifeless <UNK> is pretty funny and manages to do a lot with a minor character german <UNK> <UNK> should also be mentioned as he brings a lot of <UNK> and style to the vampire race probably born of his experiences from playing dracula stephen <UNK> provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance as <UNK> frost stands as one of the best screen villains i have perhaps ever seen br br the story is good and i feel <UNK> the vampire genre something that hasn't been done since robert from <UNK> till dawn by adding a lot of contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel by saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic far from it a lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible including the effects which are pretty good for their time i found the vampire to be a very nice touch in <UNK> of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies chose to let the vampires <UNK> com bust which looks great the fact that the overall effects were well done adds to the credibility of the film which would otherwise have fallen flat on its face br br as previously stated has a very distinct visual style that sets him apart from the directors of the following blade movies del toro is nearly as skilled but i prefer style his style gives the film a very special look and feel but most importantly it gives the film atmosphere a very tense dark atmosphere which works great in tune with the main character and story along with the visual style the music which also works fine and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie br br all in all blade is a very entertaining movie that should probably have had an 8 from me but a few annoying flaws which cannot be revealed without spoiling the movie suffice to say many of them are located near the ending of the film does that the film must settle with a high 7 br br 7 10
<START> i've just <UNK> this <UNK> remembered bit of cinematic madness from my early days and must urge you to beg steal or borrow it br br the story begins with a duel between a righteous shaolin priest and our villain <UNK> white needless to say <UNK> white kicks <UNK> ass and <UNK> his campaign against shaolin <UNK> with the aid of his new ninja allies a golden clad one who fights with a gold ring a black clad one who fights with a <UNK> and my favourite one who fights with a pair of knives who can disappear and <UNK> as a flying carpet the rest of the story concerns the training of the <UNK> of the shaolin monks killed by <UNK> white one of whom is alexander lo <UNK> whilst we are treated to the <UNK> training sequences the two young <UNK> must go through to learn the shaolin finger <UNK> technique needed to defeat <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> technique we see some of the ways our villain keeps in shape mostly using <UNK> magic to <UNK> the blood from naked ladies we all know how this is going to end but it's the psychedelic trip in between that we're here for in conclusion this is a good example of what <UNK> was doing when hong kong was getting sick of martial arts movies and that is making more and more outrageous martial arts movies this movie is very well choreographed has some nudity some gore and enough balls to the wall to keep even the most jaded viewer entertained visit your local today br br
<START> well dude where's my car might be at least a novelty as one of few hollywood films that seems to have been written cast filmed edited in less than a day i honestly can't believe this got made or that i allowed my friends to make me sit through the entire thing the jokes are too stupid and predictable to be dumb funny and the actors involved don't seem like they would be capable of pulling off any kind of funny had the script actually provided it oddly enough unlike most mindless slapstick comedies this movie actually has too much plot every scene seems to introduce a new moronic and uninteresting subplot of course they were obviously going for moronic but it doesn't work on any level whatsoever there is only one aspect of this film i enjoyed from the old show <UNK> your shorts has a very small role this is the role that will turn him into the next richard gere though you just watch
<START> i found the episodes to be fascinating and well written as a tv show it was entertaining which is what i expect from fictional entertainment i like the relationship between the professor and his female security guard although sometimes her scottish accent makes it a bit difficult to understand what she is saying i was hoping that there would be more than just four episodes i recognize that one <UNK> reviewer of this series had comments relating to his opinion as a <UNK> i understand this <UNK> comments however this is a fictional television series which is meant to entertain not present precise facts like a documentary patrick stewart performs well and makes his character believable if you want to watch a documentary then this is not the series for you but if you want to watch unique scientific based theories in an entertainment based medium then you will enjoy the four episodes
<START> highly recommended to all those who appreciate watching movies great acting perfectly surreal awkward humor requisite prison sh t accurate depiction of the male condition music is also spot on i think the artist is <UNK> but not sure the short loop of the title credit song on the dvd menu is well timed and sounds like one thing to know is that imdb maintains a ridiculous policy of a minimum comment length based on not characters not words but rather lines <UNK> post quality and <UNK> based on lines in the bold era of and <UNK> web based <UNK> is like smoking <UNK> your comment does not contain enough lines the minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text please see the <UNK> attempts to pad the comment with junk words can result in your account being <UNK> from future <UNK>
<START> margaret mitchell <UNK> in her grave every time somebody watches this mess fine <UNK> and sets can't even begin to <UNK> lackluster performances by <UNK> <UNK> as the title character and the ever bland timothy dalton as <UNK> even worse than the acting and perhaps partially explaining it is the script which is <UNK> cliched and predictable add to that <UNK> bad script a score that'll have you cringing and you've got a disaster i wouldn't wish on any viewer scarlett is just amazingly lousy and i can't imagine how it ever got made much less made it to video
<START> i read most of the comments here were everybody saw only the flaws of the movie i agree the director it's not the actors are not oscar winners but it has something everyone could relate to i don't want to spoil but telling more then the plot the finishing of school and the trip to a big party or if you like to see beyond the metaphor is choosing the way <UNK> life remember that days of youth the days when you or our friend acted like the characters or do you think you should acted like one of them and now you regret you didn't if you can go back in to that time and if you can ask yourself any of this questions maybe the movie wasn't so bad
<START> as if the world needed another seagal movie add a bunch of actors who well are not really actors a bunch of heavy metal music to compliment the rap and of course a hot looking crazy chick in leather with no <UNK> and we prevent ourselves from being half past budget why oh why do people <UNK> themselves by <UNK> in such films br br fbi capture two buddies and send them to new <UNK> where the <UNK> first <UNK> to be executed has unexpected guests br br first rate acting all around particularly any scene involving tragedy for the good guys seriously though the director did try and pulled a modern hard edge for the movie the best he could be he went to the well too often and half past dead gets boring too soon what else can you do when the inmates just hang around talking while the <UNK> continually ask what makes the main bad guy motivated a mindless action flick that amounts to little if not a
<START> there are a whole lot of movies primarily from the 80s that are so terrible that you can't help but love them the last <UNK> party is one of those i hate this movie so much but it still remains one of the most watched movies in my collection i have watched it countless times and get a huge laugh out of it every time it is the prime example of how in the 80s any movie could get released br br our killers name is maniac scary huh is an escaped <UNK> killer running around in doctor's <UNK> and a doctor's jacket <UNK> off people with a <UNK> as he goes along he ends up coming across a house of girls that are having a <UNK> party one of the girls is the daughter of the doctor that tried to operate on and ended up pulling him down in some kind of sexual position lol just watch the movie to know what i am talking about now i know what you must be thinking at this point this must be another cheesy low budget hack and slash flick like <UNK> party massacre or <UNK> day massacre right no this movie is horrible first off the quality of the film changes off and on throughout the film sometimes it will look like it could have been filmed this year but other times it is so grainy and <UNK> that it isn't even watchable the funny thing is that certain specific camera angles will be <UNK> and grainy and other specific camera angles will be clear and perfect which is absolutely ridiculous and proves that they did not care at all br br the director played the killer as if that wasn't funny enough but because of the fact that he wasn't talented enough to act and direct at the same time he just filmed one shot of him walking toward the camera with his <UNK> and then just <UNK> that clip over and over every time someone is killed br br the characters in this movie are completely ridiculous and unlikable and these people who are suppose to be ages 16 18 look more like they are 25 45 i know that slasher films <UNK> use adults as teenagers but i have never seen a movie where it was this obvious my guess is that the reason none of them are still in the film industry today is because they have all died of old age or maybe it was just because this movie was so horrible that they never wanted to show their faces again and that is a good thing because i highly doubt that they could have gotten into any more movies even if they tried all i can do is hope that tyler will one day make the last <UNK> party 2 the final conflict and have all of the original actors return i'm sure everyone would love that br br the movie was directed by stephen tyler no not the singer who never went on to direct again and it was released by b s which i am sure stands for bull and productions bull s only released one more film forever evil which was pretty awful but not near as bad as last <UNK> party br br a horrible horrible horrible film highly recommended
<START> any chance to see <UNK> hepburn in something i haven't seen or from her early movie career is a treat and on that level the film is amusing but she's horrible miscast as a hill billy her famous new england <UNK> slips through making lines like i'd better <UNK> up some pretty ludicrous she's so pretty and so it almost <UNK> this major flaw the story is an old fashioned melodrama and there <UNK> a younger generation may think this pretty corny stuff but this was the <UNK> of american entertainment well into the 1940's it has its moments but you might need to be a die hard movie buff to appreciate it
<START> i hadn't seen this in many years the acting was so good as i began this time i thought great another movie i <UNK> as a foolish young man but then the theme started to be clear and i felt the same way br br this was hollywood the seat of <UNK> so the concept shouldn't be a surprise but it is so condescending a concept i feel as if i need to take a shower after watching it in brief it tells us that even physically ugly people can seem beautiful to each other and even feel attractive br br dorothy <UNK> is likable as the <UNK> heroine she seems to have been filmed wearing minimal make up robert young is injured in the war and feels <UNK> his parents can't bear to look at him either he seems to have all his <UNK> and in part the notions of <UNK> are <UNK> br br herbert marshall is on hand as a blind <UNK> his character speaks is <UNK> tones and is <UNK> br br the best performance is given by mildred <UNK> as the owner of the title <UNK> she is bitter and <UNK> but not made of ice her story is much more interesting and believable than that of <UNK> and young
<START> i'd give this film a zero if i could how anyone could rate it any higher is beyond me until i saw <UNK> this was my pick for worst film ever from a major studio with a real budget claiming <UNK> 2 or <UNK> in the hood as the worst ever isn't really saying much those are supposed to be bad br br tim mom must have needed surgery or something for him to agree to this non <UNK> garbage i'm really not sure what happened here the novel was great the director frank marshall had a solid track record with alive and <UNK> perhaps they should have changed the title to <UNK> the cast was good and the budget was there you'd think someone would have bothered to read the script br br you'd be better off watching battlefield earth again than wasting your time with <UNK> makes you long for the return of mst3k
<START> first off the first thing that came to my mind after i finished this film last night was why the title of <UNK> 2 because i saw the first one obviously and what did this have to do with the first movie's plot the only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to go into the porno industry and that wasn't even needed in the plot because after you see the ending that i will not spoil it just didn't make any sense br br a <UNK> and his fiancée are in <UNK> and notice a woman who is swimming naked in the pool area she's very attractive so when they see her at a club they decide to have a little fun and have a steamy <UNK> but things get extremely intense when the <UNK> is <UNK> pictures of them all having the affair <UNK> that it might go public and <UNK> his career they pay off the guy who sent the pictures the <UNK> freaks out and kills the guy leading into a murder case he and his decide to find the girl they had the affair with but things just get deeper and darker as they go further into what they got themselves into br br what could have been an alright thriller turned into an unexplained and not well thought out movie which was sad like i said the title really has nothing to do with the first one so don't fall for it it's just a sexual thriller that makes no sense but it's good for those nights alone because quite frankly this is one of those films where it's so close to porn that it might as well be labeled as soft core br br 4 10
<START> another <UNK> welch classic this picture hit the theaters november 10 1969 starring <UNK> welch as <UNK> james <UNK> as joe and luke <UNK> as alan morris <UNK> is on her way to meet with her girl friends <UNK> and jackie while on her way there she runs into her ex husband who wants a second chance <UNK> walk away from him goes to the table where she sees <UNK> and jackie alan approaches her again and she starts to walk away when alan shoots her in the back <UNK> is taken to the hospital while <UNK> and jackie go to the police station <UNK> goes to the hospital where she meets up with jackie only to find that <UNK> died alan then goes after jackie who he hits with a car and then tries to run <UNK> down <UNK> jumps into her car and heads for los angeles when she gets there she calls lloyd her boss in las vegas to let him know that she was all right lloyd tells her to go to the club called the losers to see <UNK> about a job however there's one problem the bartender has a drug problem and alan knows it so alan and the bartender have a little talk back in los angeles <UNK> not only gets a job as a dancer with <UNK> but also <UNK> up with <UNK> <UNK> joe now some thoughts on this picture this picture was far better then <UNK> last and this one had <UNK> action luke <UNK> did a fine job of playing <UNK> ex husband he was your typical murder with the look that goes with it as for <UNK> welch performance the only word that comes to mine is fantastic she was awesome in this movie and her beauty stood out and <UNK> like never before the outfit that she wore on stage to dance was breathtaking in fact all the outfits she wore in this movie were breathtaking of course it doesn't matter what <UNK> had on because she looks good in everything or nothing i give this movie 10 <UNK> stars for two reasons the first and by far is <UNK> welch who's the leading actress and deserves 10 stars the second reason is that this movie was wall to wall excitement from beginning to end
<START> while this movie did have a few scary moments great use of music and film angles to build suspense it's obvious director ethan <UNK> and scriptwriter eddy didn't waste any time <UNK> their subject matter which also makes me question their claim that the <UNK> scenes were <UNK> by a genuine catholic bishop br br amongst the many inconsistencies br br <UNK> the roman catholic priest when we first meet him outside the church is wearing an academic <UNK> over his rather than the typical or academic <UNK> are <UNK> worn by <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> not roman catholic priests br br <UNK> the priest quotes some obscure and disturbing <UNK> about the angels taking up weapons he attributes it to st paul this <UNK> is not from st paul's <UNK> neither is it in the bible i can't even find it in the <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> tells his bishop he doesn't believe in demon possession and turns down the request to study <UNK> but does a complete <UNK> later that same day within minutes of talking to possessed isabelle sure it's possible but a little unrealistic see father <UNK> as a priest psychologist in the original the exorcist for a bit more realistic portrayal of a <UNK> turned believer br br <UNK> the former priest turned is the first to try an <UNK> on isabelle he quotes <UNK> and she quotes back he says i see you know <UNK> <UNK> she <UNK> him that's <UNK> <UNK> they're both wrong br br <UNK> the former priest who just got done performing an <UNK> making the sign of the cross calling on the name of christ <UNK> holy water etc tells <UNK> he doesn't believe in church and he doesn't believe in god maybe he's just conflicted <UNK> <UNK> him to put on home made and have another go at it anyway br br <UNK> the former roman catholic priest crosses himself backwards or eastern <UNK> style as an hispanic roman catholic who used to be a priest he should've crossed himself <UNK> to <UNK> left side to right side of chest br br i had to read into the little side stories to get the notion satan was messing with the whole family not just isabelle but even in the end it was hard to say for sure if anyone was really guilty of the images in their heads or if it was all demonic <UNK> except for the sheriff it's pretty clear he was guilty br br on the positive side isabelle was creepy in my opinion she was the best part of the whole movie and i liked the plot twist with claire br br i'm just not sure if the movie was meant to be serious or a spoof br br listening to the running commentary with cameron and ethan <UNK> i'm inclined to believe it was a joke
<START> spoiler alert br br i have never seen comments on a movie that i disagree with more then the comments people made on this one could learn from critical viewings of this movie as an educational film i rate it highly because it teaches how to succeed we do not watch movies to learn we generally watch for entertainment as entertainment i rate it low the ending is downbeat and cerebral intellectual this conflict results in my eight star rating the movie follows jane craig holly hunter a television news producer the network executive introduces tom william hurt to study for the on air news anchor position tom immediately charms people with <UNK> another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for his on air opportunity aaron altman albert brooks altman knows all news stories inside and out br br the network executive wants on the air and jane <UNK> saying is not ready he doesn't know the news they do not listen to her forced to place on the air jane contacts altman to get information on the news story and <UNK> altman's comments through an <UNK> to while speaks we watch the sharp contrast between altman's jane <UNK> words and as <UNK> everything altman and jane craig say in his ear in order to make it understandable likable and entertaining the audience altman gets a chance on air and the network <UNK> require him to seek <UNK> from the new guy this new news guy <UNK> him this is something altman does not see justified but agrees reluctantly br br <UNK> altman and gets excited noting hundreds of altman's shortcomings in appearance audio and <UNK> altman never considered these things before when he became an expert on the news itself the complexity of understanding what taught him causes altman to have a <UNK> <UNK> attack flop sweat when he is on the air eventually becomes the top network anchor and altman prior to being fired but fails in his attempt for a romance with jane craig because she finds out from altman that sometimes <UNK> circumstances in order to make people like him this turns her off of him this sends the message that in relationships we want people who are genuine and not trying to make us like them br br this movie sends the message that getting people to like you is the most important skill in a job but it is especially true in broadcast news there are many people commenting on how this is the <UNK> down of tv news and how represents a good looking but dumb guy or all style but no substance the opposite is true possessed skills and very complex intellect to get people to like him including the presence of mind to know exactly how he appears and sounds when he is on camera he <UNK> altman to punch a word in every sentence flaw that costs him the relationship with jane craig is that he is too driven to be likable and will fake a situation many people are calling altman very intelligent or brilliant altman played by is not as intelligent as and the flop sweat scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that handles when on the air altman is <UNK> by this fact that he knew the news and <UNK> more by getting people to like him there are also people commenting that these things are <UNK> to the tv news industry the concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job is obviously not popular but my experience <UNK> it is true in most jobs as an education on how to succeed this movie is fantastic albeit <UNK> educational yes but it does not have an uplifting ending
<START> this fox spectacle was a big hit when released in 1954 produced with great music and sets intriguing cast it moves slowly but interestingly edmund <UNK> is strikingly handsome as an egyptian who becomes a renowned doctor <UNK> three stunning women a jean simmons who <UNK> <UNK> him <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> him and a sister gene who wants him as her <UNK> the movie's popularity has not <UNK> since being re shown on <UNK> preferably in widescreen <UNK> is <UNK> great his character apparently striking out with the women and ending up never married and a <UNK> is amazing and <UNK> in her femme fatale role victor mature michael <UNK> peter ustinov co star check it out
<START> i am a big fan of bad horrors cheap horrors b movies and all that bottom 100 movies and i do not deny those are the worst stuff ever to enter the big screen or even your home video for that matter some of them e g the infamous <UNK> the hands of fate are truly bad and watching them especially on your own without any friends and beer around is a torture for a good cinema taste br br la <UNK> <UNK> el however was not that bad well of course it's bad it's silly dated corny cheap etc there's an aztec mummy a tin robot a fat masked villain a mad scientist mexican <UNK> etc the montage is poor the lines well let's say the lines are not theatrical the fx and <UNK> are the best what the mexican low budget production could've offered etc etc still the movie is fun it's so bad it makes you laugh <UNK> for an hour time sure it depends on one's sense of humor however i'm pretty sure la should teach any <UNK> to this kind of cinema how to enjoy it please note the movie lasts for about an hour and i think it's just enough time of silliness one is able to easily <UNK> br br there's also another thing watching la can give you a clue what was the whole sf horror genre concept back in the fifties when you compare it to the present day matrix era of cinema entertainment i think it also shows how both the industry and the audience evolved due to the fact the watches like la still attract full house in the theaters for some special shows movies like this are special alright and very often receive a standing <UNK>
<START> an obsessive love story where the characters have been extremely convincing i think this film highlights the talent of professional actors specially for vincent <UNK> who wouldn't at the time it was filmed be the first character you think of for such a role and yes he did succeed to seduce the beautiful monica beyond the film during this creation i can only say that this film should have been released at it is in the usa instead of thinking of doing a remake it is simply so french almost perverted and yet so true this film should stay <UNK> br br a director that should definitely get more projects as this kind of subject requires the right amount of ingredients to not make it a flop

<START> this film came as a gift a late night offering out of the blue so unlike other reviewers i had no <UNK> whatsoever i found myself glued to my seat as the film slowly <UNK> its own rhythm its own unfolding i was drawn to acknowledge my own deep love and humanity as i <UNK> for good to <UNK> but also forced to <UNK> acknowledge that sometimes i was on the side of the bad guys the film is quite quite beautiful the word <UNK> comes to mind and this more than because the film begins and ends in an far from being depressing or confronting to me the film <UNK> deep suffering and then by its nature with the <UNK> and re <UNK> as well as the deaths the film <UNK> the fact that to quote an aussie poet there is sometimes <UNK> oh gods i feel as tho i've just written a love letter to this film but there it is
<START> i first saw this movie in the night program of one of my favourite tv channels i was hooked from the very first minute nothing is as it first seems lots of suspense great acting from mr van <UNK> and i did not mind the heat in it one bit and best of all you are in for a surprise ending
<START> this movie is terrible it's about some no brain dude that <UNK> some company does <UNK> top have no shame br br
<START> is there any question that jeffrey combs is one of the true horror <UNK> this movie seriously doesn't suck and is sort of funny watching a young combs at work is great but i wish he had had more lines look out for beyond re animator it's going to kick some
<START> i had this dvd to watch thinking that i would see a type of biography o painter <UNK> but the movie was about everything but <UNK> this movie is about a young woman taken away from her family by the holy <UNK> allegedly because she <UNK> jewish <UNK> only because the poor girl did not like eating <UNK> the rest of the movie is about torture <UNK> driven by a poor script can't believe it is by <UNK> <UNK> as i could not believe this <UNK> is directed by mr <UNK> <UNK> centered on a religious man and that young woman and that is all br br ah and there is <UNK> i forgot playing a completely <UNK> role that could be the role of john paul peter <UNK> <UNK> jose or anyone very disappointing one one these movies that will be forgotten for ever if it has not had happened yet rent the name of the rose if you want a movie about the holy <UNK> and i don't know what you should rent if you want to watch a movie about spanish painter <UNK> maybe a director of a good caliber not <UNK> still needs to make it ps the spanish painter <UNK> the title role who is lost in the plot is portrayed by a <UNK> actor something that makes this film even more difficult to be taken seriously maybe next time we should send <UNK> to play the biopic of norwegian painter <UNK>
<START> i recommend that movie viewers if in the new york city area go to the <UNK> museum and get some idea of how closed in and <UNK> the living was for the <UNK> of world war ii vintage <UNK> how much more so that must have been for the <UNK> during world war i it must have truly been hell below br br walter huston and robert <UNK> head the cast of hell below huston as the by the book captain and <UNK> as his free <UNK> number two they're both quite believable as naval officers and the rest of the cast like robert young eugene palette jimmy <UNK> <UNK> evans sterling <UNK> etc fill their roles quite nicely br br the silent service got more popular during world war ii and after it's amazing but i could name a whole slew of submarine pictures like <UNK> run operation pacific of the navy run silent run deep and many more and you'll see the same plot situations in all of them i guess there truly is a limit on situations as well br br jimmy <UNK> performance is interesting he's pretty funny and his scene with the boxing <UNK> while on shore leave is very funny indeed but i'd have to say a character like him in those <UNK> quarters is probably very necessary for <UNK> if you don't have someone like that to break the tension on board a submarine you ought to get one transferred to your ship immediately br br the highlight for me however is sterling death scene very similar to sean in island in the sky it will haunt you long after you've seen this film
<START> the hindi remake of mrs <UNK> starring and directed by kamal <UNK> is a somewhat shoddy version and not as good as expected br br kamal <UNK> clearly struggles with hindi dialogs even after all these years and cannot handle even one scene effortlessly the guy has aged and should give it a rest <UNK> doesn't bring anything new to the role or to the character as say dustin hoffman does to <UNK> or <UNK> actor does to <UNK> character in <UNK> comedy play br br what was the kid doing playing with <UNK> when it wasn't <UNK> most of romantic vs <UNK> <UNK> and then <UNK> walker seem redundant to the main storyline <UNK> bathing scene was unnecessary the family is north indian but must be reminded of <UNK> night by a <UNK> yeah right br br the fine acting skills of not one but four actors namely <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the late <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> have been wasted in this film br br watch the original mrs <UNK> clean crisp and <UNK> with fun quite unlike <UNK> <UNK>
<START> mute witness is a modest yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves the film  written and directed entirely by anthony <UNK>  is a tense action packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences no pointless <UNK> <UNK> or endless plot straight to the point mystery mute witness handles about the vicious topic of movies and is effectively set in russia spoilers since the production costs are cheaper there a us film crew <UNK> moves to russia for shooting a horror film an old <UNK> is used as film location the female make up artist of the team accidentally gets locked up overnight and while trying to find a way out she witnesses the <UNK> of an authentic snuff movie she's caught and tries to escape but since she's a mute she can't cry for help and neither can she explain what she saw to the police properly the girl's life is in real danger now since there's a whole hidden network behind these snuff productions and they don't want the witnesses to be end spoilers mute witness contains multiple highly <UNK> action sequences and is rather bloody some of the mystery clues are effectively kept secret till the very end regarding the similar topic i'd say it's definitely better than the more famous 8 directed by joel <UNK> and starring nicolas cage the acting in mute witness isn't great but the leading actress who's russian herself looks really cute sir alec guinness makes a special appearance too and a very cool one i may say surely recommended with guaranteed fun and scares
<START> they loved him up and turned him into a horny <UNK> god that gets to me every time br br this is a great movie memorable lines from thank god your <UNK> died given birth seen ya died of shame to i don't understand big dan great scenes from the opening train scene laughed so hard i cried to the <UNK> br br watch it it's good it's great it's funny and it's based on a famous story worth your while believe me don't watch this if you have a weak <UNK> for you will definitely wet your pants laughing
<START> the basic plot is good and can be engaging the music is so great that it became the theme music for the tv show iron chef though it is way <UNK> and too <UNK> in the movie so how did this movie end up so poor well the plot was about 95 predictable and the characters were about as 1 dimensional as possible and the dialog what person would actually allow themselves to receive credit for coming up with the stupid macho bull crap that <UNK> to be dialog you get much greater realism from most cartoons the bottom line is that this movie has some good points but is so marred by hackneyed clichés and rotten dialog that it quickly becomes tiresome and this is a shame because <UNK> deserve a better tribute than this mess if you don't believe me look at the number of goofs listed on imdb for this movie way in excess of what you'd expect to find they just didn't care enough to work out all the <UNK> and problems so as a result the movie seems rushed and in need of a re write and re editing
<START> this is a slightly uneven entry with one standout sequence involving an over the hill gang <UNK> in the diner that once thirty years previously was their <UNK> one ho hum <UNK> between two <UNK> rock a <UNK> kidnap turned on its head and an opening sequence plus <UNK> involving heist artist wannabe edward <UNK> and current <UNK> property anna which has its moments no movie in which jean <UNK> appears can be <UNK> lightly and here he shines as one of the over the hill <UNK> indeed the film is worth seeing for <UNK> alone but each of the sequences has something to offer and it's definitely worth a look
<START> cartoon like special effects horrible acting and dialogue and dry plot this movie has it all my friend and i went to blockbuster to find a horrible movie that we could make fun of but this was just too much the movie begins with a women and her son <UNK> on a made up island in the region the women who just happens to be a doctor is in the area when a man <UNK> he has a strange wound on his arm and she immediately knows that it is a <UNK> virus the story goes on to show <UNK> fast romance between the two teenage leads this is justified by the girl saying i know it's fast but it just feels nice anyway the entire island gets infected with this virus and the is brought in we are told that within three months if the virus is not treated and contained that it will spread to the united states and kill millions of people this information does not stop the from leaving the island to save themselves thankfully the cure to this horrible virus is found just in time and the entire island is saved to celebrate the death of there loved ones the island people have a <UNK> party where everyone is dancing having fun and forgetting about the horrible <UNK> that just occurred
<START> this was a shockingly bad movie and i literally <UNK> the first time seeing the blue screen puppets imagine the worst blue screen special effects you ever saw make it somehow far worse and then combine this with poorly made rubber and play <UNK> puppets that look like something from a semi retarded pre school art class then add some <UNK> esquire <UNK> metal guitar <UNK> stuff that is way too loud and lasts way too long the overall film is absolutely awful and makes look like <UNK> its one of the worst movies i've ever seen with every <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> much like a <UNK> turd in the <UNK> slow <UNK> of a broken rest stop toilet still though a film like <UNK> is not to be missed by the bad movie out there even if only by looking up clips on youtube or <UNK> this movie is a bit of an eye opener if you can stomach the ride i think this director may be mentally ill though which is a bit watching him discuss the project you get the sense that he truly believes that he's created something wonderful i guess he's the star wars kid of <UNK> filmmakers what a mess
<START> i just wanted to say that i was very disappointed after seeing this movie i was expecting a biblical story <UNK> with great special fx etc but during the film i found out that this was an absolute disaster it wasn't biblical at all only the boat and the animals were similar to the story if you want a visual of the bible version of <UNK> then don't go watch this movie
<START> this is another bollywood remake of a hollywood movie <UNK> if i'm correct br br the film has some great moments which will have you laughing out loud which frankly only come from govinda who has become a legend within indian cinema and will always bring his a game in terms of comedies another bonus is <UNK> <UNK> who is hilarious as the gangster who <UNK> an indian icon of cinema lara <UNK> is a plus i know i sound shallow but its mainly because i have a soft spot for her she tries to be funny but its seems to be forced her acting is weak but she still shines salman khan is atrocious he tries to bring the cool charming depths but fails miserably he over acts and keeps shouting for no apparent reason br br not acting mate thats called being mentally br br <UNK> <UNK> is just bad not very good at anything no charisma no talent and i don't see why people consider her pretty the plot was far fetched and i had a hard time believing that character was remotely attracted to govinda the only good thing is the music <UNK> my <UNK> was the best in the soundtrack
<START> the movie was pretty bad it's not so much a script problem it's just that the movie is really boring in terms of pacing the movie just seems to <UNK> along at a slow <UNK> rate the story in san is that there's a serial killer on the loose who is killing morally corrupt individuals maybe i read too much into it but hey it's my nature apparently after the san kills a pair of people under the golden gate bridge we're introduced to one of the main characters of the film joe <UNK> brother of martin sheen as a cop named bill <UNK> bill is currently trying to hunt down the killer seriously he doesn't have a name he's just the killer and he is trying to <UNK> a local news reporter named rita to help him with his investigation bill is the stereotypical hard edged cop and he threatens rita to throw her in jail for <UNK> of justice anyway a few scenes pass by and suddenly rita finds a letter left by the psychopath he's a cold blooded psychopath and she has a change of heart and tells bill and his partner joe about it and help them with the investigation br br the movie tries to be a taut murder thriller but sort of just fails at that it's much like the movie the black <UNK> it tries to be tense but it just is unbelievable in terms of that the movie tries to be serious throughout but it has scenes like where the killer <UNK> obviously a fan of gore porn what with lines like <UNK> blood on her or something to that effect and joe <UNK> hitting the table going he's a cold blooded murderer i admit to <UNK> more than once at the movie even though i'm sure it was intended to be a deadly serious movie br br one of the only positive points the movie has going for it is the fact that i didn't pay money to see it <UNK> netflix and it's sad because i could see some good in their movies after watching the damned sure the movie had its fair share of flaws but it was enjoyable sadly though san has nothing going for it granted it has an okay script it's nothing too grand but it could've been interesting instead what you get is a murder thriller that fails to thrill or have even vaguely enjoyable deaths also the other reviews claim that the movie has a great twist ending that's shocking apparently i was watching a different movie because by about the one hour mark i sort of figured out what was going to happen the ending didn't shock me in the least bit i would go on insulting this wreck of a movie but i don't think i will long story short this movie is a boring uninspired thriller i use that term loosely that fails to have the <UNK> thrills that another reviewer claims to have a predictable ending bland deaths acting with all of the emotion of a <UNK> of wood and a decent soundtrack br br i'm sure others will try to defend this with the usual it was a low budget movie they did the best they could with such a low budget and all that other nonsense but when you get right down to it there was very little that they could've really spent that budget on there was very little special effects work the soundtrack sounds like it <UNK> been recycled from hood of the living dead or the damned and it's the same damn crew from those two films this movie really reminds me a lot of another low budget flick that was no good and it was called mr <UNK> the two are about the same quality they fail to deliver anything close to enjoyment and should fade quickly into obscurity
<START> starring james belushi peter alex and jason lee underdog is a true hero's tale here is the story of a regular playful little when he is dog by a <UNK> midget hell bent on destruction something freaky happens br br our quirky little neighborhood <UNK> <UNK> extraordinary powers he can run as fast a <UNK> fly as fast a superhero and has the power of thunder he is no longer he is underdog  the best crime fighter in the animal kingdom the city cannot sleep until underdog it of the evil midget dr simon and his <UNK> br br if you fancy some really light hearted entertainment with all the clichés of superhero action flicks then this one is for you as for quality entertainment this one is strictly for the <UNK> those of you hoping to enjoy the comedy of the fast <UNK> star james belushi a word of caution this is not one of his <UNK> works
<START> with two old friends br br i've always enjoyed both <UNK> and films and of course their team efforts are always worth watching and often hilarious br br although i didn't personally regard this film as in the hilarious category it is certainly a competent and entertaining vehicle for fans of the two principle actors and of 60s style romantic comedy plots br br brent <UNK> may actually steal the show in terms of laughs as the arrogant and <UNK> cruise director br br gloria <UNK> proves that senior ladies can remain enormously attractive
<START> being an american service member please believe me when i say that this movie in no way accurately portrays the emotional state of our soldiers sailors <UNK> marines returning from <UNK> br br that being said br br this movie is one large steaming pile of cliché the acting as awful with the exception of the little girl the character's backgrounds are weak and laughable and plot is ludicrous br br this movie is so bad i made an account with imdb just to warn anyone with half a brain away from it br br canadian writer director <UNK> should be really really really ashamed of this movie if he <UNK> with us foreign policy he should write a letter to the us government not <UNK> the entire english speaking world with a <UNK> crap film
<START> words cannot describe how <UNK> juvenile and repetitive this steaming pile of a series is it relies on 3 things 1 constant 80s pop culture references 2 the tired stretch out a joke to the point of <UNK> bit and 3 at least 3 or 4 pointless flashbacks per episode the only reason i can see for this crap fest being as popular as it is for the constant pop culture references which i suppose <UNK> an <UNK> lol that's from <UNK> that is so totally ironic and i am so edgy and smart for getting it response from the viewer the writing is beyond lazy and <UNK> to its viewers mostly in their <UNK> and 30s plus there's the character design which seems to consist of the same three characters with the same bored expressions drawn over and over again but with different skin colors and maybe a different <UNK> occasionally insulting crap
<START> the <UNK> as a concept is an interesting idea but i'm afraid is miscast <UNK> if given the hard man role is his element as in lock stock and snatch in this movie <UNK> plays a newspaper sports writer to be precise who during the course of the movie is easily is beaten up with ease and <UNK> over a balcony by a man who 10 15 years his senior i'm sorry <UNK> is tough looks tough and has so to cast him like this is foolish trying to investigate the double murders of a friend and a drug addict found near the <UNK> he takes on the role of policeman whilst the real police are bit part players with flashbacks from charles dickens br br when <UNK> is on screen his reputation <UNK> him he looks tough but <UNK> in this part need act tough <UNK> at the camera in parts if you watch the mean machine he is perfectly cast and believable and does a very decent performance br br getting back to the movie what <UNK> the matter somewhat is the flashback to charles dickens who is <UNK> a different story with characters who are also appear in present day these two stories are it appears unrelated apart from the same actors are used br br the sound on the movie especially from julie cox is <UNK> at times and not really fleshed out what her role in the movie is short of love interest she starts the film as a but quickly becomes the girlfriend br br the death of the prostitute is sort of answered but yet not answered strip out the charles dickens stuff and you may have a decent movie br br <UNK> is slowly becoming steven segal stick to the supporting actor role <UNK> quite good at it
<START> <UNK> things was one of my favorite stephen king books but this movie is one of the worst book to film adaptations i have ever seen they changed so many things around that it made me sick even the concept of the book being deception things not always what they appear reminder throughout the book was not shown in the movie <UNK> it was enjoyable as many stephen king films are but as many stephen king films this one did not follow the book and became a piece of hollywood trailer trash 2 10
<START> unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that jim carrey producing and starring and brian have worked on together but bits of it are definitely worth a look for laughs basically dick <UNK> carrey thinks he is being promoted to a better job that's until the company of sinks and <UNK> down now dick and his wife jane <UNK> <UNK> and their son of course are in trouble with money no matter what they try they can't raise the kind of money they really want so they start robbing a few places and then they decide to rob the guy that set dick up his ex boss jack <UNK> alec baldwin i think the most laughable bits are when <UNK> in the elevator singing i believe i can fly and the bit when he ties up someone in a robbery and is speaking with a voice <UNK> he sounds like a crap robot okay
<START> i watched this movie for the hot guy and even he sucked he was the worst one well okay i have to give props to that freaky police officer rapist guy too he was even worse the guy wasn't that cute in the end he had the most terrible accent and he was the most definite definition of <UNK> idiot that can't stand up to his mom for the one he loves there's ever been overall and if this makes any sense to you when i go to pick up movies at the video store i think to myself as i read the back of a movie that looks so so well at least it can't be worse than <UNK> moon the most terrible movie and the most terrible writing acting plot everything in it made my gag <UNK> want to do back <UNK> it was the most horrid movie i will ever see with way up there too i hated it and trust me if there was any number under 1 imdb had for rating i'd choose that in a <UNK>
<START> apart from the low budget there never seems to be more than 50 germans in one scene at any one time plus the same 2 half tracks this film is absolute top class everything is accurate that is the point i think from the uniforms to to the horror and the <UNK> everyone is as grey as the field grey uniforms grey men with the life <UNK> out of them forget us made <UNK> ho rubbish like <UNK> down and private ryan this is one of the best war films ever only cross of iron beats this for tension and story please could we have a proper un dubbed german language with english subtitles version in the uk without having to pay ridiculous <UNK> charges from europe most other dvd's are <UNK> why not this one
<START> wow was this version of the <UNK> tough to watch while none of the other reviews have mentioned this the public <UNK> version i watched was seriously flawed the sound track was off by about 10 seconds meaning the dialog and action never came close to matching so you'd hear something occur well before you saw it a very confusing <UNK> the worst is where you hear a gun shot and only later <UNK> the guy get hit and <UNK> to his death in a taxi br br while this seriously marred the film it also made <UNK> on the dialog easier and showed the serious shortcomings of it as well the dialog was simply awful often delivered with almost no <UNK> or feeling as one review said it was like watching a high school play part of this is understandable as sound was a new medium but this film's dialog was bad even compared to other <UNK> films really bad and like many of these early sound films the film was just too talky with sappy and overly melodramatic language and just not much action and you'd think with a title like the <UNK> that there would be some action however it's really a sappy romance with very little action br br the film finds carol lombard <UNK> with an alcoholic musician she herself ends up stealing to try to take care of him and the crook robert armstrong comes to her assistance when armstrong catches her cheating at cards he covers for her and then helps the drunk brother to get on his feet and naturally he falls for her in the process the problem is that once the drunk <UNK> up he too wants lombard and she needs to choose between them wow a recovering drunk or a mobster talk about a couple great <UNK> overall it's a bit hard to rate considering the lousy print i saw however even if you ignore this the film has a lot of problems due to its poor use of dialog and <UNK> talky nature and it was sappy too boot
<START> this is an early one from the boys but some people may not be satisfied with this one like all the others i found it to be different somehow than the your average <UNK> slapstick it was more funny for it's jokes rather than the poke in the eye or slap watch for a hilarious part when larry grabs the <UNK> from moe and sings into it moe gives him a good <UNK> that part made me crack up for a good ten minutes another hit for the stooges
<START> what an atrocity i am not one to demand total <UNK> from a movie but the plot and screenplay of killing <UNK> are so <UNK> that i found myself <UNK> through the entire mercifully short ninety minutes of the film br br readers of these reviews will by now have figured out the plot <UNK> a call girl who falls in love with american <UNK> is also an employee at the bank that <UNK> will help rob in a high stakes <UNK> day heist br br the film <UNK> one's credibility from the get go <UNK> and night of magic is highly <UNK> and claims to have experienced the <UNK> of a lifetime would seem to reflect the <UNK> lingering teenage fantasies more than any actual on screen chemistry complete indifference when his friend eric throws <UNK> out of the hotel room hardly sets the stage for their later strong <UNK> br br in act two <UNK> band of <UNK> drug <UNK> losers leading a <UNK> life of petty crime prepare for their big heist with a night on the town here roger main goal seems to be to prove that he knows something about drugs a secondary thread involves convincing us by endless <UNK> that eric is really really glad to see his old friend <UNK> again really glad <UNK> devil may care over the top <UNK> and affection for <UNK> isn't even remotely believable check out for example his phony <UNK> at discovering a dead cat in his apartment building development of the characters who will <UNK> us through the rest of the film is an <UNK> br br the heist is a disaster understandable since the plan is laughable and the criminals are complete amateurs this is where continues to pay tribute to his idol quentin tarantino by showing that he can be more violent than violent in reality though he's just more boring than boring to build up the excitement there is an extra security guard hidden inside the main safe this was boring in video games and it's boring now br br <UNK> is taken hostage during the heist but despite our expectation that she'll play a pivotal role she just sits pretty or more precisely fails to do anything with her in literally the last five minutes she springs to life breaks the hostage situation and saves the grateful but still <UNK> <UNK> from suffering any consequences of his crime why she doesn't mind his involvement in the crime or why she gives a damn about him at all is impossible to tell after all she's had no chance to see that he's any more decent than the rest of the gang br br throughout the dialogue is stilted and phony much of it is in french as a native <UNK> i can that it doesn't ring even remotely true <UNK> <UNK> sweet <UNK> rapidly <UNK> with tough guy <UNK> is meant to be at turns charming and scary but is instead just grating meanwhile his <UNK> cat <UNK> are more scooby doo than thomas crown when eric is <UNK> down in a ludicrous example of excessive force we can all breathe a sigh of relief like the bank <UNK> we will soon be freed from this miserable ordeal
<START> i always try not to be harsh while <UNK> something that i didn't like but after watching this mini series i was so disappointed that could not help my <UNK> on the one hand it is true that series stayed faithful to the novel and of course i found that very nice but on the other hand terrible casting poor acting especially of key characters  like funny price impression of stage play i mean theatrical way of acting makes you <UNK> from the beginning to the end i am sure with this budget even if it was low could have been done something much better and worthwhile it is up to you to watch this series but personally i don't advice you to spend your time on this disappointing
<START> as other reviewers have noted this movie is a cross between i e stolen from stories we have seen before specifically this looks like clint eastwood in high <UNK> drifter inserted into mad max remove <UNK> <UNK> and replace with a cigarette remove his horse and give him a high tech motorcycle and <UNK> an updated drifter in this movie the hero is even more blatantly a <UNK> than high <UNK> drifter now our hero has long brown hair suffers a wound to his left side and his entry into town is <UNK> by a <UNK> for salvation by the surviving <UNK> a pretty transparent reference to a second coming i watched the movie on a hot <UNK> morning sleep was impossible and upon <UNK> at 4 30 am there was nothing else on tv so the movie served its purpose while unoriginal with characters that are almost comic caricatures the movie is still somewhat entertaining at least at 4 30 in the morning
<START> this is one of the best bloke movies from the early 90's and whilst slightly dated its one of those movies that would never get made today which makes it very special in fact a very similar movie was made in the 90's called <UNK> and it was a pg variation on the same theme but it was nowhere near as fun or realistic for that matter br br so what's so special about this film it's the between the main characters and the against all odds theme of the film sean <UNK> is very likable and has starred in some of the most memorable films of the 80 90's particularly the <UNK> he also went onto greater things with <UNK> and the lord of the rings trilogy but <UNK> man is a good trip down memory lane will <UNK> from stand by me lends nice support to the film and andrew <UNK> is a terrific villain louis <UNK> jr <UNK> in his role but he does add some <UNK> to the film particularly his relationship with <UNK> rebellious nature br br so <UNK> the action by today's standards it's rather tedious and cheap looking almost like a tv movie but the production values are good and the violence is actually quite nasty for a film involving school students however the director makes up for the limited budget with some nicely suspenseful moments and well placed humor br br so park your brain at the door and enjoy this <UNK> remembered action flick but don't expect oscar material
<START> i rented this movie not knowing what to expect but <UNK> was i in for a treat br br for anyone who like myself was waiting for a good movie that combined horror and sci fi it is time to <UNK> because the wait has finally ended writing acting filming and directing all top notch i hate to admit it but i actually cried at one point when dracula was talking to the crippled guy truly an emotional roller coaster from start to finish the corridors of the ship provided the perfect spooky setting for this tale and the actors were really able to make their fear come alive to me and <UNK> as a vampire very nice br br and believe me as great as the bulk of the movie was the ending will blow you away i know this movie gets a lot of <UNK> on this site for some reason but i know none of you saw the ending coming brilliant
<START> leno talks through his punch lines this <UNK> the joke for those of you who haven't figured it out his show is held in a <UNK> sized studio for a reason or two reasons the small amount of laughter will be <UNK> and few want to see him <UNK> set is the polar opposite ed sullivan would be proud and the balcony is always full br br nbc tacky nbc will never get it <UNK> david <UNK> enterprise continues to be all about the money at least cbs has a bit of a family feel to it br br leno <UNK> cars or is it <UNK> while <UNK> races cars the difference is informative br br when i i used to ask other to email me if leno ever said something that was funny i never got a single email <UNK> has superb timing he also can re use the most unfunny joke in such a way that it becomes one of the funniest things in that <UNK> show br br <UNK> has built other careers paul is now well known and respected in his own musical right even paul's other band members get recognition and career <UNK> <UNK> henderson has become a name america knows of even the <UNK> in the same block as the ed sullivan theater get a boost what has leno ever done for anyone else personally i am glad that dave moved and leno got the carson gig i never watched nbc shows before and had no reason to after br br the top ten list is an american icon so is <UNK> leno is a dream nothing more
<START> tom stern and jeremy <UNK> are swing <UNK> planning to <UNK> a casino ala <UNK> 11 and pin it on the <UNK> angels bad move for a film with the words <UNK> angels and the number <UNK> and featuring actual <UNK> angels this movie is surprisingly tame the <UNK> angels truly deserve a better film to be centered around them not this luckily this is one of the dvds that features commentary by joe bob <UNK> so the pain of having to sit through it is greatly if you watch it any other way let me recommend something to you don't br br my grade d br br dvd extras joe bob commentary <UNK> van <UNK> message to her fans she has more than one photo gallery theatrical trailer and trailers for blood shack hell high samurai cop and the hollywood <UNK>

<START> it is a surprising movie that gets you in your chair waiting for the last minute of the film leaving on your leaps a sweet taste of i want more there are very good actors portuguese actors that have a lot of experience in the world of theater and films it is not a million <UNK> budget film but still we can see the destruction of a car in an excellent perspective that gets you in the movie if you have the opportunity of getting your hands on this excellent film don't wait for another minute just see the film i think that portuguese film are increasing the quality watch out spanish producers the portuguese are getting a high quality standards i saw the film and i'm waiting for more
<START> or anyone else have noticed the fact that first bunch of episodes are inspired too much by 90's flicks br br i mean seriously wife who is trying get someone else to murder his rich husband so she can claim his <UNK> <UNK> students who are <UNK> stopping their hearts to reach memories that are lost bunch of college bodies getting together again to <UNK> on the old days but are not fully comfortable because they did something in the past very bad things <UNK> day is one of my all time favorite movies sadly enough the writing staff behind his turd is bunch of lazy <UNK> who can not come up with their original scripts br br noble idea totally in it's execution
<START> if rich people are different from us because they have more money then film makers are different from us because they think the world cares about their every thought br br this self indulgent piece of tripe seems to have been made just because the director felt it was time to make another movie and someone would <UNK> it not every trivial idea or reflection is worthy of a movie unless you are a college film student trying to complete a course when you don't have anything to say sometimes it is best to remain quiet br br the visuals are not breath taking they are quite ordinary the dialog is inane and unbelievable they speak words no one would every sequence together in situations that are beyond imagination <UNK> f k is finally brought to the screen even if you believe in love at first sight no one falls into bed as easily as these characters they screw before they talk even more unbelievable is an aging <UNK> director finding instant sex with the most beautiful chick in town though gravity is already getting to miss at a youthful age
<START> weird with unnecessary singing and backdrops randomly much of the action will occur on stage giving the feeling of an opera performance none of that explains why this is such a bad film br br it's the impression that either not enough rehearsal took place or that no experienced choreographer was available the acting is flat even the <UNK> <UNK> zhang looks like she's just waiting for her next movement or line you may notice the trivia on this site stating that she spent half a month in japan learning to sign and dance read that again as 2 weeks and things begin to make sense even worse are the little kids who seem to be looking at their parents at the back of the studio rather than at the camera br br the cheap and cheerful <UNK> are just cheap and cheap the editing is <UNK> chops <UNK> with <UNK> of just nothing that adds to anything except annoyance just imagine all the silly dance scenes from the recent zatoichi particularly the closing routine performed by your local high school drama club with one famous actress who speaks in another language but you get her in simply because she's so good normally despite being <UNK> recorded on a cheap camera and then edited into three times its length in no <UNK> order
<START> i couldn't stop watching this movie though it was far past my <UNK> br br comparisons to hitchcock are deserved this thing really plays with you it walks a wonderful line between real immediate suspense and a dark <UNK> humor like many of <UNK> heroes our <UNK> eyed mute witness has <UNK> stumbled into something truly horrific and we are taken on quite a ride with her at turns <UNK> totally and feeling her fear at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in <UNK> br br the filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out right from the opening shots they engage and challenge you to determine what is real and what is <UNK> who is to be trusted and who is a monster the plot twists and turns <UNK> suspense is created with a combination of carefully chosen <UNK> imagery music but most simply the eyes of the characters which sends raw fear right into you br br a warning there is some <UNK> real gore as well as some nudity the horror scenes are done in an emotional way that make them far more scary and disturbing than in any teenage slasher <UNK> br br and a teen slasher <UNK> it ain't the characters are quirky and feel like real people for one thing a couple including the heroine you may even find endearing as i did there will be no mistake you're watching a movie made for grown ups i mean alec guinness is in it briefly and you know he didn't need the work br br pop this in the vcr some night when you can't sleep and don't want to yet
<START> this movie is scary at times perhaps no more so than when a naked george kennedy tells his hooker girlfriend he wants a little more sugar thankfully his <UNK> is covered by a <UNK> but the image is still more horrifying than anything you're likely to find in for example <UNK> list br br the dialog in this film was inspiring it inspired me to watch another movie in one scene when a <UNK> remarks about male pilots kennedy asks why do you think it's called a pit charming br br and yes contrary to what some have written this film is very very bad
<START> i wasn't able to last ten minutes on the this terrible film in and age of <UNK> cameras it looks to have been shot on vhs without aid of any color <UNK> or <UNK> br br as a filmmaker myself i know the constraints of <UNK> film making and even keeping those things in mind i'm amazed films can be made this poorly br br the only praise i can offer is that this film got distribution as i've seen considerably better films still seeking modest domestic or international release i'm guessing the box is what sold it it does have good box art but it all goes downhill from there br br side note it seems the director has 11 friends since no one on the this planet would give this film a 10
<START> i was looking forward to watching this movie and it does contain very interesting perspectives from <UNK> all over the country not just in major areas br br however as the film went on and as it seemed to become increasingly more one sided i started wondering who had edited the film to get several hundreds of hours down to just 80 minutes obviously decisions had to be made br br i would have really enjoyed a film that showed how everyday <UNK> felt on all sides of the issues but with the newspaper <UNK> in contrast to what people were saying and with everyone in the movie having the same opinion at the end i thought it was obvious that the editing was done with a pre conceived bias br br it could have been such a great film
<START> beyond the clouds is in many ways the <UNK> film i have ever seen not for its cult appeal gore or even for its ideas but because of the elements that combine to make this a masterpiece of cinema beyond the clouds was directed by <UNK> antonioni one of <UNK> most famous directors however if you gave this film only a quick watch over <UNK> i mean it would seem one of those melodramatic and often pointless romances this movie deserves great attention to the point of <UNK> all its cheese by cheese i don't mean a slice but a whole brick of <UNK> the music seems like it's from some italian porno the story and dialogue like they are from a corny japanese soap and the <UNK> are so obvious you want to <UNK> yourself on the head br br but once you get passed all this you are engaged in an existential work of art the cheese <UNK> into the subtle filming and draws our attention perfectly to what needs to be known the basic plot is of four chapters unrelated and all about love what we learn is that no matter what happens or what is said people cannot communicate to each other instead they can only communicate through each other i suppose that's why the dialogue and plot is so cheesy because the conversations are overly irrational with lack of <UNK> and people's reaction overly melodramatic br br i left that film thinking to myself maybe all life is one big melodrama we judge our feelings towards others as real and <UNK> i hate because i have reason but what does the hated think maybe they think that my hate is stupid and <UNK> in other words melodramatic br br so melodrama is actually an existential function a corny romance is simply human interaction put under a <UNK> glass allowing us to see the <UNK> of who we are and what we do br br this is a great film i recommend it to all
<START> the consequences of love there is really something special about this film but it's very hard to put your finger on it is a love story of sorts but not really one i've seen before it has several love themes running throughout the film one mans love for a younger woman a younger mans love for his older brother the <UNK> love of money at all costs these are just some that <UNK> in a story that has you guessing or rather not knowing where and how it will end the cast are all superb from sophia the <UNK> <UNK> to the straight faced <UNK> of the films central character with simple yet <UNK> camera work <UNK> off an ever changing soundtrack that mixes low fi trip hop with lush <UNK> pieces the style of the film changes beautifully using several styles without ever getting <UNK> love has never looked so diverse and powerful as the tales we are told <UNK> towards various conclusions the director has married old and new into a rich italian classic
<START> if you find the first 30 minutes of this film to be so slow that you wonder why you're watching it don't give up also hearing the danish language is a bit new to most north americans who don't see and hear a lot of danish films anyway as the film progressed it got better and better and the viewer is rewarded for his her patience br br being a fan of the movie out of africa this film <UNK> my interest because it's based on a short novel by karen the major character in that film br br the meal <UNK> feast was amazing i'm no chef but i was impressed how one <UNK> the story too <UNK> i suppose depending on how much you read into this and where you stand religion wise if the latter how you look at the definition of can affect how you interpret this story br br in any case it's a fine film but don't watch this if you're <UNK>
<START> spoilers below <UNK> mother is the story of jesse sissy <UNK> a divorced <UNK> woman who <UNK> <UNK> to her <UNK> mother anne <UNK> that she's going to commit suicide this is a fascinating premise that is <UNK> of all <UNK> and excitement the brilliant hook turns out to be a cheat the story that follows is lacking in substance gravity and <UNK> value where are the shocks and surprises as mother and daughter have what may be the last conversation of their lives where are the secrets revealed the <UNK> and fantasies and regrets they're here but they've all been painted the same dull color that keeps emotion in the background and <UNK> the of playwright <UNK> norman at the expense of everything else the result is not a film but an <UNK> <UNK> test br br let me <UNK> my comments by saying i find sissy <UNK> to be one of the greatest actresses in the history of motion pictures a woman so <UNK> so natural that she continues to surprise and <UNK> me after twenty years of stardom she brings a touch of class and magic to everything she does and i've seen her rescue more than one film from the <UNK> bin with her <UNK> face and vulnerable eyes her soft voice and sweet smile it was because of the great <UNK> that i watched this film in the first place and for one of her movies to be terrible it has to fail in a significant way this film fails in two br br first and foremost the film is adapted so <UNK> from the <UNK> winning stage play that it is claustrophobic and repetitive the entire movie is a two woman dialogue between jesse and her mother what worked on stage a middle aged mother and daughter argue for two hours in small house dies on film a play no matter how great needs to be adapted for the <UNK> it is self indulgent and arrogant to believe that the dialogue is so perfect that not of a word of it can be altered the screenplay for this film could have been <UNK> by thirty to forty pages and a knowing screenwriter would have given the brilliant <UNK> and competent <UNK> some physical sequences some facial reactions something to break up the wall to wall <UNK> fest and prison like single set it is no wonder that the screenplay was adapted by the original playwright <UNK> norman who may know theater but reveals herself here to be clueless in film br br i cannot over emphasize the effect the stage play script has on the film watching jesse and her mother argue about <UNK> impending suicide is redundant and dull the women walk from the living room into the kitchen into the <UNK> and back into the living room where they start all over again a tiny <UNK> house is not the ideal location for a single set film and the director never tries anything clever or original never tries to break up the <UNK> with an exterior shot or <UNK> or a flashback or anything there's no music no other characters no other stories just two women covering the couch <UNK> and arguing their opinions the <UNK> given to the play is even shakespeare's most <UNK> classics get <UNK> up for the screen the commitment to the original play seems almost it's as if the film was made only to document the dramatic treasure that was the stage play with the audience an <UNK> br br the other reason the film fails is anne <UNK> she may be a good stage actress but on film where presence is 80 of performance she rarely seems to fit she certainly doesn't fit here playing a <UNK> grandmother but looking more like mrs robinson before her morning coffee she chases jesse around the house looking more <UNK> than <UNK> and seems extraordinarily unsympathetic even when her lines convey a loving if flawed woman br br sissy <UNK> is great as she always is honest and open and so good that you actually understand and agree with her character's choice sissy lets us see that jesse is a flat tire a wrong turn of a woman who has had every bad break and made too many wrong choices she's never had control of her life and her suicide will be her way of finally saying no more this is where i get off that's how she puts it anyway and when <UNK> you listen she proves in all her films that a good actress doesn't have to behave like a man doesn't have to be all <UNK> and <UNK> and borrowed <UNK> in this and in films like coal <UNK> daughter she quietly demonstrates a soft strength and quiet depth that is as impressive as it is you can't help but fall in love br br that's why it was so hard for me to watch <UNK> mother <UNK> is wasted in a stilted stunt of a film that never serves to engage or even distract i would not recommend this movie to anyone except die hard fans of sissy like myself and even then you'll be disappointed i do give the film an entire letter grade bonus for the ending which is courageous enough to let the lead character do what's right for her and not <UNK> to a hackneyed happy ending grade c
<START> i don't care what anyone says this movie was crap the only thing it had going for it was camera work which was very well done as for the dialogue i have heard so many people talk about it sucked too yes it was honest and true to life but so what i can hear anyone talk like that on the street or in a fast food joint what made the dialogue good in movies like pulp fiction and <UNK> park was the fact that it is written dialogue that takes time to think through another thing was that the director should not have put himself in the picture i believe that the male character could have been a lot stronger but instead it seemed weak in fact the movie seemed to <UNK> around the male character and then he completely disappears in the last twenty minutes the girl in the film i found completely repulsive not in appearance but in her <UNK> <UNK> ways saying she is in love with a guy and actually getting jealous of him the next day what a <UNK> of crap final thing the sound was terrible and i hope it was only something that plagued my theater instead of actually being on the final cut of the film there was a constant <UNK> sound during several scenes and it was actually taking away from the talking going on the one good thing again was <UNK> job as the <UNK> but the actress that played the main guy's ex girlfriend did a very good job as well these two things couldn't save an ultimately terrible movie which i refuse to call a film br br 2 10
<START> i just got home from seeing radio i've not seen such an inspiring story in a long time my kids are ages 8 and 5 and i would like to take them so that they may feel the message as i did you should seek to find the best in people and love them for who they are not judge them for their differences cuba gooding jr and ed harris both deserve academy awards for this movie i don't know why we can't have more movies like this rather than the junk that is served up at theatres on a daily basis
<START> the problem with other actors cast in the of <UNK> gray is that they either looked too old for the part <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> josh david <UNK> ben barnes or that they were unable to pull off the english <UNK> manner without being stilted <UNK> is the <UNK> 19 year old or so all <UNK> skin and locks as described by <UNK> so the challenge is finding an actor that has the maturity and range for the part i e who can portray the <UNK> and but at the same time looks like someone in his late teens and peter <UNK> pulls it all off in this excellent british tv adaptation br br gielgud as henry while considerably older than what <UNK> had in mind does wonders with his scenes <UNK> have never sounded so natural and <UNK> especially george sanders in the 1945 version was pretty feeble by comparison and his costume didn't fit br br finally jeremy <UNK> plays basil as the most <UNK> and at the same time the most gay of the trio again a fitting interpretation in general the film includes enough gay subtext without turning <UNK> himself gay he's all things to all people and supposedly there's no drug or sexual <UNK> he hasn't tried in the 18 years covered by the story but that makes him more than homosexual he seems to equally <UNK> havoc on both <UNK> here as he should according to the novel br br of course the budget of this production was not very large so everything feels a little <UNK> particularly encounter with <UNK> brother suffers from the obvious studio look also the final shot of <UNK> a puppet i suppose in his white <UNK> like make up is more hilarious than convincing and death scene is inadvertently funny also as far as i recall basil should have been killed <UNK> at the table br br but all in all this is a very worthy adaptation i'm sure <UNK> would have liked it the only thing missing is the sensual side not so much sex scenes but <UNK> <UNK> world of <UNK> flowers <UNK> <UNK> and precious gems isn't really explored here i e the <UNK> is completely missing but like i <UNK> the excellent acting makes one easily forget these shortcomings of production values
<START> i don't know who <UNK> it or why but this want to be vampire flick is really awful it tries to be hip and appeal to the young mtv generation audience but it is just downright laughable the acting is horrible and the directing is horrendous i heard the budget was <UNK> 000 i want to know where all the money went
<START> how can this movie be described oh yeah i've got it wretched br br i'm not big on chop <UNK> but this is just plain garbage anyone who would waste their money to pay to see it is just too sad for words
<START> i think josh is so great the rest of the show is fun to watch but i think it is the handsome and sexy josh that makes the show las vegas really fun to see in the days of <UNK> i loved tom <UNK> i thought he was the <UNK> man on the face of the earth a hunk on a television show is a must in order for women to enjoy watching something especially just for purposes of <UNK> entertainment i would have done anything to win a date with tad hamilton josh is incredible and i will always have a super crush on him josh is definitely a hunk and i will watch las vegas all the time josh is a big reason why too
<START> george <UNK> was like boris karloff in the fact no matter how poor the film he appeared in was he would always maintain a sense of dignity and turn in a fine performance the mad monster is no exception to that rule it is by all standards a poor if entertaining film the filmmakers obviously didn't know how to make the most of their low budget and the script seems as if it was turned out in one or two days still <UNK> is fine and believable as the mad scientist br br the film itself is enjoyable on a camp level normal horror movie fans for the most part won't take a liking to <UNK> films however these poverty row productions have a small but loyal cult following occasionally they would rise above their limitations with <UNK> being the best example of this usually they looked like this for all its technically poor qualities the mad monster is an amusing enough way to kill a rainy afternoon the dvd from <UNK> is recommended as it <UNK> this with another <UNK> production the black <UNK> the original theatrical trailer and best of all an interview with glenn strange talking about his role in this movie 4 10
<START> yes it might be not historically accurate actually only 6 soldiers of <UNK> were killed there and yes it has some mistakes and exaggeration <UNK> machine gun come on or the that history lesson about how afghanistan was never <UNK> by anyone educated russian officer would know history much better than that take for example british campaign in afghanistan and yes it does not have multi million dollars hollywood style special effects but it's strongest point in showing <UNK> life there their relationships and their feelings when the best friends are being killed in front of their eyes in my opinion really does a good job showing all those things br br again movie has it weaknesses but in my opinion it appears to be one of the strongest russian movie for the past few years br br 8 10
<START> combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired with a script that the screen writers for touched by an angel might have passed up as being too <UNK> still keeps us interested at times in fact i wanted to focus on the <UNK> but i found the last act so <UNK> bizarre and awful that i think the couple who jumped to their deaths in the very beginning might have been the fortunate ones br br this movie is at heart pun intended a story built on a big twist style ending this kind of <UNK> foundation can result in a tremendous success like <UNK> or god awful garbage like the films of m night <UNK> falls somewhat closer to the latter i found the cinematography in general to be above average the tracking shots of irene <UNK> doing her <UNK> <UNK> in the pool were very impressive as was the atmosphere <UNK> by the interior of her mother's house for me the grotesque parody of <UNK> when <UNK> comes in from the rain and irene poses with him was a bit of a stretch one big issue that i took exception to in this film was method of simply turning the camera directly into the face of his protagonist and recording the emotions taking place this worked to fantastic effect in facing windows but when employed here it seems that is no in fact besides the ridiculous story the main problem with this film is the <UNK> performance of it's main character it made the final breakdown scene even more bad br br in this movie <UNK> continues his <UNK> against our corporate driven societies by <UNK> us to be more spiritual not necessarily religious and more <UNK> and while i'm certainly one who is very sympathetic to this view i felt as if the audience was being hit over the head with a blunt object could the characters have been anymore two dimensional i tended to find this movie very <UNK> and soulless was the evil aunt <UNK> anything more than a caricature it goes for the people on the side of right too like the good aunt maria clara and the elderly <UNK> and just in case we might have missed point he decided to <UNK> his <UNK> forces in their own br br this brings me to an interesting point about the director's use of color he clothes the opening couple who briefly take flight in all black as well as irene when we first meet her and after her life <UNK> the evil aunt <UNK> and of course the good but confused <UNK> black is a color that suggests a definite course the mind is set and <UNK> it is the color of choice for that <UNK> item of modern day armor the business suit it is also the color of mourning such as the <UNK> <UNK> by the <UNK> duo finally black is the color of <UNK> such as the simple <UNK> of priests and nuns that irene <UNK> in the second half of the film br br the other main color and a very appropriate choice for a movie about the sacred heart is red it is a color that has an extreme inherent emotional <UNK> the character who wears red is bold emotional <UNK> to new ideas and indulgent red is a <UNK> color in modern times it challenges our <UNK> of the and at the same time makes the vulnerable yet red carries an enormous weight of history and <UNK> as the earliest members of <UNK> <UNK> man buried their dead in red and indeed the first man named in the <UNK> adam is named after the <UNK> word for red red also has an <UNK> flavor looking back on the past where red and by association a less self driven attitude towards life was more accepted so when we encounter the red filled room the mysterious covered walls complete with a red <UNK> and a red painting of a <UNK> <UNK> of mother good characters maria clara and wearing <UNK> outfits of red and finally the painting of mother in a <UNK> red <UNK> we can see where <UNK> lie br br a word or two about the soundtrack i found the original musical themes to be excellently suited to the story the quasi <UNK> theme that <UNK> irene was great for it's <UNK> and feeling of <UNK> the absolute best use of a constantly repeated <UNK> theme such a this would have to be in kubrick's barry <UNK> with it's masterful <UNK> of an 8 bar attributed to one absolutely inspired choice was a couple of seconds of an opera <UNK> we hear as the power is <UNK> while irene is chasing benny through the house it is of the famous <UNK> <UNK> from opera la <UNK> the <UNK> is sung by the lead soprano who is leaving home forever as mother was a dramatic soprano we can guess that this is a recording of her singing and that she is saying a poignant farewell to her daughter as in the movie irene is soon destined to never again see benny alive i just have one minor question of the soundtrack why include the famous tango <UNK> <UNK> maria i love the song and personally could hear it all the time but it didn't really fit here
<START> murder by numbers is a pretty good movie even though the plot rolls along at a <UNK> pace what with sandra <UNK> character getting all mixed up with her partner and the movie flashing back to a previous trauma situation she had been in it does succeed in keeping the viewer involved in the film br br having said that i do think that it does a good job in setting that eerie sort of who done it type atmosphere it keeps you guessing at which one of the boys really was behind the murder if not both of them i think ryan <UNK> and that other kid lol do a good job of selling that bully versus <UNK> relationship not sure about <UNK> playing a bad ass but for a guy who would later star in a movie like the <UNK> he did a pretty good job once the movie gets rolling though i really found myself involved in the story sort of asking myself oh my god what would i do if i were in that situation like i said a good <UNK> type movie maybe not for the extreme crime drama movie <UNK> but a good all around flick br br 8 outta 10
<START> very stark very drab no real drama why not just make a documentary this isn't exactly the passion of joan of arc the only reason for seeing chronicles is to hear the performances i love <UNK> music and even i found it hard to sit through this misery of a film the great <UNK> plays in two senses of the word bach we don't get much of a sense of him as an actor since he's given so little to do dramatically mostly he gets to walk <UNK> or <UNK> out of various rooms <UNK> life of course was not an errol flynn movie it was indeed fairly drab and more than a little hard this probably means that the life isn't a terrific candidate for a film the music of course is another story i recommend the stations of bach far more information for one thing and some insight into the music which is after all why bach interests us in the first place
<START> a minute to pray a second to die is a quality spaghetti western with a solid cast and an interesting storyline it is filmed beautifully with a relatively high production value for a film in this genre br br alex <UNK> does a terrific job portraying clay <UNK> an outlaw who is suffering from increasingly <UNK> <UNK> he is seeking <UNK> before his enemies close in on him but is being too cocky for his own good when he asks for it robert ryan delivers the best performance in the film as the <UNK> of new mexico mario and arthur kennedy are also great here br br this movie is very good but it doesn't stand out to me as being one of the best spaghetti westerns out there it's lacking too much in style to be in the same league as any of the great ones it does have some cool spaghetti overtones but overall it's a bit too much like an american western this is especially evident in the music score which is ok as movies go in general but pretty dull by euro western standards the soundtrack kind of reminds me of the music from the <UNK> although there is an interesting story here it is told in a manner which is a bit too conventional for my tastes if a spaghetti western fan and a hollywood western fan had to watch a movie together this one would be the perfect compromise br br all of this is not to say that anyone should avoid this film i did enjoy watching it very much as i said it is a very well done film and i recommend it to anyone who likes westerns spaghetti or otherwise
<START> if this movie had a point i never discovered it a very depressing movie which supposedly is about the final <UNK> of the residents living in a <UNK> site area on the <UNK> river in montana the problem is that there is no actual <UNK> river in montana there are several north <UNK> but they are <UNK> of other rivers which divided into north and south <UNK> br br the opening scene of the movie is a coffin <UNK> to the surface of the lake but the scene is never tied into the story and the viewer is left to <UNK> as to its meaning but much is left to the viewer's <UNK> in the movie another example is when a team of <UNK> employees responsible for the <UNK> of the residents arrives at the <UNK> <UNK> another group of people are <UNK> some remark which is almost <UNK> is made about these people which makes no sense whatsoever and there is no <UNK> in the movie to explain it br br the movie is butchered into several stories and the film keeps switching back and forth between stories which is quite <UNK> and the stories are weird in one of them the <UNK> of one property refuse to be <UNK> because they are living in a home that is built like <UNK> <UNK> br br another senseless story centers around a sick orphan who is dying and somehow he is sharing his presence with a house full of ghosts and in an <UNK> with a priest at the same time if anyone can figure out what the ghost story was about the author must have explained it to them br br the scenery was stark and the sun never shines there are snowy mountains in the far distance i guess the purpose was to set the mood the time period is set by the fact that the all drove ford of the 1946 48 era although the events are supposed to have occurred in 1955 the acting was mediocre when i saw the billing for this movie it said that <UNK> hannah was in the picture if she was i didn't recognize her but i <UNK> that she was the ghost lady
<START> about this film was the title song after 30 minutes i <UNK> watching because it was so lame bad story bad actors bad movie if you want to watch a good movie watch pulp fiction instead
<START> in this tale of a tightly wound christian family that has three of its four members born again after a cake caused car crash what really stands out is how grounded most of it is where there is so much potential to go over the top and how truly inspired most of the acting is where most of the film's moments particularly its frank and innocent discussions of sexuality after three of the four family members have their guilt and shame removed is hilarious it is also thought provoking and the characters stay with you br br how often for example does a character in a comedy spin from near caricature to full <UNK> emotional being in the course of one scene how often do we see a cast that can pull back from <UNK> mid sentence in order to show a bit of the humanity beneath the character's skin even many of the bad guys in this film have moments of heart breaking honesty even while much of what they do can be absolutely ridiculous and horrifying there is truth and history behind even the most questionable acts in this film which is a difficult task in satire br br how refreshing it is to see a <UNK> comedy that can dare to be <UNK> how nice to see actors so fully committed to character that they can dare to let them be ridiculous and sublime br br and as a gay person i do not think i have ever been quite so touched by a <UNK> sex scene as i was by the first sexual encounter between the parents of this family after their accident br br bravo bravo one of my favorites at this year
<START> hey you are not alone i remember <UNK> i was just 17 when it was on i remember james garner was one of the coolest actors and <UNK> was such a great show i couldn't believe it was on such a short time wish i could remember the last episode i probably didn't see it there were no <UNK> back then so it when it was on you saw it and if you missed an episode it was gone forever unless it came back on summer reruns anyway sure would be great if it came out on dvd but i don't think that many people even knew about it what a shame br br garner would hit it big a few years later with <UNK> files and he brought along his buddy stuart <UNK> from <UNK> to play his sidekick angel
<START> this movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life while i like how the director chan <UNK> park handled the revenge the move as a whole was terrible <UNK> is only billed at 1 hour and <UNK> minutes long but it feels like it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story i will say that the english dubbing was done very well and the movie was easily understandable i felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and a lot of the dialogue repeated itself also if you have an <UNK> to annoying voices then avoid hearing <UNK> <UNK> she plays <UNK> do speak if you are looking for a movie to kill time and make you feel morally superior to others then watch away if you don't want to watch a movie filled with incest bad dialogue unnecessary fight scenes gross torture scenes and confusing flashbacks then this is not the movie for you
<START> so after the initial disappointment of the first final fantasy movie which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the final fantasy series final fantasy <UNK> children has released itself to a warm reception and now a dedicated <UNK> and the reason for the films success is understandable as it has lush graphics fast moving fight sequences and some cool as hell characters however if you haven't played then it is likely that you will not enjoy this film as it's storyline carries on from the game without previous explanation and your likely to get lost from the plot even if you have played the game secondly there is no character development without previous knowledge from the game your opinions on the characters are limited to <UNK> and <UNK> of course for fans the film is almost guaranteed to entertain at least for nostalgic reasons and it's cool seeing all the characters you grew to love from the game rendered in some pretty amazing computer animation one last complaint the film at least in my opinion attempted to <UNK> too much into less than two hours and therefore the last half hour or so seems horribly rushed if you played and enjoyed than it is a worthwhile watch though nothing too special if you have not played then it is best that you play it first before watching this film
<START> saw the move while in paris in may 2006 i was <UNK> between that and mission impossible i am very glad i choose <UNK> <UNK> not only because it was funny but might as well watch a french movie while in france i had a great time would recommend it it is important to have some understanding the french society of today to really enjoy the humor of this movie cannot wait for the dvd to come out i don't know how some of the de would be translated in english i certainly buy it when it is out p s i saw on de <UNK> which is a movie starring that all kids were talking about in france this movie is a comedy but <UNK> than one can imagine in comparing both movies i have to say that did a good job in <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i hated the first movie is really boring and we only get see the <UNK> at the end br br the plot dead bodies are being found in the new york harbor the police have no clues nor suspects until nick and his colleague realize the killer is a giant <UNK> everybody especially the police captain refuses to believe <UNK> story and soon the harbor will be filled with <UNK> for the 4th of july <UNK> br br in this movie we get to see more of the giant <UNK> and special effects for this movie are really good for it's time br br the acting is this movie not bad but not great too but okay and watch able br br the are some really cheese scenes to movie but if can get past that you should enjoy the rest of movie br br 5 10
<START> only a very small child could overlook the <UNK> in this bomb the first difficulty faced by the submarine is what appear to be <UNK> of rock falling down through the water and crashing into its <UNK> but it's not rock they're under the north pole it is ice everybody except possibly <UNK> mentioned small children and even some of them know that ice <UNK> br br then disaster strikes that darn van allen radiation belt around the earth catches fire no one knows how this happened we are told which is understandable because it is utterly impossible for radiation to catch fire and even if it could there is no air in space for it to burn br br there is literally no good reason to overlook science concepts basic to 2nd grade school <UNK> when making a film however irwin allen manages to do it again and again perhaps we are meant to focus on the people instead which is pretty easy as they are cardboard br br the cast tries very hard not to look embarrassed in this ridiculous sub kiddie romp much like later episodes of his lost in space tv series the concept of which was <UNK> outright from writer <UNK> <UNK> and then rushed into production br br the sub looks pretty good though which is why this one gets a 2
<START> is probably the single worst piece of trash to ever hit the straight to video selection they take a scene from the order starring jean claude van damme and this <UNK> me because van damme is a personally favourite for b movie comedy segal has done some fine work in the past but he has dropped very low in my books and he will probably never pull out another or marked for death unless he sits down and has a very good brain <UNK> session with himself br br it also <UNK> me how he didn't do many of his own stunts like he has done in previous films in conclusion of all this if you are prepared to see a movie fit for a trash can or <UNK> then rent today you die
<START> <UNK> on the moon is almost certainly the strangest most convoluted and most <UNK> giallo ever made it may come as a restraint to some of the sub <UNK> fans but this film doesn't feature many of the regular giallo <UNK> like bloody knife murders preferably committed by a masked killer wearing black <UNK> ravishing scantily dressed <UNK> and unpredictable red herrings however to compensate for all this  and much more  <UNK> <UNK> from the most <UNK> mysterious and non stop compelling atmosphere i ever experienced in this type of film the level of mystery in this movie is so high and unbearable it literally makes you feel uncomfortable and scared like the female protagonist alice herself you absolutely have no idea of what's happening or why and this feeling of utter <UNK> is <UNK> the film's main <UNK> as a viewer you <UNK> to help this poor woman understand the things that overcome her but you simply can't alice has a successful career as an <UNK> but her quiet and peaceful life gets brutally interrupted when she wakes up one morning and slowly begins to realize she has absolutely no <UNK> of the previous three days she finds a torn apart photograph of a hotel located on the holiday island <UNK> and decides to go there in order to investigate what happened on the island several people including a lonely little girl seem to recognize alice only she used the fake name nicole wore a red haired wig and acted like she came to the island to hide from an unknown danger meanwhile even the poor girl's nights are restless as she has <UNK> dreams of <UNK> <UNK> on the moon surface and an uncanny scientist called dr <UNK> the plot of <UNK> is truly bizarre and slowly brooding and particularly the <UNK> sub plot is really difficult to link with the rest alice assumes they are just images from a sci fi movie she saw long time ago which sounds like a reasonable enough explanation but you sense there's a deeper meaning and actual connection to all the other events fans of tension driven and stylish italian cinema can't afford themselves to miss this film really this is director's <UNK> psychological tour de force with <UNK> beautiful photography and mind <UNK> music in spite of the lack of violence or maybe just because of it the film is genuinely disturbing and the mental agony alice goes through honestly affects the viewer emotionally as well as it is sadly too often the case in <UNK> cinema the climax suddenly comes rather abrupt and nearly doesn't give a explanation of all the awkward events you just witnessed for the last hour and a half still the content of <UNK> will keep you <UNK> long after the film has finished and its powerful impact will only increase <UNK> <UNK> is sublime as the tormented leading lady and receives excellent <UNK> from the limited supportive cast including the young the <UNK> euro cult star <UNK> kinski receives top billing as well but his role is merely an extended cameo this film is actually a lot better than director more acclaimed and much easier available giallo the fifth <UNK> so here's to hoping <UNK> will soon receive a fancy dvd release as well
<START> it must be said that the director of the cell <UNK> has quite <UNK> established himself with his first feature which happens to rank as one of the most visually astounding films in contemporary cinema br br the cell is more of a visceral experience than a film as a thriller it rises above most of its peers with competent editing and a chilling score effectively providing an exceptionally suspenseful atmosphere however it is ultimately skill for elaborate and disturbing set design and imagery that carries the film's <UNK> sense of terror br br as with several recent films i have been shocked by the <UNK> <UNK> among those who have commented <UNK> about the cell in <UNK> of the film i will address a few of these issues the plot appears to be the main concern and while it is not revolutionary and borrows heavily from the silence of the <UNK> it was never intended to be the most important aspect of the film the plot itself is a vehicle through which vision simultaneously horrifying and wondrous is presented to the audience much in the same way that the plot of the silence of the <UNK> is secondary to the fascinating study of its two lead characters <UNK> and <UNK> while the silence of the <UNK> is clearly the superior film it is irrational for one to <UNK> the plot of the cell and in the same breath praise that of the silence of the <UNK> br br my final concern is the mention of mtv style directing it pains me to see the <UNK> of directors who use innovative camera and cinematography techniques a camera has the potential to be much more than simply a tool with which to record events angles pans colour <UNK> and so forth are all used to their full extent in the cell with the purpose of creating the sense of a dream like state that could not have been otherwise achieved this is essential to the film as the entire premise behind it is the <UNK> of a serial killer's <UNK> if you simply want a series of static shots stick to stage plays and give up cinema altogether br br that being said the cell is thoroughly entertaining terrifying and breathtaking in both its pacing and design anyone who is able to look past the perhaps uninspired yet never dull screenplay will find one of the best films of the year 2000
<START> i just wanted to leave a quick comment as its not listen on here but i have just seen this movie the version i just rented was released in 2005 as far as i know and it was actually called don't go into the attic i only realized it was the same movie as <UNK> <UNK> upon searching for some of the actors who looked familiar in the movie anyways i'm in ireland so maybe this has only been released over here and in the uk now but thats what its called over here not really like it matters because i would not recommend this movie the only words that spring to mind watching it are cheese cheese cheese my one mark out of ten is purely for the one little <UNK> bit o
<START> oh my god why did i waste my precious time on this film it is pathetic <UNK> <UNK> and unrealistic and one of the worst films i have ever seen in my life yes my life i am embarrassed for <UNK> raj films the poor guys have to live with the horrible news that yes they produced this terrible film br br this is by far the most trashy sexual <UNK> raising movie i have ever seen by <UNK> raj films i cringe for them i really do along with the terrible acting or no acting for that matter by <UNK> combined with the lack of talent of the look at my boobs <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has not one good thing about it at all even the music is not <UNK> the standard left by the director <UNK> did an embarrassingly bad job here br br honestly i expected more much much more
<START> one way or the other you can't get away from the basic message the strong survive those who are <UNK> or emotionally sensitive leave they leave a hole behind in the lives of those who love them a hole that is seen in it's <UNK> as selfish that's what <UNK> realizes in the end just prior to helping wolf <UNK> from his self blame she can accept closure to the missing of her sister beautiful european scenery a lot of truth in it about <UNK> and addiction to the next big moment for a moment i thought of the gang who was around in the early 70s i liked this movie as it reflected a time when i came of age myself
<START> not a bad concept i just wish they had taken it in another direction its a movie that tries to be interesting by shocking you with <UNK> to begin with which works for most people with weak <UNK> but besides this there's not much to this movie its not funny nor is it romantic so please somebody change that label and since i already knew that <UNK> is actually legal most places and a million dollar industry i wasn't really shocked but most people do not know this and i thought that how the movie evolved after the secret came out was just disappointing because it could have been one of those shocking eye opener movies that would teach the ignorant about a fetish that is very much a reality for yes i did my <UNK> hundreds of thousands of people so if you like watching bad movies that you can <UNK> about how you could make them better while watching them than sure have fun doing that
<START> de or the green <UNK> as it is called in english is a very dark comedy about two losers who work for a popular butcher they are fed up with their bosses criticism and decide to start a business on their own their shop is expensive and it doesn't even have electricity all over the place and to make things worse they haven't got any customers as their former boss predicted when the man pays them a visit in their shop he challenges them to provide the meat for a dinner party he <UNK> br br than a tragic accident happens one of the <UNK> locks the <UNK> into the <UNK> chamber when he <UNK> the shop the man dies and the neurotic one of the two <UNK> decides to cut out of the <UNK> and serves it to the dinner party instead of calling the police it's an incredible success all at once every person in the village wants to taste that incredible chicken overwhelmed by his sudden success the butcher sees no other option but to kill more people who he can sell as chicken br br i guess that the subject <UNK> may not be enjoyed by everyone especially not because it is shown with a lot of humor personally i liked it a lot it shows perfectly how far some people would go for some social acceptance and to get out of their isolation it may sound a bit far fetched but i'm sure you would be surprised to see how people in real life sometimes act br br next to the original subject i was also pleased by the actors' performances and the humor there is no overacting as you might expect in this kind of movies it's all very sober and realistic i guess that's typical for the and <UNK> movies the same for the humor i'm sure i wouldn't have liked it as much as i did now if the humor had been over the top or with a lot of <UNK> <UNK> like you see so often in american movies i loved this movie and i give it an 8 10
<START> the movie was very good i'm an avid mystery fan and i usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing while i did figure out who was going to be killed i didn't figure out who did it i wasn't happy with the portrayal of the <UNK> character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that please know that while these <UNK> movies are good they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have <UNK> ms <UNK> and especially <UNK> david <UNK> is definitely <UNK> i have seen every actor who's played him the worst was peter ustinov
<START> the killing yard is a great film although uneven at times morris <UNK> puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and <UNK> prison <UNK> and the presence of alan <UNK> as his defense attorney is none other than genius the emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's flashback scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being <UNK> i was not even born when the riot took place however through extensive research i find that the killing yard does the story all of it's fair i would definitely recommend this film for viewing by any educational or <UNK> group as a much needed learning tool
<START> a coming of age story about a teenager <UNK> against the church and her minister father in a small norwegian village the countryside setting is <UNK> but the story is rather pretentious and plodding with much of the film devoted to <UNK> <UNK> it's like watching a religious propaganda movie who has made only one other movie is pretty good as the sensitive young protagonist as are as her strict father and as a woman that is fascinated with the film aims to be fresh and charming but feels rather stale and tired director and co writer who has worked mostly in tv is not up to the task
<START> minor spoilers br br need any further proof that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ranks among the most original and provocative filmmakers working anywhere today see this film br br working from slight variations of a theme running through most of his work the hole represents a study in alienation and loneliness in this case between a man and woman who are upstairs <UNK> neighbors and how varied <UNK> real or psychological of <UNK> wall people off from one another here the woman the <UNK> neighbor attempts to endure as her apartment is <UNK> by a <UNK> <UNK> from upstairs a <UNK> attempts to locate the source of the problem then disappears after creating a large hole in the floor already isolated and desperate both characters are among the few residents of a <UNK> project who haven't <UNK> in advance of a mysterious near apocalyptic <UNK> the hole <UNK> the two apartments functions first as yet another in a long line of <UNK> but soon begins to take on a significance of near <UNK> proportions br br <UNK> sense of humor and sense of cinematic history is displayed with a bit more than usual as the woman's occasional <UNK> revolving around her upstairs neighbor are <UNK> as musical numbers set to the music of grace chang which explode from the screen in brief bits of surreal romance and humor quite reminiscent of the big screen <UNK> from heaven and for all of the <UNK> and alienation on display here <UNK> <UNK> of late 90s pre <UNK> tensions is funny absurd and gives this film a very appealing the final scene is extraordinary br br meanwhile <UNK> in typical fashion <UNK> most of the usual expectations or <UNK> <UNK> bring to asian cinema with a <UNK> casually revealed <UNK> focusing on both the <UNK> <UNK> of the human mind and the most absolute of there's an utter <UNK> of almost everything about his characters <UNK> or most cultural <UNK> which does <UNK> the isolation of the characters making the hole and his other films rather <UNK> but also always fascinating and insightful
<START> o m g did you ever think they would make a movie about it well i knew they would but i didn't know when and now its here at last when i received it yesterday through the post i put it into my wicked <UNK> that plays dvds and instantly had this grin on my face as cloud appeared looking well gorgeous and they followed by all the other fascinating characters from final fantasy the game including and my favourites they are pretty too in this the graphics knocked me out they were truly amazing so real down to the last hair the story line is ok bit confusing especially as my version of the film was in japanese but of course being a long time final fantasy fanatic i did not mind a bit i just read the subtitles all the characters talk the way they would do in the game and reno and rude are still ridiculous the dragon scene is wicked too just looks so good anyway the graphics were amazing the storyline fantastic and the basic idea of even having a film genius
<START> though this film destroyed director and screenwriter michael <UNK> career and <UNK> united artists it still stands as one of the top movies of all time there are plenty of reasons to <UNK> dismiss this movie for sure among them its length its technical problems its <UNK> <UNK> of animals on set the list goes on and on and yet for all of this it remains a film that captures something it is a classic example of <UNK> storytelling on par with <UNK> its moments lasting as long as they might in reality having not been <UNK> down for good cinematic timing it feels real in its moments of anger love and war and <UNK> this film should be seen by any person who <UNK> film and storytelling
<START> wow i truly regret watching this picture funny i agreed to see it just for my wife who endured the torture of seeing it about a half an hour before <UNK> while i stayed in front of the tv but only to feed the the <UNK> in me and i because i wanted to know if this movie was so bad in its entirety or if there were some <UNK> aspects which might <UNK> the feeling i had of being a stupid for watching this called two girls and a guy br br everything in this picture is wrong totally wrong since the initial absurd premise of two women stupid enough to stay with their common boyfriend until the awful but <UNK> end not forgetting the horrible acting of the three actors don't believe the rumors the acting is bad and i don't see how graham has made herself a known name within the movie industry br br i wonder why after the producers saved some bucks with just three actors and an only location they didn't hire a person to write the script instead of putting a monkey to do it with his br br at least i felt a little fine when i destroyed the dvd and threw it to the trash anyway i liked somehow and just a little the brunette actress natasha something but that was not enough to beat the incredibly stupid and crazy premise of face off changing faces so two girls and a guy to the bottom goes br br stay away from this
<START> heard some good remarks about this film as being very gory and but it's neither obviously the screenwriter wanted to do a scary horror film but at the same time <UNK> some teenage comedy for the young target audience scares and comedy <UNK> result in good films the same goes for monster man br br not really funny nor scary or overly enjoyable on any other level br br <UNK> years of age i've seen my share of horror movies i have seen good ones and terrible ones but the crop of films released these days are so <UNK> mediocre it <UNK> me to watch 'em the acceptance these days for bad films like this is what really <UNK> me let's face it they produced a lot of crap in the 70's 80's and 90's but they were regarded as such then as well today they're regarded as good entertainment <UNK>
<START> this film is a cash in a cash in <UNK> on a rousing theme tune created for an earlier classic <UNK> <UNK> has long since jumped ship and so have most of the production values lee van <UNK> takes over the lead role of chris i can't think of any actor who looks less like <UNK> than van <UNK> hey he could have at least <UNK> off his hair and lost the <UNK> just for the sake of continuity some <UNK> <UNK> show this movie in order to <UNK> <UNK> one step out of line and the magnificent seven ride is brought to the <UNK> and <UNK> they didn't even bother trying to make this movie not look like a tv movie abysmal
<START> they used footage of some real protest spliced with some woman talking about a society with no men to make it seem like these people were cheering for the of men the funny thing is you can see a man cheering on his own death in the background br br ok the plot some lady says there should be a society with no men and the crowd in front of her which contains some men think its a great idea so then all the men are killed or something so there are no more br br then this blonde scientist creates a man but <UNK> some <UNK> so he can't be violent the male grows very quickly and soon is a full grown man not long after he takes the <UNK> beetle and drives into the city where he's discovered now you would think the lone man in a city full of lesbians would be the <UNK> guy ever but no way the police chase him br br i didn't watch the rest but it probably ends up that they've got to race against the clock and some people or something bad will probably happen somehow the man ends up in a stadium with some other men who want him to lead the rebellion these brave warriors hiding in a stadium might have had some sort of plan which laid out the details of how they'd single <UNK> get rid of a planet full of women but i didn't watch and neither should you br br if you're up late and channel surfing and this happens to come on don't watch watch anything but this you'll find those ads for or the ones with women in bathing suits asking you to up the phone to meet women just like in your area will be more satisfying entertainment br br oh yeah there's this funny thing when they're pulling in with their cars i don't know what they did it looks like they drove in real slow and careful but then tried to speed up the film to compensate but it just looks really weird br br the blonde girl was kind of cute and i'm feeling generous so 2 10
<START> i've watched a lot of television in my <UNK> years but i've never had so much fun week after week as i had watching oz the acting by the entire cast was excellent the writing was just perfect with every character remaining consistent throughout the six year run i also enjoyed the mayhem and the ultra violence it may sound odd but it was at times comical finding out how one of the characters would eventually end up dead i particularly enjoyed the true romance and love between and <UNK> those two men really knew how to throw down in every way possible i truly hope that hbo will continue to show us re runs of this great show forever i've watched every episode at least 4 times yet i still look forward to <UNK> and <UNK> nights at 11 p m for an episode of this fun and very entertaining show
<START> i have read all of shakespeare's plays seen productions of a majority of them and even acted in and directed some i do not necessarily believe that shakespeare must be done in the traditional fashion but i hated this movie br br there is nudity that is gratuitous and unnecessary there is that is far beyond what i believe shakespeare intended some of the dialogue is incomprehensible and there are those elements like the singing and dancing that add no meaning to the movie but replace shakespeare with the director's self <UNK> br br i am sorry to say that i wasted perfectly good money to buy the dvd of this movie
<START> i'm not surprised that this film did well at the <UNK> film festival it is a shallow film that would appeal well to shallow people two actors pretending to be actors in a relationship who fight and look for a lost dog the film is allegedly exploring the dynamics of the relationship however the relationship is far too petty to merit any such exploration this couple has one dimension they fight they <UNK> then they make love and fight some more there brief moment of <UNK> does not reveal any possible reason that these two would be involved with each other given their <UNK> and <UNK> relationship beautifully shot excellent score but without anything of merit in the script or characters this short is just that
<START> well this movie actually did have one redeeming quality it made up the funniest season one episode of mst3k i wish <UNK> had released this one instead of the <UNK> hand
<START> five characters in search of an exit has to be one of the most boring <UNK> ever made it was on sci fi this morning and as usual i changed the channel i put it in my top five list of the worst <UNK> ever produced dull and predictable and not worth watching <UNK> worked this theme to death <UNK> in the hands of aliens who often were giants and in this particular version it just doesn't work anyone who hasn't seen it before will quickly figure it out this is another <UNK> philosophical mood piece perhaps <UNK> the plight of those in prisoner of war or concentration camps where the imprisoned may lose interest in finding out where they are or fighting their <UNK> william <UNK> as the soldier who is the last to drop in is the only one curious to make the effort and it doesn't take long to figure the outcome
<START> as this movie unfolds you start to feel the <UNK> of human existence if you carry with you questions inner wars <UNK> <UNK> about the meaning of life then you will feel this movie with every <UNK> of your body charles <UNK> begins a war with an utterly predictable ending war with god his theories resemble the fact that god has nothing to do with mankind has nothing to do with the amazing world that we live in savage harsh ironic and chaotic this words surround the mind of the character thrown into an universe of material truth who slowly pushes hope for god out from his mind nevertheless the movie as charles <UNK> still sees wonder and beauty beyond god in the universe of <UNK> evolution
<START> one of those movies where you take <UNK> on who will die first and who will survive at the end there was just something about the movie that made me zone out i think because i keep looking back and thinking yep still in that tree still looking at the water poor character development i felt nothing when they were in danger i was voting for the croc i found it hard to believe a croc would try to tip a boat in the first place and then when it jumps into the boat i find that really unlikely as well the croc seems too supernatural at times <UNK> knowing all also when the croc attacks it's behavior seems very unrealistic it's a killing machine and wouldn't be letting victims escape twice to three times in a row especially when attacking in the water
<START> i saw <UNK> years ago dubbed at a friends house i don't remember it much and then i saw at the video store there is a second one not really related to the first one <UNK> makes a little cameo and that one was okay not as good as the first one i'm seeing the first one again tonight not dubbed <UNK> edition i really like german movies like this one it's very interesting and people and <UNK> like the one in the movie could exist i think i <UNK> but it's very grossly entertaining and scary <UNK> 2 is a little different and the characters are not as good as the first but if you really thought <UNK> was interesting and good you should see the second one
<START> the main problems of are related to the tremendous script mistakes that only a <UNK> <UNK> will just the main question is what's is the purpose of the killer in his lying in the middle of the floor the film tries to show that the killer's aim is to cause evil and destruction in his victims he loves to play with the lives of other people and to feel control over their the fears and so why does he just pretend to be dead between the two main characters a tremendous <UNK> can a man pretend to be dead for more than one or two hours without moving a single muscle or even without breathing in order not to be discovered by two men who are in the same room it has not sense at all except to be the final d effect of the movie the killer seems to have always the control along the plot and if it's lying like a dead body this can't be possible finally it doesn't work the right place for the killer should have been a darker and <UNK> shadow behind the false shadow the male nurse but not the floor of the white room the director shouldn't have showed the killer's face and maybe the site where he is hidden then the film would be a quite good thriller however is just a fiasco hitchcock please come back
<START> <UNK> <UNK> once said he was still making movies only to make good and easy money when i see his latest releases i can believe that br br beowulf is all in all in the good part of the crap movies there are some good thrill scenes indeed the actors themselves aren't too bad but the plot is silly the mortal <UNK> like music has nothing to do here the ending is really s y br br really the only good thing about it is that me and my friends could laugh about how uninteresting it was i even wish i wasted my money on something else br br
<START> van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books from the setting of mexico to the five star fight scenes this movie was amazing the film is all about border <UNK> officers protecting there territory which is the border of mexico ex navy <UNK> are <UNK> drugs out of mexico into the united states of america usa van damme and scott <UNK> give stunning performances as the cop and the villain although this film wasn't as good as until death but it still gave the action acting and the film a five star look i always look forward to these b grade action films and they keep getting better keep them coming van damme br br watch this film if you enjoyed films like until death the hard <UNK> and second in command
<START> easily lucio <UNK> most respected film don't torture a <UNK> is highly renowned for it's edgy subject matter gruesome imagery and strong storyline terror <UNK> a small italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery was it the creepy <UNK> the <UNK> voodoo witch one of the <UNK> the rich girl someone else contrary to most <UNK> frequent representation on the film's violent content i consider it much more plot driven featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed involving chains and boards in no aspect does this detract from the positive attributes this movie delivers fulci proves himself fully capable of <UNK> out one hell of a dark and disturbing giallo with killing black magic and of course a nice full set <UNK> <UNK> though i'm particularly more fond of <UNK> lizard in a woman's skin and new york <UNK> don't torture a <UNK> <UNK> the giallo genre as a moody and compelling murder mystery
<START> 1 let's suspend belief for a moment and let's stop pretending we could might or ought know how it is or ought to be there in space human knowledge in that area is probably primitive as say middle ages <UNK> are compared to today's satellite <UNK> so we really have no clue 2 considering this is just a bbc tv <UNK> <UNK> it gets much better than many big budget hollywood blockbusters and that is just incredible 3 all in all a show worth watching as it portrays the cgi enhanced and <UNK> account of what we know of the <UNK> system this far 4 probably <UNK> and cgi ing the whole thing is the only way to make it <UNK> to a large public ever watched clips from real space missions and real space <UNK> the quality is generally average to poor and the comparison would be between looking at a chest x ray and what it tells about the human body and compare it with a cgi ed cyborg movie which one would be most entertaining yet the chest x ray is real while the cyborg flick is just <UNK> <UNK> 5 actors do a good job none i'll tell my <UNK> about but very fair for it being a bbc <UNK> <UNK>
<START> comparisons to the original series are inevitable it's a shame diana <UNK> left the original show in the 1960's due to <UNK> on the part of the producers and <UNK> probably <UNK> this as much as any fan there's no telling how long the show might have lasted otherwise linda was ok as a replacement and her episodes still <UNK> almost all of the quality and aspects of the <UNK> episodes only the <UNK> <UNK> chemistry was lacking the new <UNK> should have been left on the shelf a <UNK> <UNK> an annoying and a who the hell is this guy <UNK> also the humor was forced and poor granted i only watched a few of the episodes because that was all i could watch but i think i got the idea try as many might and do it's nearly impossible to <UNK> an old show as a new format or movie
<START> in order to enjoy an imaginary portrait of diane <UNK> ' stephen needs the viewer to suspend all reality and prior knowledge of the american photographer diane <UNK> <UNK> it's the very use of diane name and knowledge to her life and work that sets this film up to fail on a grand scale br br what becomes apparent quite early on with the casting of the beautiful <UNK> and glamorous nicole kidman as the anti glamorous jewish diane <UNK> is that didn't get <UNK> or what her work was about <UNK> realism and seems only attracted to <UNK> on a superficial level through her photographs of circus freaks br br what follows is a kind of pretty and trivial beauty the beast fantasy biopic with robert downey jr as <UNK> hairy fictional love interest however it's not the <UNK> of the story that is the main flaw in this film but the director's misogynistic stance that diane <UNK> one of the art world's most <UNK> and original woman <UNK> was incapable of <UNK> her own ideas about her work while his previous film was a study of female <UNK> his continued portrayal of the female as <UNK> <UNK> this film completely and <UNK> in the face of the real life diane courage <UNK> and <UNK> in single <UNK> exploring the often shady world of <UNK> br br imagine an imaginary biopic on pop star <UNK> life with guy <UNK> as her <UNK> the man behind her career and you'll get a feel of how seriously flawed and imaginary this film is it can only work if you have absolutely no knowledge of the subject or just choose to ignore all the facts br br it's a shame because once you remove all reference to diane <UNK> this film could have stood up on its own as an interesting study on <UNK> and a good companion piece to secretary 4 10
<START> 1 hour and 40 minutes of talking boring talking and more talking and then some it is hard for me to grasp how an actress like anne who <UNK> superbly in femme fatale would sign up for such a piece of crap unbelievable if you need a this movie might help although i would prefer some nice classical music unfortunately i just found out that i have to write 10 lines for my comment to appear that's almost as unbelievable so short and <UNK> one or two sentence <UNK> expressing one's core take on a movie is not enough <UNK> people i made my point and don't to waste your time with more unnecessary words as this movie does <UNK>
<START> there are so many episodes that make me <UNK> over the stories br br that i wish i could pick the best ones and bill make for a strange pair that are beyond help but manage to play the victim and <UNK> their way out of hard time just to drag dan into their life of crime br br <UNK> will notice the odd joke for toronto or the federal government and because the cbc <UNK> a really good show by the that dan was part of the show takes shots at them and in the episode <UNK> <UNK> the cbc is <UNK> across the <UNK> br br when dan says that the cbc would never waste money on useless venture enters the room and gives dan back his tape of friday night with ralph this show was a flop and most people wouldn't get the joke unless they knew the <UNK> history for making shows people don't watch or good shows that they do watch
<START> when a killer calls has got to be the biggest ripoff released by asylum so far it's about a sexy babysitter on duty who receives spooky calls from a creepy voice who asks her repeatedly have you checked the girl naturally she has the calls <UNK> by the cops after having to perform some realistically unnecessary tasks hanging up when he calls waiting ten seconds and <UNK> <UNK> sound familiar yeah that's why i rented it too br br well it should and i hate to say it but this could've been more entertaining than the big screen <UNK> that was released around the same time if not for one fatal mistake rather than <UNK> in b movie ripoff glory it tried to do something original it tried to make the lead character sympathetic rather than having clichéd campy fun with her mind you this could've worked with a talented actress but she wasn't sure she looked good and she screamed and cried but oh well whatever br br then came the horrific ending not horrific in that it was horrifying horrific in that it was boring the pacing up until that point about an hour in was campy clichéd and fun then it heads in another direction and it <UNK> away from just another dumb fun slasher movie with a sexy teenage cast to a hostel esquire gore <UNK> br br i guess this falls into the oh well whatever category the lead actress <UNK> a line oh well whatever i don't feel like it we forgot to give the killer motivation oh well whatever i don't feel like <UNK> it the pacing completely changes halfway through oh well whatever i don't feel like <UNK> fifteen minutes off continuity errors oh well whatever br br if you like this kind of movie dumb cheesy predictable campy splatter movie with sexy cast then you'll be fine up until the ending the ending is stupid it's not fun it's not scary it's not campy or cheesy or quickly paced in fact there was almost exactly five minutes of the character doing nothing but being tied up and that's not a spoiler because it's on the back of the dvd and looking around at the stuff in the room then screaming and whatever
<START> you cannot be seeing the same movie if you didn't grow up in france or spent at least 10 years there like me i don't know if it will ever make it outside french cultural borders i include <UNK> and <UNK> here you cannot translate its kind of fun every name is joke how many people outside paris would understand the pun in the name of one of the roman <UNK> however monica <UNK> l is so beautiful i almost forgot to breathe when i saw her
<START> first off i never got into dr who until recently honestly i never got the opportunity to watch any of the previous <UNK> pun intended since it was never big here in the us as it is everywhere else br br that said i must say obviously that after finishing the 2nd season that this is one of the best sci fi shows i've ever seen br br now i watch a lot of sci fi shows from all over and this show stands out br br the first season was tops to begin with with christopher <UNK> in the title role and i thought he was terrific of course so was the lovely <UNK> <UNK> who just adds such humanity and warmth to the character of rose that no one could've done it better let's not forget as jackie and <UNK> clarke as mickey ricky who are just a blast to watch then there's david at first i thought he was too <UNK> looking to play the character his ears but after watching the 2nd season he fits in just fine his sharp acting and physical comedy is almost flawless he's great with snappy dialog and can turn serious without <UNK> an eye br br aside from the great acting from the cast is the acting from most of the guest actors that have appeared a lot of them are veteran actors but some are new to me and are damn fine br br the production and direction of the show is top notch occasionally <UNK> be some cheesy effects here and there but that's always been a factor in the original series and like those episodes is <UNK> br br my favorite thing of all about the series the stories writing folks is always the key to great entertainment russell t davies has written many of the episodes along with a few other writers and they have done an excellent job they've managed to bring excitement <UNK> intelligence and fun with clever concepts and great dialog i also appreciate the fact that they can <UNK> the older past story lines and enemies well my friend explains much of this to me while we watch the show and <UNK> br br i won't mention anything about the 2nd season and how it ends since the sci fi channel just started airing the 2nd season br br i wouldn't want to spoil it it's so much fun and excitement you'll never want to take your eyes away nor miss a word of dialog br br it really is that good br br ps thanks to the producers for nicholas <UNK> back <UNK>
<START> i'm sick of the open mind argument i'm generally quite open minded but this sort of line is basically made by people who enjoy things that should not be enjoyed you know what there is a reason so many people are disgusted by this and just because someone out there isn't doesn't make it less so there is after all a reason for the existence of the feeling of disgust and no amount of open mind or pushing the <UNK> should eliminate that feeling otherwise we're no better than senseless living things br br back to the film another argument is that this film puts women in the roles normally reserved for men which may be why men don't like it but just because it proves revolting for more men than would otherwise doesn't make it great maybe men shouldn't be turned on by what's <UNK> the movie industry but is the answer for women to do the same maybe if you don't like movies tv and entertainment having so much sexual <UNK> of women so much violence don't watch them br br and if you're a director don't make them br br otherwise some day someone will ask for an open mind when what happened in this movie happen in real life br br heck some people seem to like it so much
<START> some twenty or so years ago charles <UNK> was a hero of mine i <UNK> accepted the image that was created by intellectual types and seen in various films of course i never got to meet the intellectual types that <UNK> <UNK> as a hero they usually could be found safely behind the counter at <UNK> video stores and record <UNK> these people hardly talked and when asked a question usually <UNK> and <UNK> in some vague direction they were useless when it came to <UNK> a specific title but their shelves were always <UNK> with strange and unique titles to be <UNK> in the secret <UNK> club i believed i had to shed my <UNK> up bringing and <UNK> the counter culture br br my introduction to <UNK> started with the movie <UNK> the late 80's film that starred mickey rourke and faye i was a fan of rourke at the time he also <UNK> a sort of modern male <UNK> anti hero a brooding intellectual type at the time this <UNK> to me hero <UNK> at convention a mid 30's tramp who lives life with no ties answers to no one oh and to be recognized as a genius by a hot female literary <UNK> <UNK> on the cake afterwards i read post office and hollywood the later being <UNK> take on his experience with the film now allow me to fast forward to the latest film based on <UNK> book <UNK> one which i read and enjoyed <UNK> takes the form of in this novel i often wonder where <UNK> ended and began 20 years after <UNK> the fictional movie <UNK> is still the same i have watched about an hour of the movie and i have yet to see signs of the <UNK> cracking here is why <UNK> <UNK> was my hero is handsome played by matt dillon he has clean neat hair <UNK> but not over the top when dillon <UNK> and writes he looks cool goes from job to job ignoring and or fighting with various bosses he <UNK> two <UNK> one of whom he lives with walks out on only to return to with little <UNK> is his own man and we never see him <UNK> he's a <UNK> one dimensional 30 something james dean <UNK> <UNK> lies to the viewer it does so by <UNK> the idea of a man a writer without consequence a poor man who's suffering for his art what could be <UNK> than that now let's say there are some truths to <UNK> in that the events took place what the audience is missing is the pain that existence maybe the point of this movie and most movies is that for 80 mins we need to escape the world that's filled with consequence and pain and take up <UNK> with an anti social <UNK> that <UNK> talks drinks with detached <UNK> one who rejects conventional behavior of job and family my hero used to be movie <UNK> long ago that would have worked it was easier then now i have yet to claim a hero things are not as easy <UNK> logic and movie <UNK> of counter culture icons offer no <UNK> or even ask questions
<START> ostensibly a story about the young child of jimmy stewart and doris day the kid gets kidnapped to keep his parents quiet they know something about a plot to <UNK> the <UNK> of an <UNK> country during a performance at albert hall in london br br the movie is rich in <UNK> incidents a friendly but <UNK> frenchman seems to <UNK> the innocent stewart a doctor from indiana a little too intensely to be merely <UNK> curious later the frenchman shows up in arab disguise a knife in his back and <UNK> some information about the murder plot to stewart stewart tells his wife doris day looking very <UNK> indeed but refuses to <UNK> with the police and risk his son's life br br instead the couple try to track down the <UNK> buy them off and get their son back taking them from <UNK> where hitchcock has given us his usual <UNK> eye view of the customs locations and food to london there is a hilarious wild <UNK> chase involving a set to between stewart and the staff of a <UNK> shop the staff are more concerned about <UNK> their half stuffed <UNK> than anything else and they <UNK> around holding the <UNK> of a <UNK> and a <UNK> in the course of the <UNK> stewart manages to save his throat from being cut by the <UNK> bill but is bitten on the hand by a stuffed tiger the action <UNK> along by bernard <UNK> <UNK> score the scene ends with stewart <UNK> out the door hitchcock ends it with a shot of a <UNK> head <UNK> at the <UNK> door there is also a running gag well done about some <UNK> waiting around the <UNK> hotel room in london waiting for things to be explained br br there are two serious issues that are lightly touched on one is the relationship between stewart and day which is not as <UNK> as it ought to be considered as a <UNK> ideal she's been a stage musical star for some years and is <UNK> known and she's given it all up to marry an ordinary guy who happens to be a doc that's understandable in say a nurse or a flight attendant or almost any woman other than an international star with a promising career in her own right it isn't <UNK> into but the <UNK> is noticeable as it was not in the original version it reminds me a little of an exchange between joe <UNK> and his then wife marilyn monroe who had just returned from entertaining the troops in korea oh joe she <UNK> did you ever see ten thousand people stand up and cheer <UNK> thousand <UNK> joe former hero of the new york <UNK> br br the second problem is one of <UNK> who is of greater social value one's own young son or an unknown <UNK> do we put ourselves or our loved ones at risk for the sake of national <UNK> day is faced with this dilemma in its <UNK> form at the climax in the albert hall her solution <UNK> for <UNK> to political <UNK> although her motives are <UNK> does she scream to save the <UNK> life or does she do so just to release the anxiety that is overwhelming her <UNK> alec <UNK> falling on the <UNK> at the end of the bridge on the river <UNK> the photography is extremely good and the settings can be menacing even on a quiet street in a <UNK> neighborhood of london it's mid day and stewart is alone and determined but frightened too there are footsteps <UNK> on <UNK> street from someone somewhere is he being followed is his life in danger and where the hell is everybody who lives on this street hitchcock pays such close attention to location details that we can make out the garden wall bonding of the <UNK> beside him br br the director had a rare <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> while being interviewed for <UNK> otherwise <UNK> book <UNK> <UNK> that the earlier version of the man who knew too much lacked the depth of the later version hitchcock <UNK> it seems to me you want me to make films for the art house audience but finally agreed that the 1930s version was the work of a talented amateur and this version was the work of a professional no argument there br br this is hitchcock pretty much near his <UNK>
<START> honest to god the outline pretty much says it all the planet not to be confused with aunt <UNK> is represented by a cheap l a <UNK> there's no <UNK> so the most recent male <UNK> go off to <UNK> <UNK> br br the men get mistaken for kings or arrested for <UNK> on women although despite the fact its a planet of women we only get two women who participate in any girl girl sex scenes and eventually as always happen in science fiction cliche movies everywhere the women become convinced that men are good for something well not the men who made this movie at any rate br br but boy do we get to see a lot of that something in <UNK> amounts of <UNK> sex and nudity this one has less plot then usual for such flicks so change the channel if you don't like this kind of movie and <UNK> your teeth if you're into this kind of thing
<START> it is quite rare that a movie comes along that is so useless that i with imdb allowed the use of negative scores in fact i reflect back upon this movie and i truly cannot think of a movie that had so little going for it acting your kidding right direction no a plot no this movie has nothing going for it if you take it as a serious movie this is often the case with movies of this genre but most movies of this nature can be watch as if they are a comedy and you can laugh at how pathetic the characters and situations are and almost get your times worth this movie is so empty that it cannot even suit that purpose i have to give this a 1 10 three points lower then any other movie i have ever rated i truly feel that the staff involved in this movie should pay me for the <UNK> minutes i spent watching it i do not really have the words to describe how bad this is no one should ever watch this for any reason again
<START> my synopsis <UNK> christina <UNK> was a high school slut and <UNK> who <UNK> with <UNK> justin timberlake to fulfill her needs <UNK> must report to his national guard unit and leaves <UNK> all alone <UNK> is not alone for long because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook up with a man after a party <UNK> is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road the next day <UNK> samuel l jackson finds <UNK> and carries her home <UNK> gives medical care to <UNK> and believes that he can also save her from herself <UNK> is like a dog in heat so <UNK> puts a 40 pound chain around her and his <UNK> to keep her from going out looking for men <UNK> has problems of his own because his wife has just left him for another man <UNK> turns to his blues music to <UNK> his pain br br my comment the movie has a deep meaning to it once you get past the sex and violence the film has a different feel to it the story is raw and almost puts you in the movie as if you were there the 40 pound chain is a good metaphor and symbolic of a <UNK> belt you don't give love away to anyone but you keep it for your true love the chain could also be a parallel to a wife who is <UNK> to the kitchen yet <UNK> didn't cook <UNK> only wanted to have sex all the time whereas a wife may not i think craig <UNK> writer director has made an extraordinary movie and samuel l jackson sings a mean blues song the story is emotionally charged <UNK> the subjects of race religion music and sex all into one paramount classics run time 1 <UNK> rated r 8 10
<START> pretty twisted horror film that has a few good moments here and there with some creepy blood <UNK> scenes however it's just too dull for it's own good all the characters are ok and the story while had a lot of potential is rather dull however the blood <UNK> scenes looked <UNK> real and as a result they were extremely disturbing it's well made and <UNK> written and it started out really interesting but it just couldn't keep up the pace plus i found the ending to be disappointing <UNK> <UNK> has no more then a very small role in this so i was also disappointed about that and stephen knight does a good job as the lead as he was pretty twisted plus i got this in a dvd horror set called a taste of evil along with a bunch of other horror films there is lots of blood however it's not all that gory and for it's low budget it was pretty well done however as i said it just couldn't sustain it's interest this is a pretty twisted horror film that has a few good moments here and there with some creepy blood <UNK> scenes however it's just too dull for it's own good i would pass but i guess it's worth a watch if you have nothing better to do the direction is ok <UNK> <UNK> norman <UNK> <UNK> do an ok job here with decent camera work and doing a good job on it's low budget however the pace is too inconsistent for my liking the acting is actually alright stephen knight is great as the lead he was creepy twisted sick and gave a very creepy performance the most creepy thing about it though was he seemed like a normal person <UNK> <UNK> did well in her small role christopher <UNK> is ok i guess sin his short time rest of the cast are ok as well overall i would pass but i guess it's worth a watch if you have nothing absolutely better to do 1 2 out of 5
<START> having not read the book i was more open to the fresh interpretation that each director gives to their medium which is film not to the letter of literature on this particular film i was happy that the holocaust that occurred in russia and it's <UNK> countries finally received some attention the nazis were particularly cruel to russians and russian jews if you read the <UNK> and see the <UNK> built in and nearby <UNK> you will understand this movie and why many kept silent when they should've spoken up br br it was certainly time for this to be <UNK> and i hope that more stories will come out of this it's high time
<START> 15 park <UNK> well the name <UNK> initially being an address from new york and film being set in however as the story unfolds one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between relationships social cause and of course the world of <UNK> i would say <UNK> is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at <UNK> well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie in a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own park its an <UNK> search within each of one of us br br the <UNK> performance from <UNK> <UNK> is a treat to watch her screen presence brings whole lot of life into the scene indeed it was surprising to see her in such a powerful act after long because i expected it to be all the way <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> makes you feel skin deep of an elder sister who is running the whole show for a rather unfortunate family and during this time she almost forgets to live her own life she <UNK> all her ambitions and desires with <UNK> 18 year younger sister who is more like a daughter to her and an aging mother played by veteran <UNK> <UNK> as for the leading actress from guide that's how i can recall her instantly there is hardly anything to say except few lines and tear drops here and there ever <UNK> <UNK> plays another pivotal role in the film he shows the emotions of a middle age man with <UNK> on his face to near perfection this man really <UNK> me with the variety of work he has done from a musician in beats to a liberal muslim in mr mrs <UNK> and so many <UNK> he is one versatile i really wish if he had some more shots in the first part of the movie as well the cameo in the movie is by <UNK> shah remember <UNK> and <UNK> wedding she looks really beautiful and depicts the role of a mother of 2 kids with real ease she gives you a glimpse of today's indian woman who is modern in approach but still conventional when it comes to her husband's prior relationships br br the focus of camera has been portrayed by <UNK> she and her <UNK> world <UNK> the of 15 park <UNK> she has really worked hard for the character but there are times when she is not able to relate with the audience the <UNK> accident of her life tries to rope in sympathy and it has been only partially successful br br the movie tries to address quite a few things in one go starting from the unique world of a disabled person to the status of a female even in today's modern india and also the twisted relationships in a <UNK> family and i believe has succeeded to certain extent the <UNK> of while she works as a journalist in a rural eastern state really gives us all a naked picture of the country we are so proud of br br well after i finished 15 park <UNK> there was a sense of <UNK> within me i wanted more out of this movie to me emotionally it has been a commendable effort on the part of director except few <UNK> must watch for all those who like to see a different cinema something with a strong purpose
<START> i like movies that show real people americans and tell truth the movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it it played here in <UNK> fine amazon says above that it's usa but the box states all <UNK> i have to say it is not for the american viewers it played in here in world raw views a theater i saw it and later i ordered it the cut was different and much better see it and you will like it or maybe hate it sorry bush lovers but this movie is driving you crazy because it makes sense get angry and hate it disagree with everything in it but i for one stand by it it's not for the empty minds it is long and too hard to keep up with but by the second viewing it makes more sense i loved <UNK> words and the poem made me cry

<START> <UNK> miyazaki's latest and <UNK> film for studio no no on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disney <UNK> cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and <UNK> to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories br br the story revolves around the friendship between a magical sea <UNK> <UNK> and the human child that she encounters during a curious outing to see the human world the human child lives in a small house on a cliff <UNK> a small <UNK> city in southern japan based on <UNK> island where he lives with his young mom lisa <UNK> names the strange <UNK> and takes it to the <UNK> <UNK> center that lisa works at is definitely not your typical <UNK> and soon begins to adapt and take on human aspects she develops human speech and an <UNK> for ham meat by <UNK> some blood from a cut on finger br br yet just as and begin to develop a bond is taken back by her father <UNK> who is a former human who has rejected the surface world and is now attempting to collect and develop magical <UNK> taken from the sea that aid him in <UNK> and <UNK> the world's <UNK> br br desire to become human has become so strong however that <UNK> is unable to contain her anymore and she takes on a more human appearance and breaks free from her water world home and goes back to see br br during her <UNK> unintentionally releases <UNK> <UNK> of magical <UNK> which <UNK> all sorts of magical sea creatures that causes a violent storm in the <UNK> surrounding town desperate to resolve rebellion he soon calls upon the help of his beautiful wife mother the water <UNK> mother lady of the sea <UNK> br br as with his past films miyazaki's no no touches upon various themes of <UNK> and <UNK> this time focusing on the health and <UNK> of the world's <UNK> the opening sequence is at times <UNK> when encounters a <UNK> which is <UNK> the <UNK> floor <UNK> mountains of garbage and <UNK> one can understand the anger and frustration of the character of <UNK> who has spent his lifetime trying to <UNK> the damage civilization is doing to its <UNK> yet finding it an <UNK> and almost <UNK> <UNK> br br enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film it is at times bizarre and outrageous but at the same time charming and curious clearly miyazaki wanted to capture the sense and style of a child's imagination the art style has the appearance of <UNK> <UNK> drawings and is wonderfully colorful and <UNK> it is almost like a child's color book come to life br br child actors and do great work as and they bring adorable charm to their roles in particular sounds so darn cute as that it is little wonder that falls for the magical girl former campaign girl model and actress <UNK> no <UNK> is also very good in her role as modern mom lisa i was a bit confused at first by her character as i initially thought she was older sister it also didn't help that kept referring to her as lisa rather than mom but i guess it is perhaps a sign of the times and an <UNK> of the modern japanese family in the anime series <UNK> also refers to his mom by first name as well br br 80s comedian sounds totally different as the serious <UNK> but wisely doesn't make his character sound <UNK> villainous or goofy menacing while we don't get to know his character more former pro baseball player and actor who portrays father <UNK> also delivers some nice voice work the opening theme no by japanese soprano <UNK> is simply beautiful and stirring in contrast the and no no theme is light and amusing and evokes images of a traditional japanese <UNK> rhyme during one brilliant sequence the soundtrack takes on an almost <UNK> operatic sound with music that sounds like die br br the film is not perfect however and does suffer from moments where the central story of and takes a back seat to some of miyazaki's overwhelming <UNK> visuals i also had wished we had more time to explore <UNK> back story as well as the relationship between and his father br br like <UNK> delivery service <UNK> no <UNK> moving castle princess and my neighbor <UNK> no <UNK> no no is another miyazaki classic that is a marvelous feast for the eyes like a modern day fairytale the film tells a timeless story of friendship and love that will surely be <UNK> in years to come
<START> sorry to repeat myself over and over but here's another great columbo episode i guess that's why i'm such a fan most episodes really are great the best episodes always have a standout feature of some sort and in this case the murderer and his <UNK> are possibly the youngest ever columbo villains br br after watching a lot of episodes where columbo and his <UNK> act like close friends it's good to see an episode where <UNK> <UNK> and bad feelings rise to the surface it just gives an episode a bit more drama and bite columbo is rapidly onto the fact that the two students who claim to be helping him are not very secretly laughing at him and feeding him false clues he happily plays along deliberately turning up the bumbling in front of them to make them <UNK> him but of course he knows instantly when they are talking <UNK> br br the murder itself is another complicated one along the lines of the bye bye sky high iq episode with a sophisticated chain reaction of events that manages to kill the intended target while providing the <UNK> with a seemingly <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> years between 1978 and 1990 the technology has moved on from record players and <UNK> to remote control car <UNK> systems and hidden cameras br br stephen puts in a great performance as justin <UNK> the obnoxious <UNK> student gary is low key but good as his yes man friend cooper <UNK> and it's nice to see robert <UNK> as mr <UNK> <UNK> dad br br a very satisfying episode in all ways
<START> this is supposed to be charlie's masterpiece but i will <UNK> that it is actually one of his weaker films first of all it's not funny not one thing in this movie made me laugh okay there's a quick jump into a box that was a giggle but that was one of desperation the first and only <UNK> where he speaks he sings in an earlier film but his flat dialogue shows us exactly why he was such a joy to watch in modern times and gold rush two films that are at least ten times better than this film there's literally only one good scene in this film the one where hitler plays with the globe like a beach ball that's it br br okay so it gets a lot of praise for being the first film to <UNK> war even long before we entered the war nope not true simply not true so that praise can be turned down a bit the three stooges did it on january 19 1940 with you spy ten months earlier than the october release of <UNK> film and that movie was actually funny if you want to watch <UNK> greatest film watch this only for reference and then pop in modern times gold rush city lights <UNK> the kid or even <UNK> <UNK> romance
<START> the most disturbing thing about this film is not that it's a load of <UNK> the was never really as much an espionage threat as the movie makes out the <UNK> aspect is the way that it the wholly <UNK> tactics of the fbi and the <UNK> activities <UNK> secret <UNK> <UNK> turned into <UNK> <UNK> these are the kind of things secret police thugs like the <UNK> did and presumably what the good patriotic americans were fighting yet the fbi did them and didn't bat an eye that's the only realistic part of this movie and they present it with no sense of shame at all add to this <UNK> the <UNK> itself by having only <UNK> <UNK> the bill of rights the film also makes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that the black civil rights movement was communist inspired another pack of lies it's extremely difficult in this day to excuse such outrageous propaganda even understanding the paranoia of the times when one realizes how <UNK> it was to real people then
<START> this is one of the dumbest ideas for a movie remake a classic film shot by shot i hope nobody tries this technique again in 1998 good will hunting director gus van <UNK> tried it by <UNK> hitchcock's 1960 classic psycho and failed miserably what on earth was van <UNK> thinking of this remake doesn't even come close to <UNK> the original the few changes that were made here were no help if you want to see psycho the choice is obvious see the original br br out of four
<START> <UNK> girls is my favorite tv show of all times they only aired the first 2 seasons in india but i've watched the rest on dvd or read it online it's very refreshing to find a show where the protagonist isn't <UNK> around her mother's back but has an open relationship with her the chemistry between lauren graham and <UNK> who play and her daughter <UNK> is really great all the acting is excellent and the characters though extremely quirky are still believable the residents of stars hollow show all the amusing <UNK> of small town life which is <UNK> by the endless <UNK> and social <UNK> that make up the high society life of parents on one hand there are dance and <UNK> <UNK> while on the hand you have <UNK> <UNK> and cocktail parties all the character's develop a lot and there's a happy ending for more or less everybody there are dramatic elements but also a lot of very witty humor boyfriends are all incredibly hot as are her friend <UNK> basically it's a cool funny very satisfying show which <UNK> all the aspects of life and gives you a feeling of if you work hard enough and wait <UNK> you'll get what you want even if it wasn't what you intended
<START> the <UNK> of four seasons is a film about a lack of love the film starts off with the main character hans returning from a spell in the foreign legion he returns to his mother not to be told how much she loves him or how much she's missed him but to be told that he is worthless and even worse that she would have preferred the man he went with to have come back instead it is the character's relation to women that makes this film so hateful the fact that his wife is <UNK> than him is symbolic of his relation to the other gender he is consistently <UNK> by them and it is through his relations with them that his life isn't as great as it could have been this is also shown clearly by the way he treats his wife after a drink he lost his job as a policeman through lust for a woman and even his wife a woman that is supposed to love him never really shows any affection for him even at the end his wife is more bothered about what her and her daughter will do than the state of her husband br br the <UNK> of four seasons is a thoroughly unpleasant film there isn't a scene in the movie where someone is happy and not only that but the movie seems <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> in the misery of it's central characters the movie is certainly not recommended to anyone who is currently having a hard time that's for sure despite all the misery the film never steps out the <UNK> of reality every event in this movie can and most probably has happened and that only serves in making the movie more shocking the film is of course <UNK> by rainer <UNK> fassbinder the cult german director that committed suicide in 1982 this is only my second taste of the man's work but through just two films it is easy to get an idea of the type of art that he creates both films are <UNK> and gritty yet realistic pieces of art his characterization in this movie is subtle we only ever get to know the characters through their and not through their character this is a very clever way of showing the audience that it is their surroundings that define the people in the film not the people themselves and as nearly everyone that sees the film knows what living in an urban society is like it wont difficult for the majority of people to relate to br br the <UNK> of four seasons is not a film that is easily forgettable the movie is high on substance and low on style and that makes for a very memorable picture and one that everyone who considers themselves to be a fan of cinema should experience it is with that in my mind that i give this film my highest <UNK> it's not sweet and it's not pleasant but you will not see a more realistic portrayal of depression and this is most certainly a movie that will stay with you
<START> sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says stay away from this movie we should all pay more attention to that little voice this may be the worst movie i've ever had the non pleasure of sitting through or it may be the best reason to remember that your dvd player has a fast forward button made on a budget somewhere in the <UNK> of 1 99 the <UNK> is obviously a quick <UNK> made to on the current bunch of scary cave lots of darkness claustrophobic unknown menace flicks like the cave and the descent a few years back there was similar <UNK> of look alike movies that used sea going <UNK> instead of <UNK> all had scary <UNK> <UNK> lots of darkness claustrophobic <UNK> unknown <UNK> same old same old the <UNK> is really the blair witch project only this time we're lost under the earth and not lost on top of it throw in a <UNK> with failing <UNK> a cow skull with <UNK> glued on it for a monster and one of the stupidest twist <UNK> ever put on film that being said let me urge you to listen to me the little voice in your head i'm your friend i want you to have a happy life stay away from this movie
<START> a disturbing film this <UNK> as it does with an intensely intimate reunion between a naked man and his young son but in its confused structure it contains a <UNK> imagined visual exploration of the innocence of an <UNK> <UNK> br br the plot follows two threads the weaker of which is the <UNK> revelation of graham <UNK> condition wound through this though is a beautiful description of his condition and his meandering path towards a partial awakening driven by his affair with irene br br the affair is the strong thread while the <UNK> of the plot are carried by a seemingly tacked on collection of characters <UNK> best friend who can reveal the cause of his condition in a <UNK> flashback his manipulative boss and his comic book mad scientist psychologist all of whom have an interest in keeping him lost and <UNK> br br the failure of the film lies in the conflict between the two threads one is visual meandering and sublime while the other is structured like an inept thriller all <UNK> dialogue and <UNK> <UNK> of symbolism br br nevertheless i enjoyed it keeps <UNK> with the <UNK> of taboo and <UNK> away into something beautiful as in the <UNK> with the double <UNK> and the two women when a setup for a scene of cheap pornography becomes a segment of peace and <UNK> i still don't get the tooth though br br odd clunky and a narrative failure but with an almost redeeming beauty
<START> why did i have to go out and buy yes buy jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman maybe it was a burst of temporary mental <UNK> but i'm guessing it's because i kind of enjoyed the first jack frost it was a silly but funny horror comedy which had some okay effects by screaming mad george that and the fact that on the back cover of the sequel there was this nice picture of this guy <UNK> by this giant <UNK> coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all so i thought if it's as idiotic as the first and has some nice splatter gore in it it should be fun right well i was so dead wrong br br let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot i mean a mutant killer snowman on a <UNK> island that <UNK> mutant killer baby <UNK> which can only be killed or <UNK> by <UNK> as much as i love the premise i really hated the movie first of all while the first jack frost looked like an actual movie seemingly being shot on real film and all this sequel has the look and feel of a third rate soap opera it has this way too slick shot on video look the lighting is just plain awful bright white spots for the day look and stupid colors like blue and green at night the acting well don't even go there the dialogues range from stiff to extremely <UNK> that <UNK> man was just moronic saying man after every sentence and when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman all i could think of was a seventh rate <UNK> from child's play <UNK> dumb and supposedly witty one liners before he kills someone br br the best joke was were one guy asks why are you talking to your watch and the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked thank god for that oh yeah and that little scene over the end credits with those two japanese <UNK> on a <UNK> ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too but the worst thing about this movie was where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about there were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings a lot of people were killed off in original ways here but all off screen like i've read in many other comments there were indeed nice set ups to a head explosion a crushed body eyes being <UNK> out tongue ripped out but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood <UNK> on the floor or nothing at all that frontal shot of that british guy being <UNK> from the back cover of the dvd wasn't even in the movie i only saw that particular killing filmed from the back meaning i didn't see sh t i was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen and then i get to see nothing what a let down could it be that i saw a cut version of the movie that would be a shame 'cause only a decent amount of splatter fun could have saved this movie if you ask me seeing a lot of killer <UNK> reduced to bloody pulp just didn't cut it for me speaking of those <UNK> they were done very poorly they made <UNK> look like state of the art <UNK> but i guess that was the whole point of it at some point the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad cgi boy you really have to see it to believe it best is to not see it actually 'cause this flick is just too bad okay i did laugh with it for it kept getting worse and worse just stick with the first jack frost 1996 and you'll be okay just bare in mind that it's a pretty silly horror comedy but fun in it's own right br br it's funny but writer director michael <UNK> somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after jack frost 2 and then focused on writing turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for the i inside starring ryan <UNK> and identity starring john cusack so the man seems to have some talent after all br br now it would be far too easy to give jack frost 2 the lowest rating possible so i say one point for that naked asian babe doing the skinny <UNK> and one point for those completely retarded <UNK> babies way to go mr <UNK>
<START> the main portion of this lightweight musical story is located at fictional college which peter peter <UNK> hayes <UNK> due to the <UNK> of stage actress grace hayes his real life mother who fills the same role here and who manages to supply his love interest through her secretary mary <UNK> who is his real life wife directed from a weak script and additionally <UNK> by excessive cutting and poor editing this film does provide some <UNK> among its eight songs including the title number and has nice turns by soprano <UNK> benny <UNK> as a <UNK> shop <UNK> and the dynamic tap dancing <UNK> <UNK>
<START> for native <UNK> <UNK> the film lacked emotion and emphasis used too many non native <UNK> especially too many <UNK> from the actual history terrible terrible <UNK> i wonder where and who did that <UNK> it was both in english and <UNK> i wonder how bad the <UNK> was in <UNK> if the english <UNK> was <UNK> bad described the one of the greatest <UNK> life very uninteresting there are better films made by <UNK> directors with very low budget from 1980's honestly i'm wondering if the film critics of academy award is that <UNK> or what only good thing was some good cgi in some fighting scenes only moderately not over the top cgi
<START> this critique tells the story of 4 little friends who went to watch angels and demons the movie on the first night it came out even though it was a school night because angels and demons is worth it two of the four had read the book of those that didn't a guy was wearing pink skinny <UNK> this was the least <UNK> part of the evening after watching the <UNK> angels and demons br br the movie starts out in a lab where the <UNK> is being created while another process is going on and apparently someone knows about it or something notice how very confused i am i don't get what happened they were just making the <UNK> finds her own father dead what the symbol sent to <UNK> is a <UNK> not a burn on someone's chest they take out the x 33 scene they take out <UNK> they pretty much take out and the connected to it they take out the and replace him with some religious british dude they take out the diamond they take out near rape scene they take out fight with the now british dude on crack they take out the press dude following them around they take out the death of the fourth <UNK> they take out the fact that the becomes <UNK> they take out the grand scheme they take out <UNK> being in the helicopter and landing on that island toward the end they take out the fact that father was a scientific priest they take out <UNK> fun and most unfortunately they take out sexual appeal br br other than the movie completely losing focus of the details the movie is acted horribly one must admit though there were some good things for example the <UNK> <UNK> recreation must have been extremely difficult and it was extremely well done the explosion scene was mind blowing other than that screw this movie for ruining the book for the people who didn't read it
<START> really average is the only word that comes to my mind when you see this br br the acting was average maybe a bit above average the camera usage was average actually below average the picture was so shaky and the colors were grainy and <UNK> the plot was a good one but moved at such a slow pace and wasn't put to good use br br this could've been so much more if it didn't go at a <UNK> pace and we saw more into the characters backgrounds br br all we see are flashbacks here and there of alice and how her home life is so bad her mother is a working class woman trying to make end meet for her and her daughter we see a flashback of her of when she was in high school and her friend says to her tell your mom to make some better food and everybody says it's your mom yeah that's embarrassing but why would you run away from it br br i could definitely see if her mom was a drunk or somebody was <UNK> her but nothing was her home except she was embarrassed by it how immature br br we're not even given a glimpse of what the <UNK> lives have been like except that they've been <UNK> for awhile and the woman forgot her name gave her baby up when it was 9 months old this really could've been so much more it could've had alice who was abused by her drunk mom go down to florida with her friend but then becomes a prostitute or something along the lines of that other then the real plot of this movie that is alice a girl with a home life of probably 90 of america's population working class <UNK> to florida but then gets <UNK> by turning into a prostitute br br i don't see why it won an award at sundance it must've been up against some really weak competition to have won that one award br br also to me <UNK> boston new england accent seemed forced it didn't seem genuine i should know i was born and raised in boston but now live in georgia br br 4 10 not really worth your time in my opinion
<START> angels are a bit of an american obsession but are often rather boring they are the of god and also the arc angels are great warriors <UNK> being the <UNK> and best looking until he was kicked out of heaven br br so what happens if you don't believe in anything let alone angels and you are sent to investigate an angel story only to meet one with wings and less than <UNK> attitude br br maybe that is what america needs being a <UNK> is different from being good michael is a rude obnoxious <UNK> <UNK> of heaven who will fulfill your wishes and make you care enough about the world that you will be touched br br funny but not greatly so touching but not overly sentimental intelligent without being clever it is just a good simple small comedy watch on a lazy sunday afternoon
<START> oh my started out with such great potential a bunch of cute <UNK> girls walking around practically naked check then off to a bar where the 80's cheese gets turned up a notch check off to a <UNK> state park the next morning check a bunch of girls and their professor <UNK> <UNK> a general store guy and that <UNK> from they live acting as the local drunk makes for a nice body count check and speaking of body count notice the strong resemblance on the dvd cover to the foreign horror flick body count aka camping del <UNK> a <UNK> indian in the woods doing some sort of ritual hmmm ok i'll let it slide check and then oh brother all downhill from there terrible the monster head in the pond had me cracking up though
<START> if you like poor se some bad acting and a total lack of credibility this is a movie for you so a really cheap looking movie but i liked it anyway why because i like those kind of movies i can't help but smile when i see these kind of movies what were the producers actors director and se people thinking when they made this film don't expect an <UNK> or alien just a very low budget horror adventure movie br br there is one nice splatter moment when a guy's head is shot off but for the most the horror is pretty tame the final monster is pretty cool too br br it's only 73 minutes long so you can t go wrong there maybe you can pick it up at your local <UNK> or watch it on tv i'm sure you will have a good time watching it br br but don't say you weren't warned
<START> george sanders playing the saint for the <UNK> time does a good job out of a good script with the usual good rko cast around it's a non story too <UNK> with murders and good clean fun br br thread 1 in new york police inspector <UNK> friend is framed in a corruption scandal and <UNK> st comes over from london to try to put things right nice and simple so far but is there really more than 90 000 in the world thread 2 another tale of a woman taking revenge on the people who murdered her brother wendy <UNK> does well in <UNK> off some nasty men and having the saint fall in love with her to boot including a baddie who was under their direct protection and in <UNK> there's a creepy shot of him dead and staring and them in a car when they're taking him back to where they'd got him paul as <UNK> gates must have supposed to have been homosexual in this witness the dressing <UNK> at the beginning and the later <UNK> comment by st that he was thinking of keeping him as a pet and did too for palm springs <UNK> was played by jonathan hale as usual but this time with such a beaten <UNK> attitude that what he really needed was a good <UNK> from <UNK> to <UNK> him up br br the <UNK> office also made sure you got the picture right all threads are tied up with no bits well worth watching for all of us who like this kind of thing but if val <UNK> version is your <UNK> then don't bother
<START> i was so let down by this film the tag line was something like 'the story of a girls sexual <UNK> you can only imagine how disappointed i was i was <UNK> at the time and i took my girlfriend to see it i thought we were going to see a sexy movie that would leave my girlfriend <UNK> for it sadly that was not the case i guess we just weren't ready for a deep and meaningful movie that required an element of sophistication that we just didn't possess at the time i'm not so sure i possess it now and i have long since <UNK> company with that particular girlfriend pity really my first love we left the cinema half way through the film my friend who should have known better stayed for the whole thing i still got the required result with my girlfriend the film just didn't help much it would be interesting to see it again so that i can make a more informed critique though i feel the experience has left me <UNK> for life
<START> this is an excellent example of an bad b movie there are worse movies than this one titanic for example but this definitely shares the pile of steaming crap movies br br ok this was apparently shot in kansas city which explains why everyone is so lame the main guy looks like steve <UNK> and is even more lame than him i didn't even think that was possible in fact him and the main girl in the movie are responsible for the worst drama ever its not just that there acting was <UNK> over dramatic well actually it was of course the script was terrible which combines for a deadly one two punch in bad terrible utterly unwatchable drama br br the scarecrow lets talk about him the <UNK> you hear every time he's around is stupid and obviously dubbed in now his costume i cannot get over that its a guy wearing <UNK> <UNK> and a stupid mask i simply am <UNK> maybe if your 3 years old with brain damage you'd be scared of him it br br one of the characters the token black guy actually used the line this might be a chance to earn my red wings when referring to trying to score with one of the girls on her period wow um <UNK> that is the kind of dialogue you can look forward to br br oh in the beginning when the scantily clad girl is running through the corn why is it <UNK> off i'm pretty sure its not supposed to be evident just one of the many obvious mistakes made throughout this <UNK> another is the bad dubbing for the musical number <UNK> thats right there all at the beach and the one gets up the courage to sing a song and play guitar for everyone and its so obviously dubbed its funny thankfully the scarecrow answers all our <UNK> and throws a <UNK> right through the guy's chest when he's done singing overall the gore like that is pretty good this is one of those films when you rooting for these people to be killed by the killer br br ok there's a scene where the 2 guys bury one of their friends in the sand then stand up whip out their and <UNK> all over the guy in the sand who does this really imagine it hey lets bury joe in the sand then stand up and take out our <UNK> like its no big deal and pee on him in fact this brings up the <UNK> <UNK> in this film what the hell a good part of the beginning of this movie is the <UNK> standing around in there underwear in the locker room and corn field while there doing the <UNK> what the hell is with that <UNK> in film and real life <UNK> get the girls and <UNK> don't that really doesn't make sense as all <UNK> think of is girls and sex and apparently all <UNK> think of is sports and being around each other in their underwear i don't get it br br lets get to the sex as someone who watched this movie with me put it i've never been so disgusted by <UNK> sex in my life and its true if you like hot a cup action or ugly old woman boobs then this film is for you i swear they found a girl with the smallest breasts ever and this is who they get to do the nude scene then the ugly old woman nurse shows her <UNK> ones a couple of times and man i just didn't want to see that br br now i have to talk about the <UNK> continuity to this film thats what really is just bizarre it starts in the daytime then they all head to the <UNK> and within like 2 minutes its instantly dark middle of the night when they drive off from there saying their going to the beach its instantly day again and apparently they stay at the beach until night again and until day the next day so basically these events in the film cover 4 days without any of the characters needing sleep or anything its really weird br br after the main killings have taken place it flash <UNK> to weeks <UNK> and apparently none of these people actually care that they saw their friends brutally murdered the surviving people literally pop some <UNK> and thats when i realized the budget didn't go to the script directing or acting it all went to that <UNK> bottle of <UNK> br br the ending stop reading now if you don't want the ending spoiled for you it truly is enjoyable br br ok so the end takes place in a church and the scarecrow put his soul inside the <UNK> kid body then he fights with the steve <UNK> <UNK> guy and he fights him with a b movie version of the power the emperor had in star wars i'm not kidding its so stupid so somehow in the middle of the fight the <UNK> soul jumps bodies into the <UNK> jr guy and then with the last amount of will he has of his own he <UNK> himself on a cross in the church its awesome some blood but whats even better is that the cross is obviously cardboard you can see the bottom move off the ground wow <UNK> have fun watching
<START> ok with <UNK> in it i should have known better but br br within 3 mins you've encountered 5 bites from other movies and tv shows br br 8 mins casper van <UNK> should have <UNK> by now br br 10 mins you're feeling sorry for tom <UNK> <UNK> jr that he has been reduced to doing movies like this br br 15 mins erika <UNK> shows up looking like <UNK> br br 20 mins you're ready to shoot you're self br br how these movies receive funding is beyond me and yes i watched the whole thing the ending is priceless just stay away
<START> i can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten to be honest i saw the preview for this movie and the premise looked intrigued me yes i rented it after reading <UNK> comments they are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired they are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of dr graves br br also interesting is scott clark who plays grant the kid in the wheelchair i identify with the character he played perhaps because i am in a wheelchair br br this movie is certainly worth your looking at
<START> gritty drama emotionally powerful blah the bbc has lost out big time to masterful productions such as the wire sopranos and <UNK> from hbo okay so the budget may be a lot smaller but 'the <UNK> last night was badly acted predictable unrealistic stereotypical <UNK> and a big fat waste of time tv british tv is not as good as it used to be and is falling further and further behind the american productions br br there was no sense of brutal violence from the there was no indication that this man was enough to beat up a man he has respected for such a long time there was no <UNK> when he did it and this shouldn't be the sort of character that would back down when bob <UNK> called his son a <UNK> in a display of <UNK> br br i wish i was more <UNK> to express my disdain for this show but i am not and although i can't prove my point well enough believe me when i say that this was rubbish shock tv that provides no real <UNK> looking perspective on life br br 1 5 stars
<START> this movie was sweet the main character lady was sensitive to 2 different men who wanted her she seemed not a character at all but a real person who had made some mistakes but was trying to set things right i liked the movie a lot even the older ladies who were lesbian didn't <UNK> me too much
<START> i as a christian am <UNK> after seeing just the first half of this picture the film's website says they <UNK> the movie before writing but i believe they forgot to <UNK> the ultimate source the bible i sat with two different versions of the bible and could not find half of what happened or was said in this picture it was like they made up what was not in the bible and changed what was in the bible to what they thought modern film viewers would want to see instead of the truth i personally am too young to remember the 1950's ten <UNK> but it can't be any worse than this i have written to the network and can only hope they <UNK> apologize for this travesty
<START> i can't help but be completely annoyed by this sitcom it's like they didn't even bothered trying <UNK> write good comedy just rehash third rate jokes and hope it sticks the worst of all this is that it's all so <UNK> uninteresting and lacking in every way br br to make things worse leading man kevin james has a permanent i'm so funny smug grin on his face that would be tolerable if only he once delivered in the comedy department which he doesn't he just lies there doing nothing like a big unfunny baby which takes me to the relationship between the easily the most <UNK> and poor representation of a married couple on any tv show really headache obnoxious spends the whole show as if it where a violent chore to even be around her own husband jerry stiller <UNK> the few laughs on the show is doing a 100 <UNK> of his role as frank <UNK> in seinfeld only this time his hints mostly <UNK> on water due to the inability of the central duo in <UNK> a joke even if it flew by them the episodes just drift along in a stream of <UNK> their jobs add nothing and their interaction is even worse br br this is not even a waste of talent there is no talent here this is a <UNK> creative desert
<START> this show should be titled when bad writing happens to good actors considering most of the players have demonstrated immense talent in other <UNK> e g andre <UNK> in homicide life on the street and david morse in st elsewhere i'm hoping that the frenetic pacing of the show is <UNK> as the series develops along with the obvious cliches and dialogue so absurd i wondered just how stupid the writers imagined the core audience to be we're beat over the head with the main points of this show instead of being left to gradually figure it out almost as if the writers feel that they must spell out that the main character is some sort of <UNK> angel sentenced to redeem himself from sins both and mortal via <UNK> into his cab <UNK> many affairs watching the premiere required much suspension of disbelief that mike <UNK> would so rapidly <UNK> their guts and he would feel driven to <UNK> in the lives of utter strangers that he possesses those super cop abilities to be all things to all people weapons expert martial arts master psychologist father <UNK> and so on ad <UNK> pure fantasy what is it about recent <UNK> shows based in <UNK> that they all seem to be <UNK> with a nasty ex wife and a very <UNK> child overdone i wanted to like this show really i did because it had the virtue of having a premise slightly different than many of the <UNK> appearing in this <UNK> fare and it stars some of my preferred actors but i'm afraid this is just another possibly good idea ruined by <UNK> execution
<START> the theme is controversial and the depiction of the <UNK> and sexually <UNK> india is excellent nothing more to this film there is a lack of good dialogues why was the movie in english there was lack of continuity and lack of passion emotion in the acting
<START> no one would ever question that director <UNK> <UNK> is a genius but what we wonder about is is he an insane genius so many people hated this film i am normally the first person to <UNK> many french directors of making offensive boring disgusting and pretentious films such as the horrible recent film and the pointless and offensive <UNK> but strangely enough i actually think that <UNK> is an amazing film made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft and containing remarkable performances the film does carry melodrama to more extreme <UNK> than i believe i have ever seen on screen before but then <UNK> is extreme that we know the film also contains what i consider way over the top or <UNK> fantasies and wet dreams what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the <UNK> in between playing scott <UNK> rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with <UNK> and fires burning in old steel <UNK> <UNK> depardieu plays a rich young man in a <UNK> whose step mother is catherine <UNK> and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath by the way but he suddenly completely when he discovers that his deceased father a famous <UNK> had <UNK> an <UNK> daughter who had been effectively <UNK> of by <UNK> as an <UNK> this is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of romanian <UNK> with wild <UNK> hair <UNK> face and little ability to speak french <UNK> depardieu then transforms himself into a <UNK> of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their <UNK> and corruption and lives in <UNK> and extreme poverty while <UNK> a vast inheritance he then <UNK> an incestuous sexual relationship with his half sister which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people though i have no <UNK> to it as i think people are far too hysterical about sex especially in america where apparently it never happens the intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful if depressing hyper melodrama the differences between <UNK> making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme french films which i think are pretentious and disgusting are 1 that <UNK> is an excellent filmmaker and 2 he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful if harrowing extreme emotional condition <UNK> a human being <UNK> and turns against his background many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous but i don't agree i believe <UNK> was genuine and was not making an exploitation picture at all it is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who for all i know may be a complete madman but i believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement
<START> i watched the minute version and have to say that dollar for dollar it it probably one of the worst films ever now i am not saying it's the worst film ever but if you look at a ratio of cost over how much an average person would enjoy it this is a very very bad film br br i would say that the single biggest factor making this a bad film is the writer director michael <UNK> rarely can so much blame be placed on a single person had he not been so self indulgent a film just as bad could have easily been made at about 90 minutes saving the studio millions br br the film begins with a completely unnecessary prologue that's supposed to be set at <UNK> the scene is huge but completely without context you have no idea exactly what is occurring nor do you know why the students in particular john hurt are behaving so i find it very hard to imagine a <UNK> going like this in <UNK> and it looks a lot more like 1970 this is a half hour where you have no idea what is happening who the characters are or their motivations br br the next scene is 20 years later inexplicably the two <UNK> <UNK> hurt and kris kristofferson are in <UNK> so they went to the best school in america and now one is only a law man in the middle of no where and the other is well what is john hurt in the film he just appears here and there and seems to be either a jerk the prologue or a pathetic and pointless drunk who hangs out with murderers even though he is apparently against them his entire character made no sense they never explained why he was a brit living in the middle of nowhere it was impossible to hide his accent why he bothered to come along with the hired army if he was so against their wicked plan nor why he would risk his life for a cause he didn't believe in at all as for kristofferson his excellent acting and better defined character made his character more believable though having him move to <UNK> and risk his life for a prostitute made no sense at all br br this brings up the worst aspect of <UNK> gate while the scenes are way too long and needed <UNK> the worst part of the film is that the characters were like cardboard john hurt a wonderful actor with nothing to do in the film jeff bridges and many other big names are there but you have no idea why in fact other than kristofferson isabelle <UNK> as a hooker with a heart of gold quite the cliché and perhaps christopher walken everyone is completely one dimensional it's hard to imagine a movie this long where you don't know or understand the characters br br much of the film also seems <UNK> who would have thought to have a giant roller <UNK> constructed in the middle of no where in <UNK> i am sure that just getting the basic supplies in this region in the west would have been very very difficult and yet we are expected to believe that trains filled with roller <UNK> and <UNK> arrived instead of food maybe if they hadn't spent a <UNK> dollars building and the roller <UNK> the <UNK> could have <UNK> to buy food and avoided this war over cattle and what's with the guy on roller <UNK> with the <UNK> what did this have to do with a land war br br the most obvious problem you are left with is that it's a film where very very little actually happens until the big battle late in the film there are lots of scenes of filth and flat <UNK> so much <UNK> that by the time the battle occurs many audience members would have left or are now so hostile to the film that it's inevitable that nothing could salvage the film br br as for the final battle it was done reasonably well but had problems first this minor <UNK> on the <UNK> lasted longer than the d day invasion second while details of the actual events of the so called johnson county war are a tad <UNK> we do know that the characters played by <UNK> and kristofferson never actually were there as they'd both been hung before the battle third i can't believe that <UNK> actually killed animals throughout the film especially during the final battle while i am far from a bleeding heart about animal rights his need to use animal guts and actually kill some of the horses is a low point in cinematic history watching and knowing that some of the horses died to achieve <UNK> vision for the film is very sad br br finally after the big battle we have an <UNK> while it is <UNK> short it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague we see kristofferson on a fancy <UNK> so we can assume that he's finally putting some of that <UNK> education to work for himself we also see a woman who appears to be one that kris looked at a couple times during the prologue most importantly nothing is said and you have no idea what the final outcome i read up on it myself and found that the film often got the facts wrong br br overall to say the film is long and needed tons more editing was like saying wwii was a minor <UNK> well i've certainly seen a lot worse but if you factor in the cost of production i truly think it might just be one of the worst films in history br br finally when a film has this much explicit nudity i warn parents however as no child could sit through this film even with a promise of sex the warning is not necessary
<START> first of all the entire script is mostly <UNK> adding to the fantastic illusion that what we are watching is an actual documentary secondly the actors hired by were <UNK> chosen to represent their true political <UNK> and backgrounds the hippies portrayed are actual hippies the government officials though not necessarily in the government themselves are at least actually <UNK> <UNK> within the system and several of the cops are actual policemen the interactions of these actors given the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by eventually come to a violent head where even himself is convinced that a cast member had actually been shot we hear him screaming cut cut in the background br br an amazing film though american critics were quite harsh in their reviews one actually <UNK> that it was the most offensive film she had ever seen this not entirely unexpected as the <UNK> of this oppressive communist like mentality of america during this era would certainly <UNK> some <UNK> this pseudo documentary definitely requires an open mind though if you are seriously looking for an intensely accurate portrayal of 60s culture this would be the film to watch
<START> emma thompson alan <UNK> carla and <UNK> <UNK> are a delight in this sexy caper this film is smart edge of your seat entertainment for adults and what a relief that is in these days of big concept predictable cartoons great music and camera work add to the fun that is this new orleans set puzzle highly recommended ten stars
<START> i love this film it is excellent and so funny ben is fit and i wouldn't mind meeting him on holiday i rate this film a 10 because its <UNK> and i hope they never re make it because it would never be the same funny bit is <UNK> andre is looking at the moon and he shouts at nicole to <UNK> outside and look at the <UNK> that bit always makes me laugh and never gets old another thing is nicole looks a lot older then 14 but <UNK> a <UNK> actress but i need help with something does n e 1 no the name of the song played at the end <UNK> nicole and andre are dancing its really <UNK> me because i want 2 no what it is because its a nice song
<START> excellence seems to come rare in <UNK> today many consider just two out of the year's best picture <UNK> to display sense to the movie industry and in <UNK> is <UNK> ' the mark is hit directly br br the film <UNK> its brilliance with the beautiful setting the scene entry from the beginning you receive a sense of warmth and true family connections and relations between one and another and also the cast is introduced perfectly for <UNK> <UNK> character <UNK> his sensibility is expressed through holding his dying <UNK> hand and for the character entitled alex it is easy to see his life in his perspective the true <UNK> rock star with the cast <UNK> at first the story slowly <UNK> into our minds as <UNK> decides to venture to <UNK> to meet the woman believed to save his grandfather thus the entire family and from there the story movies slowly yet kept at a fast pace from the contrast of tear dripping drama and laugh out loud humor included in scene by scene every scene br br although the movie itself is rather <UNK> there are several complaints from other sources commenting about <UNK> <UNK> inaccurate adaptation of the <UNK> <UNK> novel personally i have never read the novel but any movie especially this movie in particular should not be <UNK> on whether the <UNK> of the film matches the storyline of the book but rather how the major concepts from the novel were expressed and exploited through the film just because it may be far fetched from the novel does not mean that this film is no longer a must see it still is br br throughout the film new information the audience's mind very slowly some of these thoughts are never answered and in fact the second half of the movie its entire topic and reason of travel through <UNK> onto something different yet rather similar to the original intentions of this film the film does however leave you on a satisfied note yet to the weak hearted souls a tear may be dropped and throughout the film to the people with common sense of humor may just have to laugh from alex and john's fun and ongoing conversations br br i would recommend this film to several different types of people to those whom enjoy movies that share the genre drama comedy for those who have an interest in family connections and to those whom have an interest in subjects and to those insane people who find slapstick as hilarious comedy this movie is not for you and for you whom think that this is a seriously funny and absolutely <UNK> funny film you are wrong this film shares comedic moments and dramatic sequences and to those whom judge a movie based on their <UNK> with its <UNK> novel you may or may not enjoy this film but this film should be taken for much more than whether or not it was close to the book br br all in all <UNK> is is an ingenious piece of work that will <UNK> <UNK> hearts
<START> early in the movie <UNK> johnny cave character tells his <UNK> in the office of <UNK> and <UNK> that in the previous year <UNK> shop owners had cheated the american <UNK> out of more money than the national war debt then he goes out and tickets a particularly <UNK> green <UNK> for short selling him a bag of sugar that is four <UNK> off oh the horrors and one skinny chicken that his <UNK> scale has rather <UNK> <UNK> to be six <UNK> after which the fur or in this case <UNK> flies er fly when a <UNK> in <UNK> clothing attempts to <UNK> an investigation into the <UNK> <UNK> practices our hero becomes a lone wolf <UNK> the war of the <UNK> on behalf of <UNK> across america after all four cents here and a quarter there add up and before we know it we have <UNK> word of his <UNK> soon reaches both the mayor and the <UNK> <UNK> and cagney becomes a marked man if it sounds silly it's not the <UNK> practices are only a plot tool or as hitchcock would say the <UNK> and while unfamiliar it works every bit as well here as any <UNK> agent or g man anthology in which the fight is taken to shady crooks who are operating outside the interests of the country's common good the production standards are decidedly grade b but it is cagney who makes this movie the delight that it is this was his first film away from warner brothers after seeking release in court from his <UNK> contract and he seems to be at ease and enjoying himself tremendously the performance turned in here is intelligent and <UNK> with his unique energy and <UNK> charisma mae <UNK> presence lends a definite <UNK> feel to the overall production the supporting players turn in solid performances and the story moves along <UNK> after a rocky introduction that seems to begin three or four <UNK> into the story but sit back and enjoy it for the cagney showcase and engaging depression era time capsule that it is
<START> predictable <UNK> pointless caricatures contrived actors did what they could actors clearly <UNK> they were embarrassed to do this not one emotional connection real sequence from film who you <UNK> the police <UNK> you can't do that <UNK> hang up the phone <UNK> jesse got a sh t load <UNK> drug money you can't go involving the cops <UNK> i'm not so sure stealing money from criminals is a crime even if they arrest him at least he'll be alive <UNK> listen to me <UNK> this ain't handled right <UNK> gonna end up dead now hang up that f in phone <UNK> best friend starts to load up guns brother hey you <UNK> no answer hey i got a family to worry about keep in mind his child is sitting right there watching ish all of this then more and more and more exposition br br notice how in the above sequence at no time do the police on the other line say hello hello uh we can hear everything you're saying we're sending someone over there right now br br embarrassment for all <UNK>
<START> i rented this film for 5 and felt sorry i did it i wouldn't give a for it if i knew this is the worse movie ever none of the filming locations was in former <UNK> map at the beginning what the english actors are trying to speak serbian <UNK> pretending they are <UNK> and they did it terrible bad my first language is serbian and i could not understand what they were about they drove a big <UNK> in a country where 3 sides <UNK> <UNK> and muslims are in war and they wrote on it peace 4 <UNK> ha ha how stupid was that don't know why english are making stupid films about war like this one or even if they do why they are <UNK> <UNK> for everything when there was another two sides in a war too and we all know they were killing too not just sitting and pretending innocent so they should at least show the whole truth this film also <UNK> flowers behind lines the hunting party and few others were total <UNK> and that's proved <UNK> the hunting party was biggest loser in 2007 <UNK> spent 20 <UNK> 4 it and they earned <UNK> 000 ha ha what a crap the truth will come out sooner or later proud to be <UNK>
<START> it's hard to believe a movie can be this bad but you live and learn what's more amazing is the fact that the people who put this thing together likely had college meanwhile the fruit of their labor <UNK> the appearance of something a group of five <UNK> <UNK> may have come up with on the bright side if there is one the soundtrack has some nice moments which is another reason to question how the rest of the film can be so <UNK> bad
<START> i was all in awe of the film looking at the <UNK> and went to watch it the film was horrible to say the least br br the first scene is good and till they go to london things are funny but slowly the pace <UNK> and they is nothing funny about it br br the <UNK> <UNK> subplot is funny at places but is <UNK> and adds to the boredom br br the drugs part is funny especially the monologue of govinda br br the film goes on and on <UNK> just like a small kid has written it br br the <UNK> brings a twist in the story but by then i lost hope br br the second half starts okay but the way things are handled makes a mockery the entire <UNK> jackie angle is half baked also how come people don't identify them br br the climax is quite funny though stupid br br <UNK> is not at all in his elements from this film he started doing <UNK> and his films got bad and bad music is good <UNK> <UNK> bin stand out and too camera work is good br br akshay kumar has white in his <UNK> and looks old but he acts well though this role he has done many times yet thanks to his natural comedy acting things look bearable govinda looks out of shape bad and his act except monologue is boring too surprising from govinda seems too much pressure on him to comeback and <UNK> fails to <UNK> him <UNK> is okay in parts but overall just repeat act <UNK> <UNK> is funny at places <UNK> is okay <UNK> kapoor is great jackie looks overweight and acts in his sleep <UNK> khan is bad lara <UNK> <UNK> to glory but fails to act
<START> i checked this out for free at the library and i still feel ripped off yes sandra <UNK> is actually in it but only in five scenes <UNK> up to barely 5 minutes and even those are fairly painful to watch the rest of the movie is so bad that you'll spend most of the time hoping it will end soon but only if you're one of those people who have to finish a movie once they start it everyone else will just turn it off don't worry you aren't going to miss anything <UNK> lines assuming that you were tricked into watching this because her name is <UNK> on the case are essentially just <UNK> of other characters lines like this dialog br br lisa <UNK> danny please tell me what is going on br br danny i don't know br br lisa mean you don't know br br danny i don't know it's something to do with my dad br br lisa mean your dad br br danny i don't know he ed up or something br br lisa why am i here br br danny i'm sorry lisa i don't know br br moments later danny some army buddies of my dad br br lisa mean army buddies br br see what i mean br br bottom line just say no
<START> a family a teenage boy his mother and a <UNK> sick of city life decides to move to the mountains to get away from it all and have a fresh start however their <UNK> is <UNK> by three brothers and their <UNK> father who don't take kindly to <UNK> on their <UNK> while having objects thrown through their window and being threatened in the street is just the start the youth decides to make things even worse by having a relationship with the terrible <UNK> sister with the law unwilling to do anything about it and the violence <UNK> rapidly the <UNK> decides to take matters into his own hands br br <UNK> wildly between hilarity and <UNK> this is one of the <UNK> exploitation movies ever made at first you can have a chuckle at some of the hammy acting and ludicrous dialogue given to the characters especially the overwrought bad guys but then you get completely unnecessary scenes like a mother being raped while her son is forced to watch or the sister getting herself beaten up by her siblings for daring to sleep with our young hero in fact the whole view of women in the movie which seems to be that they're pathetic creatures who scream a lot and can't defend themselves is pretty despicable but of course there's the obligatory nude scene which this time involves a young lady diving into a pool <UNK> less under a very thin t shirt who cares about plot <UNK> when you have some willing young <UNK> ready to shed her <UNK> right br br the climax <UNK> on the teenager who up until now hasn't been able to <UNK> without jumping suddenly <UNK> into a rambo clone and blowing off his <UNK> left right and centre to save his <UNK> who is being held hostage by the gang it's completely implausible but hey so is everything else in this film so at least you can't <UNK> it of not being consistent so rather than attempting to find logic in a place where the word doesn't exist check out the imdb pages for janet <UNK> green stephen hunter jonathan etc notice a pattern <UNK> here their careers all hit dead ends why sit through this and all will become clear remember kids if you want to get ahead in this business hire a decent agent and always read the scripts they offer you please 3 10
<START> this was a very good 1950s western one of the better ones i've seen in a decade which featured that genre on screen and on tv it certainly had three big actors on the <UNK> glenn ford barbara stanwyck and edward g robinson it turns out that ford was the star of this film while the other two stars were in supporting roles ford had the bulk of the dialog he also was the good guy while robinson was the bad guy and stanwyck was twice as bad as robinson she played the real heavy in this film and the character she played was a little too <UNK> at times br br ford handled his starring status very <UNK> as he usually did especially in westerns he played a nice guy who didn't want to fight was a peaceful man but if you pushed him look out br br the story had a nice mixture of action and <UNK> not <UNK> either it had an <UNK> western setting which was put to good use with the widescreen it also featured realistic people in a realistic setting that credibility with the characters especially the supporting players was most impressive the men way out <UNK> the women in this film acting and character wise <UNK> foster and may <UNK> were weak the only <UNK> of the production it's easy to see why these two actresses never became stars br br even though it is over 50 years old this western is one you'd still find fast enough moving to enjoy no matter how old you are or what you're used to seeing for classic film fans this is almost a must with this cast and good story highly recommended
<START> i saw this movie considering this as a normal hollywood movie but then came to know that its a movie made for tv channel on my dvd cover out of 2 critics comments one of the critic stephen from it as a best movie of the year br br all the character were simple and decent performances except the <UNK> character which never gets scope which director wanted to keeps mystery till end there was suspense till end but when you see the end that lady police officer and main <UNK> had a lesbian affair seems to be totally stupid idea god knows what happens to dave the male lead character br br the other critic from mr <UNK> movies said that shocking and effective but doesn't quite live up to all the hype which i saw after watching the movie for which i was partially i should have read this first before taking the movie
<START> well what can i say what the f k there really isn't much to say about this really the only way you would like this is if u like me like bad bad horror to laugh at br br acting very unconvincing just watch the last scene with the main actresses running rip off of texas chainsaw massacre but in a bad way just awful br br gore really not believable in one scene they use one of those knives which have a <UNK> cut out of them which fit over a body part etc by using this with the addition of red <UNK> its supposed 2 look real although it really doesn't br br plot predictable get lost in woods on camping <UNK> movie ripped off from friday the 13th br br killer quality scary mask if you're scared of <UNK> kinda unbelievable that someone would chose this as their costume however the director obviously realised all the good costumes had been used in all the other horror camp movies out there br br total 3 10 p s stay away from camp blood ii that one made this look like lord of the rings
<START> if you are a <UNK> shore fan you will laugh your butt off if not this is a silly mess wasting some very good talent a cute <UNK> carla from south <UNK> invites her california college <UNK> <UNK> shore home to share <UNK> notable cast members lane smith cindy <UNK> mason adams and the drop dead gorgeous <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> watch where you step
<START> you got it right bobby was <UNK> imaginary friend through the whole movie even at the beginning when on their way to california his mother knew of bobby and didn't <UNK> mike <UNK> on bobby since imaginary friends are common with young children br br that's why they both got stomach at the same time that's why the <UNK> were so close br br at the end mike was letting bobby go the king was arrested mike could go on without bobby it's also why <UNK> mother didn't seem disturbed when mike received the <UNK> mike had written <UNK> from bobby the ol' west tourist stop and the other <UNK> from all over the world you noticed <UNK> mother turned the first card over and looked at the <UNK> what a great mom doing the best she could in the late sixties br br a 9 out of 10 for me brought back memories
<START> this is one of the greatest films ever made brilliant acting by george c scott and diane <UNK> this movie is both disturbing and extremely deep don't be fooled into believing this is just a comedy it is a brilliant satire about the medical profession it is not a pretty picture healthy patients are killed by incompetent <UNK> who spend all their time making money outside the hospital and yet you really believe that this is a hospital the producers were very careful to include real medical <UNK> and real medical cases this movie really reveals how difficult in is to run a hospital and how badly things already were in 1971 i loved this movie p s i noticed that the incompetent <UNK> dealer surgeon played the head of the firm in la law the young doctor played in lou grant i also noticed that the <UNK> nurse has appeared since in <UNK> and other shows
<START> <UNK> kinski popped up in a <UNK> number of spaghetti westerns throughout the 60's and early 70's he was usually cast in secondary parts as nasty villains <UNK> <UNK> lands himself a <UNK> lead role as crazy johnny <UNK> a foul <UNK> and deranged sex maniac who comes up with a plan to <UNK> a lovely <UNK> in order to obtain her considerable inheritance johnny and his gang become wanted <UNK> after the plan goes <UNK> awry writer director mario <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a compelling portrait of a severely sick and twisted piece of <UNK> low life work the plot unfolds at a steady pace the tone is appropriately gritty and serious and the exciting action scenes are staged with real skill and <UNK> the shoot outs in rock are especially gripping and thrilling ironically dressed in white <UNK> <UNK> charisma from every rotten <UNK> and jumping on beautiful women every chance he gets <UNK> johnny makes for a <UNK> creepy and monstrous <UNK> kinski is simply spectacular as this <UNK> <UNK> character he receives fine support from the <UNK> <UNK> as sweet fiery saloon girl <UNK> steven as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as ruthless band gang leader <UNK> <UNK> as smart lawyer gary <UNK> and <UNK> as <UNK> sensible <UNK> <UNK> kudos are also in order for <UNK> <UNK> moody and spirited score well worth seeing for kinski fans
<START> as bad as this movie is i really like it the poor acting dialogue and action made it so funny i loved john travis from <UNK> cop and stayed up all night working out how the death machines checked in at the airport if they can't speak probably had to shake nod at the security questions actually why can't they speak it fails to <UNK> to any sort of movie making convention which makes it strangely interesting to watch just lots of people getting killed around a very loose plot surrounding hired killers no machines as such and those weird face mountain things on the front cover and the trailer do not appear i love the fact that there is no good guy in this film until about half way through and i love the numerous pointless scenes of that <UNK> landing lots of people get killed who have nothing to do with the plot and no explanation is given about anything do not expect to understand this film instead admire how the main good guy can't even handle a random old guy in the bar who is presented as the bad guy yet speaks out against the <UNK> decision to hire a scantily clad woman to dance badly in the corner for entertainment all the good guys seem to enjoy this why did old guy get to beat up our hero and why did the random bloke decide to help old guy in the fight why did the hero collapse under one punch from old guy onto the bar where a stream of water <UNK> out in the background so it looks like it's coming from his mouth definite top 20 b movie must check for a part 2
<START> i was recommended this movie by one of my film making friends and was therefore expecting something good sadly i was very disappointed by the first half ah a movie about a <UNK> taking revenge on their a hole boss how original and watched the second half on fast forward hoping to find something that would justify the 45 odd minutes i'd already wasted but all i got was the <UNK> ending br br the basic problem is that this is a movie which seems unable to decide what it wants to say and says whatever it does say hard to tell what that is badly great acting does not save a bad script full of characters i can't care about br br now maybe if i didn't <UNK> in the movie industry i'd be shocked to discover the dumb politics and exploitation going on behind the screen but as it is my feelings are as summed up above br br 2 10 would have been 1 10 if it weren't for the acting and the paper cut scene
<START> this show is my guilty pleasure all the way when i first tuned in to america's next top model i expected to be bored and to find it very very stupid i didn't this show is actually serious fun i read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be america's next top model and it so does who doesn't love the <UNK> and excitement that come with being a model on you get to see what it's really like and who doesn't love hearing the girls bitch about each other and get into fights or enjoy wanting to throw something at that <UNK> lady br br give this a chance don't expect something intelligent or a show you can look to for a life lesson just enjoy it for what it is serious fun
<START> <UNK> and his <UNK> partner jerry lee are together again in this 2nd sequel i sincerely had no clue that they made one sequel let alone two and for a film that was only slight better than turner <UNK> this time after <UNK> <UNK> he has to mate his dog with other dogs people and wait around for jerry lee to poo real classy stuff i mean come on now the original had at least a few good laugh this one has <UNK> a one jim belushi just looks old and worn out both belushi brothers were great in the <UNK> if john hadn't died would he be so bad today like his brother that thought makes me sad for some reason br br my grade d br br where i saw it usa network
<START> as a fan of history mythology and fantasy <UNK> knights show pulled me in from the get go it has semi decent scripting the costumes are fantastic there are exceptions it has pretty good acting and the heroes and villains all play well off each other br br scripts half a script is pretty great the other half falls flat but its all mixed together meaning many episodes turn out so so also some of the key players are repeatedly being given dead lines king and <UNK> for instance they need to be given something more i'm not sure what but the writers should be able to come up with something acting apart from some over acting by villagers horrid lines they end up putting too much effort into casting did extremely well in choosing their leads and so on everyone good and bad works well together costumes weapons the everyday clothes that everyone wears are spectacular <UNK> knight armor that falls short are and a bikini would probably have better protection in her case and wouldn't look as plastic his looks like bunch of snap it together pieces of brown plastic when it should look <UNK> <UNK> looks like it was bought at a <UNK> store and while weapons look cool they also look plastic br br recently <UNK> knights has taken on too many power rangers traits if you watch the show you'll know what i mean as the series progresses though it should find its <UNK> and perfect its style overall it is a wonderful show that all ages should enjoy most of my friends and i watch it and we're all 20 the plot <UNK> and twists though it gets a bit juvenile in places and everything just keeps getting more interesting it might be of some interest to fans of the movie <UNK> or the t v series the adventures of <UNK> a lot of adventure a <UNK> of mystery a dash of romance a <UNK> of forces at nature check it out my score 7 10
<START> after matt <UNK> phenomenal performance in crash most will probably rush to pick up a copy of <UNK> to see if dillon is for real or simply got a lucky <UNK> from a great script br br well <UNK> certainly has its moments but the <UNK> of everything will most likely turn viewers off however nothing should be taken away from dillon his performance is wonderful and full of excellent deadpan humor proving he's a solid actor with significant chops it's just a shame about the directing and script br br the story is about henry hank dillon and his <UNK> to <UNK> to anything resembling <UNK> he <UNK> or gets fired from jobs in mere minutes only to find himself back in a dreary pub meeting even women while trying to write a novel we never really know what the novel is about except that it involves everything cancer movies you me br br skipping from <UNK> to <UNK> and constantly returning to jan <UNK> taylor the haunting a loser girlfriend who's just as <UNK> as himself hank tries <UNK> to discover what his life is supposed to hold for him whether he ever learns what that is is up for interpretation some may say that he never does while others might argue that his life is simply a path to obscurity br br regardless there's not much substance to <UNK> even with matt <UNK> fine performance the story <UNK> through <UNK> life without much thought given as to where to take the audience and that's a shame <UNK> performance would've <UNK> even <UNK> if given a decent script
<START> a wasted effort on the surface it's a typical disaster movie we're involved in the lives of a few people who get caught up in the big event however the script is so awful and there's so much explaining of the characters' background within the dialogue that we feel we're being treated like morons even <UNK> street didn't explain the origins of mr <UNK> or how mr hooper died we can work it out someone thought that entering into the script would give it <UNK> when discussing power companies the acting is by and large bland with the exception of the older performers randy quaid brian <UNK> and after the first hour i couldn't care less about who the <UNK> took out br br but maybe there are the special effects to watch sadly no even on a 20 year old tv set i could see one <UNK> and trailer were computer maybe there are <UNK> limitations so i can forgive that one footage of a plane trying to land looked pretty real but i kept telling myself i had seen that before this site <UNK> it it was from an earlier film nowhere to land br br so in summary the only good bits are from another film and when you see the best action sequences <UNK> into a 30 second network <UNK> it makes category 6 look quite good my advice rely on your network to do some good 30 second clips watch them and save yourself two nights
<START> i loved this movie because <UNK> phillips can really fight i always hate when actors are not believable in action parts it was great to see no offense but a woman who can <UNK> perform martial arts and fighting if you compare this with most action movies with females you will definitely see what i mean they don't have to cut up the shots with someone that can fight and it flows better i was very impressed i hope there's more
<START> <UNK> <UNK> fruit <UNK> island is a hilarious show that is on saturday <UNK> on wb it stars <UNK> fred and all of his friends on the island and every episode is a very funny <UNK> of theirs most of the time it is because of <UNK> <UNK> trouble making antics which makes it funny and other stuff going on on the island at the same time the humor is great and nobody on the island is very bright at all which adds it being as amusing as it is i don't think this could be funnier the voice talents of the characters are <UNK> superior and are exaggerated which adds to the show's hilarity if this is ever on dvd i'm getting it a s a p br br strongly recommended for a good laugh
<START> there have been some harsh criticisms of <UNK> moon on imdb i think this is for three reasons first <UNK> are disappointed that the mini series is not exactly like the book second it's not as good as the original <UNK> <UNK> finally people like to complain on imdb and the greatest films in the world will have bad comments br br i would like to say that no movie is going to be as good as the book that's just the way it is <UNK> <UNK> wasn't as good as the novel it was based on additionally the movie of <UNK> <UNK> had some things left out <UNK> switched around that's just they way its going to be with a film adaptation of anything so its a <UNK> argument when looking at <UNK> moon br br i do agree it's not as good as the original <UNK> but hey nothing is i know people that guide their lives by the lessons they learned from the <UNK> if i was going to compare every book i read movie i watched and tv i viewed by <UNK> <UNK> i would be <UNK> unhappy br br this is a made for tv miniseries based on a prequel to <UNK> dave the novel and sequel to dead man's walk and that's what you get it's the best tv i've seen in years it's a fun set up for <UNK> <UNK> we get to learn about the history of the rangers we came to know and love in <UNK> does an amazing job in <UNK> gus elizabeth banks and linda <UNK> also do great jobs as creating characters that help fill in the past of the rangers and <UNK> br br if when it comes on again i promise you'll enjoy it more than some <UNK> reality show
<START> <UNK> stupid <UNK> from the <UNK> talented john hughes <UNK> soon be making a film with the <UNK> from <UNK> who's <UNK> if his stars get any younger he <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> formula yet again to produce this idiotic comedy in which a baby makes his way around chicago while inept <UNK> joe <UNK> joe <UNK> and brian <UNK> try to catch him along the way enduring much tiresome slapstick if <UNK> and <UNK> can't find a laugh somewhere in your movie then you're in trouble but the <UNK> of the movie is most glaring in the scenes where crowds of people fail to notice a baby <UNK> around on the <UNK> utter nonsense
<START> due to the fact that in 1976 there were no cgi i felt that the movie was quite watchable the studio productions were very good and very elaborate the background effects were very believable and always appeared as if they were part of the whole set the actors did ok considering the premise of the film being set in a type of jules <UNK> atmosphere where imagination and possibilities of future exploration were at most <UNK> had i watched this film in 1976 i probably would have been in awe of the ability of man to build a machine that could travel to the <UNK> core i still wonder to this day why we are not all flying around in our cars but i <UNK> <UNK> and cushing have their funny moments mostly from their facial expressions toward each other which of course makes the film somewhat campy which i loved the <UNK> left something to be desired but the story had a good premise although i feel as though some other sort of <UNK> could have been more believable under those circumstances all in all quite watchable for its time and fun now
<START> yes it's a so bad it's funny classic with a budget running into the <UNK> of dollars some of the most abysmal acting you have ever seen and absolutely no even remotely frightening moments not even a <UNK> camera work was at the <UNK> school level one still shot outside a house was obviously hand held and <UNK> blood looked like watered down <UNK> someone made a trip to the local butcher shop for the human bones and miss witch had the <UNK> mask wal mart could provide br br did anyone involved look at the final cut and realize what a mess this was most of the names in the credits have to be <UNK> it would be career suicide to have this on your resume do yourself a favor and watch <UNK> video of his instead
<START> in 1968 when take one was released it came from out of nowhere and struck like a psychedelic thunder <UNK> <UNK> american actor and film maker william <UNK> aimed to forever alter the style of documentary film making and to this day there has never been anything quite like it the movie is a film about 'the making of a <UNK> and intentionally written and directed so as to create as much controversy and <UNK> as possible set in new <UNK> central park the action and <UNK> dialog concern a couple who fight and <UNK> about homosexuality and abortion the woman wants out of the relationship and the man wants an explanation near the end of this interaction a drunk homeless man <UNK> the proceedings and offers his commentary and personal back story then after the principle footage has been shot the film crew add their own views of the film maker and what they feel is his inept handling of the movie and during the entire film multiple cameras are employed to record the action within the scene and <UNK> commentary by cast crew and <UNK> i would certainly recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in avant garde film makers such as andy <UNK> john cassavetes or jim <UNK> william <UNK> attempts to show that a thing cannot be truly observed and understood because the viewing itself would alter the reality take one can be seen as a cinematic representation or <UNK> of the <UNK> principle this is only one possible explanation and true intent is certainly open for <UNK> above all else this film seeks to <UNK> confront and <UNK> and without a doubt succeeds admirably
<START> 1993 was a time of change in the wwe but for this <UNK> they decided to wind back the clock as hulk hogan returned along with his good friend <UNK> <UNK> who had been out of wrestling since a accident in 1990 br br this was not a great event only two matches had any real build and the whole thing came off as being rushed the in ring action wasn't great and the twist at the end which i'll discuss later really wasn't the earth shattering moment the wwe hoped it would be br br this forgettable night started off with shawn <UNK> defending his <UNK> championship against the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> had beaten michaels a couple of times leading into the fight michaels had a new manager <UNK> <UNK> while <UNK> was accompanied by former manager and future wwe hall of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> won by <UNK> michaels kept his title and went straight back into his <UNK> with marty <UNK> which had been put on hold just for <UNK> why i have no idea br br next up saw the <UNK> brothers scott and rick defeat the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> with scott <UNK> the pin after hitting <UNK> with the good match br br <UNK> the clown needed help from another clown to win his match against crush a second <UNK> distracting crush when he was in complete control and allowing <UNK> to get the pin and the victory <UNK> was an entertaining gimmick character who got old rather quickly br br razor <UNK> easily defeated the returning bob in the next match br br this brings us to the first in our double main event as the mega <UNK> team of hulk hogan and <UNK> <UNK> with the newly turned good guy jimmy hart in their corner took on <UNK> former buddies money inc ted <UNK> and irwin r <UNK> this was a fairly <UNK> finish <UNK> as mentioned had been in a accident <UNK> full facial surgery and had <UNK> the match with a face mask on <UNK> ripped the mask off him and beat <UNK> to a pulp the <UNK> went down hogan grabbed the face mask and knocked out <UNK> and <UNK> and then hart who was wearing a <UNK> shirt counted the three another <UNK> came down and <UNK> the decision <UNK> money inc winners by <UNK> br br next up lex <UNK> or the <UNK> as he was also known at the time defeated mr perfect this match came about because <UNK> was being managed by old manager bobby perfect had is feet on the <UNK> when he was <UNK> but the <UNK> missed it br br the undertaker picked up a <UNK> <UNK> victory in a pretty poor match against the giant <UNK> the undertaker had earned the <UNK> of manager harvey <UNK> in 1992 and taker had defeated his big monster <UNK> at survivor series <UNK> <UNK> revenge and took it at the royal <UNK> as <UNK> attacked taker <UNK> him the match <UNK> dominated undertaker in this match but was for <UNK> taker out with weird finish to a bad match br br this bought us to our main event as wwe champion <UNK> hart seriously challenged as champion for the first time put his title on the line against mr <UNK> monster <UNK> <UNK> controlled the early going but hart <UNK> and then took control he had <UNK> in the <UNK> surely he would give in and hart would be established as an heroic hero after taking out the big monster but <UNK> had other ideas throwing salt in <UNK> face rendering the canadian helpless as <UNK> got the pin br br what a <UNK> ending but wait here comes hulk hogan he's checking hart to make sure he's ok suddenly <UNK> challenges hogan to a wwe title right then and there hogan accepts <UNK> throws salt towards hogan but hits <UNK> instead hogan hits the leg drop and wins the match and the title what did i just watch and so what most fans thought was going to be the night we either saw hart establish himself as a giant killer or <UNK> establish himself as an <UNK> monster we instead saw hulk hogan pick up a meaningless title win a title that he would not defend for three months as a matter of fact this was the only match hogan <UNK> for the wwe before the king of the ring <UNK> in june 1993
<START> i saw a great clip of this film which i'll talk about later and then the cast list and thought i might as well give it a go basically a down on his luck bartender randy matt dillon his cocky cousin carl <UNK> paul reiser and murder investigation detective john goodman all have something in common they have seen the girl of their dreams whether married or not and they would do anything to please and be with her even die all three met saw her one night at the bar that randy worked at they have no knowledge of each other but all three cannot stop thinking of femme jewel valentine the lord of the <UNK> <UNK> tyler all three are telling their stories to someone they hope will listen to their pretty intense and revealing stories randy talks to hit man mr michael douglas who co produced the film carl to psychologist psychiatrist dr green <UNK> <UNK> and to priest father jimmy richard <UNK> they confess all details of what they have been willing to do their sexual contact with her and eventually they are all brought together in one place all intent on being with her and all involved with the final shootout that leaves one dead one running away and eventually dying and one stunned and the unexpected guy she chooses but at the same time obvious <UNK> it's sex obsessed douglas also starring andrew <UNK> clay as <UNK> <UNK> and sandy martin as <UNK> <UNK> woman if i had to pick a favourite moment it would definitely be what was mentioned at number 11 along with cool hand luke on the 100 greatest sexy moments where tyler <UNK> the woman <UNK> the car with <UNK> all over herself and in front of goodman very sexy apart from that not the most memorable film okay
<START> the best thing about this movie for me was that bryan dick played <UNK> and made me melt <UNK> and all his made the movie worth sitting through even though i to get up and scream i have never seen a <UNK> man br br <UNK> but that's not the point br br the title that is indeed what it is they took the beautiful story written by <UNK> curtis <UNK> and threw it out i will in all my <UNK> <UNK> glory point out what was missing what has changed and all else wrong with the movie br br sit tight and here goes br br apparently <UNK> is son of <UNK> and gabriel and apparently is no longer child like in the book and as i recall from the book <UNK> and <UNK> were lovers br br <UNK> is apparently blond as opposed to the notably red hair described in the book i believe the book said that she looked more like a fox than a wolf and the movie also shows that <UNK> is aunt br br where did <UNK> go br br vivian is 19 in the book she was 16 br br vivian and <UNK> meet in high school which they both attend in the book vivian goes to see <UNK> because of his poem <UNK> but according to the movie <UNK> beat up his dad escaped and now lives in romania and draws graphic novels this made me go <UNK> the f k ' br br there is no in the movie where was the kelly in the movie the kelly in the book however hated vivian and she also dated <UNK> after they broke up vivian even gets <UNK> in the book and <UNK> her room br br gabriel bears a striking resemblance to a <UNK> drug lord in the movie and he sort of sounds like one too his acting was very good but his appearance threw me off br br vivian had no parents in the movie her father and mother and 2 other siblings died in the movie yet in the book when she comes home one night her mother is sitting on the couch after fighting with <UNK> over gabriel and vivian has no siblings only her father died in the book br br <UNK> accepts for what she is this really got me he kills <UNK> in the creepy church confronts vivian and she saves him from the others wolves except <UNK> shoots her so they off to find medicine and then they try to leave the city together wtf in the book <UNK> freaks out when she turns into a wolf and cries like a chick throws stuff at her and so she <UNK> and jumps out the window then he makes up a story that he tried to break up with her and she threw a chair out of the window that doesn't sound accepting to me br br <UNK> wants her to runaway with him in the book he wants nothing to do with after she turns for him nor does he lovingly hold her face and say she can control it he cries like a woman because he is scared of her br br and the final <UNK> the one that nearly gave my three best friends and i heart attacks in our seats br br in the movie <UNK> and vivian run away together and has killed gabriel as in she shoots him gabriel dies in the book not only does vivian not kill gabriel i do believe they end up together as in she doesn't end up with <UNK> she ends up with gabriel what the hell br br small things were noticed too red hair which he gets from <UNK> has been changed to brown in the movie and vivian works at a chocolate shop br br a horrible shock i am ashamed the book really wasn't hard to follow if disney can use a random h school why couldn't the <UNK> have found a random h school br br sigh i was really looking forward to this movie i loved the book it's sad that it didn't follow it one bit i give it a 2 only because as the top of this review states <UNK> played by bryan dick was dead sexy and <UNK> <UNK> did a wonderful job and they kept the poem from br br with love br br <UNK>
<START> though it pains me to some degree that i'm bothering to <UNK> the comments board for this new series mainly because i'd hate to give the false impression that there's actually any semblance of public interest in it i feel compelled to throw in my <UNK> on this one br br to put it simply never before have i felt so <UNK> to root for a tv show's swift and <UNK> <UNK> based solely on the merit of its <UNK> ads and in case you're wondering i'm a dude br br listen comedy network though your existing original programming is already shall we <UNK> say of a quality i'm looking at you girls will be girls you have truly <UNK> yourselves on this one whoever green lit this thing could not be further out of touch with what's cool right now br br best of luck
<START> captain <UNK> is one of nicolas <UNK> better films he turns a fine performance as the title character this is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island john <UNK> character gives his daughter played beautifully by penelope <UNK> some honest advice about love this movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable this movie also allows <UNK> to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart once the film <UNK> up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it again nicolas cage did not disappoint
<START> i had the <UNK> recently of viewing what is said to be the last <UNK> technicolor <UNK> print and found it much <UNK> and more touching than remembered also closer to the original material basically all screenwriter n richard <UNK> did was <UNK> change much to spoken dialog and insert a <UNK> scene or two including a very amusing one for pearl <UNK> oliver smith's production design is <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> guys and dolls <UNK> adaptation mode but it works well for this <UNK> <UNK> unrealistic quality stereotyping and racism are present but not to a <UNK> inducing degree further for a movie of its time it's pretty frank the adultery violent behavior drug use and self destructive <UNK> of the <UNK> of <UNK> row are not at all in the telling but there are beginning with all that variation from the stage text the loss of so much <UNK> <UNK> brilliance no wonder the family doesn't like it the especially of sammy davis jr 's material is <UNK> trendy and vulgar george knew what he was doing folks you didn't have to mess with it so much and while <UNK> and <UNK> act well and their singing <UNK> sing well there's a huge <UNK> between the characters' singing and speaking voices you're constantly aware of the <UNK> what really counts here of course is the music among the greatest ever written for the theater anywhere despite all the <UNK> it survives and you'd have to be made of stone not to be moved by it if the treatment isn't entirely to the <UNK> liking and it shouldn't be there's still no reason not to spend some bucks to <UNK> this ambitious filming of <UNK> masterpiece and make new generations more aware of his genius
<START> until i did a web search on what alice found i didn't realize that the name of the film is <UNK> in the title of one of lewis <UNK> books the <UNK> complete title is through the looking glass and what alice found there br br the alice of the film comes from a background quite different from that of lewis <UNK> alice her fresh and <UNK> character however is similar the movie alice begins as a young woman in new <UNK> who steals money from her ass <UNK> boss and takes off for miami vaguely planning to study marine <UNK> and play with <UNK> she encounters a middle aged couple in a <UNK> home the husband's retired from the military who rescue her from a strange man at a <UNK> stop and from her <UNK> breakdown perhaps caused by their br br as it turns out the couple is heavily involved in truck stop prostitution and see sweet young alice as a promising <UNK> the wife played by <UNK> in a performance worthy of some big award buys alice sexy clothing and shows her how to apply hot makeup initially alice <UNK> accepts her <UNK> and with the <UNK> <UNK> does several tricks the encounter shown in the most detail is quite different from most cinematic sex but may be typical of what most often happens in real life the man is shy and <UNK> and <UNK> for finishing too fast br br what's wonderful about alice and different from her <UNK> from <UNK> to sister carrie is that she learns from her experiences and <UNK> herself this is how things really are prostitution is everywhere people are neither all good or all bad alice leaves the <UNK> home with her well earned money and a feeling of mutual respect
<START> <UNK> a previous summary says if you like aliens and predator you will enjoy this film i could not disagree more this film pays no respect to its <UNK> <UNK> and has reduced two of the best loved sci fi <UNK> to little more than a teen horror slasher movie it has none of the tension or foreboding present in previous alien or predator movies and there is no discernible lead character i really did not care about any of the characters and i positively <UNK> to see the stereotypical cast die as soon as possible in the vain hope something better would replace them it really takes super human incompetence to have two of the most <UNK> creatures ever invented positively fail to make a gripping thrilling movie only watch this if you want to see how not to do it
<START> the <UNK> points of view can come up as a good idea in some movies here it is a total mess br br but the total mess begin with the story a video clip wants to shoot a light comedy with a <UNK> noir like female character she is gorgeous and no men could resist to dive and crawl and suck her <UNK> she is all the more looking as if <UNK> wouldn't melt in her mouth br br the movie does melt away in its own <UNK> being smart funny good looking at his best white trash only please
<START> i found this early <UNK> difficult to watch and i'm a norma <UNK> fan it's not her fault but the primitive production values of this film would cause any viewer to become bored 90 of the movie is filmed with medium shots and it's very similar to watching a dull play
<START> i found this film to be extremely <UNK> the main character doesn't know he's gay until he realizes that he likes barbra streisand and has a limp <UNK> i was so offended that after the screening at the toronto film festival i went up and spoke to the screen writer to complain about this film this is the sort of film that needs to work to have banned
<START> i just wanted to say that i love so i automatically loved this movie everything else about it was so so billy crystal is a good actor even if he is annoying but the thing that made this movie was at least for a basketball fan seeing act
<START> when i first saw the movie i thought it was sweet a family movie for the rest of the night and over the next couple of days though clever moments and funny lines kept <UNK> back into my thoughts and our conversation there's a lot going on classic elements of farce good character acting and <UNK> story line is just hysterical <UNK> it a feel good movie <UNK> the wit and fun it's smarter than it seems just like it's a wonderful life is
<START> someone should teach the people who made this movie that there is a difference between presenting multiple twists and <UNK> the audience over they even use <UNK> as a tool to cover up the plot holes whenever they can't find their way into or out of a scene they just say she is to her past now or she's <UNK> out of it now and they think that explains everything this movie is a <UNK> cheat and in the last 20 minutes becomes a full blown fiasco 1 2
<START> this was the very first kung fu movie that i have ever seen the dubbing is not the greatest but alot better than some that i had seen the plot is much better than some that are made today it is gory at times but that is what gives it that special push academy award material is it not but if you like to watch fights and a decent story this is for you
<START> this film is pretty good it actually is like a good wine it gets better the more you watch it the pace is pretty slow for such a high <UNK> topic but the cinematography is beautiful and surreal there is a cool blue <UNK> that rides the whole film there is also one great performance in gabriel performance of the character midget he is terrific why doesn't this guy work more if the film got better support he probably would have
<START> i've tried to watch this film 3 or 4 times but i just can't get past the fact that everything about it is just awful i'm sure it was a courageous move by somebody to cast jack palance as the protagonist but there is not one single <UNK> of my being that believes that he could act at all much less act against type br br yes i understand that <UNK> <UNK> was a brilliant author but it's not evident here this odd and forced <UNK> mash of 50's <UNK> dialog seems to any genuine meaning which explains why none of the actors even the good ones <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> winters everett sloane seems to know how to deliver their lines it's as though they don't understand the meaning of what they are saying and in the meantime <UNK> corey and palance stage a terrific contest to see who can be more stone faced br br the direction is amateurish and completely overwrought the physical interaction between the characters is as stilted as the dialog br br and can we discuss that hideous set it's so busy ugly and contrived that it adds to the robotic <UNK> quality of the characters the dialog and the portrayals br br this film seems to suck the energy right out of me it looks like everybody took an <UNK> of <UNK> each morning when they arrived on the set it takes a pretty lousy movie to make rod <UNK> and <UNK> winters look bad but this one succeeds br br i can see that it might have been effective as a play on or off broadway where <UNK> and beats could have <UNK> themselves for <UNK> the power of the plot and the artsy <UNK> of the pseudo hip dialog
<START> when i decided to try watching a movie about zombies i wasn't expecting a whole lot that's exactly what i got and then even less aside from a <UNK> of special effects <UNK> and a severe lack of any acting talent the chilling also sports the absolute worst script i've ever seen made into a movie i had to stop the tape numerous times during the first 45 minutes in order to <UNK> the damage done to my intellect for witnessing such atrocious dialogue as there is found here br br furthermore the collection of characters is so formulaic and one dimensional it's ridiculous the corrupt doctor his assistant played by linda blair we know she's his assistant because he repeatedly refers to her by that title the recently widowed businessman with a heart of gold who develops a romantic interest with <UNK> character his criminal son the blair character's alcoholic abusive unemployed boyfriend whom we are introduced to in the most contrived use of a flashback and of course the rough tough <UNK> security guard who becomes the hero br br apparently the <UNK> fluid which some lab uses on its bodies is highly naturally resulting in disaster when all of the <UNK> <UNK> end up <UNK> in a remarkable sequence of events during a lightning storm on halloween night no less as for the zombies themselves if you enjoy watching people in green <UNK> masks walking around in <UNK> foil suits then the chilling is the movie for you the zombie action is very weak at its best the <UNK> primary killing method seems to be grabbing people by the shoulders and shaking them to death the businessman and the security guard do most of the zombie fighting including a highly suspenseful scene of re <UNK> the undead with <UNK> let me tell you the steel mill scene in <UNK> has got nothing on the chilling in portraying an enemy getting frozen in his tracks like that br br how linda blair ended up stuck in the middle of this piece of dreck is indeed a mystery true her career didn't exactly <UNK> during the 80s sadly but this movie is an embarrassment for her the script doesn't even have the decency to put her to any good use the most that her character is given to do is <UNK> out things like here they come do something hurry the only thing i can figure is that poor linda was <UNK> for her work on this film in <UNK> of food the hero is played by <UNK> adams himself dan <UNK> in this picture he faces stiff acting competition from his beard and the security dog and he does his best to <UNK> them both br br the only frightening part of the chilling is the introduction which brings up the factual elements of and suggests that the film you are about to see could happen in your own community as i was counting the number of times a few of the names are repeated in the closing credits i was <UNK> to suddenly see get credited fortunately it was only for the movie's sound production 1 10
<START> this is a wonderful look you should <UNK> the pun at 22 women talking about breasts theirs their <UNK> other women's and how they affect so many aspects of their lives young girls old women and everyone in between with all <UNK> <UNK> etc talk about developing <UNK> celebrating hiding <UNK> or <UNK> their breasts br br it's charming delightful sad funny and everything in between <UNK> with documentary footage and clips from those famous old young women's films that the girls got taken to the <UNK> to see the interviews are a fascinating window for men who love women their breasts into what the other half has to say when they don't know you're listening
<START> this film for me and my wife is more entertaining than all the <UNK> buster violent thriller mystery murder movies that abound it is about real people making the best of their lives they just happen to be indian and the main characters are in law <UNK> the realistic acting and the great scenery more than make up for the slightly implausible plot the sound track is by <UNK> smith who also did the soundtrack for <UNK> waits and is great adam beach plays a <UNK> policeman who is a little bit accident prone and wes <UNK> is the stoic <UNK> professional detective there are many other fine either supporting or cameo roles by graham greene <UNK> etc we have also seen <UNK> waits another adaptation of a <UNK> novel and we greatly enjoyed it too
<START> i will not comment on the story as such i agree with most peoples comments that this is a good all round action movie with a well told story and good acting br br this film deserves 100 for cinematography for its opening sequence the opening shot is stunning and i have not yet figured out how they did it the movie is worth watching for that shot alone a pity therefore that the dvd that is currently out is just the movie and no information is given as to the making of the film let's hope somebody comes up with the special edition br br and the even better thing is that the opening sequence also becomes the ending leaving you totally guessing great stuff a must have for a collector of classic film moments
<START> accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and pc ads the movie is about b <UNK> a guy who has rejected from all the <UNK> he has applied for so decides to make his own college and invites all the other people who did not make it problem is hundreds of people sign up to his school the movie is hilarious and i was lucky enough to buy it for 5 00 at a sale and i have always watched it since overall this movie is a must watch for fans of all comedy as it is funny witty and just a good movie all up i rate this movie a very fair <UNK> go accepted make a sequel guys but make sure it is not crap
<START> the english patient is one of those films that mostly deserve all the highest praise i say most because this movie albeit very serious intense deep and really thoughtful still suffers some <UNK> first and foremost why oh why are the modern films so long this one lasts for more than two hours and from time to time it becomes really hard to concentrate and follow the extremely serious plot i say if the film were an hour shorter that would serve it only good however we have what we have the winner of several oscars the english patient is still very good it is a deep insightful <UNK> of human soul love and betrayal war and <UNK> violence and bravery ralph <UNK> is a <UNK> superb actor his hero neurotic and silent is an enigmatic person ready for everything only to save the life of his lover he is great even though half the time he is a <UNK> <UNK> he is the strongest link here juliette <UNK> is as usual very convincing and sweet she adds a lot with her excellent play and the love story plot with that <UNK> officer willem <UNK> colin <UNK> christine scott thomas are all here all enormous and all very strong and then there is desert of egypt then there is deep sky green of italy the nature is here even when people die bombs <UNK> land mines explode war is here too it is obvious terrible and bloody then there are corpses horrible gory bodies then nude bodies adultery and all i do not know what to say so much of a splendid actors' work so much of realism so much of brutality that war brings this is not a film for <UNK> it makes you think
<START> after just viewing the movie i must say this is one of the worst films i have ever seen this takes my worst movie award away from <UNK> which is no easy feat it is neither a porno nor a legitimate film and it gives them both a bad name the acting camera work plot script and sound are all awful my personal favorite part of the movie is the duck asking the bartender if he has any <UNK> why was a joke such as this put in the film was the director thinking i need a humorous scene to balance out the great acting so i will use some lame ass joke i read on a <UNK> <UNK> another retarded part is when norman <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> on himself as he attempts to keep it from <UNK> why did they even bother to give the film a <UNK> 17 rating were they hoping to get as large of an audience as possible at least if it were rated x it would be more sexual and therefore taking the viewers focus away from the overall low quality i pray for someone who worked on this <UNK> waste of a flick to respond
<START> i just started watching the show around july i found it by mistake i was channel surfing during a vacation it is a great show i just wish it wasn't on so late at night it's on at 12 30 am as a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time br br i read some comments i did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen br br i grew up in the 60's i'm hispanic and i had a white boyfriend plus we had black friends in high school i believe people get along because of their interests and personalities and it has nothing to do with being a certain race or color br br i can't wait till the show goes on dvd so i can buy it this way i can see it from the beginning
<START> bed is a strange movie it's very convoluted as if it had a lot of ideas but lacked the ability to bring them all into one coherent story instead we get various <UNK> that <UNK> into their own separate little movies oh sure they eventually meet up in the end but it all seems rather superfluous of note is the girlfriend and her troubles at the hospital was this interesting then there were the we are spirits thus we have no <UNK> elements which leads to the same problem that people had with ghost namely if the characters have no <UNK> i e no <UNK> form and they can phase through walls and what not how exactly do they keep from falling through the floor or <UNK> up the ceiling for that matter br br bed was highly <UNK> as a new breed of south korean film there's plenty of special effects but the movie itself is hollow and its faux melodrama will only touch those who are easy to well touch to begin with br br 4 out of 10 br br go to www <UNK> com for a more detailed review of this movie and reviews of other foreign films
<START> john <UNK> one man shows are hit or miss <UNK> mouth showed off his intense characterizations and great timing but the material was average o <UNK> accomplished the former as well but this time the material was funny freak is a classic followed by his disappointing sex o <UNK> but his stuff in freak showcases his genius and when he's in the spotlight he's without <UNK> br br semi <UNK> look at the journey of a young man has power and <UNK> i don't think even it's creator knew about by allowing us the chance to see his soul mr <UNK> gives us an opportunity to project our own life onto his and there can be no greater gift a performer can give the <UNK> to drop 'the <UNK> expose and share is too terrifying for most actors they use characters to hide behind but goes full <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> any <UNK> <UNK> bruce and richard <UNK> were our best cultural <UNK> comedians actors because they spoke from their heart about whatever they noticed in society and the truth provided <UNK> humor combine that with a great actor's gift of <UNK> and being in the moment not to mention a sense of humanity and you'll see john <UNK> has the power to do the same at least in freak he does br br from birth to his first big break and every life <UNK> moment in between a viewer sees our host and other characters in their most private moments all the while experiencing the pain hope and humor that comes with looking <UNK> and lean <UNK> tight is <UNK> with sweat by <UNK> end having offered up his crazy life for an audience spike lee's fluid camera work captures the actor's nuances down to the last lip <UNK> and slow blink the scenarios range from drinking with his <UNK> <UNK> father when he was 9 to seeing a chorus line with his gay deaf uncle his first <UNK> vicious <UNK> when he <UNK> naked eager to have sex a nightmarish first sexual encounter with a large german woman in the back of a kentucky fried chicken follows an <UNK> attempt to pick up a drunk <UNK> catholic in a bar on st <UNK> day <UNK> in a serious showdown with his mother and father it's here that he shows his true genius he plays a scene between these two characters and himself and his brother with such a strong dramatic <UNK> intensity you forget you're watching only one person there's no costume changes bad <UNK> lighting tricks or makeup just an actor giving his all it's simply amazing br br other actors comedians that stand out right now are eddie izzard and chris rock but they don't dive into themselves as deeply as john <UNK> does that's not a criticism not by a long shot i love their work but freak is different it's moving in a no b way it's the best one man show out there and no one will be able to touch it for a long time
<START> what happened to <UNK> <UNK> career i can still recall when he was considered an a list actor br br was it <UNK> island the final nail in the coffin of a once promising career wow this guy must really hate <UNK> <UNK> guts br br this movie wants badly to be a comedy but fails to deliver any laughs the characters are caricatures and badly drawn ones at that but still what pains me the most is seeing mr <UNK> taking up on this kind of roles next to actors so far away from his caliber i mean at the time when he was making movies like <UNK> he could never in his worst nightmares have imagined that in the future he would be acting in movies with a <UNK> <UNK> a cow that just had her <UNK> <UNK> shut and maybe whats even worst next to elizabeth <UNK>
<START> i was a guest at the <UNK> <UNK> screening of eddie monroe and was pleasantly surprised with the story the great acting and the talented directing i found it hard to believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film powerful performances by uncle benny sara jessica and morris eddie monroe the supporting cast was chock full of colorful and amusing characters this film reminds me of one of those movies that you will look back on in 20 years and discover that it launched many actors into stardom much like the <UNK> where tom cruise <UNK> patrick ralph <UNK> and others can be found look out hollywood there are new stars out on the horizon and they can be discovered in a little long island independent film called eddie monroe great job
<START> this is not the kind of movie that really merits critical attention it's not going to win any oscars it's really not a very good movie at all heck it's not even really a movie just a string of short disgusting gross out skits strung together in an effort to make entertainment and as much as every critical bone in my body cries out to give this movie a failing score gosh darn it i'm going to give it a much better score the kind of people who are going to enjoy this movie are not the kind of people who really care what critics have to say so i'm not going to give some <UNK> critique of <UNK> quality of surreal <UNK> that <UNK> and on how our society oh forget it br br what's to say there's no plot development no character development no real beginning there's a semi enjoyable end that's not nearly as funny as the skit that <UNK> it and everything in between <UNK> of <UNK> bathroom humor that junior high kids laugh at it's actually pretty funny br br leave at the door all your <UNK> of a good movie jackass number two is just gross out crap that's really all it is i do give the filmmakers this though they come up with some pretty imaginative stuff you'll probably cringe several times throughout want to throw up a couple times <UNK> and shift <UNK> as the people on screen do death and vomit <UNK> stunts vomit crap <UNK> <UNK> virtually every <UNK> fluid can be seen in jackass number two there's nudity sexual humor <UNK> and so on and so forth br br it's entertaining if you're the kind of person who finds this stuff enjoyable then you will probably really like jackass number two i laughed several times like i said it's pretty imaginative stuff i never once wanted to vomit though i do have a pretty strong stomach just accept the movie's premise a bunch of idiotic guys do weird crap for fun once you get past that accepting it and going with it you'll enjoy it the only flaw in the movie is the sheer excess of all the weird and disgusting stuff there are several very imaginative very disturbing skits but it drags in many places as they do ones that are less interesting towards the end things pick up but in the middle of the movie the drag hurts the overall film's quality in a half hour tv show this isn't a problem but with film length celluloid it's inevitable that boredom will ensue at some point after awhile the gross crap just becomes br br on the whole though number two is an entertaining imaginative and above all disgusting comedy that will leave you with a feeling of pain <UNK> and hilarity go see it if you must but hey if you know you don't like this kind of stuff don't bother you'll just be disappointed
<START> an insane assault on viewers senses this is a <UNK> mash of <UNK> hindi and english movies poorly done the name carries over from a <UNK> multi star cast which the 2002 version also boasts of the story is taken from the <UNK> <UNK> roy <UNK> and visual effects taken a horrible attempt from the matrix terminator 2 and mission impossible ii br br set in a college environment <UNK> <UNK> kumar college kids is the victim who mistakes a fatal assault on her by two students as a collective effort on the part of our <UNK> as it turns out is a <UNK> <UNK> snake <UNK> as a girl in this life and her mate from the previous life now a super powerful all and any shape assuming <UNK> is out looking for her in this life appeals to him to avenge her <UNK> and murder br br so begins the mad killing spree where the <UNK> lover starts <UNK> each male of the group with increasing powers and tricks with <UNK> attempts the effects are extremely cheap with computer generated <UNK> <UNK> bodies and motorcycle stunts <UNK> the farce br br carry over from includes raj playing a catholic priest who provides temporary relief to our boys with a more <UNK> correct multi religion the original only had an <UNK> sunny <UNK> plays love interest in her current life and the ultimate <UNK> against the all powerful br br music and songs are below average br br avoid if you don't fancy cheap thrills
<START> i first saw this film in the late 60's and try to see it every time it comes on tv which unfortunately isn't often now that i have tcm and <UNK> i hope it will be on at least once a year like louis <UNK> jr in an officer and a gentleman jack <UNK> delivers an unbelievably great performance as a <UNK> island <UNK> sergeant with the classic screw up <UNK> and the story line in this one though dated is touching and very well acted and having real jar heads in the cast certainly helped in the realism of the film as well it's a great film with top notch acting and a superb story see it if you have the chance it's well worth the time
<START> being a fan of <UNK> <UNK> comedies i thought this one looked like it was worth a try i was quite disappointed br br the version i saw was on tcm but consisted only of the <UNK> falls movie the miss polly movie was absent the talents of the actors who give fine performances is wasted on one of the stupidest stories i have ever had the misfortune of sitting through br br tom brown tom wilson surprised me by being the strongest actor in the show but the spotlight is by slim <UNK> sam <UNK> who if he has any talent didn't demonstrate it here br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is great but doesn't have near big enough a part the biggest laugh in the movie is when she ends up under sam under a table br br the only one in the movie who has any sense at all is tom wilson <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> in general while she is physically quite attractive her personality and attitudes make her completely <UNK> <UNK> sam and the hotel desk clerk are just complete fools br br sam and <UNK> give up their honeymoon <UNK> in the crowded hotel for tom and <UNK> but then they take it back sam ends up <UNK> tom and <UNK> in their room most of the movie is them trying to break out but sam using a rifle always puts them back again br br towards the end comes the worst part tom who is finally about to make good his escape runs into a minister on a lower floor of the hotel now the guy who as i said is the only one in the whole movie who has a head on his shoulders suddenly for absolutely no reason at all decides he has to marry <UNK> br br he drags the minister up to the room he has just escaped from but <UNK> doesn't want to marry him he gives her a kiss and now after one kiss she feels compelled to marry him br br finally sam has the nerve to say to tom you <UNK> me when practically the only line tom had to sam earlier was we're not married to which sam <UNK> you think i'd believe that br br idiotic
<START> i was surprised to like this movie since i'm from the check your brain at the door and have fun school of film viewing however this film touched my heart i have friends like mentally retarded emily i have friends like and i've been in shoes chasing away opportunity out of fear and out of devotion to others br br amy disappointment in her daughters was almost <UNK> on screen and the awkward moments where she tried to bridge the gap with were raw and painful to watch and perhaps i am <UNK> than most but i never saw the twist with father coming usually i <UNK> on to those things rather quickly br br my <UNK> are similar to others posted here i thought christopher <UNK> wonderful sympathetic character a very different role for him i thought was underused what happened to him once he realized what was going on with the poetry would he like james try again second the ending such as it was didn't seem to resolve or accomplish anything i didn't expect the pieces to be picked up and all the ends tied neatly but i felt that i was left at odds with the characters that there was no real healing taking place here or any real efforts at healing being made br br otherwise exquisite and lyrical and disturbing and for some very very true
<START> look no further this is it the worst movie ever made there may be others that are tied but there are none worse there can't be br br i found this movie on a <UNK> sale <UNK> for 3 25 and thought no movie with those actors could possibly not be worth that price turns out it's worth triple that as the minimum they should have paid me to watch it br br i'm virtually certain that the girl in the picture on the cover of the package is not the girl in the movie they <UNK> someone else someone younger and <UNK> to make it look more appealing whatever plot there was <UNK> to about three minutes of actual movie the rest is filler and i don't mean the kind of filler that you only realize is filler when it's over or that is some kind of eye candy you don't mind having there i mean filler that has you thinking about your shopping list i think the music must have been made up by somebody with a friend who had a radio he listened to once it's terrible br br if there were a shot of a nice mountain a river valley a forest anything there would be something positive about this movie there isn't even with the <UNK> button on the remote even at top <UNK> speed you can't get it over with fast enough br br after years of thinking about commenting on movies being tempted but not <UNK> with imdb i finally <UNK> because i had to do my part to push the user rating on this stinker down as far as possible br br the <UNK> ask that you focus on the content and context i can't there isn't enough content to focus on and that's exactly my point sometimes bad is just bad and this movie would have to be much better than it is to <UNK> to being only that
<START> apparently re cut episodes from the <UNK> tv show on the big screen while this was frequently done in the 50's and 60's because people didn't have a tv or a color tv and producers wanted an <UNK> return on their investment big screen ticket sales or if it went to the small screen of a series that isn't in <UNK> the results were usually less then the sum of their parts the only time i've ever seen it work were where multi part stories were put together ala rocky jones or man from uncle or in the case of horror anthology the <UNK> and 13 demon street here the effect is to have stories of american criminals in the <UNK> and 30's dillinger pretty boy <UNK> bonnie and clyde etc inter cut with each other as a narrator talks about how the fbi hunted them down its a weird <UNK> that doesn't quite work because its clear that there are things here that don't belong together more than once i looked at the tv oddly because things didn't seem right in fairness i won't describe the <UNK> of the production since this was what early tv and the series was like its not bad but its not very good either to be perfectly honest the episodes of the series that i've seen work better a single episodes where we're not expecting as much given the choice i'd rent dvds of the show instead of this movie
<START> i first heard about <UNK> when i was on the for the local science fiction convention craig <UNK> banks sophie banks and brian came out to show the video and give a couple of <UNK> on making tv on a <UNK> budget i have to say that i was very pleased when i finally had the chance to see the show comparisons with red dwarf are inevitable since the first seasons of red dwarf were also shot on a low budget although <UNK> has to set some kind of record for the least amount of money spent per minute of air time and thus have to make up for the lack of eye candy with good writing and acting <UNK> banks who plays chief petty officer <UNK> does a particularly good job of presenting an earnest but clueless persona br br original idea was for the story to be told in two minute <UNK> shown in between other shows over the course of an evening although for some reason space didn't get how cool an idea this would have been and so the <UNK> were all rolled up into a one hour show which space normally showed in two half hour episodes the existing dvd doesn't include episode 3 which premiered at con in seattle in 2005 or episode 4 which was <UNK> at in <UNK> in 2006 but if you're in touch with your local <UNK> community you may catch news of a showing somewhere near you
<START> the first time i saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching the kim possible movie the commercial showed <UNK> and her friend discussing the meaning of the word nothing it is one of the stupidest commercials i've ever seen basically they go back and forth with lines like nothing is a thing so technically nothing is something when i saw that i figured it would be yet another lame <UNK> maguire <UNK> by disney but i had no idea how bad br br fast forward about 3 weeks when my sister turns on the t v naturally <UNK> happened to be on what i saw had to be one of the most unintentionally funny shows i've ever seen <UNK> it go something like this br br <UNK> a <UNK> tree <UNK> has an incredibly <UNK> obsessive crush on the very <UNK> and poorly acted acted out owen for some reason her friend <UNK> decides that owen needs to be tested to see if he is as good as he seems what exactly do these <UNK> involve well one thing they do is put a <UNK> on her <UNK> why so that she can be <UNK> and ask her <UNK> knight in shining armor to get it off how is this a test because if he <UNK> it he's mean and <UNK> and doesn't believe that bugs as <UNK> puts it are innocent animals too they spread disease and they deserve to be <UNK> but of course owen just <UNK> it out the window and <UNK> is still in love but that's not all <UNK> says he needs to be challenged one more time on something that no guy can pass this one involves <UNK> <UNK> down their pants yes you read that right and walking buy him to see if he notices their large <UNK> predictably he doesn't notice and we see <UNK> in her bizarre and strange <UNK> world <UNK> decides that she wants to be with owen forever raise a family with him and as she puts it live like wood <UNK> with their <UNK> that's just plain wrong br br bottom line this is the strangest most insane show i've watched for those who like to make fun of dumb stuff you'll love it for anyone else skip this show
<START> black vengeance is an alternate title for <UNK> hung ho aka tragic hero 1987 i have just seen this on vhs together with the first part of the story <UNK> woo <UNK> rich and famous also 1987 the poster and 2 stills featured on the page are for a 4 dvd set of movies starring rod perry the black <UNK> fred <UNK> black <UNK> 2 richard <UNK> black fist the fourth movie is called the black six strangely while the characters retain their original names in rich and famous in black vengeance <UNK> <UNK> character is named eddie shaw alex man man <UNK> is harry and andy <UNK> is called johnny also confusing is the fact that 1994 is given as the <UNK> dates on both films perhaps that was the year they were american dubbed according to the release dates given on imdb tragic hero was released before rich and famous was there any reason for releasing the sequel first despite some comments i enjoyed these films although they aren't among best such as the killer and hard boiled which are truly astonishing however if one day i come across a 2 dvd set of rich and famous and tragic hero i won't hesitate to buy it hopefully these comments about black vengeance clear up which was also for me a mystery as to where it <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> filmography
<START> always enjoyed <UNK> 1950 which starred <UNK> o'brien and was very curious about this film dennis quaid <UNK> <UNK> was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out she was having an affair with one of his students <UNK> gets involved with meg ryan sydney fuller who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and wound up having a one night stand and in some ways loved him deeply <UNK> learns that he received a drink which had bad <UNK> and would cause him a great deal of health problems if you like dennis quaid and love meg ryan you will enjoy viewing this film meg gave an outstanding performance and kept this picture worth watching
<START> i just saw this movie and all i can say is where are the drive <UNK> these days this seems like it would have been a great 2nd feature at a drive in in 1977 maybe playing with one of those joan collins movies but it's only worth watching now if you're feeling nostalgic for the 70's silly plot that is full of holes but it does remind one of the era it was made in interesting to see <UNK> griffith so young and anne <UNK> is quite attractive though not much of an actress in fact there is not much acting going on in this movie at all it's sort of a dukes of hazzard adventure without a <UNK> or a 1969 dodge <UNK> jumping over stuff in the woods but there is a <UNK> jumping over a garbage dump in this one
<START> as much as i respect <UNK> for what they do i was <UNK> and bored with this film the acting was ok but <UNK> phoenix was a poor casting choice to say the least br br what bothered me the most about this film was the <UNK> music whining on and on and on at the worst possible time in the film the directing and continuity was pretty bad too br br spoiler for example after <UNK> character falls several stories and is badly injured he can barely move to speak to his captain on the radio then miraculously he manages to crawl across a huge space covered in <UNK> and fire to punch a man sized opening in a double <UNK> brick wall using only a foot long piece of re bar and to top it all off he then gets ultra weak and <UNK> up again br br did anyone also notice that throughout the film whenever you see shots of <UNK> fighting fires and <UNK> people there is little or no smoke in the buildings i would think the smoke should be pretty thick in a flame <UNK> building br br i also got tired of hearing the search and rescue team yelling i need some equipment over here br br i really thought i would enjoy this film but i found it to be a weak attempt at representing the true life of a <UNK> the intention was there but i honestly think that this film could have been so much better i couldn't help but think that the producer was trying to meet a <UNK> with this film and had to rush to put it in theaters more time should have been spent on editing and <UNK> there was good flow to the film br br the special effects were impressive in some scenes but disappointing and almost ridiculous in others kind of like a jerry bruckheimer movie br br call me critical but i just can't see what's so great about this movie at least it wasn't as bad as the whole ten <UNK> which is by far the worst film i've seen in recent months br br i really hope there isn't a ladder 50 in the making
<START> my girlfriend and i saw this movie when it was originally released the controversy that surrounded the original release teen nudity physical <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were subjects that never touched our view of the film we were close to the same age as paul and michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions we were too young to get caught up in the simplistic at times acting and the corny at times emotional twists this movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have i still remember sitting in the movie theater with my girlfriend and holding her hand while she cried during the tragic <UNK> <UNK> final scenes
<START> what can one say about any wilder film other than they are the most human and real stories about people and what drives them bugs them <UNK> them billy created pictures like paintings that stand forever <UNK> the human condition he paints the good and the bad in all of us he also paints with love i can't imagine anyone having a list of greatest films without a wilder film on it they will last because they are true i first saw this movie on tv in the 60s when i was a kid and i had to leave the room because i felt tears <UNK> up in me and was embarrassed now i'm an old man and i still feel the tears <UNK> but don't leave the room i knew these people and loved them and grew up around them billy <UNK> them in this film and not in a <UNK> way but in a most realistic way that <UNK> the power of the human spirit
<START> this movie one of the best i've ever seen talks about it does it <UNK> ourselves in a <UNK> <UNK> in cold colors where the rain falls <UNK> a <UNK> world it does it displaying us the story of two persons living in this world a man and a woman a coincidence or the fate <UNK> their <UNK> but they're not able to open one to the other with words characters are the mirror of the difficulty of our society concerning <UNK> relationships an that here is taken to the extreme limits all the characters exchange only a few words during the movie dialogues are nearly absent and when some words are spoken they're often weak and empty far away from describing people's real feelings so the progression of the story the revelation of character's feelings is developed brilliant idea by the musical <UNK> only apparently meaningless that <UNK> the movie the <UNK> of the sentimental event and the drama of female protagonist lead us to a splendid ending heavily symbolic a movie totally different from the usual a clever realization by a great talented director ps forgive me for my bad <UNK>
<START> ok so it's a silly movie but i think they knew that when they made it and there are some neat little twists on the otherwise tired overdone godzilla type genre borrowed a tape just because i knew someone in it but i did <UNK> it out to a couple pals who also kinda liked it
<START> this movie has made me a <UNK> and coach larry fan the story's characters slipped and fell before they begin to grow as they <UNK> through incredibly strong conflicts those were understandable and completely believable like life there were no easy answers for the problems facing them all superb actors and an excellent script brought this true story to life i wish there were more movies like this one these days i watch almost exclusively worthwhile true stories because they are typically far more interesting than fiction additionally this one is inspirational and it teaches us to not to give up on anyone too quickly
<START> i rarely even bother to watch comedic movies or television these days they're insipid vulgar and most importantly not funny this one could be seen as a refreshing blast from the past it's worth watching and i don't believe it would be dated in any significant way classic humor is classic humor and good writing is good writing regardless of the era in which created br br i would love to see this film again it came to mind after having seen the somewhat similar summer school on television recently like that slightly newer film <UNK> is funny without being cruel overly sexual or <UNK> in bathroom humor the key of course is how the adult character makes such a difference in the life of the teen character maybe even a virtually life saving change and how they both grow up in the space of a summer
<START> it's nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the <UNK> man lead this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little cliché you cant help but like it br br i think the story was a little rushed at the end but <UNK> that would have made the story even longer superior to other romantic comedies such as 100 days with mr arrogant and possibly tied with my <UNK> friend br br it would make an interesting introduction to korean cinema not as great as my sassy girl but still good
<START> rock star is a well told hollywood style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how <UNK> became rob replacement for <UNK> priest mark <UNK> <UNK> on his likable boy ish charm and performed with believable admirably something he has been known to do since the release of boogie nights br br stephen <UNK> no stranger to <UNK> themed movies takes the audience through the wonders of the <UNK> lifestyle of an <UNK> species the hair metal rock god <UNK> <UNK> acts as the film's host plays the <UNK> who gets to see his wish come true his likable character quickly wins over the heart of the viewer who wants to see him succeed and gets the chance to give him the metal goat horn hand sign several times over br br the only real complaint with the story is that the supporting cast namely the other members of the band were not fleshed out or even introduced properly more interaction with these life long rock musicians would have <UNK> and <UNK> new surroundings br br naturally rock star is filled with great music <UNK> score the steel <UNK> original work and plenty of 80's style metal hits makes this soundtrack a must have let's all hope that films like rock star not only give a credibility to a style of music that helped define a generation but also spark a very needed revival
<START> val kilmer is almost nowhere in this film lucky for him he plays maybe 30 seconds of screen time and his role is completely irrelevant after seeing the film i couldn't tell you what role he plays in the film ok they suck you in the first hour by <UNK> you in dark underground <UNK> spooky movies filmed in dark underground <UNK> easily suck most people in to last the first 30 minutes to an hour then you will begin wondering why am i watching this i remember thinking how easy it must be for a director writer to use dark underground <UNK> to make a film simply film people wandering around in dark <UNK> and you have instant suspense but that is where this movie goes no further we all wonder what goes <UNK> in the night but there is nothing out there in the dark in this film but more darkness the story is even worse apparently there is an underlying story to the film that i learned of after watching the film but the film uses such poor <UNK> that it never came across clearly during the screening i still don't understand what the writer director meant to say some children trapped underground by a <UNK> sister in russia why are they in our time the same time as the characters are they ghosts br br this was an absolutely horrible film that drew me to write my first imdb review to warn others to avoid it
<START> brad pitt sticks his <UNK> finger in diane leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants funny horribly so the invented yarn takes the dirty dozen for a ride and sometimes <UNK> it to pay tribute to other movies lots of fun even paris when it <UNK> is mentioned in a delightfully <UNK> piece of dialog i was thrilled by <UNK> character and by his sensational performance brad pitt creates a true original i love the actor's lack of vanity there's a <UNK> in the character that is pure brad pitt tarantino visits a new universe but fortunately his hand his brain and his heart are visible all over the place
<START> this may not be regarded as a review on any film but just a comment on a film i saw when i was a <UNK> i remember coming home of an evening all full of wonder at what i had seen i tried to <UNK> my parents part of the story but they listened without understanding well what was so strange about two kids stranded on an island who fall in love and grow together and have a son as you must have guessed by now i'm referring to the blue <UNK> 1949 which has kept me <UNK> and <UNK> through the years almost 50 and now wonder full of anxiety and disgust who or what has prevented the film from being available in <UNK> or dvd or whatever i've spent a lifetime chasing the opportunity to get hold of it one day and nobody knows anything about it what a waste indeed sorry if my english is not at all technical or scientific but my mother tongue is spanish i'm doing my best to make myself understood thank you my name is juan and i'm writing from <UNK> in s america
<START> <UNK> <UNK> has made some of the best western martial arts action movies ever produced in particular us <UNK> 2 cold <UNK> special forces and <UNK> 2 are all action classics you can tell <UNK> has a real passion for the genre and his films are always <UNK> creative and sharp affairs with some of the best fight sequences an action fan could hope for in particular he has found a <UNK> with scott <UNK> as talented an actor and action performer as you could hope for this is <UNK> out with special forces and <UNK> 2 but unfortunately the shepherd just doesn't live up to their abilities br br there is no doubt that looks better here fight wise than he has done in years especially in the fight he has for pretty much no reason in a prison cell and in the final showdown with scott but look in his eyes seems to be dead inside there's nothing in his eyes at all it's like he just doesn't care about anything throughout the whole film and this is the leading man br br there are other dodgy aspects to the film script wise and visually but the main problem is that you are utterly unable to <UNK> with the hero of the film a genuine shame as i know we all wanted this film to be as special as it genuinely could have been there are some good bits mostly the action scenes themselves this film had a terrific director and action choreographer and an awesome <UNK> for to face down this could have been the one to bring the veteran action star back up to scratch in the balls out action movie stakes br br sincerely a shame that this didn't happen
<START> with several name actors lance <UNK> david warner joe don baker why was <UNK> combs given the lead <UNK> would have been a perfect fit for the lead as would warner baker or even others in the movie such as charles <UNK> combs was miscast in this and did a poor job of it everything he did seemed fake or contrived br br the script is poor meaning that if lance <UNK> or another had the lead role he might have saved the film removed it from my waste of time category but it still would have been a bad movie the screen play was completely lacking the director should have recognized this and helped the movie along
<START> tourist trap is an odd thriller that came out in the 70's it's about 5 friends molly <UNK> jones jerry jon van <UNK> <UNK> robin <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> roberts and woody kevin mcdermott who stumble upon a down museum lost <UNK> a curious and eerie <UNK> museum this <UNK> of <UNK> but strangely life like <UNK> is run by chuck an eccentric but seemingly harmless has been has one warning for the youngsters stay away from <UNK> and disturbed brother br br the curiosity gets the best of them and they go exploring the trap is <UNK> amidst flying objects <UNK> doors <UNK> that <UNK> on their own <UNK> by some hidden force the trap slowly <UNK> in on the group the creature and his army of murderous <UNK> make quick and brutal work of the friends until only one remains br br although not a slasher movie tourist trap still contains elements of slasher movies such as the chase scenes and the stalking and the fact the killer wears a mask br br the seemingly <UNK> abilities of the killer to lock <UNK> and <UNK> the wax <UNK> is used to great effect perhaps the scariest thing about this movie are the <UNK> which are admittedly scary enough to start off with but are <UNK> spooky here the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously <UNK> budget these wax figures are blatantly plastic shop <UNK> but this only goes to serve as even more eerie when their eyes move with an incredible human the acting is actually pretty good chuck gives a well rounded and creepy performance as mr <UNK> jones is great as the female lead
<START> following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood the plot has many twists and uses <UNK> <UNK> the event sequence <UNK> following following if you are willing to pay attention it is an exciting movie full of noir <UNK> with the running time at 70 minutes there is a lot to take in but the fast pace helps to keep the viewer enthralled br br bill is a lonely <UNK> fellow who takes up <UNK> people and seeing where they go what they do he is a bit too <UNK> however and eventually gets caught by a well dressed clean cut bloke named <UNK> <UNK> bill in a world the poor boy is not prepared to live in <UNK> is a smart rogue who seems to have complete control over the other characters by the end of the film the disjointed story is explained thoroughly the film is an excellent first effort from the talented <UNK> nolan who would go on to make <UNK> one of the most original movies of our time
<START> is typically considered one of the 3 master <UNK> of japanese film the other two being <UNK> and this is an interesting and honest film on the lives of retired <UNK> whatever happens when such a woman ages and loses her charm and <UNK> well for those who are interested watch this film one is successful as a money <UNK> but the other two have to borrow from her and are <UNK> doesn't have any children but the other do finds out that her old love is coming to visit her and is excited is a master in subtle studies of his female <UNK> characters ultimately draws the viewer into the study of the questions of ones happiness and one's life worth very good film indeed
<START> it is playing on showtime right now but is going to be released as a movie called three or has been released for 2006 mess ups include a supposed nude body comes out of the waves with her <UNK> on you can have fun finding the others it was a decent stranded hungry cold crazy person video but that is about it and of course what would a movie be without sex the lady has a nice body and the men are pretty but the story is the same as swept away or a savage is loose type with some blood wonder if the movie studios know they made a big <UNK> and already released this show and now gonna release it as three billy zane should have worn a top hair piece or <UNK> his head completely juan <UNK> pace is awesome and there is a couple good sex scenes there is a voodoo woman that loves the character <UNK> pace plays and in real life her name is <UNK> pace too not aware of any connection but probably <UNK> or married
<START> first off let me say that this movie is nothing spectacular the cast is like the saved by the bell reunion the monster is a guy in a bad outfit and like always the military is useless it would seem that the more training you have and the bigger your gun the more likely it is that you will die if you're in a cheesy low budget horror movie apparently the people in the movie business have little respect for the navy <UNK> the marines and ninjas who get it the worst the plot is thin a <UNK> by the name of dr <UNK> traps the he then <UNK> it aboard a cruise ship where two members of the crew let it loose you can do your <UNK> and watch this movie and not miss a beat the most noteworthy part that really makes it all worthwhile revolves around the <UNK> daughter toward the end she goes all martial arts on the monster and kicks his butt let me get this straight the monster <UNK> out the entire navy <UNK> unit while they are using armor <UNK> <UNK> ok its a movie it can happen right but here comes the <UNK> daughter who can't be older than 19 and kicks the crap out of the with front and side kicks it was hilarious they should get a <UNK> for coming up with that
<START> the movie is being <UNK> as i write br br i simply forgot how horrible an experience i had watching it in the cinema br br the whole idea of the movie is flawed the fact that intelligent europeans and americans stranded in the desert forget all concept of morals and civilization within a couple of days is laughable the madness of lord of the flies was longer in the making br br details that annoy are plenty one is the single african god like character that mysteriously survives the horrible climate and have done so for ages without losing his mind and he seems to have no supply problems either ridiculous so too is the rescue attempt from the tour guide an indiana jones look alike whose rescue attempt ends in tragedy and death a 5 minute walk from the <UNK> then there's the choice of <UNK> <UNK> onto the group by a guru like joke of an artist he reminded me of my hippie high school art teacher br br the worst thing though is choice of <UNK> obviously is an intellectual brain fart how that ever was going to be an pass time is never clear to me br br <UNK> are few and far between it's a beautiful movie but that's never important br br high school <UNK> weird for the sake of weird it's a complete waste of time unless you like <UNK> useless art movies
<START> well where to start describing this celluloid <UNK> you already know the big fat <UNK> passing as a plot so let's <UNK> point out that this is so pc it's offensive hard to believe that frank oz the same guy that gave us laugh <UNK> like little shop of horrors and <UNK> made this unfunny mess br br so this guy doesn't know he's gay till this actor points it out ok sure if anyone ever says i'm gay i'll know the truth even if i currently like girls more than george <UNK> likes a dollar br br and how to know the true nature of my sexuality well if i like classic dancing and barbra streisand i'm gay if i dress like a blind man in a hurry with half my shirt hanging out i'm straight oh sure br br and here's the big cliché of clichés no matter how you look there's always a very attractive hollywood actor <UNK> adore every bit of grease under your skin or a top model <UNK> love your zero iq your butt ugly face and your pointing out ears if all those gay common places weren't enough to get me angry this did in real world looks matter folks and i know for sure br br i see it coming now you'll say relax it's a comedy don't take it so seriously if being a comedy gives anything <UNK> <UNK> to suck out loud i think the world has a serious problem wouldn't be much better and funnier to make a movie to those old tiresome clichés instead of <UNK> them over and over again br br so one of the absolutely worst movies i've ever seen 1 out of 10 if giving this rating has something to do with my sexual please let me know i'm interested
<START> i never thought i'd say this about a biopic but there is a near over abundance of characterization especially concerning <UNK> emotions and too little on the literal <UNK> in his life by the end i'm not sure if he dies he's supposed to or if his sister finally dies she's supposed to or if the director spent a little too much time on the <UNK> <UNK> that's an inside joke in case you missed it wrote a children's book called night on the <UNK> <UNK> however this glimpse inside the mind of a writer who <UNK> poetry and fairy tales from his imagination is very intelligent creative entertaining and emotionally powerful br br all this despite the fact that everyone is animated as animals like in many of stories br br some of the visuals are truly astounding especially considering that it was a made for tv movie seriously some of them like the sequence with birds <UNK> blue light rival parts of <UNK> however i still can't stand computer animation when it is mixed with <UNK> animation the cgi trains are horribly obvious even more so than the <UNK> train br br 8 10
<START> didn't sound like it was from a fantasy film the film is dark with dark overtones the soundtrack way too uplifting to the point it <UNK> on the visuals i'm sure they were aiming for something <UNK> but it just didn't work the scene when <UNK> is attempting to escape is a perfect example why does it sound like the <UNK> there is no comedy there is no <UNK> to this br br the idea of the movie is great and the acting is very good as well i enjoyed everyone's performances it's available on online viewing br br definitely worth a viewing but write your own soundtrack
<START> the movie is complete disaster i don't know who write scripts for movies like this one but i would definitely love to meet one of them and talk to him a little bit perhaps script writers really don't know sh t about situation in foreign countries in present or recent past or they just don't give a damn and write everything that they think it's interesting br br a great and <UNK> formula with mad dictator 1 lonely hero an american of course might seem like a good idea but come on we had such a <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> who did a lot of bad things to it's people but i simply can't imagine him yelling shoot them shoot them with such a <UNK> passion like in medieval times maybe they wanted to show how evil he was but it was a stupid idea much better impression would be if he just did it in cold blood like the real monsters do br br the list of nonsense is too long but the funniest thing is no matter how many national tv stations there are in russia russian president watch american <UNK> news <UNK> br br give me a break br br burn this piece of please br br awful
<START> to be honest i thought this movie would be a japanese drama i was dead wrong this movie is based of the popular japanese anime novel of the same name it tells the story of a town that is cursed by the or the spiral in english little by little the towns residents start to slowly become dangerously and violently obsessed with anything to do with <UNK> and some of the residents start to actually turn into living things the actually have some sort of spiral within them such as a <UNK> br br the movie was one giant random acid trip twisted with romance and drama sort of like what makes this movie disturbing is the ways that some of the people are obsessed with the spiral for example one of the <UNK> has a garage full of house hold objects with <UNK> <UNK> into them one girl took her extremely long hair and <UNK> to an insanely huge spiral like style one kid slowly transformed into a human <UNK> one man could twist his body into a spiral shape one woman attempted to cut her ear open to obtain the inside and one teen ran over himself so that he could be twisted around a car tire and one kid stuffed himself into a <UNK> so he could become a spiral br br another very disturbing aspect of this very well <UNK> is the atmospheric tone and the style in which this movie was shot the camera angles add to the psychotic and twisted story in other words a very good cinematography the overall <UNK> of this picture makes for a somewhat demented story the <UNK> is a blend of <UNK> green yellow and a little orange and the special effects with some of the <UNK> are outstanding br br however like many japanese films this one has an <UNK> of forbidden love and romance between a girl and a boy however with all the <UNK> and strange happening going on in the town it is hard to keep up with the relationship of the two teens but in some way it is very irrelevant more like a second hand story that has nothing to do with the actual story of the spiral obsessed town br br overall i would recommend this film to anybody who likes vastly different and bizarre foreign films it has just enough <UNK> and insanity it touched me
<START> after watching the series premiere of talk show with spike i took a moment to really think wow there are actually good shows on after 12 besides snl and i was also sad to see that it was only 30 minutes long his great writing skills helped this show overcome a series lack of money and helping hands electronic lincoln was hilarious and i really think this will be a good dark horse talk show br br i was very happy with the way he handled it and gave andy some good lines to work with as you would have suspected it was a little shaky but for that kind of time <UNK> it was very good br br overall if you are not someone on <UNK> or even if you are and you don't have something more important to do than watch this great piece and have a fun time doing it
<START> i was 12 when this film was released and <UNK> it the <UNK> were inspiring and it made me feel good watching it several <UNK> at the cinema i actually had the soundtrack album and played the <UNK> over and over br br 26 years later i'm ashamed just sat and watched it with my 2 daughters who enjoyed it <UNK> but my cynical older grown up eyes hated it it's very poorly directed in many places and considering it was lionel <UNK> directing i really wanted to enjoy it the character animation was so rough yet the backgrounds were quite good i remember the critics at the time saying that it was a poor film and was horrified but now i agree br br it is an old film yes compared to what can be achieved now maybe that's why i thought it was good then but that does not excuse it for it's poor acting directing and <UNK> the main child actor's voice <UNK> dubbed which is very distracting too can't quite see what they were trying achieve when it was being made all that it become was a weak film
<START> okay it features one lovely blink and you miss it joke when the dead are rising from their <UNK> the names of the old time horror directors like jacques <UNK> and jean are featured in the <UNK> and the <UNK> of morally <UNK> con <UNK> villains is on target preaching morals etc but why these soldiers are anti <UNK> because they have gone to the war most of them should be <UNK> right why they don't go to killing the enemies who killed them or something why they all want to vote against the <UNK> why this story has made of a movie questions never answered
<START> <UNK> or witchcraft as it's <UNK> known in europe beings with jane brooks linda blair waking up from a nightmare involving a witch jane's mother father rose annie ross <UNK> robert <UNK> are interested in buying an old deserted hotel on an island about 50 miles from boston <UNK> it <UNK> it together with jane their young son tommy michael <UNK> rose <UNK> are planning to travel to the island with an architect named linda sullivan catherine <UNK> to check on the amount of work that needs doing they also meet up with the estate agent jerry <UNK> rick farnsworth hire a local <UNK> named sam george stevens to take them to the island once there they enter the hotel begin to <UNK> the property while back on the boat sam is killed the boat is let loose to <UNK> off into the distance they discover two unexpected guests in the shape of a photographer named gary david <UNK> his virgin fiancé leslie leslie <UNK> who happens to be <UNK> a book that she is writing about the gruesome legends <UNK> surrounding the infamous island hotel as the night draws on a raging storm outside <UNK> them from the <UNK> as a mysterious <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> keeps popping up as the ancient evil that <UNK> in the hotel seeks fresh victims for demonic possession human sacrifice satanic <UNK> br br the director of this american italian co produced film is somewhat <UNK> in mystery as the imdb lists <UNK> <UNK> as martin but there are <UNK> that joe <UNK> did the <UNK> either way to be honest despite it's bad reputation i found <UNK> quite entertaining in a so bad it's good cheesy sort of way the script credited to harry <UNK> <UNK> on the imdb again is confusing too as the actual credit on the film itself is daniel davis anyway whoever wrote this thing did a decent job please stop laughing at heart it's a haunted house horror but adds some gory deaths a surreal feeling to everything the different sets of characters have reasonable motives didn't get on my nerves as much as i'd thought they might it's not plotted very well it doesn't make a whole a lot of sense the dialogue isn't exactly top <UNK> stuff but as a whole <UNK> entertained me for it's 95 odd minute duration plain simple it's reasonably well paced a little slow to get going maybe but there are plenty of surreal bizarre goings on gruesome deaths to keep one amused one part of <UNK> which destroys some of it's credibility is this so called storm there is no storm in sight the sea is probably calm enough to swim in supposed <UNK> ending didn't really work for me either just check out the dumb expression on <UNK> face on that final freeze frame the hotel provides for a good isolated location adds a certain atmosphere to the film which has the distinctive <UNK> <UNK> feel throughout cheap horror at that technically <UNK> is not too bad at all it was obviously shot on location so it looks good throughout while not exactly the <UNK> of film making <UNK> it's overall production values are slightly better than expected the violence gore is of typical euro <UNK> a woman has her lips <UNK> shut hung inside a <UNK> so she can't scream as the others light it someone is <UNK> then burned alive <UNK> on a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> expand pop a woman is raped by a man with no lips <UNK> was shot in english so there is no dubbing as far as acting goes david <UNK> linda blair in the same film what more can i say yes ladies <UNK> does take his shirt off for the <UNK> <UNK> takes hers off both <UNK> blair are a hoot to watch in this thing however the little kid is very annoying really can't act at all i sure most sane film goers will disagree with my opinions but i still stand by the fact that i liked it would happily watch it again <UNK> is pretty good fun definitely worth a watch if your into <UNK> films or your a horror fan in general
<START> i have always had this morbid curiosity when it comes to <UNK> bad and <UNK> movies i also have always enjoyed so bad it's good flicks you're looking at someone who actually liked recent cheese filled kid flicks like <UNK> and thunderbirds 2004 br br so i watched this and it turned out that all the critics are right about this one it's a major flop but unlike a lot of <UNK> it isn't even enjoyable on any level not even just to make fun of it's just one boring cringe fest after another all the way through br br i had been warned i didn't listen i am a fool br br don't be a fool don't waste time and money on this pile of trash
<START> a fun romp a lot of good twists and turns and we were not even baked br br didn't know this movie even existed until watching the extra trailers on a monty python dvd oddly it was there along with the city of lost children and the adventures of baron br br the plot keeps you wondering throughout br br the acting was awesome hank <UNK> shows his talent again bill bob is billy bob br br definitely worth watching
<START> i knew it would be a bad movie when i rented it but i hoped for a good bad movie oh well had fun making fun of the endless sand <UNK> eating <UNK> dung well actually <UNK> and weird <UNK> acting from i think it was about five actors the dvd needs a director's commentary so that i can find out what he was thinking or if he was at all i can't believe they actually went to england and wherever to film this could have been done anywhere would have been better if they had managed to get her naked the best line of the movie he waiting for his <UNK> <UNK> still waiting now that was funny if anyone had more than 3 pages of dialog beyond the narrator shut up already then i'll watch it again
<START> the third part of miike's dead or alive trilogy is as unrelated to the first two parts as they were to each other more or less show and <UNK> are back again for the lead roles but this time the movie <UNK> us forward 300 years or so into the future post apocalypse br br <UNK> plays a tough cop an <UNK> for the corrupt city's extreme police <UNK> and show plays a drifter who <UNK> up with a bunch of the city's <UNK> rebels the film must have been shot in hong kong as most of the rest of the cast are <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> ho being the most <UNK> faces there's also a hk stunt crew on hand for the films action sequences which are very cool in a hk via miike style br br this could be fodder for a dreadful low budget b movie but in miike's hands it of course becomes something more interesting it's quite a slow thoughtful film that <UNK> along and doesn't try to force anything down the viewer's throat characters are rounded and interesting and the plot an interesting but fairly loose <UNK> for the story to be hung on br br all in all a fairly low key effort until the action scenes which show miike's increasing <UNK> at directing and <UNK> very nice action watching the short making of with show <UNK> in wire <UNK> is really fun you can tell they were having a great time br br the finale of the film tries to tie together the 3 dead or alive movies which is quite unnecessary because each one is really self contained miike's explanation of the connection is very funny though and <UNK> the series off quite nicely br br not as deep or well developed as not as outrageous and intense as still another good miike movie though
<START> after getting thrown out of their last job and finding <UNK> <UNK> in the united kingdom the six members of the wonder boys better known as the crazy gang see an <UNK> for <UNK> in the gold strike town of red <UNK> in the <UNK> territory it's from a newspaper <UNK> and on the back there's a story about chamberlain saying the country better be prepared for war off they go to the <UNK> and the frozen limits br br by the way it's case of misplaced <UNK> the <UNK> is forty years old and it refers to joe chamberlain and the <UNK> war rather than <UNK> in the current crisis but that's typical of how things go for this crew i can see stan laurel making the same mistake br br of course when they get there it's a ghost town inhabited only by young jean kent and her grandfather moore <UNK> he's getting on in years and is a bit touched in the head got a gold mine that he's misplaced somewhere that he goes to in his sleep that is when he's <UNK> the gang better help him find that mine or otherwise pretty ms kent won't marry <UNK> <UNK> anthony <UNK> but rather saloon owner bernard lee a fate worse than death br br this was my first exposure to the crazy gang and i can see both why they were so acclaimed in the uk and why they never made any impact across the pond the jokes come fast and furious and then were a number of things that the code in the usa just wouldn't allow the jokes are also strictly <UNK> british and a lot just wouldn't be gotten over here br br the sight gags are universal the final chase scene is worthy of anything that the marx brothers did in america my suggestion is that if you watch the frozen limits tape it if you have a working <UNK> with british history and run it two or three times just to make sure you pick up everything it will be worth it
<START> okay i had watched this movie when i was very little and the day that we were cleaning out the closet i see this i thought i have no idea of what this movie was like so i went ahead and put it in oh my god this film is so darn bad i never thought that this film could ever get as close to my least favorite film as it did but i did laugh because all the jokes were so corny and ridiculous not funny so much stuff in this movie was funny because it was so stupid this film is not anywhere near good i would have to say if you want to watch this movie you definitely better not expect anything big and if you've already seen it trust me i feel your pain as well
<START> i'm pretty sure poe would have considered this a travesty the first two stories are decent nothing spectacular and then there's toby <UNK> what on earth was fellini thinking it's a rambling random dull piece with little to recommend it one should feel frustrated at the lack of <UNK> or conclusion but there's only relief that it's over
<START> superb even the author was laughing at the end and what a balcony scene this film has it all <UNK> funny and yet strangely faithful to the <UNK> of <UNK> but not for the faint of heart and the best credits since monty python and the holy grail i am troma
<START> why jessie <UNK> one of <UNK> top musical stars was in this movie in between her <UNK> the good companions and the classic <UNK> is a good question when i first saw it i was really disappointed i wanted to see her sing and dance she was billed as <UNK> the non stop variety girl but there was more stop than variety br br now i see it as a good little drama br br it is about a bus crash and the stories leading up to it of the people on the bus br br apart from jessie <UNK> who is great as <UNK> sir ralph richardson plays her fiancée yes that's right br br edmund <UNK> who went to hollywood to co star in <UNK> movies and also with natalie wood in miracle on <UNK> street plays a grumpy businessman gordon <UNK> is his very annoying partner br br williams who wrote night must fall was the black <UNK> villain and frank <UNK> who went to hollywood and appeared in david <UNK> and the devil doll is the young man in trouble <UNK> hale who was married to jessie <UNK> at the time played the bus conductor
<START> this was an excellent show it came on <UNK> back home in chicago and i remember cindy from played the teen aged daughter the show dealt with subjects such as sex <UNK> pressure and <UNK> it was about a middle class black family who had a teen aged daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from <UNK> or somewhere i can't remember i remember several episodes but the one i remember most was when their cousin got her period for the first time i was probably 7 8 when i first watched it and i was able to keep up with the program this was a great show i can't remember the name of the guy who played the son on the show but i always got him confused with kevin <UNK>
<START> the real star of the last of the airport films is that big <UNK> <UNK> the french created called the <UNK> if you bear in mind that the whole film is dedicated to showing what that <UNK> <UNK> plane could do in the sky than the whole film kind of makes sense br br but if you're expecting some serious drama here than by all means take some of the <UNK> action the <UNK> shows here when some nasty folks try to shoot her down br br susan <UNK> plays a television news reporter who also happens to be the mistress of military industrial <UNK> robert wagner one of <UNK> <UNK> just happens to bring her information on some of <UNK> dirty business <UNK> selling arms to folks not friendly to the usa when the source <UNK> is killed in front of her and she's nearly done in by a hit man whom she escapes from of course she confronts wagner with the information and of course he <UNK> it but right before <UNK> boards the <UNK> widow kathleen maguire hands her the necessary documents br br but on the way to <UNK> with a stop in paris wagner and his <UNK> try to put the big bird down but the <UNK> crew of <UNK> <UNK> david warner and george kennedy is up to all their tricks it's quite a bag full as you'll see if you want to watch the film br br if you're an <UNK> <UNK> you absolutely won't care about the plot it's like the film le mans with steve mcqueen which has a legion of auto racing fans who have made it a cult item maybe le mans is better at that because they just didn't bother with any kind of story br br among the passengers is a pot smoking <UNK> played by <UNK> walker a <UNK> mother accompanying a new heart for her child played by <UNK> <UNK> and martha <UNK> a woman with a weak <UNK> who spends the entire trip from washington to paris in the <UNK> she's actually the best one here br br robert wagner must have been psychic though because i'm sure on the strength of this film he got the part of doctor number two in the austin powers series br br i'm sure all concerned got a big pay day out of this film but it seems to have killed the airport saga of movies

<START> on many levels it's very good in fact considering that this was a low budget british indie by a first time feature director with a largely <UNK> cast it's a magnificent achievement i don't know how much it cost the figure of <UNK> 000 was <UNK> about in publicity but you never know how reliable a figure like that is the point is that this film looks like it cost a couple of million <UNK> and it clearly cost a tiny <UNK> of that great special effects terrific production design effective props and costumes excellent photography good acting and direction an impressive score and an absolutely stunning sound mix even having said that much of the script was great the characters were clearly identified and all had something to do this is a movie about ten men all dressed roughly the same in one location and it would be easy for them to be <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but these were ten characters mostly that was done through the dialogue and the way they <UNK> to things throughout the middle act when the plot was developing the script told the story well and showed how it affected the characters if the whole film was like the second act it would be stunning br br before the ship blows up twelve people make it to individual escape <UNK> or which blast away from the ship they're not much more than automatic metal <UNK> and the poor <UNK> inside are trapped <UNK> and have no real idea where they're going but that makes sense i like the e <UNK> they're an excellent idea done very well and make more sense than a nice <UNK> escape capsule i also like the way that we are specifically told later that they are designed for ship to ship escape but can just about make in an <UNK> because let's face it these guys were bloody lucky that their ship was blown up so close to a planet that said it doesn't look to me like there are <UNK> <UNK> e <UNK> still on the <UNK> and you have to wonder how the prisoner is able to get into an e <UNK> but in he gets and it has just occurred to me shouldn't the captain have gone down with his ship rather than being the first guy out of there anyway the e <UNK> all land on a <UNK> planet with nothing but sand and sparse <UNK> or at least on a sandy <UNK> part of the planet which may have icy wastes and lush <UNK> elsewhere <UNK> it's a planet in a sci fi movie it will be exactly the same all over we have to accept that all the e <UNK> come down within a few miles of each other so that the ten survivors are able to meet up firing <UNK> into the sky to locate each other br br the captain a muscular mountain of a man who could have a pretty good career in action flicks if he gets the right agent decides that they should try and contact <UNK> with whom they were <UNK> to <UNK> but they cannot do this from the planet they need to get into <UNK> the engineer says that if they combine the power <UNK> from two e <UNK> they can probably give one of them enough juice to lift itself on anti <UNK> high enough to blast above the atmosphere it can all be done on automatic but it will need a <UNK> to send the <UNK> the captain <UNK> <UNK> for this but in a <UNK> sensible move the engineer points out that putting the <UNK> man into the somewhat <UNK> e <UNK> is ridiculous and that it needs to be the <UNK> member of the team that's kid i really liked the way that he now points out that his name is david and the captain starts using it treating him with dignity and respect that was good storytelling and good characterisation
<START> with a humor that would appeal to an <UNK> small audience the average viewer will find it pointless and monotonous when cartoon network advertised this show it was made to look as if it was a major drama or event complete with a real rain scene and government officials trying to catch the sheep br br when it came out on the air i was disappointed at how all the characters were so one dimensional and a totally bland animation the only thing that put it to anything close to humor were the names of the characters like private public and general specific a few vague references to cultural aspects and how lady <UNK> sheep with her steel wig br br slightly off topic but i don't see why would sheep fall in love with that ball of dirty <UNK> balls called <UNK> it was hideous
<START> this typical teenagers movie is one of the best beside the story is good the music is well <UNK> the movie all along br br although i do not enjoy classic movie unless it is classic and better written script this one is exceptional maybe the hair style and language should be change a bit in the 80's i believe offensive language is still rarely heard br br
<START> extremely <UNK> vision of a war situation where the couple from ok they have different names and initial situations but the actors are the same gets caught in the <UNK> of two <UNK> the depiction of the fighting parties as <UNK> authorities are often captured in sublime surreal pictures and draws interesting parallels to <UNK> 1984 even if bergman <UNK> this context on a personal level of a slowly <UNK> <UNK> war that is why countless fundamental and philosophical questions towards <UNK> and <UNK> marriage are relevant and essential while the threat and danger from the outside tears open an <UNK> in the inside which was covered with before an intense allegory on the fragile <UNK> of <UNK> conventions
<START> deep water 2006 br br it is indifferent it's there waiting for you to make one slip up those words <UNK> are perhaps the best sum up of the nature of the ocean i have ever heard <UNK> its <UNK> are <UNK> not least of which her loneliness those words come from the mesmerizing and heartbreaking documentary deep water it is the story of donald an amateur sailor who <UNK> in the 1969 sunday times race around the world if you do not know his story it may be best to stop reading now don't read this or any other information on or the race find the film and just watch it br br after the first solo of the ocean in 1967 <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> began seeking the next one up this time the journey would have to be done without making <UNK> or stopping along the way having fallen on hard times saw the race as a great chance to get his family back on their feet he had lived through financial <UNK> as a child and wanted part in going back to such a life so he set out to find <UNK> and soon did in stanley best and rodney the two men spelled the potential cash cow and granted a boat on the condition that if he should pull out of the race he would be forced himself to pay the <UNK> his boat however was in serious need of <UNK> and he feared it would not be ready in time for the final departure day he was informed however by his that he simply must go  after all they up the <UNK> and expected it back many a time over br br the details of the story are infamous boat began taking on water and his progress <UNK> to a crawl faced with the decision of trying to round the horn of africa certain death in such a boat or turn back financial <UNK> and he searched for a third option he chose to hide out alone on his <UNK> waiting for other <UNK> to round cape horn in south america from there he would <UNK> the race he reported false positions and record breaking <UNK> then he stopped all communication for fear that his position would be given away he also had to <UNK> <UNK> fake <UNK> books for each day of a journey he did not take eventually the loneliness the guilt and the realization that he would likely be caught <UNK> too heavy on his final <UNK> entries make the <UNK> of a <UNK> seem entirely sane only a few weeks from home he turned his boat away from home and is reported to have jumped overboard soon thereafter br br odyssey is a fascinating one and its ending is heartbreaking but strikes of <UNK> our dreams so often turn into fears and the consequences of our actions often leave us so few <UNK> for a happy ending it is a story of a descent into madness <UNK> on by the <UNK> <UNK> of the cruel <UNK> the filmmakers do a wonderful job in telling this story it's put together with chilling audio and video <UNK> done by and <UNK> of his ever increasingly <UNK> <UNK> notes the story starts slowly and may distract some viewers but the <UNK> of the story are entirely worthwhile as it progresses br br there are also <UNK> into some of the other <UNK> such as frenchman bernard who was on par to likely win the speed competition only to pull out and begin a second trip around the world also in the film is robin knox <UNK> who was the winner of the competition he <UNK> his prize money to the family br br to read briefly on the saga simply does not do justice it's interesting of course but a quick <UNK> <UNK> the raw emotions and <UNK> presented here the final moments of deep water are genuinely heart breaking hearing the thoughts of his widowed family and the <UNK> and understanding of his friends this is a fascinating story and it is that which carries the documentary into such great channels
<START> spoiler spoiler this movie <UNK> just let me say now that i totally agree with what had to say about this what was sam thinking she was with a guy who told her he loved her 3 times in total was extremely hot and stuck with her though her trying times josh <UNK> but she decided to break up with him no cheat on him with a <UNK> ugly spoiled rich brat jerk loser who never said he loved her in the entire movie oh wait he wrote it on the wall does that count and left her in her time of need because he was scared chris loser <UNK> who would you want to be with the only reason i sat through the entire movie was because it had josh <UNK> in it and hoping that maybe she would die at the end i wanted <UNK> to get another girlfriend who was actually worthy of him the whole your mom thing was funny i enjoyed it i hate it when people around here say it but i think that <UNK> deserved it <UNK> should have said it to sam as well she needed a good slap how the romance started is a mystery to me they never said anything to each other anyway so i don't understand how they got together i was thinking about the cheese <UNK> you gave me did it have <UNK> or or oh what a come on the supposedly romantic lines were so stupid plus he's ugly i must admit i did cry in this movie for a long time really hard not because she died but because she broke heart he cried in this movie so many times he tried to smile for her but he couldn't stop the tears he cried when 1 he told her he loved her 2 she got sick 3 chris <UNK> came back and he saw how happy she was w him 4 she died i cried when he cried because he loved her her entire life and told her and yet she was dumb enough to not care and love a guy who left her in her time of need and who did not cry at the funeral 1 1 2 stars only because i love josh <UNK> oh by the way chris <UNK> your mom <UNK>
<START> well first off the twins are exactly the same there is no one is <UNK> and one is <UNK> ashley is <UNK> than mary kate though and their boyfriends aren't even french so that is bad because they are <UNK> the accents <UNK> it is also not that bad not their best i am a big mary kate and ashley fan don't get me wrong the storyline is ok and it is funny to watch it is not the type of movie that you would watch over and over again but hey when they made this movie they were still new at the whole making their own movie thing the girls also act like they are older then 13 but if you are a young viewer this is a good movie not so good if you are older than 13 unless you are a parent watching a movie with your kids then it's ok good luck <UNK> a with your future movies
<START> on the plus side this does contain interesting information over a wide range of topics particularly concerned with <UNK> the ss and their research branch it also has some good piano music some interesting footage and some excellent camera work br br however it is a very poor piece of historical work it has no clear aim to it and the entire thing could be summed up as follows br br <UNK> set up a department in the ss for research into the origins of the german race they went all over the world they did some things and launched to all manner of places of these <UNK> were explored the results were not shown and the arguments were barely <UNK> they wanted to establish that the <UNK> race and the german people were one and the same thing through historical proof they didn't find any the members of this research group were leading <UNK> members of the ss and therefore linked to the holocaust and were seen as ok after the war and went on to lead german <UNK> br br these facts in themselves are fascinating but they are never explored in depth and no coherent argument is presented in the program that either <UNK> these people or them nor does this seem to be the aim of the programme the aim of the program is unclear it <UNK> from topic to topic the witnesses though presented as credible are few and <UNK> br br sadly this programme does not know where it is going or why and fails to impress the topics are fascinating but this program tries to take on a huge area of research and consequently appears to not know what is going on i would avoid this br br also the <UNK> the german <UNK> nothing to do with the holy grail of christian mythology except in passing mentions of to look for the christian holy grail are made but never followed through the title is misleading and the content of this documentary unconvincing and <UNK>
<START> one <UNK> said if you like austin powers you will like this movie i liked powers and was disappointed with this movie the film works hard maybe too hard for laughs maybe it was that all the villains in this movie were shouting as if the shouting in itself is suppose to be funny i get where they were trying to go with this flick a cross between zorro and the scarlet <UNK> but it just doesn't work austin powers if silly but intelligent zorro the gay blade lacks the <UNK> of austin powers the big <UNK> or <UNK> br br i kept waiting for a laugh and while waiting found myself amazed that someone actually got paid for the script my 15 year daughter also thought the movie was flat my 17 year old who selected this flick on it's title walked out after 20 minutes br br it seems many people on imdb liked this film but for me it lacked the good timing or jokes of a good comedy
<START> for any wrestling fan this is the <UNK> to forget no logic to the matches some garbage gimmicks <UNK> the clown and the giant <UNK> this was a forgettable <UNK> something rare for the wwe f the logic of hogan winning the world title at the end made no sense and many people feel that alone help put the nail in the <UNK> from the meaningless gimmicks of the roman soldiers to simply some real bad wrestling <UNK> vs crush being the worst match to simply bad match making scott razor <UNK> vs bob how can you have one of the greatest <UNK> <UNK> making a comeback and working his first <UNK> face a power wrestler who was <UNK> at the time this is a <UNK> that even the wwe has since admitted was way below what the expected just all around a stinker
<START> 'the is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them written by ronald <UNK> himself a former <UNK> to the legendary donald it <UNK> with energy and true love of life behind the br br as <UNK> the overbearing actor and main focus of the play albert finney is a joy to watch whether complaining about the lack of a storm during the winds ' bit of <UNK> or <UNK> to his faithful stage manager <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> good as ever about the old times as norman his camp <UNK> tom gives a fabulous performance <UNK> around at the <UNK> and call of collecting a bottle to go at the pub or <UNK> the former fool mr <UNK> scott often mentioned but never seen br br in an engaging support cast there's edward fox as a typical arrogant second lead <UNK> walker as her <UNK> <UNK> west as the replacement fool and many others br br this film has great energy bringing with it some of the of its stage origins it is true but being so well acted you don't notice very well done indeed
<START> i think that is one of the best russians <UNK> for teens i think i were near 6 8 parts of the movie one boy form <UNK> grade found a time machine in the old house where nobody lived and he goes to the 21st century just 100 years in future in future he meat pirates they tried to steal a machine to read minds and a story started soundtrack for that movie was very popular in soviet union everybody loved that movie which was on tv every year
<START> chip is an absolute genius and the end result of the projects are truly amazing the co <UNK> do a good job i particularly enjoy watching the project come together the end results are much better than when they came off the <UNK> line what with the mechanical and <UNK> advances of today however i do get annoyed somewhat at the fact the projects seem to be the property of the already rich and or famous it's too bad the ones getting <UNK> can afford the <UNK> let's see now vince <UNK> of <UNK> crew gets a car make over for his buddy hello if he <UNK> were a true friend he would have paid to have his friend's car restored what a joke another episode shows a middle aged seemingly well to do gal getting her <UNK> <UNK> named <UNK> done the husband of 30 years was behind it all the couple looked like money was not in short supply what a shame i guess the lunch <UNK> guys like me will have to save for the day that will never come i happen to own a ford project chip will somebody pick me
<START> for what it's worth this is a fairly decent road runner cartoon if a little short just under 6 minutes the gags are adequate at best the animation is competent and the new restored dvd master looks nice however that's where the qualities end allow me to provide a little <UNK> in 1958 thanks to a <UNK> <UNK> wb got hold of a bunch of <UNK> music that would be used in 6 of the year's cartoons br br there is only one phrase to describe this <UNK> music and that is it has the <UNK> sound i use that phrase to describe music which has absolutely no <UNK> to the on screen action and feels like it was recorded by an orchestra <UNK> of members of a <UNK> youth cover band the music in this short feels hopelessly tacked on and incredibly obnoxious especially considering there are scenes in this short namely the piano trap that would have worked best with little or no music br br i didn't think a wb cartoon would be ruined by awful music even scores aren't this obnoxious but considering the cartoon isn't that notable anyway it becomes almost painful to watch with the music it's kind of like how late 80's episodes of doctor who could be bad anyway and yet be made unwatchable thanks to unbelievably awful music which sounded like he hit the <UNK> button on all 5 of his <UNK> <UNK> at the same time br br i am going to have people call me crazy for this but i'd easily watch one of <UNK> cartoons over this at least the <UNK> music was usually in sync with the action on those
<START> the production year says it all the movie is a <UNK> mess of politically correct <UNK> drivel of a so <UNK> symbolic variety that comes across as ridiculous today every scene has the purpose of <UNK> light on one of the burning issues of society mainly the role of females in the working community the role of women vs men women as sex objects <UNK> politics war etc every scene is commented upon by the inner dialogue of one of the main actresses or by turning the scene into a <UNK> joke i have no <UNK> of any plot or who the main characters actually were it is the sort of movie where <UNK> is <UNK> by having a couple make love in a furniture store sales window while the sales agent delivers his speech or where a revealing interview of a stage actress turns into a <UNK> act for of course the offensive gentlemen of the press is the equal to a raunchy club audience then we move <UNK> on as we need to see war <UNK> in a peaceful forest we need to see multiple <UNK> <UNK> public speeches being drowned in the male blowing of cars <UNK> or <UNK> crowds and of course we need to see cinema <UNK> of <UNK> and all the other usual suspects you get the idea but all this does not matter at all the movie is an <UNK> piece of <UNK> for any male <UNK> bergman <UNK> a movie <UNK> leads <UNK> harriet and at the height of their beauty makes this reviewer surrender completely and just drivel  and also delight in watching them so <UNK> use their acting skills in a movie i had never heard about before today it is hard to believe how especially the face of <UNK> owns the screen every single time she appears the cinematography is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> often <UNK> in an <UNK> <UNK> and you just never grow tired of watching the performers how absurd that a movie made with so much consideration for the <UNK> agenda <UNK> <UNK> that women should not be viewed as merely an object of desire has nothing better to offer the 21st century viewer than a parade of stunningly beautiful babes as mentioned i am not complaining i could <UNK> it tomorrow
<START> closet land tells a powerful story and has many different subtle elements you could read lots of stuff about the movie's plot before hand but you don't really need to all you need to know is that the movie is all about an <UNK> along the way we learn lots of things about the <UNK> and the person being <UNK> we also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place especially when you have absolutely no control over it br br in the end the movie amounts to a warning really though the movie has several different aspects to it about what happens to people's <UNK> when they look the other way and ignore <UNK> happening to those around them br br if you've got about an hour and a half and know where you can rent this i strongly recommend that you do so
<START> i rented this movie with very low expectations but was pleasantly surprised this movie is extremely good stuff and one would never guess it was low budget br br <UNK> directed by <UNK> centers around an 18 year old named <UNK> played by the superb who leaves his home because of the circumstances surrounding the way his older brother died he is overcome with guilt by this event and falls into a hard life of a runaway teen on drugs and alcohol on his 18th birthday his father tracks <UNK> down and gives him a tape left for him by his grandfather of which he was to listen to on his 18th birthday br br the way the whole film is told is with two <UNK> stories unfolding at the same time the present life of <UNK> and the past life of his grandfather during <UNK> of which <UNK> <UNK> to on the tape br br the three outstanding performances in this movie are the ones from as <UNK> and playing jason the young 18 year <UNK> soldier his grandfather also the role of the <UNK> wounded <UNK> played by <UNK> ' all putting in fine performances br br a couple of concerns and scenes that didn't sit too well with me the priest father chris played by <UNK> who is gay and in broad daylight up the local street hustler the whole neighborhood knows about and then we have the local store clerk named jeff a sweetheart played by the attractive <UNK> who just wants to be loved and for some unknown reason is attracted to the very unattractive and sleaze ball street hustler clerk who sleeps with just about anyone and in all <UNK> is a walking toxic time bomb on top of all that he's not a very likable person this part just didn't ring true br br the parts i really like the most was the flashbacks to the war they were so well acted and very touching there is a scene at the end where the one soldier is dying and the other soldier is there for him to comfort and show him love as he lays badly injured and dying this is such a wonderful and touching scene it left me in tears beautifully acted br br i highly recommend this movie it is one of love redemption and the power of the human spirit to survive
<START> let me first start with the obvious has been a serious problem throughout history present in many societies and causing the deaths of million of jews that said the problem with this movie is that it views the united states probably the most <UNK> society ever to jews outside of israel as a not very different place from nazi germany set in 1943 the movie is about a man william h macy who gets confused with a jew after he starts wearing glasses a number of very nasty things happen to him after that he loses his job and he is unable to find a new one his neighbors <UNK> him all ending up in a violent confrontation from one of arthur <UNK> self <UNK> <UNK> novels the sort that gave <UNK> a bad name
<START> some funny lines are all what makes this movie bearable the camera tv movie like the acting poor julie davis is more than and the directing amateurish and or <UNK> but i can understand that no one had fun to realise the and trivial script
<START> the best so bad it's good movie ever made <UNK> ray moore is my personal hero whether dealing with day to day life or <UNK> <UNK> down the block i can always look to him for inspiration and <UNK> when it comes to <UNK> the man nobody is <UNK> watch <UNK> as he and his army of all female kung fu killers take down mr big and willie green awesome plot huh there are so many one liners that multiple viewings are necessary to improve your <UNK> if you say a couple of lines from <UNK> you are instantly cool if you are in the mood for a laugh riot rent this movie also check out the human <UNK> disco godfather and <UNK> the devil's son in law now can you dig that br br you no business <UNK> insecure rat soup eating '
<START> i can't believe i watched this whole movie another <UNK> in that i kept waiting for it to get better which never happened the sound is terrible going from too low to hear the conversations to <UNK> sound in seconds the plot is absolutely implausible the acting is mediocre although keaton does his usual good job as a mental case although being <UNK> in that role could certainly be considered a negative the director knows absolutely nothing about <UNK> <UNK> science or anything of a technical nature <UNK> i wonder how they came up with that <UNK> there are so many errors goofs and things wrong with this movie that if one were to list them all it would possibly set some kind of record as a general a <UNK> on the <UNK> wearing a non <UNK> off road helmet san francisco paper walls move when <UNK> <UNK> just appear out of thin air guns point one direction but hit things in another lighting appears and disappears and there is barely a scene in the move that doesn't contain some kind of error my wife who is an <UNK> in an unit finally left the room before the end of the movie so upset over all the medical errors i gave it a 2 only because of keaton's acting else it certainly would have gotten a 1
<START> this is the third movie in a month i have watched that did not go the way i expected the first two being the black <UNK> and <UNK> neither of which gave any new ideas of who committed the crimes br br i have always had a fascination with <UNK> and was so excited to see a new movie on the subject of <UNK> investigation that was not a comedy but after about 30 minutes it all went horribly wrong br br i could have stood for the acting the camera angles the stereotypes if only there was a good story about chasing <UNK> but none here i am not saying there was anything wrong with the subject matter but netflix pushed this movie as a <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> believer investigating multiple br br i stopped watching about half way thru can't believe i wasted that much time with this one please don't make the same mistake i did
<START> if you're not a fan of the 80s and you need to be a particularly strong fan or of one of the two leads there's nothing about this film to recommend br br the story as others have said is dull almost an <UNK> to the basic notion of the characters and the idea of making a slightly manic comedy i watched it to about an hour hoping it would turn a corner a twist would occur or it would somehow kick into gear but no it's not unwatchable it's just dull it goes by it goes by with bits of running around <UNK> lingering shots of feet at strange angles bits of shouting <UNK> but i didn't get a real feel of energy or manic fun it just came across as forced needless to say also there was nothing to laugh at particularly a bit of mild amusement here or there but nothing more br br don't be fooled by the mention of <UNK> by the way all it means in this case is that almost all the principal cast is female if anything it's actually <UNK> two female leads fine excellent the drug dealer is female okay their <UNK> is a <UNK> alright their friends are female okay the only other person we particularly see who lives in the same building oh female i wasn't on the <UNK> for that but after a while it felt like a conscious decision had been made to have the film cast that way and it felt again a bit forced and <UNK> br br on the plus side if you are a fan of 80s fashions and culture there is plenty to see and if you're a fan of helen slater she's fun and enjoyable to watch there's also some screen time for carol kane which is great but not enough br br overall 3 10 if you're a huge fan of the 80s helen slater and carol kane you could maybe stretch it to a 5 because of them although there's still the fact it's a comedy which isn't funny which <UNK> it <UNK> if you're not a fan of those things you might as well make it 0 because there's nothing much else to enjoy here
<START> this was truly a heart warming movie it is filled with so many messages loyalty friendship sickness death and the paranoia society has concerning anything they don't understand i have shed a few tears during certain movies but this movie kept the tears flowing
<START> the review on the main page admits that the movie is horrible but that you should forgive it because it is nicely violent no you shouldn't there are spoilers at the end of this review but how i can spoil this rotten movie i have no idea even if you are a die hard alien fan like i am wait for the dvd it isn't worth a 3 99 rental either but you'll be much less inclined to truly hate this film if you pay that than 12 bucks or better per person plus <UNK> <UNK> at a theater br br in the theater i watched there were exactly two laughs both by a girl sitting next to me other than that there was total silence throughout no or that was bad ass nothing imagine being a patient on an operating table and just being given the <UNK> now you know what you'll feel like in the theater after the opening scene of br br what was the budget on this movie like war of the worlds <UNK> 3 and other f x driven movies the director seems far more involved in what the cgi people can come up with than developing characters or a plot spielberg has tried and failed at this several times usually with tom cruise sure the movies make money but should they war of the worlds and minority report had the budget to pay for a decent script tom cruise et al and ss himself but were still awful i'm sure wasted 90 of their budget on cg and had no choice but to hire any actor that would say yes even though the casting agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and picking actors at random br br there is no tension developed in any scene so we are never close to being surprised who cares who gets killed we didn't know any of them we all know what happens when the <UNK> aliens make their <UNK> exit we all know the blood is acid in alien aliens 3 <UNK> and even the directors make use of the fact that the aliens can think can hide and can lay traps this director decided that the <UNK> scott james cameron and others were idiots for developing characters you actually want to see either live or get killed in this installment you will never care who lives or dies not a kid a parent a pregnant woman the characters serve only one purpose in this movie to die the opening scenes establish the fact that the movie is going to be a predictable joke the character development scenes mix clichés bad humor and bad acting and <UNK> the viewer to the point where we really don't care if they get killed so long as they die in never before seen ways but they don't the director tried to make something different from those who <UNK> him in the alien franchise but only succeeded in the good parts of the first films the human protagonists and stealing the rest from other recent sci fi films br br there is not one original use of the either the alien or characters the actually has little trouble killing aliens by the dozen even though the last movie led us to believe that <UNK> the aliens as such a deadly <UNK> that they used the killing of one as <UNK> of passage the is never really developed as a <UNK> creature its ability to <UNK> <UNK> into a host is ripped from several different movies most recently probably was <UNK> where <UNK> tongue <UNK> eggs into <UNK> or doom where the mutated creatures would leave their <UNK> behind after they <UNK> a <UNK> throat br br simply put we aren't given reason to care about anything in this movie there is violence but it doesn't shock or surprise and is nothing that hasn't been seen in any of a hundred slasher flicks the cg is ok and both species of alien are made to look and move as they have in movies past but since the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad we kind of hope that they all die the little girl was probably the best actor of the bunch but sadly we aren't made to care whether or not kids women or anyone else lives or dies we just want the movie to end eventually it does but not before another stolen plot line from resident evil 2 has a <UNK> aim way to wipe out the <UNK> and not before yet another stupid scene that is supposed to open the door for further sequels but does it in a movie filled with bad scenes the worst may have been saved for last br br sorry for the <UNK> but everything bears repeating bad script no plot unoriginal action scenes uninspired direction abysmal acting decent f x that were wasted because of the many flaws br br i don't mind going to an indie film and being disappointed the actors and directors and crew are probably getting their careers going and working on a <UNK> budget for a movie with this type of budget and hype i feel cheated along with disappointed this movie is a painfully boring waste of time from the opening scene to closing credits sad to say that a preview of <UNK> 2 was the best part of and didn't even look that good

<START> started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters in particular the relationship between the <UNK> assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all the scenes between the <UNK> owner and the assistant were nice but the rest was just very slow it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film the characters were very <UNK> and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce by the time the <UNK> <UNK> the assistant i was bored and didn't care what happened next and so i switched off glad i didn't pay to see it didn't laugh or even smile once there seems to be a strange tendency for americans to <UNK> their films as <UNK> when they are funny peculiar rather than funny ha ha i have finally learned to avoid what americans term dark comedies which usually turn out to be gruesome weird and unfunny now it looks like i will have to be a bit more <UNK> when they call a film romantic comedy as well maybe comedy means something different when applied to a film rather than a series in america i don't understand why america can produce amazingly funny comedies like two and a half men will and grace king of queens but can't seem to produce really funny films without <UNK> to toilet humour this film wasn't gross or anything but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn
<START> this film grabs you from the opening scenes and never lets go you watch <UNK> upon viewing <UNK> excitement over coming to america he's a likable fellow you cannot help being fond of him even when his <UNK> is replaced by <UNK> as his <UNK> turn you know that in his circumstances you would be forced to make the same choices he does to survive this movie comments on <UNK> worship of beauty and all things superficial and is only more true in the culture of the twenty first century <UNK> himself becomes victim to this philosophy when he tells his blind girlfriend you're young and beautiful if you could see you would have the world and like many a modern gangster movie when her safety is threatened he <UNK> a powerful revenge his innocence is not altogether lost however for he demands an equally high price of himself knowing he deserves his fate br br peter lorre is in fine form in this starring role only a few actors could convincingly accomplish this character's transformation from innocent to <UNK> criminal in sixty nine minutes lorre is well supported by all the cast making this a real ensemble picture and not just a vehicle for one star with a bit less preachy dialogue this movie would be a 10 highly recommended
<START> br br <UNK> of the funniest minutes on celluloid this short parody is at least as much a part of the star wars saga as phantom menace and far more entertaining if you ask me <UNK> wars was the first in a long line of <UNK> spoofs which form their own <UNK> these days i hate to describe it too much it's so short that the premise is just about the whole thing suffice it to say that many of the most popular and familiar aspects of star wars have fun <UNK> at them household <UNK> such as <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> portray <UNK> and robots the princess anne <UNK> character wears actual bread rolls on her head instead of the famous <UNK> of <UNK> hair and <UNK> is even more of a <UNK> than his original if that's possible ernie is one crazy son of a buck he's also the source of now the apocalypse now spoof
<START> mainly a biography of a <UNK> doctor robert robert downey who has his way in the king's palace for the first half of the film and then helps out the <UNK> in the second half mainly <UNK> meg ryan br br the good fantastic set decoration i e the lush king's palace and <UNK> make this a visual treat the language is also very tame ian <UNK> and hugh grant provide interesting support br br the bad after 50 60 minutes this movie simply gets too boring it desperately needed to be given some spark after an hour but it does the opposite it drags on and on the script certainly needed some badly needed <UNK> shall we say the film may look nice but it's a long two hours to sit through too long
<START> <UNK> jim is kind of like a romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two boys are total losers both boys around 30 living at home with absolutely nothing going for them i live in the <UNK> and i can't name one family like this i picked it up because i kind of like <UNK> acting humor now i realize i need to have a agent to that humor to make it work the acting and camera work and editing was fine the first 15 minutes got you set and the last 15 minutes helped prevent the film from being totally depressing jerry springer trailer trash type of story the female members of my family were begging me to turn it off but i <UNK> under the premise that there had to be a turning point near the end and we watched the entire movie the male family members as expected simply walked out after the first 30 minutes
<START> i broke my own rule buying this movie from the 5 <UNK> bin at <UNK> basically if a movie has a big star in it and you've never heard of it before it's usually for a reason well in the case of this movie the reason is because it sucked they <UNK> sandra <UNK> photo and name all over the cover of the dvd as bait and it <UNK> this little right on in i was thinking of <UNK> the disc to charity or giving it to the library but i don't think i would want to subject anyone else in the world to this movie worst lines what do you mean army buddies what do you mean your dad
<START> this german horror film has to be one of the <UNK> i have seen br br i was not aware of any connection between child abuse and <UNK> but this is supposed based upon a true character br br our hero is deaf and mute as a result of repeated <UNK> at the hands of his father he also has a doll fetish but i cannot figure out where that came from his co workers find out and <UNK> him terribly br br during the day a mild manner <UNK> and at night he breaks into <UNK> and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls they are all attractive of course else we wouldn't care about the fact that he usually tears their clothing down to the <UNK> he <UNK> eventually to actually killing and that is what gets him caught br br like i said a very strange movie that is dark and very slow as <UNK> <UNK> never talks and just spends his time drinking blood
<START> this show is perhaps one of the most boring most unfunny shows i've ever seen while the humour was subtle and i'm all for the subtle humour the jokes just weren't funny br br the show is about two in their mid thirties living in new york trying to start their music careers br br i saw the one episode where brett leaves the other <UNK> behind during a <UNK> okay the plot idea has potential but i got the feeling that half the episode was just filler and the other half was actually important to the story br br what i mean is they kept on explaining how the one who was left behind felt betrayed and had a lot of <UNK> for the other guy i've got one piece of advice for the writers mention it once for the idiots who can't figure it out by the way he's acting and move on br br and i found the characters were annoying the character who left the other behind brett came across as being overly innocent and naive the one left behind walked around talking in this <UNK> and robotic voice br br a third character who was the band manager was obviously incompetent but he was the one character that i liked he's also the one that earned the show a one star rating br br all in all a show i have no intention of ever watching again
<START> not only unique for its time but one of the greatest science fiction films of all time made without cgi on a very lean budget in today's <UNK> figures stanley kubrick made this film without the high shooting ratio he normally has stanley kubrick is without doubt the greatest director in history thus far br br this film was cut from five hours to two hours and twenty minutes and the art direction was superb br br stanley kubrick and the great c clarke <UNK> to write this time less classic br br aliens a special message on earth at the dawn of human kind and one on the moon which modern man finds br br finally humans accompanied by the most advanced computer ever made set of to <UNK> the find the next monumental message which turns out to be a <UNK> br br any one who studied film and or wishes to be a part of the film industry or just enjoy great films must experience this film br br if you don't like it then you belong to bollywood or your a true aussie
<START> spoiler ahead br br i suppose that you shouldn't expect much of a made for tv movie but this one was especially bad the plot was a good idea but badly done the acting wasn't especially good and the ending of the film was just terrible the main character was perfectly normal all the way through the film and then suddenly when we find out that she was the killer she just turns into a mentally challenged psychopath it's completely pathetic br br there is only one reason really to watch this film <UNK> <UNK> although haven't we all seen her in a <UNK> before don't bother even watching this waste of time if you want a film about the world of beauty contest then watch drop dead gorgeous instead it's only an <UNK> number of times better
<START> this is the classic western the good glenn ford the dashing hero the ex soldier the man who would not hold a gun again he eventually has to stand up the the evil land baron edward g robinson who owns most of the valley and wants it all then there's barbara stanwyck the real <UNK> of the <UNK> edward g <UNK> wife who will allow no one to get in her way even making edward g robinson look weak she is so evil that everyone else <UNK> next to her blind ambition and <UNK> to rule the valley and everyone in it the <UNK> in her eye as she sees people face death for her is unnerving it is worth waiting for throw in a young brian keith and a few others and you have a drama that stands on its own with the requisite shoot outs <UNK> and close ups of hard riding <UNK> and you have a heck of a western without giving anything away there are enough twists and turns within to make this not just a standard cowboy shoot em up
<START> broken silence or race against fear 1998 starring <UNK> richards william susan <UNK> tracy <UNK> ross scott <UNK> ken david bruce dawson director joseph screenplay sara jean <UNK> murphy br br this is another lifetime channel film made exclusively for television released in 1998 directed by long time tv series director joseph l inspired by true events it's a lot like the majority of lifetime movies a <UNK> tale for women raising awareness of the predator lurking within the family a mother father wife husband and mentor teacher in this case track coach the young and little known actress <UNK> richards she played the small girl in jurassic park delivers a highly convincing performance as high school track <UNK> mickey <UNK> who is raped by her coach kurt william and must suffer in silence as no one believes her story except for of course her own mother susan <UNK> together mother and daughter fight to put kurt behind bars the film drags on quite a bit is ultimately predictable at times far too melodramatic for the sake of drama itself but is genuinely powerful in the end <UNK> <UNK> performance is of the daytime soap kind but she is the strongest in the entire cast her facial expressions body language and overall acting is realistic in terms of how she as an aspiring <UNK> <UNK> her coach is in turn <UNK> by him and must now live with the shame trauma and further fight him in court william plays the part with a nasty sort of <UNK> though he is far from subtle he has abused other star <UNK> before who have remained silent and made it to the top and appears <UNK> innocent william a lesser known actors like the others has has never done a role like this but but he does a believable and strong performance overall it's especially disturbing to see him in this role because he is a sexy lead actor in everything else he does including some lesser known films and on the soap opera <UNK> light the only real problem i had with this film is the manner in which the film is structured as the film opens we watch coach about to rape mickey letting us know right away that this guy is no good but this makes for weak character development and story if the first scene had instead been the sequence with the opening credits in which we see mickey running <UNK> in the city across a lake we would have better character development because we don't know that coach while seemingly interested in the success of his star <UNK> is really a nasty piece of work and we would have seen mickey a person whom she thought she knew and then received a rude awakening when she realizes she was wrong about him director joseph is no stranger to drama for tv <UNK> landing star trek quantum leap the outer limits lois and clark earth final conflict and movies like la femme in 1996 had directed another lifetime movie similar to this stand against fear 1996 he manages to convey the gravity of the event we are genuinely disturbed by the coach lurking around the <UNK> where he rapes his own student these scenes are graphic and ought to be viewed by mature audiences but its message is clear sexual <UNK> and <UNK> are not always a stranger and can assume different forms and their <UNK> grounds can even include a high school this film supports the cause of fighting to prevent violence against women and <UNK> women who have been silent victims to <UNK> and fight so that <UNK> will cause no further harm to others despite other negative reviews this film does a great job in expressing its message and ought to be given to mothers daughters high school students including both male and female as bad as rape is staying silent when it happens is even worse
<START> pretty br br pretty actresses and actors pretty bad script pretty frequent let's strip to our <UNK> scenes pretty fair f x pretty jarring location decisions the college <UNK> room looks like a high end hotel room probably because it was shot at a hotel pretty bland storyline pretty awful dialog pretty locations pretty annoying editing unless you like the music video flash cut style br br this one isn't a guilty pleasure this is more an embarrassing one if you must watch this pick a good dance <UNK> album and turn the sound off on the movie you'll see the pretty people in their pretty black <UNK> and probably follow the story just fine br br the cast may be able to act i doubt that anyone could look skilled given the lines plot that they had to deal with
<START> richard 1991 documentary about gary cooper gary cooper american life american legend gives us a look at the tremendous all american star through his films and his life narrated by clint eastwood the theme is definitely gary american as we are taken through fast clips of his many appearances in westerns and scenes from meet john <UNK> mr deeds goes to town and sgt york the best part of the documentary is the home movies of cooper and his family as well as his childhood photos showing him as a beautiful blonde kid with the sunny smile he would have his entire life there is also a hilarious clip of cooper on the jack benny show doing the comeback on the number bird dog and benny loses it the documentary also takes us briefly through his <UNK> affair with patricia <UNK> which nearly ruined both their lives br br there's a certain <UNK> missing from this bio <UNK> it jumps around a lot and has no footage of cooper being interviewed which would have added a lot also clint eastwood's narration was described as <UNK> what it was was boring and <UNK> given that cooper himself tended to be the strong silent type on screen we could have used a little animation br br on a personal note gary cooper was one of the <UNK> men who ever lived there were some looks at him in his early films but not nearly enough for this fan that smile those lips that bone structure he was handsome throughout his life but in films like <UNK> and desire he is devastating instead of sitting through a scene from one of his worst performances as howard in the <UNK> giving a speech that he admitted to the author he did not understand a young suave cooper in a <UNK> would have been a nice touch this documentary alas was definitely produced by a man
<START> this is a bizarre <UNK> directed by the guy who edited the texas chainsaw massacre chuck gives a hilariously over the top performance as the owner of a <UNK> wax museum which our doomed teenagers happen to break down near the wax figures look so real one of the <UNK> points out <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> not so much a slasher film as a weird mix of psychological horror and old fashioned house of wax style terror i can think of many many horror films that are worse than this one
<START> another movie with a star of a wrestling so far i have noticed <UNK> can't act on the movie screen this movie is no exception br br the action is dreadful it makes you laugh at what they say and they can't be serious they try to act scared but they fail and look stupid the acting is horrible possibly from the bad director br br the plot was stupid just some people get placed in a hotel because they're criminals and they get randomly killed off the movie is stupid all the way through making it one of the worst i have ever seen br br the only think and this is why i give it a 3 and not a 1 is because of the way <UNK> <UNK> dies the pole through the head and the stories of him <UNK> was awesome br br overall this is a really horrible movie and you definitely shouldn't waste your time with it
<START> the <UNK> is a straight to video steven seagal film that was originally intended to be released as a theatrical feature in march 2003 an intention which was reportedly <UNK> when <UNK> prior film half past dead <UNK> at the box office according to some reports the film had a lavish 20 million budget including location shoots in <UNK> and paris and was completed as part of the <UNK> <UNK> to a two picture deal which was <UNK> after the relative success of exit wounds seemed to indicate that seagal still had a solid following br br despite the size of their investment <UNK> screen gems probably made the right move in <UNK> this movie it is nearly incomprehensible what am i saying it is incomprehensible i don't think i understood what was going on at all except in the very <UNK> terms br br seagal is employed by a mysterious guy to deliver a mysterious package to another mysterious guy other mysterious guys try to stop him other highly mysterious guys try to kill the moderately mysterious guys who try to stop him other really really mysterious guys do especially mysterious stuff all of which which was in fact too mysterious for me to figure out the intended mysterious wife tries to <UNK> the package before it can be delivered to her husband because he is a self <UNK> <UNK> professional who has been hired to deliver the package only into the hands of the husband seagal at first defies the wife then later gets involved in protecting her and her daughter from other mysterious guys with unexplained <UNK> as well as from her husband br br many people have mysterious <UNK> conversations many people blow each other's brains out some guys seem to die more than once while in other scenes <UNK> end without a clear view of the result so the audience sees somebody die but is not sure which one of the <UNK> is headed to boot hill <UNK> shift often adding further mystery or should i say confusion br br i don't know who was on whose side or what anybody really wanted and the resolution was as unsatisfying as the exposition at the end of the movie i just sat there thinking that's the end what the br br i couldn't even figure out the credits imdb says that aussie actress kate <UNK> from <UNK> was in this film but i'll be damned if i know where either she was left on the cutting room floor or she wisely <UNK> out of the project she could have found some activities more <UNK> to her career like having unnecessary surgery ripping those <UNK> insert cards out of magazines or taking some community college <UNK> in animal <UNK> br br seagal used to be a pretty fair hand to hand <UNK> but the action scenes didn't manage to redeem this film at all seagal is in his 50's now and is a very large man so he is reduced to a level of physical <UNK> and even during that he is contained in a <UNK> length coat to hide his <UNK> <UNK> he might even get a little <UNK> <UNK> the from candy bars although that's understandable if you <UNK> just how many of those he must have to eat to maintain his present <UNK> br br steven seagal seemed to be making a comeback with exit wounds but if his last film was half past dead this one must be pretty close to filling out the other half
<START> if you decide to watch wild rebels don't expect anything deep and meaningful if you're looking for a film that explores the relationships and structure of a motorcycle gang wild rebels is the wrong movie if you're looking for an expose on the breakdown of the american educational system and the problem of juvenile <UNK> wild rebels is the wrong movie if you're looking for a movie that <UNK> how rural police <UNK> are when facing a well <UNK> well organized gang wild rebels is the wrong movie but if you're looking for an absurd movie filled with scene after scene of unintentional humor horrendous acting a paper thin plot and community theater style production values wild rebels is the right movie br br wild rebels is the story of a down on his luck stock car driver named rod <UNK> steve after a fiery crash which rod walks away from completely <UNK> despite having only a <UNK> pants and a london fog style jacket for protection rod decides to give it up with no plan for his future other than to wander <UNK> through the back roads of the south he stumbles on the <UNK> angels motorcycle gang a gang being three of the stupidest guys to ever <UNK> up a leather jacket and a woman they seem to share this group of <UNK> spends their time <UNK> a rural town in florida by committing such atrocities as stealing a newspaper from a <UNK> <UNK> these bumbling idiots need someone to act as their driver during some larger crimes they have planned apparently these three <UNK> can only drive vehicles with two <UNK> not four so they <UNK> rod to perform <UNK> of daring that only an experienced stunt driver would be capable of like keeping the car in the middle of a <UNK> road during a low speed chase eventually they hold up a bank get into the aforementioned low speed chase and have the <UNK> gun battle with the police ever put on film i could go on forever but you get the idea br br i hate the term so bad it's good but that seems to <UNK> describe wild rebels
<START> <UNK> has gone full circle from <UNK> in 1985 to totally abysmal now it's such a bad reflection of the nation this crap tops the ratings br br the ideas for plots can consist of nothing more trivial than putting ever characters name in a hat the first two out regardless of their sex will sleep with each other the 3rd 4th out will have a fight in the <UNK> the <UNK> one will be arrested the <UNK> develop an addiction <UNK> get pregnant etc etc br br the producers are clever though the 30 minute show is only actually ever comprised of 3 lines br br 1 someone will walk in the <UNK> say what's on 2 someone else will stand up say leave it out 3 then a woman will say <UNK> <UNK> come in <UNK> <UNK> insult <UNK> br br that's it that's every show apart from the occasional get it sort id is it sort id br br the show was once a realistic portrayal of east end folk their way of life the came off when 1 they extended it from two nights a week 2 the slater family turned up how they attract viewers is beyond me the <UNK> character <UNK> everything that's gone wrong with society treating anyone else like something she's pulled off the bottom of her shoe br br the people who vote her the best character in these <UNK> must the same as the ones that vote jamie <UNK> despite the fact he hasn't played a game for 3 years br br what i can never understand is if the show is the <UNK> of british tv why do all the biggest names leave ross martin the list is endless br br how long has the longest <UNK> marriage lasted with them being faithful to each other yes people leave but until the script writers realise that characters couple can be interesting likeable without sleeping around the show will continue to <UNK> an episode last week had 3 separate plots of exactly that and <UNK> the doctor top even <UNK> as <UNK> unconvincing couple ever to appear on tv ' br br yes <UNK> is the most watched show thats <UNK> but many <UNK> factors contribute to that 19 30 20 00 is the perfect time of day to gain the most audience figures it has an <UNK> edition for 2 hours and more than that millions of the viewers watch it out of nothing more than habit but if they were completely honest to themselves they would admit that in 2002 more than ever it can be absolutely pitiful
<START> <UNK> is yet again another bad action film about a guy who <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and happy endings and fire and burning and overacting and bad suspense and predictable and just don't see br br dean cain got stuck playing superman on lois and clark and can't get any good roles anymore so i don't know if he is a good or bad actor br br this isn't good br br why can't anybody stop that bad people who keep making these things <UNK> swear they just s them out on a <UNK> belt and hope they are good they need to make a guy whose job is to just burn the movies that look bad just have a bucket of next to him and dump the cases in then at the end of each day light it and go home
<START> every time i see a film like this i get sick to my stomach when i watch a movie i like to see what i see in everyday life as i go through my day i see blacks whites <UNK> <UNK> etc how do you cast a film and don't even think of the possibility that other ethnic groups will walk past you i'm sure they didn't do it on purpose but pay attention i don't care if it takes place in kansas or south central all i saw was one token black this was typical in the 80's hey it's 2007 with all the <UNK> singers and <UNK> working as actors thomas <UNK> church could have paid more attention to his cast aren't actors supposed to be more liberal
<START> blame it on <UNK> is a romantic comedy 80's style with more than an eye full of sex throughout its 101 minute running time br br the plot concerns two middle aged men in crisis one of whom is <UNK> through his divorce the other dealing with the possibility of that same <UNK> both good friends they decide to take a vacation in exotic <UNK> de <UNK> each with a daughter at their side complications set in when one of them gets involved with the other's daughter br br this potential riot of a story is fairly funny and there are some good lines however it never really becomes hilarious as it could have any attempt at handling the moral issue seriously doesn't work either and perhaps director <UNK> should have stuck to the humour of the situation br br not a bad film but what really ruins it is michelle <UNK> awful performance as the naughty little <UNK> jennifer while she uses her body to full advantage it's the only thing she's got <UNK> acting <UNK> leaves a great deal to be desired no wonder we haven't seen her in anything else br br friday january 7 1994 video
<START> well well i had seen a lot of reviews on this one and a lot of <UNK> always showing the <UNK> scene but this flick is a tough one and i mean it by all ways it's hard to find a copy because it was a low budget independent release and because mpaa was on the hunt for every copy on vhs it came out <UNK> but it had to be rated for the mpaa so copies disappeared into the underground scene all people involved in this flick never did anything else in the <UNK> so it made this flick unique vhs copies almost never pop up on ebay or other sites and if they do you will pay over a 100 to get one but due us connections i was able to catch a release on dvd sold worldwide limited but it was to be a sort of official one now and then there are still some <UNK> of this <UNK> but is it worth all the hype surrounding it as said earlier it is a tough one to catch but also to sit through there are gory killings there is <UNK> there is nudity but there is also a lot of talking between the <UNK> and to be honest if you would like to see the movie in 5 minutes watch the ending it's a flashback in the killer's mind the blood flows and indeed it's a <UNK> but not the full 80 minutes splatter <UNK> for 10 minutes the quality of the movie is okay sound okay no <UNK> colors okay black is black and not blue as in many low budgets it's okay to watch it but you never will be frightened but it's one to watch with your friends having a beer and a pizza i guess <UNK>
<START> i saw the <UNK> video vhs of this that's another one of those old 1980s <UNK> whose <UNK> i wish i had br br this movie was pretty poor though <UNK> don't look in the attic the main <UNK> that is repeated in this is don't go to the villa just getting on the grounds of the villa is a bad idea a character doesn't go into the attic until an hour into the movie and actually should have done it earlier because of what is learned there br br the movie starts in italy in the 1950s two men are fighting and a woman is telling them the villa is making them do it one man kills the other then regrets it and the woman pulls out the knife and stabs him with it she <UNK> the villa and after she's left a chair moves by itself what's the point of that but when in the garden a hand comes up through the ground and drags he into the earth br br from there it's the present day thirty years later there's a <UNK> that appears suddenly and doesn't appear to have anything to do with the movie the children of the woman from the prologue are <UNK> the house the main daughter is played by the same actress who played her mother at least one of the two men from the prologue seems to as another character too she's haunted by some <UNK> not to go to the villa but they all do since if they do not use it they <UNK> it people die a lawyer who has won all his cases tries to investigate a little the ending is pretty poor why was the family cursed an unfortunately boring movie br br there's an amusing small print <UNK> on the back of the video box that reads the scenes depicted on this <UNK> may be an <UNK> impression and may not necessarily represent actual scenes from the film in this case the cover of the box is an <UNK> that does more or less accurately depict the aforementioned woman dragged underground scene although there are two hands and the woman is different it's true sometimes the cover art has nothing to do with the movie i also recall seeing a reviewer who had a bad movie <UNK> scale in which movies with <UNK> on the cover instead of photos got at least one point for that
<START> the movie starts off as we see a footage of a huge <UNK> back in the 30's in america then a short story is shown about a creepy looking farmer <UNK> who made a deal with satan to get good <UNK> <UNK> hired young men to work in his garden killed them and used as scarecrows he also fed the ground with their blood some time after 2 cops come to visit him one of them gets shot by <UNK> another one kills the farmer himself after that the present day is shown and some guy named sean is told that he has an old farm left as inheritance he decides to go there with some friends to see what's up little did sean know that the next night is the <UNK> night br br as for me this movie had a good story for a horror flick but low budget and poor special effects just ruined it dark <UNK> is a perfect example of lazy film making for example we see a scarecrow a usual guy wearing a funny cheap mask chasing a girl when he raises his hand we get to see a normal human skin below his <UNK> instead of some rotting flesh the gore is not very impressive as well there are some nasty killings by our lovely scarecrows but everything is very cheap and unrealistic surprisingly the acting is somewhat ok in this flick or i better say its believable some nude scenes are presented as well for the fans even a lesbian scene but those scenes don't save it br br verdict good music good story solid acting but awful effects cheap gore and plot holes slow this movie down not really recommended
<START> the scripting of the subtle comedy is <UNK> by any movie in recent years the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable the comedic timing written into the script is more than enough to make up for a well worn underdog plot when you're sure you know the ending surprise highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one <UNK> scene in particular great movie
<START> this film almost gave me a nervous breakdown when i was recovering from a few years ago i had just started teaching in secondary high school the whole teaching business was all a bit for a <UNK> but to mentally prepare myself for going back into the <UNK> i decided to watch some rather awful films the <UNK> was one of the films that i chose and then i put king of the streets the uk title of on just before it finished i found myself almost in tears at the sheer waste of it all my life the film stock the <UNK> i had paid for it a couple of weeks ago in the blockbuster ex rental section the time it must have taken to print the <UNK> art the effort of the <UNK> and musicians involved in the soundtrack as as their efforts were the list goes on br br i love bad films let me make this perfectly clear i love watching crappy films from blockbusters me and my mate dan used to sit and watch many many <UNK> horrors and laugh at them but this was a different type of crappy film i don't think that anything has come close to this not even tobe <UNK> death trap which is probably my second worst film in the world the whole making a car from abandoned parts section nearly killed me the <UNK> of music at any available opportunity regardless of on screen events the whole i can't even carry on with this <UNK> as my gag <UNK> has started the <UNK> of that film even now three years after i watched it for the first and last time still <UNK> me speechless but i am still able to type the whole making a car from odd parts section had me <UNK> horrible things br br i <UNK> you if you are interested in watching this film just <UNK> at the cover of the video and imagine the worst possible version of the story synopsis on the back i can almost guarantee that it won't be even half as bad as this film actually is don't under any circumstances contemplate actually watching it for any reason whatsoever not if you are a christian and you want to see a christ allegory not if you are a bad movie and you want to experience the true <UNK> of trash not even if you want your life to seem longer and believe me every second that this film runs seems like at least a minute make no mistake about it this film is <UNK> it is the <UNK> in video form as bo in get <UNK> said i've seen better film on teeth
<START> pink <UNK> is a cult classic the plot of this film revolves around the challenge to supremacy as the <UNK> person alive pink <UNK> contains some <UNK> repulsive scenes like a sex scene with a chicken and the scene where divine eats fresh dog <UNK> yes the movie is shocking and funny at the same time but the biggest laughs come from the actors' lines check out especially this line from divine kill everyone now <UNK> first degree murder <UNK> <UNK> eat s filth is my politics filth is my life on the whole i really enjoyed this film still its <UNK> an exercise in bad taste should be taken to heart and even those used to the gross out movies today may find this gem hard to stomach highly recommended
<START> when i first saw before night falls <UNK> <UNK> had just been nominated for an academy award i thought he's got it he didn't i watched <UNK> last night please give it to him this time this is an actor convincing touching emotional brilliant see also los <UNK> al <UNK> and you will understand what i am talking about he is an absolute <UNK> and i swear it's not only the result of make up work this movie is so beautiful so well done the characters are so real <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> how about a best director nomination i also have to mention the make up artists i can't think of another word but magnificent i really hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves as far as i am concerned it already has
<START> this is simply another bad chuck norris movie norris plays a cop on the trail of a twisted serial killer of women he put the guy away three years before but the guy somehow gets through the bars in the nut house he's in by using what looks like dental <UNK> then the killer escapes in a cleaning van and drives it over a 400 foot cliff and survives to spend time around a theater <UNK> <UNK> irish jack <UNK> is the best thing in this movie but like in superman ii he doesn't say a word somehow that's supposed to make him more menacing ron <UNK> of super fly fame and steve james are wasted playing the city's mayor and <UNK> sidekick respectively the film also contains the idiotic subplot of norris and his girlfriend having a child out of <UNK> it's so 1980's when <UNK> <UNK> serious acting turn with over the top musical <UNK> <UNK> every <UNK> scene in predictable fashion the film becomes a chore to sit through the build up while searching for the killer in the theater is interesting enough with norris <UNK> through the shadows to discover the <UNK> but the end fight is disappointing after beginning in such a promising way it's yet another disappointment from cannon films and it plays like a movie made for television of 4 stars
<START> black dragons is a second feature wwii propaganda film popular at the time it's not as bad as some would have you believe br br a secret meeting <UNK> by the respected dr william <UNK> george is interrupted by a mysterious stranger names <UNK> <UNK> bela lugosi shortly thereafter the participants at the meeting begin to turn up murdered their bodies being placed on the steps of the japanese <UNK> in washington <UNK> is suspected federal agent dick martin <UNK> moore is assigned to the case and meets <UNK> niece alice <UNK> joan <UNK> who tries to assist him the reasons behind actions are not explained until the final reel until all is explained at the end the story is hard to comprehend br br lugosi who had by this time been reduced to appearing in a string of low budget <UNK> is actually quite good in this one he is not allowed to over act as much as he did and credit for this has to go to director william <UNK> <UNK> character through the shadows and is reminiscent of his dracula even to the point of the full close ups of his <UNK> eyes br br <UNK> moore a one dimensional actor at best would become tv's lone ranger in a few years joan <UNK> makes a good heroine br br although a little dated now black dragons is not a bad way to spend an hour
<START> <UNK> spring tells of the <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> faced <UNK> <UNK> year old czech man who <UNK> and all who know him with his mischievous ways while his wife <UNK> plans her funeral <UNK> <UNK> shows us how to get babes to kiss you when your <UNK> and how to cop a feel in an elevator and get <UNK> for it as he pranks his way from day to day in this warm and glowing look at old age and one man's creative amusing but socially <UNK> ways of enjoying life while <UNK> to be <UNK> to the old home <UNK> spring is a plodding subtle comedy with messages for all ages which will have the greatest appeal with more mature foreign film buffs b
<START> i'm a fan of independent film dialogue driven character study pieces are where it's at for me some of the other <UNK> are right <UNK> isn't going to rival the godfather for best mob film ever on the other hand <UNK> is a well written and well directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor actress my problem with one of the other reviews br br <UNK> stands out as the only <UNK> in a cast of italians br br is a jewish last name and as such has a dark not a traditional one of an <UNK> he doesn't stand out at all rather delivers a great performance br br this didn't win many awards but it is deserving of a saturday night with a bowl of popcorn i found it for 7 bucks at blockbuster and was pleasantly surprised to say the least highly recommended
<START> i decided to watch this on <UNK> on demand for free because i figured well nothing else looks enjoyable and it turned out to be quite a good little horror surprise the film serves as an anthology of four urban legends told from the point of view of four teenagers whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere after they decide to build a <UNK> in the woods they begin to tell their spooky stories and the movie transitions to the events in the stories br br the honeymoon a <UNK> couple traveling cross country in an <UNK> to las vegas is <UNK> when they park in a <UNK> area by evil beings that hunt by the full moon i won't spoil that for you the hook amy smart and james <UNK> probably the most famous people in the movie besides beautiful christine taylor play the young couple who come face to face with the maniac that has a hook for a hand in this most recognizable short br br people can <UNK> too this is probably the scariest and most dark of the stories a young girl <UNK> with another girl on the internet but it turns out that it's actually a man who is obsessed with her and he proceeds to break into the house when she's alone this was really chilling br br the this is also a great story with <UNK> quinn and <UNK> who play a <UNK> and a beautiful mute girl who are <UNK> by ghosts from a previous century in a mysterious farm house this was good but it was the weakest of the entries br br the group around the <UNK> slowly develop their own terrifying experience in their segments between stories and the end of this movie is surprising and really awesome overall this is not bone <UNK> scary but it's certainly a great little guilty pleasure that horror fans alike would definitely find worthwhile
<START> a real surprise not exactly family entertainment from disney some violence lots of tense moments and a great story based on fact the theme of night crossing is determination wins never losing sight of their objective two east german families risk it all in their daring balloon escape to freedom the story is both harrowing and heartwarming time is not on their side the east german police are closing in and the outcome far from certain until the very end if you are looking for a good <UNK> entertainment that contains no nudity and limited violence then i highly recommend night crossing it is pure entertainment <UNK>
<START> i rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case judge and jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun but this movie got <UNK> <UNK> as it went on david keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent judge and jury was well plain dumb i gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2 i gave it an extra star just because david <UNK> gun was cool
<START> i had watched this on italian tv as a kid and recall being fond of it â in view of its mixing live action with animation however it was universally <UNK> at the catching up with it again after all these years i have to admit that the critics were right br br what must have seemed wondrous to a child's eyes is actually very poorly done not to mention boring for a fantasy adventure <UNK> both star ex young man' richard harris and director action expert hunt are ill suited to the material at least michel score with lyrics provided by scriptwriter don black is <UNK> â if not exactly inspired by the way a number of well known personalities are featured among the voice artists on this british <UNK> co production julian glover <UNK> love murray <UNK> robert graham stark and this being his last film work michael bates br br while the essential plot points of jonathan <UNK> classic novel <UNK> becomes the <UNK> in a war between the little people of two <UNK> countries and on escaping ends up in a land of real giants do emerge here it's done on a strictly kiddie level with stereotyped characters though thankfully little <UNK> of the comic romantic variety â which <UNK> the whole venture somewhat pointless outside of its <UNK> experimental nature since max and dave <UNK> had already done a splendid feature length cartoon version of the book way back in 1939
<START> just finished watching this movie as it were playing on tv and i <UNK> have anything else to do went right here to imdb too look on the trivia page and happened to glance at the user comments and what do i find every dumb idiot raises this movie to the sky i <UNK> even have written anything but when no one else takes the time to spread the word about this suck ass movie i thought that i could br br the acting sucked from pretty much everyone in the cast the worst one was the guy playing brian wilson think i got the name right as he were overacting especially when he was high the rest <UNK> as bad as him but no one was good neither i ain't no expert on the beach boys though so cant really complain on the story that much except it sucked though no motivation for any of the characters decisions most of the time but hey maybe they were idiots in real life to and what i found worst was that i thought it were going to be a movie about the beach boys but you really only got a grip about a few of the characters i hate when they do that in movies same thing in the doors even though i like that movie more don't have any energy left to write more it sucked don't buy or watch it
<START> let's get tough is one of those movies that people probably regret years later that they made full of awful racist <UNK> talk and jokes this east end kids story details how the kids want to join the military to defeat the <UNK> since they're too young they decide to clean the town out of those <UNK> <UNK> they find one throw fruit at it without anyone doing anything to stop them and he pulls a short sword out to menace them the cops say to stop annoying him he's only chinese he's on our side when the kids go back to apologize the chinese man's dead it's all part of this huge <UNK> and german spy ring the kids see to it that this is stopped at all costs i'm sure all of this was fine when it was made 1942 but viewed now you realize of course that this is clearly a product of it's time full of stereotypes german and japanese funny how the east end kids have a black kid in the group and he's not <UNK> either gee <UNK>
<START> tom hanks returns as dan <UNK> robert <UNK> in his first adventure angels demons which hollywood decided to make after the da <UNK> code given the <UNK> more controversial subject striking a raw nerve on the faith itself the catholic church was up in arms over the first film but seemingly <UNK> about this one and it's not hard to see why considering ron howard had <UNK> to do a flat out action piece that serves as a great <UNK> video of rome and <UNK> city and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful on location scenes save for st <UNK> square and which was a <UNK> model used br br so i guess with the bulk of the budget going toward the sets the ensemble cast had to be <UNK> down tried to step into the female void left by audrey <UNK> but given <UNK> character then having a lot more stake in the film scientist had a lot less to do other than just waiting in the wings to change some <UNK> on a <UNK> filled with anti matter in the book she's the fodder of course for <UNK> to <UNK> his vast knowledge of the <UNK> the and the great <UNK> between the two but here she's neither love interest nor his intellectual equal br br ewan <UNK> on the other hand <UNK> up each scene he's in as patrick <UNK> who is <UNK> taking care of the <UNK> office while the other prominent <UNK> are in the <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> a new <UNK> and he plays patrick with that <UNK> in the eye with nuances enough to let you know there's more than meets the eye there's no surprises here for readers of the novel but <UNK> performance here is one of the highlights of the film as hanks plays well tom hanks br br the book itself is rich with arguably accurate content as always and had a lot more plot points on science versus religion and a wealth of information that dan brown <UNK> and linked together in an engaging fictional piece of work while reading the book some years ago i thought that should a film be made of it it's easy to <UNK> and <UNK> more on the set action pieces sadly that's what this ron howard film did with a pace that doesn't allow a temporary <UNK> unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some discussion time over a cup of tea this one moved things along so quickly it's like reading the book all over again page after page being <UNK> just to get to the thick of the action br br catholic reviewers have called angels demons harmless because i guess it didn't <UNK> on its many <UNK> unlike the da <UNK> code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith and if anything this film served as a great <UNK> <UNK> video with a nice showcase of the many prominent <UNK> <UNK> that would <UNK> many around the world to go pay a visit naturally certain areas like the <UNK> beneath st <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> remain out of <UNK> but the walk along the path of <UNK> now that's almost free br br nothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive but for those who haven't this film may just <UNK> you to pick up dan <UNK> novel just to read a bit more about the significance about the <UNK> and characters such as <UNK> <UNK> and who are <UNK> linked to the plot but much left <UNK> satisfying pop corn entertainment leaving you with nothing spectacular
<START> this film is like the breakfast club meets mad city it's got one plot twist after another with justin walker corey <UNK> and james <UNK> delivering really great performances however this movie is not for everyone if you don't like movies that go all the way with regards to violence then don't watch the last twenty minutes my wife had to leave the room of course i couldn't take my eyes off the screen this is a really gritty realistic teen drama i can't believe it came from b movie king roger corman this film is a must see for those who are not faint of heart highly recommended
<START> <UNK> phillips who in her own right has <UNK> a great list of credits as a hard working hollywood actress shines in this third installment of <UNK> and village <UNK> series in this installment the sexual innuendo has been toned down with <UNK> showing a caring <UNK> side towards a recently <UNK> genius teen <UNK> delivers this role to the viewers with great the action and stunts were the best in the series
<START> i saw this video 2000 years ago and would love to see it on dvd a good film but i would have loved it even more if it had included the legacy of the beatles and the etc br br i also don't know exactly how true the story is were some changes made to <UNK> the story br br i was only 3 when buddy crashed and didn't wake up to his music until the late 70's much later i found out our family moved into our new house on yes <UNK> 3rd 1959 br br well little things you say and do his songs will always be remembered always
<START> this is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics and is a must see for all <UNK> fans why it has everything a great 70s exploitation film should have over the top dialog bad acting enthusiasm sex sleaze political <UNK> violence and many other elements of a good cult classic are included in other words <UNK> is a must see br br as with a lot of these films the plot makes little to no sense what i picked up from it is that <UNK> hustler <UNK> got framed up for having stolen <UNK> and half a million dollars worth of <UNK> while he was doing time his arch nemesis willie green the same man who framed him took over his nightclub however the sympathetic warden the only white character in the whole movie that isn't completely evil or incompetent decides to spring him free to stop the evil willie green and his drug <UNK> luckily he knows kung fu as does about 50 to 75 of the characters in this film do and even more luckily while he was locked up the <UNK> queen <UNK> sent all his to kung fu school with this army of kung fu fighting his words not mine on his side he plans to take back the nightclub from willie green however two racist white cops try to frame him up again and have him thrown back in jail br br as i said earlier don't try to follow the plot i've seen this movie about five times and there are many elements that seem to have no connections to anything else supporting characters wander in and out of the film i'm still attempting to figure out what was up with <UNK> <UNK> the mayor and the <UNK> <UNK> who cares ultimately the scenes with these characters are all priceless as for the dialog its horrible with even worse delivery since <UNK> ray moore was originally a comedian i begin to wonder if this film was meant to be a spoof or a serious action film it seems he couldn't decide which one lines such as yeah i'm so bad i kick my own ass twice a day call for further investigation either way the film is hilarious and the plot has more holes than a swiss cheese factory another hilarious element is some of the most <UNK> uses of sex and nudity ever in film actors that you would never want to see naked get naked including the mayor and queen <UNK> not to mention the fact that the boom <UNK> seems to show up in every other scene br br most of all moore shows incredible enthusiasm he seems to be having a generally good time and is certainly charismatic his comedy <UNK> proved to be a huge influence on latter day <UNK> rap including dr <UNK> who <UNK> him on his groundbreaking 1992 album the <UNK> as technically inept as the film is it is <UNK> influential even more important it is an all around good time the biggest crime an exploitation film can commit is being boring and this for all its flaws is quickly paced and entertaining in other words if you dig this kind of film you'll love <UNK> if you don't dig it you're a no business born insecure jock <UNK> f a 7 10
<START> hello all denver fans br br i couldn't agree more with you guys this show was so cool and cute i i watched it as a kid in the late 80s among denver are other favourite too such as care bears and <UNK> i am 24 now but it is still one of my favourite shows and my favourite cartoon from the 80s it brings back all the memories the theme tune was great too i get <UNK> whenever i hear it it is sad that it lasted such a short time but it has remained a firm favourite its great that i am not alone and that there are people out there who liked it too this is one of the cartoon shows i shall keep for future generations br br <UNK> denver

<START> a couple of days ago i saw the awesome house of sand and fog and i was impressed with the amazing performance of ben kingsley in the lead role i decided to see ray trying to understand how and why ben kingsley did not win the oscar of best lead actor after watching jamie foxx in the role of ray charles i agree with the academy he really deserved to be awarded i like ray charles i was not his fan but it is amazing the resemblance of jamie foxx with him the film is completely supported by jamie foxx who <UNK> of most of the shootings and his movements on stage looks like as if he was a reincarnation of ray charles with regard to the story i saw the extended version on dvd too long but also very pleasant with many beautiful songs and scenes showing mainly a <UNK> ray charles my greatest surprise was to find that ray charles was heroine addicted and how he treated his own family the presentation of his childhood through <UNK> flashbacks was the boring part of the movie my vote is nine br br title brazil ray
<START> the <UNK> hour was a movie i just <UNK> upon <UNK> in late at night this movie kept my fascination throughout the entire film tony <UNK> is this poor unsuspecting guy who just wanted to fall in love with a woman and by simple jealousy goes on this incredible journey terrific movie and a hidden treasure
<START> childish storyline ripped off of a lame hollywood movie terrible acting cheesy dialogue and not quite up to par sex scenes that's right another great <UNK> parody i enjoyed this film greatly sure the acting is terrible but that part of the fun the storyline is ludicrous but some things must be sacrificed when the story has to <UNK> around girl on girl sex scenes and because it's only <UNK> no <UNK> the sex scenes were a little bland but it's like the great god of <UNK> <UNK> russ meyers said who really cares what goes down beneath the <UNK> i don't know if i'd agree with mr meyers on this one but what the hell the flick entertained me for an hour and a half i give it a c it would've been a solid b if they <UNK> cast more of the girls to look like russ meyers actresses
<START> ok enough already this is a terrible piece of television the camera work is appalling do i have to remind you of the <UNK> <UNK> so loud you can hardly hear the actors speak lady <UNK> has the most annoying voice in the entire world anna massey is <UNK> in such an unbelievable fashion and the lack of chemistry between <UNK> and edmund is beyond beyond also the <UNK> girls aren't pretty enough and the guy playing henry crawford is awful to say the camera work is dodgy is an understatement i watched this adaptation over christmas and i think under any other circumstances i would not have been able to endure this and certainly would have not been able to justify the wasted time br br i am a fan of faithful to jane adaptations so i could not bear the film adaptation or the recent pride and prejudice movie but see any other adaptation instead even emma is better than this
<START> i was initially excited about this movie and fully expected it to be a combination of and <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately i was continually disappointed in the lack of depth and interest of the plot and subplots <UNK> through the movie i <UNK> into <UNK> fun at the characters and sets to avoid having to turn it off i did enjoy the premise of a future with <UNK> cultures and <UNK> of the and have <UNK> what could have been an <UNK> and intelligent look at the future is <UNK> into a plodding <UNK> scifi channel midnight flick with horrible acting cheap sets and a final gratuitous shot of tim robbins <UNK> maybe he should stick to his <UNK> political <UNK> it has all been downhill since <UNK>
<START> no spoiler needed to steer you clear of this well bizarre film canada becomes part of the usa ok so i guess i'm unusual but i expected something about the <UNK> of canada becoming part of the usa silly me continue with this movie and you are off to cloud land the opening premise has nothing to do with the rest of the film in which you will trust me not care a <UNK> for any of the characters <UNK> and <UNK> and due south have to be among the most imaginative series ever but in this case paul gross i'm so very sorry to say didn't have a clue about making a coherent film and wasted a lot of talented actors in the process a real disappointment
<START> absolutely the most thoughtful <UNK> deep intense hamlet ever done no other version comes close <UNK> has the best understanding of the role of all the actors that have played it patrick stewart's <UNK> is <UNK> and still sympathetic i particularly like the two <UNK> playing and <UNK> very <UNK> and yet sinister some might <UNK> about the need for a strong <UNK> she's not a strong person that's the point and ward hits the proper nuances amazing simply amazing every one of the more than two dozen times i've watched it
<START> the sequel is exactly what you will expect it to be and it is good enough that everyone who would have wanted to watch this should leave it happy br br this is not a movie that will win an academy award but it does take what made the jackass tv show and original movie a success and it turns it up a notch it is funnier more brutal and more disgusting than the original and i loved every minute of it br br the original had a few notorious stunts and there is at least one stunt that this movie will be remembered for you will <UNK> cringe look away and laugh very very hard br br in any event you probably do not need to read this review or any others to know if you will like this movie unless you have never heard of jackass
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen the story line is a joke the effects are terrible the cinematography doesn't fit the tone of the movie the dialogue is cheesy and the actors do a good job at <UNK> up the rest people just don't act that way in real life situations my question is who would <UNK> such crap br br the movie starts where some <UNK> fall down a mine <UNK> after a <UNK> fails to save them next we join some <UNK> in a forest who ride around doing stunts on their <UNK> one guy falls and breaks his leg or something the <UNK> arrives to help them meanwhile somebody starts a fire some more bike stunts <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br i wasted my time br br do not watch this movie
<START> a fantastic film featuring great aussie talent director mark dealt with the potentially <UNK> inducing subject matter in a way which was humorous and refreshing definitely the highlight of the 2000 <UNK> international film festival australian film veteran sam <UNK> was as always fabulous in the role of <UNK> <UNK> professor and new talent matt <UNK> gave a performance which will have people saying you know bert <UNK> <UNK> dad get out and see this movie
<START> this solid black and white slapstick comedy with a dark but hopelessly contrived plot is a true crowd <UNK> that will have you howling with laughter as well as rolling your eyes with disbelief br br it's the old psychopath on a train story but that is of no big importance as the thriller portion of the film almost seems to be merely a <UNK> to the antics of the great comedian robert his hapless nearly <UNK> optimistic soldier <UNK> both compassion and in a fashion that almost rivals chevy chase br br the thing about the film that <UNK> to me the most however is that <UNK> between the improbable and the hilarious are the accurately portrayed everyday <UNK> and of train travel they add a most welcome sense of realism and recognition br br this thriller comedy has admittedly borrowed most of its suspense from hitchcock and should in my opinion only be watched for its comedy value which is high indeed besides lars solid performance as a delightfully cynical <UNK> is worth the price of admission alone br br <UNK> recommend
<START> the main word that comes to mind when considering this film is dodgy this is a low quality film biography of one of the most iconic performers of all time the <UNK> one deserved better br br before getting into the meat of my thoughts on this biopic i have to say that there are two things i found effective first was the use of actual fan footage and interviews at certain points in the film especially in the scenes depicting the first set of child <UNK> <UNK> i feel that this contributed a certain authenticity that was severely lacking throughout the rest of the film second was the sequence depicting the <UNK> of michael jackson and lisa marie <UNK> i will not comment on whether i believe the marriage was a <UNK> but by many accounts it was a relationship where care and affection existed between the two parties involved that really came across in this film <UNK> anderson and <UNK> <UNK> had decent enough chemistry to pull it off these successful points are enough to keep man in the mirror away from 1 star status br br that said there was very little else here that worked very few of the actors looked like the people they were supposed to portray most those playing elizabeth taylor janet jackson and diana ross also the absence of jackson's music was a huge loss how can you effectively tell a story about him without his music i understand that they were unable to secure the rights to it with this being a low budget <UNK> production it seems though that if you can't have the man's music in a film about him you might as well pack it up and go home because you're missing out on an extremely important part of his life story br br this film's characterization of jackson bothered me a little too i won't argue that he was troubled and may have been a few <UNK> short of a value meal but here he was portrayed as something close to mentally disabled i don't believe that jackson known to have been a <UNK> businessman would have been quite as naive about how the adult world works as he was made out to be in this film br br finally the way this film was written was nothing short of <UNK> many lines or <UNK> of dialogue were either extremely corny like michael and <UNK> exchange or nonsensical like the <UNK> of love comments made by michael also the screenwriters don't exactly have a knack for subtlety there was a lot of <UNK> of upcoming events what could possibly go wrong sorts of lines and extremely overt <UNK> of themes and <UNK> in the film if i'd heard the word believe one more time this is what ultimately <UNK> the film as something that could be considered <UNK> bad br br perhaps when we are a few years or even a decade or three removed from jackson's death someone will be able to bring his story to life in a more deserving film by that time we might have a better perspective on his life and someone will be able to present a truly thoughtful examination of who michael jackson really was and what he's meant to the world of entertainment this very dodgy biopic was not that film
<START> first i'm sorry for my english second the true story of this episode <UNK> soldiers operation 6 soldiers were killed hundreds of <UNK> were killed too within 10 years the soviet army has lost less than 15 thousand person and killed over <UNK> and civilians there is no <UNK> without permanent help of usa the veteran of war traditions there are no traditions in this film there is no military <UNK> there is no first jump no farewell to the fighting <UNK> there is no delivery of awards and <UNK> there is nothing sacred there is only a hatred to soviet army being in this area on investigation we have revealed start up jet <UNK> by <UNK> an exact place could not define so <UNK> have asked to give easier square also have covered it through pair minutes here it was the reality of fights so there was no feeling oblivion these feelings have appeared then already on other war and in other state others were children more kindly more <UNK> and were as fathers well and <UNK> fight full orgy shooting in anywhere mental attacks young ben not killed both not broken through and full absence of mutual aid that there was a main thing on this war even americans accused us of <UNK> <UNK> of force against <UNK> and here it is direct on the contrary in the summer 1981 i about myself have firmly solved that personally should fill up a minimum 50 <UNK> as a result accepted plan has been under <UNK> and on a i <UNK> strongly and <UNK> as <UNK> after returning the first months there was a feeling of that i not was at war up to the end not business there have completed all how follow there was any vague but an oppressive sensation of <UNK> with itself and <UNK> <UNK> such here night ideas can be and out of place at all officers really in film are not present absolutely in occasion of that what is the time they spent with staff on fighting is constant new year on fighting from where did they take <UNK> in mountains and so on br br if you want a fairy tale about war 9 and is for you if you want truth you must see come and see or ask for fire
<START> after an astronaut dies in space he is brought back to a military base inside the man are discovered alien <UNK> he is the host for what could be a terrible alien invasion this film comes to us from director bernard l <UNK> who also directed attack of the giant <UNK> see separate review but may be better known for his work on columbo executive producer was roger corman known as the creator of much better films than this one particularly in the 1960s br br this movie is cheesy and poorly constructed what comes across as interesting is the poor effects not the actual film itself one scene shows a close up of the alien <UNK> and it's an embarrassing cartoon representation even for 1958 and then when a full grown alien appears you'll wonder why he is wearing shoes or if you're really <UNK> you'll wonder why you've seen the alien suit in other movies br br by no means is this the worst science fiction film you'll ever see and you almost have to give it some credit the alien host <UNK> a military base idea <UNK> both the thing and alien by a number of years i don't know if these films were inspired in any way i doubt it but at least it was ahead of its time beyond that though the film <UNK> and is only great for <UNK> when drinking i haven't seen the mystery science theater version but this sure is one film worthy of their insults
