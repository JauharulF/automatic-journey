<START> although films about edgar rice <UNK> famous hero tarzan have been seen by movie goers for almost a century now this is the definitive version of the story <UNK> is the actual story of the origins of tarzan as set down by edgar rice <UNK> way back in the second decade of the last century i've been assured by experts br br tarzan and sherlock holmes are probably the most filmed fictional heroes in history i've no basis in fact for saying that just a gut feeling the most popular holmes was basil <UNK> the most popular tarzan was johnny <UNK> and films that they made with both those characters will be criticized no end by <UNK> br br but <UNK> is the real deal a faithful adaption of <UNK> first story concerning the origin of his hero i can't think of another film which shows that tarzan learned french before english but that is shown here and it's only natural since it was a french survivor of a <UNK> <UNK> played by ian <UNK> who discovers tarzan who has been raised by the apes since his parents who were <UNK> on the african coast died there after his mother gave birth br br his parents were in fact the son and daughter in law of the earl of <UNK> and the surviving earl played by ralph richardson is of course <UNK> to learn he has a <UNK> of course there are others who don't welcome the new heir back in society br br one who doesn't is <UNK> mcdowell playing of course jane she does not communicate with tarzan in answer to his <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> tarzan speaks a <UNK> english french and understands the language of the apes as well as for the language of love tarzan and jane need no lessons br br <UNK> earned three oscar nominations for best makeup in regard to the apes best adapted screenplay and a <UNK> nomination for ralph richardson for best supporting actor it should also have rated a nomination for cinematography of the jungle scenes in and the scenes of the british <UNK> in several landmark places like <UNK> house and <UNK> palace br br for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the real deal
<START> it's got action and fantasy mixed all together what more do you want in an action movie and it also has one of the best martial artists in the movie industry today wesley snipes so all in all this movie hasn't left anything out and that's my comment of what i think is a classic beat em up movie
<START> the duke is a film based in the heart of the british <UNK> where an old duke john <UNK> dies and to avoid his large property and the vast <UNK> to be taken from him after death by 2 <UNK> <UNK> oliver and sophie <UNK> he passes his down to his dog the <UNK> best friend an american girl named charlotte played by <UNK> whose parents die becomes <UNK> by the former duke due to him being her great uncle a young chef named arrives with him and charlotte instantly connecting creating a romantic sub plot which in its own way acts as the under tone for the main plot line being the activities of <UNK> the and his many activities and love interests with other dogs all this is watched over by james who plays a butler who is determined to try and serve his old duke by doing his best to serve his new master <UNK> acts as the older character there to comfort and advise the younger ones whilst he over looks and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master a fine comedic performance mixed with elements of drama to end the career of a fine and influential actor br br though from the technical viewpoint i dislike this film as i only watched upon discovering james role though the plot is good elements of the writing and directing have to be <UNK> ignoring the absurdity of a <UNK> duke i personally dislike the over use of comedic and outrageous jokes upon the <UNK> characters due to their <UNK> the <UNK> on <UNK> related humour as you like is much too apparent and general silliness of many characters doesn't appeal to me the director phillip uses mid long shots too often with either an <UNK> voice or affecting the overall sound quality plus the acting of and <UNK> whilst good at the dramatic and romantic sequences fall drastically short fulfilling the <UNK> <UNK> regarding the role br br but as a mature movie fan i find it easy to be over critical of a simple family film designed to make you laugh i can admit i found certain bits funny and other bits touching along with a plot that may be far fetched but has definite connections i do not recommend this film to mature movie fans but i do highly recommend it to dog lovers families who wish to enjoy a funny film for their child and james fans who wish to see in his final role
<START> i am appalled to see that so many people have given positive reviews for this film this movie has no redeeming factors the music is not good the acting is pathetic i have a difficult time understanding how someone could enjoy this movie let alone sing its <UNK> the idea is horrible certain scenes linked to the plot such as the continued love story even though the male romantic interest is a <UNK> head are so bad that i wanted to do myself <UNK> harm while watching them the fact that there is scene in which a <UNK> head flies under a girls' shirt so he can feel her up and she likes it is reason enough for everyone associated with this film to <UNK> the link to west side story can only be a mockery since to reference such a great movie in such a horrible one is grounds alone to destroy all copies of this movie to make a long story short this film is horrible in every way and if i had my way everyone who likes it should go straight to hell
<START> much more than any other film from that period night of the demons represents the brainless and hugely enjoyable horror <UNK> it's <UNK> fun with loads of nasty make up effects gorgeous looking and horny teenagers and adorable cliché elements a group of party animals led by the alternative angela goes to celebrate halloween in an abandoned funeral home that carries an eerie urban legend it all starts out typical and innocent with dancing drinking and the occasional <UNK> between youngsters that can't keep their <UNK> under control but pretty soon a <UNK> demon possesses the <UNK> in the most ingenious ways you've ever seen the rest of the cast gets slaughtered <UNK> only to return as hideous creatures <UNK> for blood the thing that makes this film better than most cheesy 80's horror films is finds a good balance between light headed camp and atmospheric horror some sequences really are creepy and the funeral house setting supplies night of the demons with an excellent tone director <UNK> makes great use of the set pieces <UNK> a <UNK> endless dark and his young <UNK> cast obviously love what they're involved in the terrific make up effects by a whole team of artists and <UNK> are of course the obvious aspects to love and horror fanatics will absolutely love the large amount of severed limbs <UNK> out eyes and crushed <UNK> the ultimate highlight however is <UNK> <UNK> trick with the disappearing <UNK> this <UNK> bimbo <UNK> an entire tube of <UNK> in her <UNK> and continues her sexual murder spree terrific night of the demons received two sequels during the 90's and although they're still definitely worth checking out they focus more on comedy than chills
<START> this is one of the most predictable movies i have ever seen and this supposed to be funny boring boring boring find the fast forward button at your remote and use it i can t say i laughed once and the only good feeling this movie gave me was relief when it ended
<START> the devil's men represents what turned out to be one of the last <UNK> of the occult obsessed horror scene of the 70's shortly before halloween came along <UNK> up the rule book set fire to it and kicked it screaming through a plate glass window br br to cut a long story short a couple of <UNK> greek film makers fancy their chances of <UNK> together a new film franchise featuring the unlikely double act of <UNK> wise talking american investigator milo and <UNK> but kind hearted priest father an <UNK> <UNK> is mixed up in some satanic offering up tourists as sacrifices to an extremely <UNK> of the <UNK> and only milo and can stop him br br or something like that br br the reality is however horribly dull frustrating and loaded with wasted opportunities i strongly suspect that the <UNK> film makers blew most of the budget on getting donald peter cushing and brian for the soundtrack <UNK> and hoped that would be enough to <UNK> audiences in the english speaking world br br it isn't the devil's men looks beautiful with assured camera work and fantastic locations score though basically just a one <UNK> <UNK> that he probably <UNK> out in an afternoon is suitably atmospheric and the movie is laden with cracking 70's <UNK> including that <UNK> sort from <UNK> towers and uber <UNK> jane <UNK> of island of death <UNK> but there the <UNK> end cushing <UNK> through it looking like he has a corn <UNK> up his bum and <UNK> about trying his best but never quite getting things right to make matters worse the character of milo is <UNK> flimsy and unlikeable br br okay so it doesn't look that good but from there the film simply refuses to go anywhere there is an <UNK> that the local villagers are possessed but to be fair to them they never really do anything very much other than <UNK> about looking <UNK> eyed perhaps they were just tired just when you are sure things will come to some kind of a head milo and <UNK> the <UNK> satanic party with laughable ease sending him on to meet his maker the statue of the <UNK> falls silent and hey <UNK> satan is defeated br br yeah right br br the inane optimism that the devil's men might be the first of a series of films is <UNK> home by father final line mere seconds before the ridiculously rushed ending br br who knows milo perhaps one day i may call upon you again to help defeat the <UNK> br br i'm sure you'll be putting that call in any day now donald
<START> dear readers 2001 a space odyssey is kubrick at his best although i really can't say that as space odyssey is his only film i've ever watched but still it's a good film strange but good br br the movie is in three acts much like the novel which is <UNK> since the author wrote the screenplay anyhow we first start out with the simple yet spectacular opening with also <UNK> on the <UNK> then comes the boring beyond belief <UNK> of man' sequence then there's the odd <UNK> of the sequence on the moon played to blue <UNK> finally things get good with the spaceship scenes and hal going <UNK> and killing people after that things die down and we have the the sequence which was way too long and the ultra strange ending even though 2001 a space odyssey is a good film it's not star wars stargate terminator or the <UNK> but it rocks my <UNK> to the chef mr kubrick br br signed the constant dvd collector
<START> one of best movies ever fire it is not much about <UNK> description of india today it is the mind blowing use of light that never stops never becomes normal even when in this sense the movie is almost unique both leads are of very good quality the origin of <UNK> as a street performer are pretty obvious her performance is a superb but the use of the light i have look at it and looked at it again and again still mind blowing after ages nothing <UNK> in the story rather pure way of facing the subject in a way it is sad that in the bizarre world we live today a major art work is usually known as a gender film fire can stand face to face with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> arc or no or some of the major kurosawa movies just to name some wish my <UNK> could help a little this movie to its deserved way to fame
<START> you know i'm getting really tired of all the generic music being used in these type of movies see <UNK> disturbing behavior etc every scene of genuine tension here and there is some is immediately <UNK> with some cheesy pop tune completely <UNK> the suspense why do they do that to sell some <UNK> of course but in this case mission <UNK> did anyone buy the cd br br and yeah ms <UNK> attacks her role with <UNK> and <UNK> with some <UNK> <UNK> to add kick but what are molly leslie and <UNK> doing here their roles they're so underused that i cannot use characters here have no purpose in the storyline so i can't figure out why three well known actresses had been cast br br oh and the ending is so unbelievably hackneyed and irresponsible the kids get off <UNK> free and act as if nothing happened all smiles at <UNK> they're criminals people no consequences for their actions kidnapping assault grade <UNK> nothing br br little things too was tale about her husband true what's with the <UNK> would the <UNK> katie character loose her <UNK> on a <UNK> like that great message guys why did go to her home how did <UNK> academic nemesis walk through the door at that exact moment how do students even obtain <UNK> home <UNK> what's with jeffrey <UNK> on what basis did fire <UNK> she's <UNK> <UNK> and held hostage by students <UNK> sake br br oh well i'm spending way more thought on the script than mr <UNK> apparently did so i'll stop here br br 3 10
<START> this movie <UNK> self justice it <UNK> freedom to a black man who killed the men who raped his daughter and in the end he gets of <UNK> free despicable enough as this may be there is also adultery in this film the character has the <UNK> for the <UNK> character and the film has some of those stereotypes of trial films like the important news brought to the court in the nick of time that make every <UNK> demanding film goer such as me sick i really cannot believe that someone liked this junk it is a film so bad and holding up false ideals that i am unable to put my critic in an <UNK> pleasing way when will the american people wake up and find out that they are being manipulated 24 7 by films like these that turn reality into some <UNK> where there is justice for all if only they take it into their hands this cowboy attitude just makes me sick and in my eyes it represents everything that is wrong with america
<START> for those who expect documentaries to be objective creatures let me give you a little lesson in american film making br br documentaries rely heavily on casting you pick and choose characters you think will enhance the drama and entertainment value of your film br br after you have shot a ton of footage you <UNK> it together to make a film with ups and downs turning points <UNK> etc if you have trouble with existing footage you either shoot some more that makes sense find some stock footage or be clever with your narration br br the <UNK> that the filmmakers used footage of locales not part of the movie <UNK> next to beautiful <UNK> does not detract from the value of the film as a dramatic piece and the particular image is one that <UNK> enough to justify its not quite truthful inclusion at any rate you use the footage you can so they didn't happen to have police violence footage for that particular neighborhood does this mean not include it and just talk about it or maybe put in some cartoon animation so the audience isn't <UNK> um no br br as for the hopeful ending why not yes americans made it yes americans are optimistic <UNK> but why end on a down note just because it's set in a foreign country and foreign films by and large end on a down note let <UNK> portray the dismal <UNK> of life br br let us americans think there may be a happy ending <UNK> in the future there just may be one
<START> i had never even heard of one dark night until someone mentioned it on a horror message board here recently and reading into it i gained interest due to meg <UNK> involvement and <UNK> that it was an early gig for friday the 13th <UNK> jason lives director tom unfortunately sad to say it's nothing special the premise has a <UNK> to it a college girl must survive the night in an old <UNK> until morning in order to join a <UNK> that girl is a young meg <UNK> as julie who wishes to prove to her loving caring boyfriend steve david mason daniels that she can make his cruel conniving ex girlfriend <UNK> robin evans <UNK> regardless of the tactics she pulls in order to see her fail along with <UNK> gang is kitty leslie always with a <UNK> in her mouth and leslie elizabeth daily who doesn't really wish to cause julie such trouble while leslie insists on leaving julie alone as she remains in the <UNK> carol and kitty plan to torment the poor girl meanwhile steve <UNK> for her while julie carol and kitty encounter an evil they couldn't possibly imagine the corpse of a recently <UNK> psychic vampire whose <UNK> was of a dangerously powerful degree will seek to drain them of their very <UNK> the only one who can help these girls is the dead man's daughter olivia melissa newman who is <UNK> with the same psychic power he has br br i think what many will find exciting is the unusual evil that threatens the girls in the <UNK> it's certainly different than what you normally see in the slashers that were out at this time like adam <UNK> character he was the cynical husband of olivia who found the idea of her father's power ridiculous i had a really hard time <UNK> to the tacky plot and i personally never found anything within the film to get excited about the <UNK> to me never really was that spooky it doesn't really achieve the same kind of eerie quality phantasm captured and the corpses which are used to attack the girls are laughably unconvincing there is one great scene where a <UNK> face <UNK> away i have a soft spot for low budget films from this period of time but i just never really could find a reason to get involved when you have this unsatisfying undead corpse shooting electric <UNK> from it's eyes causing other bodies to break free from their <UNK> to <UNK> their master it's just too silly to take seriously carol is your typical blond bitch wishing to <UNK> a nice girl who is dating a former flame steve is your typical <UNK> clean all american boyfriend handsome and tender who becomes the hero seeking to save his girl from whatever sinister forces are at play to make up for the small budget director tries every trick in the book to thrill the audience using a series of <UNK> effects such as corpses which pursue young girls <UNK> which shake and <UNK> doors that slam shut and objects <UNK> by themselves the film obviously has it's fans and i am glad i had a chance to see it but i was a bit disappointed that one dark night wasn't the horror sleeper i hoped for adam west has a very small role as the concerned husband hoping his wife will snap out of her depressed state regarding a father who had nothing to do with her melissa newman is the troubled olivia <UNK> that she must stop her father once and for all or else he'd continue to prey on the living donald is an associate of <UNK> father's who informs her of what he was i wasn't particularly blown away by <UNK> performance here she was basically scared most of the time but she'd get a chance to prove herself to a greater degree from this point <UNK> this will undoubtedly be of some value to those who watched it back at that time for nostalgia purposes it might seduce fans of movies from this era
<START> i am in awe of the number of people who consider this film to be decent much less great do the majority of people even have basic standards for a film they watch i just don't know anymore br br this commercial cinematic product doesn't really deserve the respect of being called a film to call dean cain talented is a gross injustice to anyone who actually has talent i have had a lot of respect for <UNK> petty but most of that has gone right down the <UNK> at least her role was extremely small maybe she had a bill that desperately needed to get paid br br the ignorance i saw while viewing <UNK> was amazing let me start out by getting this off my chest if you can't show fire realistically then don't show it at all okay it's an embarrassment to all involved when you show lame effects that don't even come close to <UNK> an actual burning building br br some interesting <UNK> 1 a janitor opens the door to a large <UNK> closet and finds the entire room <UNK> in flames what does he do he tries to put out the fire with his <UNK> 2 the same janitor who knows the building is on fire later comes across a door marked <UNK> <UNK> his brilliant mind tells him that it would be a great idea to open said door big mistake 3 a woman is giving a fantastically generous <UNK> of 100 000 to a <UNK> rescue <UNK> but she's wearing a fur coat to the charity event they're holding wouldn't people who care about animals kinda <UNK> on that sort of thing 4 several of the people in the movie are forced into a vault of some sort with massive steel walls that even an <UNK> pulse couldn't <UNK> yet they have a <UNK> air <UNK> leading right into the back of the thing that anyone could crawl through that sure seems like a <UNK> in security br br i could go on and on but i have grown tiresome thinking about this lame movie our hero whom we are supposed to be cheering for is a career criminal who early on tries to kill some police officers what a <UNK> guy if the general public wants to waste their minds away on this drivel then more power to them i just wish i could have it <UNK> from my memory 1 10
<START> i'm lucky enough to have a good quality copy of my vhs on dvd so i can now watch this over and over again the characters are so well played i can't find fault with any aspect of the casting ok so there are a few differences from the book but the old cliché of love <UNK> all is so <UNK> portrayed that it makes no difference the reality of living in the rural countryside of early 19th century england is beautifully <UNK> by the changing seasons from biting winter to glorious summer days and this is <UNK> in the different characters from bullying father to all <UNK> love a story that changed my life
<START> do you like explosions how about fighting well this movie has both of those you know the other thing you can't have a movie without a kick ass motorcycle the type that <UNK> off someone's head and knocks them out at the same time you bet the has one there's even a classic cliff scene br br all in all i'm quite proud that i have even seen this movie and even <UNK> to have my review be the first one yes
<START> there is one of the best movies directed by that story told about young writer who is his place after a second war he's survive german camp excellent true atmosphere action goes in camp for <UNK> placed main hero played by one of the best polish actor daniel finally fall in love but unfortunately his lady has been killed there was beautiful scene when he is talking with american soldier and says about death his girl nothing is happen simply you're <UNK> to us now he's condition of soul has been destroyed 10 10
<START> this is an example of what film school would call a good debut movie it follows all the rules short scenes to the point cheap to shoot <UNK> film making no sets just <UNK> buildings and possibly an empty hospital wing also even the black white film stock was a stroke of genius probably selected more for its low expense rather than film effect but it worked br br reno was amazing as the <UNK> everyone's acting was brilliant the plot was simple and effective and no <UNK> bits left to distract you a tight well crafted cost effective budget movie br br released in 1983 this would've been made just before the art of big budget action <UNK> became <UNK> by the hollywood movie making engine and movie making was more <UNK> and therefore more difficult and more in need of the right people in the right places than today's internet <UNK> world so luc would've had to do quite a bit of <UNK> and promise keeping to achieve this result which makes the end product all the more remarkable br br but then again the french movie industry has always <UNK> an excellent reputation yes i know luc is <UNK> but the movie is a french production and has been the source of many hollywood remakes br br if i have one criticism it's that the cover picture on the dvd and possibly the original sales poster bears no resemblance to the movie whatsoever and appears to be a rather bizarre image rather than representative of any of the movie's themes at first glance it appears to be a man in post apocalyptic <UNK> on a swing but on second <UNK> reveals a man in <UNK> with a lance on an office chair with his legs on a desk in a self confident <UNK> this never happens in the movie once br br it's black and white film stock zero dialogue physical acting tight scenes and brilliant actors makes this movie one worth adding to your private movie collection a superb movie

<START> this is a student film and it's a piece of crap i would use much stronger language to describe it but then the review wouldn't be posted and the world needs to know beyond any possible reasonable doubt this movie really sucks br br there seems to be a different <UNK> used when <UNK> an already famous director's early work like somehow it was genius that we were just too stupid to comprehend since he finally got it right now today i'm not buying it the early movie bad taste made by the lotr peter jackson's sucks and this early work from another famous director really sucks the same way too these early works are representative of crappy everything from budget to scripts to actors etc it all is bottom of the bucket trash don't be fooled by the big name br br if you like watching a handful of male 70's hippie pretend they could ever command a ship with the worst special effects you have ever seen this is your movie br br i can't f believe this thing won a golden <UNK> award for best special effects that is a joke right or a joke award br br if you want to watch what this movie wishes it was rent a season or three of red dwarf you
<START> goodbye mr <UNK> is a superbly written and photographed musical version of the classic 1939 film aside from peter <UNK> wonderfully controlled understated performance as the <UNK> <UNK> who finds love and is changed by it the film contains hundreds of stunning visuals from ruins to london side streets to an extended countryside montage the music and lyrics by leslie have been criticized as being dull or not up to par for film musicals but they are used to enhance the story rather than tell it many songs are used to <UNK> montages or scenes the few that don't are <UNK> to show <UNK> numbers in this manner the songs do not <UNK> upon this delicate story but <UNK> what the characters are thinking or feeling where did my childhood go walk through the world with me and you and i are especially effective an absorbing brilliantly acted directed and written film
<START> death in <UNK> is a movie i need to see once every ten years it is always different because i am always at a different stage of life br br the movie is about art beauty longing death some scenes are painfully slow others simply annoying to watch especially if you have seem them before yet i would not want to miss a single frame the music is repetitive the main theme of the from fifth is used again and again yet i would not want to miss a single note when the last image fades the last note dies i am left <UNK> and exhausted br br this movie is a <UNK> to film making as with most really good movies the saturday evening crowd should stay away from it and this is simply the best movie ever
<START> is <UNK> an original film heck no but it is a lot of fun i just caught this buried on the movie channels one night and it was an enjoyable flick i was expecting much but what i got was some interesting scenes i really liked the first seen at the <UNK> store some amusing stories as told by the characters and a little bit of action thrown in the mix as well some good performances from young actors was good and i was particularly impressed with aaron who has gone on to impress me further in friends and and so if you want 90 minutes of easy going fun go ahead and check out
<START> i know it was supposed to be a long walk but really br br the costumes were a bit <UNK> but still it was the 1970's i suppose br br it was a bit long and dull so give me the newer version any day
<START> one of alfred hitchcock's three greatest films along with psycho and the <UNK> steps strangers on a train is as brilliantly out of control as a merry go round in <UNK> and almost as deadly it's the kind of film you have so much fun watching you can't even feel properly guilty about it until you have time to catch your breath br br top amateur <UNK> <UNK> guy haines <UNK> granger meets a <UNK> weird <UNK> stranger named bruno anthony robert walker on a train thanks to the <UNK> pages bruno knows all about guy's problems with his no good wife <UNK> and rather <UNK> suggests they do each other a favor bruno will kill <UNK> and guy will kill <UNK> father who wants to put bruno in an institution guy laughs it off but bruno ain't kidding as guy finds out to his peril br br it's a great premise for a murder story and hitchcock gives strangers on a train a run for all its worth with the help of walker in perhaps the greatest performance in any hitchcock film including anthony <UNK> in psycho while <UNK> makes his mark playing against the grain walker as anthony is one perfectly at home either up old ladies at a <UNK> dinner party or <UNK> a young woman at an amusement park br br what drives bruno many <UNK> suggest his apparent homosexuality finds a match in pretty guy yes bruno lights up the old gay <UNK> but guy seems happy enough on <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> anne <UNK> ruth roman <UNK> interest for guy could just as easily be envy for someone making a mark in the world while he lives at home letting <UNK> file his nails br br oh i certainly admire people who do things bruno <UNK> looking like a cat <UNK> a mouse you know it must be pretty exciting to be so important br br later on bruno calls himself a bum accurate enough except for our rooting interest in him even as he <UNK> guy's life with his homicidal <UNK> it's the ultimate perverse tale there's a sense of integrity about bruno in his <UNK> dedication which <UNK> our respect and which hitchcock plays to so brilliantly when bruno <UNK> away from the scene of his big crime am i the only sick person in this world who's actually happy for him i think not yet hitchcock keeps the story on a right enough path for us to realize how low we have fallen we don't want bruno to win exactly but we enjoy his <UNK> as he tries br br everything else is so perfect or at least close enough to make every shot memorable hitchcock always managed at least 2 3 good <UNK> sequences per movie here you get a score of them at the amusement park alone 20 big shows the <UNK> side at the entrance says and they aren't kidding script camera work a gripping <UNK> match ruth <UNK> jaw dropping figure it's all too much greatness for one film to contain even granger does his <UNK> youth thing here with more <UNK> <UNK> than gregory peck ever managed br br you can call this a clinic in movie making but clinic sounds too dull strangers on a train is good nasty fun all the way through leaving you with a nifty <UNK> at the tail as you realize you were rooting for the wrong stranger all along heck i'll take that ride over again in a second
<START> i saw <UNK> the new show and loved it from the very first moment it is an energetic tribute to irish dance filled with brilliant dancing music and choreography the leads jean butler and colin dunne had me captivated with their exquisite dancing may they always keep shining and keep dancing their on stage chemistry was amazing and the <UNK> between them on stage was obvious they look like they were made to dance with each other this show is my absolute favourite and probably always will be long live <UNK>
<START> this is by far one of the most pretentious films i have ever seen it is a tight slap on the face of some indians who speak in english and were looking at the mirror disgusting the bubble <UNK> version of the 1970s politics of the north indian <UNK> the message the educated english speaking indian tried to save the poor <UNK> of india in all <UNK> it ignores the fact that the poor <UNK> are also capable of and are saving themselves on their own br br as a love story its okay the problem is that the love story and character development is based upon a completely <UNK> version of politics

<START> although i'm not crazy about musicals cover girl is a delight for classic movie buffs and especially for fans of rita hayworth and gene kelly the film may be dated by today's standards and the story and songs may be nothing special but the musical numbers are <UNK> staged and there's a terrific cast to go with the film plus the film is a worthy introduction for fans of rita hayworth she's simply breathtaking in glorious technicolor br br despite <UNK> collaboration with the film his music here is nowhere near as special or memorable as his songs in swing time 1936 yet the songs serve the film well the dancing is nothing short of excellent especially coming from gene kelly's solo number and my favorite musical number alter ego dance the amusing phil <UNK> nearly steals the film as kelly's partner otto <UNK> eve <UNK> and edward <UNK> give good performances in their dramatic supporting roles and rita plays a sweet charming girl here a role that's a far cry from her femme fatale babes in films like blood and sand 1941 br br all in all this is a delightful film that's worth watching even if you're not big on musicals yet the film's music could have been more memorable if only my favorite period <UNK> irving berlin or cole porter wrote the songs for this film however it's the glorious technicolor cinematography and the imaginative dancing that are the real treats of the film's production br br while i was watching rita hayworth do her stuff i don't think i've ever seen a more beautiful or <UNK> <UNK> dance on the screen since i saw <UNK> <UNK> in michael <UNK> masterpiece the red shoes 1948 just watch rita in cover girl and fall in love with her
<START> at first it seems the <UNK> romance movie where a girl meets a boy and fall in love but the point is that this movie has a feeling others don't have the first time i saw it i couldn't see it complete because i had to leave but while i was walking along i thought i must see it again but i didn't have any opportunity by then one year went by until i saw this movie in a not free channel and i saw it and i recorded it too i saw it once twice until 200 times and not kidding i did know all the dialogues by hart and i don't know why but i saw it everyday and never got bored and i have to say that i'm not used to see a movie more than twice the act is very good gerard depardieu is a talented actor and <UNK> <UNK> too i would like her to be in a good movie because i think she can do it on balance it's a movie i can't take out of my mind
<START> is where i'm assuming this movie came from i mean i've watched plenty of b movies over the course of my young life so far and i wouldn't even <UNK> this as a b movie i remember seeing films in my high school mass media class that <UNK> this one br br so the premise is a bunch of dancing numbers and goofy crap happens women in <UNK> who aren't even that great looking to begin with dance in the beginning and sing guys with hairy <UNK> show up and girls with <UNK> who are out in the <UNK> i mean i can barely put together a cohesive sentence just thinking about this movie according to most people on this site <UNK> the hands of fate and <UNK> people are the worst movies mst3k classics d i used to be one of them then i saw this movie usually i don't try to trash a movie too much but the people who made this really do deserve it it is that bad and that unbearable and i'm assuming the director or an actor in the movie is the only person who rated this a ten
<START> eh this is a popcorn movie nothing more i watched this with a bunch of friends and though that might not be the best way to view a horror movie and most of the dialogue and action was laughable br br it left me yearning for a real film br br the main problem is the lack of tension in the film it keeps flashing back to scenes which <UNK> any discernible tension br br and the character relationship <UNK> yeah they suck i won't say what they are but they just don't add anything to the film storyline br br by relationship i mean the two main characters br br <UNK> my recommendation is this watch this movie if you can't think of anything better mediocre at best maybe not even that
<START> i got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say french culture i thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played <UNK> brother also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well br br favorite part when william is making fun of the german guy studying and when he acts out how flies <UNK> br br my french isn't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on br br watch it
<START> what a silly movie while it looks nice it doesn't make a lot of sense on the one hand the film suggests that madness was that she was just a woman ahead of her time on the other hand she has an obsession that is right out of the worst victorian novel of the <UNK> woman and that does seem a sort of mental problem like miss in a castle this movie is what elizabeth would have been if elizabeth had not been able to get past <UNK> sexual attraction
<START> i saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it what a movie i am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and i would like them to see this movie i would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older <UNK> john music br br i have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any br br i bought some old movies like melody in hong kong who had quite a collection of old movie but they did not have this br br i am also looking at the sequel paul michelle br br can anyone please tell me how to get a copy of the vhs or dvd or <UNK> br br really appreciate it br br many thanks
<START> <UNK> machine is easily one of burt reynolds best efforts it also stands as one of the best contemporary crime dramas erotic and violent the movie <UNK> itself by setting the story in <UNK> and delivering a chaotic detective case to you the viewer on a silver <UNK> dedicated and determined <UNK> must stop the murder of a lovely lady of the night who's is anything but ordinary before long <UNK> <UNK> machine <UNK> a conspiracy of the highest order which threatens to corrupt the inner body of <UNK> as a resident of <UNK> <UNK> i recall the excitement in town during the movie's production <UNK> machine goes to great <UNK> to give an accurate portrayal of <UNK> twenty years removed and 2 000 000 more people later the film stands the test of time trust me <UNK> has not changed one of the highlights of the picture is <UNK> <UNK> daring stunt a classic symbolic ending it was even featured on that's incredible <UNK> reality show of the period it's just too bad that hollywood does not make enough films like this one kick back each your popcorn and watch sterling silver cinema action
<START> it was evident until the final credits that this film was made in 1989 as all the elements of its production were made to look 1960's the acting the <UNK> the sets and the props all had an aesthetic from an earlier time br br the film opens to the moments prior to the dropping of the a bomb on <UNK> and how this tragic incident affects one family a young woman who lives with her aunt and uncle even in black and white and using special effects that are quite primitive by modern standards but <UNK> and effective nonetheless the depictions of the immediate aftermath of the bomb are quite horrific family members become <UNK> to each other others resemble zombies as they wander the streets <UNK> and in shock br br the title refers to <UNK> that fell soon after the bomb which was mixed with <UNK> ash and in which is caught rumors of being in <UNK> at the time of the bombing affect her marriage <UNK> and it is later <UNK> that the black rain is indeed causing the film is concerned not just with the physical effects of the bomb on the japanese but on the social and psychological damage that was <UNK> br br i found the film compassionate and a fascinating journey into a unique culture while the film is primarily concerned with the pain felt by one family the film's gentle political message is relevant today and probably for all time wars have horrific consequences and should not be entered into unless absolutely necessary it is said that history repeats itself and the current leaders of the of the have learned nothing while atomic <UNK> has not <UNK> since 1945 other deadly after effects have this film is compelling viewing
<START> spoilers simple movie about simple people who's problems are far too complex for them to handle br br natalie aka sara <UNK> shirley knight has become overwhelmed with married life and the fact that she's now pregnant is the straw that breaks the <UNK> back taking off from her homes in long island new york natalie has no idea where she's going but hopes to find peace and <UNK> somewhere in the <UNK> of america it's on the <UNK> that natalie picks up <UNK> <UNK> killer james <UNK> who seems as lost and confused as she is as natalie calling herself sara at the time soon finds out <UNK> had suffered a serious brain <UNK> while playing football on his <UNK> team and has been reduced to such a simple minded individual who's so passive that he lets everyone including later in the movie natalie step all over him br br sympathetic at first natalie becomes very annoyed at the self <UNK> <UNK> for not standing up for himself and letting himself be used as a <UNK> by everyone he comes in contact with in the movie not knowing what to do with the child like <UNK> natalie finally gets him a job in far off <UNK> as a cleaning man at the <UNK> jungle pet market owned and run by mr alfred tom being the both kind and simple minded person that he is <UNK> lets all the animals out of their <UNK> causing havoc at the pet store and has him fired by his boss mr alfred br br in the meantime natalie who thought that she was finally through with <UNK> ends up back at the <UNK> jungle when she's given a <UNK> ticket by traffic cop gordon robert duvall it seems that mr alfred is also the acting county judge and is the person that natalie is to pay her traffic fine to while all this is happening gordon the cop had developed a strong liking for natalie and wants to get her in the sack at his trailer home the first chance he can gordon a widower with a <UNK> 12 year old daughter <UNK> needs a mature woman with lots of <UNK> to make him forget his many social and psychological problems and natalie is exactly the medicine that the doctor ordered br br spoilers wild and shocking final with gordon going completely out of his mind and attempting to rape natalie who refused his drunken advances which has <UNK> finally get out of his self <UNK> <UNK> and came to her rescue there's no happy ending here with natalie saved from being both <UNK> and raped by gordon but <UNK> who was <UNK> gordon around like a <UNK> <UNK> ball ending up dead for all his good and noble efforts br br jimmy by far was he most tragic and sympathetic person in the entire movie all <UNK> wanted was a friend to talk to and spend time with and all he ended up getting was the sh t end of the stick by everyone even the one person who at first treated him with kindness and understanding natalie <UNK> in the end <UNK> even though he was treated like dirt by everyone despite his <UNK> not to offend even those who stepped all over him came out as the most likable <UNK> as at the same time heroic person in the entire film
<START> saw this for the first time on uk tv with good musical <UNK> the elevator scene is class especially when he does the going down thing in the phone booth and then <UNK> with the floor <UNK> the jump through the is really impressive and there's so much more apart from all the stuff that's been mentioned before there's the fight with the man who's been bullying the woman with the dog it just looks so simple the only <UNK> is the plot he gets mixed up with dead eye dan who then escapes but doesn't <UNK> even when some more gangsters get involved later on the scene where it looks like he's shooting at the fat inspector is funny but would have been better if dead eye was the one pulling the trigger
<START> the directing is brilliant the casting is remarkable though i would've loved to have seen a little more of aaron <UNK> from y r fame who played paul <UNK> i only have two minor <UNK> about the film as subtle as they are one leno is excellent but his stage presence i e during what appears the <UNK> of one of his late show episodes is a tad <UNK> two the distribution of the foul language i am willing to tolerate foul language so long as it is not used <UNK> and to a degree the film was gratuitous the language seemed to be used as a tool to <UNK> the pathos of <UNK> otherwise well portrayed by her frequent use of it and served to make leno a <UNK> <UNK> by his lack of use of it of course if the characters really did behave this way kudos to everybody nonetheless the piece is an excellent one as far as television and video are concerned the film i feel had potential for the big screen but would've required re casting for the bit parts and probably a different director as well the aesthetic feel is that of the larry sanders show good for hbo mediocre for cinematic purposes
<START> i thought this was an extremely bad movie the whole time i was watching this movie i couldn't help but think over and over how bad it is and how that was 3 <UNK> down the drain the plot was so <UNK> they did an excellent job at the beginning of explaining who dated who in high school but they never really explained anything after that was it a supernatural thriller was it a regular thriller apparently you can decide for yourself because they didn't see the need to explain i understood basically what happened i think what i got confused about was all of it prior what was the deal with the bloody <UNK> phone calls etc was this guy coming back was the wife <UNK> carrie or something who knows you certainly won't after watching this movie
<START> firstly few <UNK> allow students to take <UNK> from their <UNK> lover secondly few women <UNK> are sleeping with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> few <UNK> <UNK> have a dad who <UNK> in their <UNK> <UNK> once a second member of a college small group project team meets a violent demise the college president will <UNK> the whole class and not turn a blind eye as the professor <UNK> <UNK> the rest of the group toward grisly deaths since the supernatural elements of cult make absolutely no sense it is useful to study the mundane content of this film to truly appreciate how much this flick really sucks
<START> committed stars heather graham along with <UNK> affleck and luke wilson its the story of who is determined to find her ex husband who is in the process of a mid life crisis br br committed was not at all what i expected it was lacking in comedy which was ultimately the genre it was beyond stupid and un realistic <UNK> affleck delivered a reasonable performance <UNK> recent roles have been lack <UNK> and this is not an improvement br br <UNK> most recent role was blessed which i also found misleading and didn't appeal to me at all br br pros affleck br br cons predictable unrealistic poor acting and not a comedy movie
<START> there is a running thread in film comedy that all the great comics are just falling short of the law or on going to jail think of that <UNK> w c fields in the old fashioned way or the marx brothers in a night at the opera or chaplin in the <UNK> of mae west in she done him wrong the of the law is inevitable and when they end up on the side of the law the results are actually still hostile between the forces of law and order and the comic think of lloyd in his first <UNK> welcome danger trying to assist the san francisco police department in the midst of a crime wave and making police sergeant edgar kennedy want to kill him think of laurel and hardy as ill <UNK> cops in midnight <UNK> i find this type of <UNK> is so <UNK> in all these <UNK> and their <UNK> comedy that even a fake title for a film deals with it think of jerry seinfeld in one episode of his series creating a three stooges short sappy where the boys end up being <UNK> for murder br br buster keaton frequently pulls in the forces of law and order to be his opponents in his comedies look at <UNK> bill jr where he tries to spring his dad from a but he actually had more conflict from police forces in his shorts in convict 13 he is dragged back to prison when mistaken for an escaped convict in cops perfect title if you see it you'd understand the police force of a large city is repeatedly looking for keaton mistaken for a terrorist and in the goat he is unable to avoid the police for most of the film br br keaton is a tramp just looking for food but he is totally unlucky when he sees a stranger throw a lucky <UNK> which keaton earlier ignored over his shoulder and then find a <UNK> full of money keaton tries the same thing and hits a cop in the head the cop gives chase and keaton as luck would have it runs into another cop tries to act normal but ends by throwing the other cop into the path of the first soon he has three cops chasing him briefly shaking them he walks by a window at the local jail where local murderer dead shot dan malcolm st <UNK> is being photographed passing in back of the <UNK> windows keaton is stupid enough to stop and look straight in the <UNK> notes this and <UNK> as the picture is taken when dead shot <UNK> the police it is keaton's face on all the wanted posters br br st <UNK> would eventually be a successful director of silent and early sound comedies although in his later biography would be a <UNK> at 20th century fox where his work with laurel hardy was below par br br keaton <UNK> to another town by train the passenger cars containing his <UNK> from the <UNK> and tender this is the film by the way that has two famous keaton jokes his arrival on the <UNK> is done in a distant shot with it coming closer and closer and suddenly the audience sees keaton sitting on the br br the second famous sequence goes later and may have influenced chaplin somewhat in the beginning of city lights keaton had accidentally knocked out a man who was arguing too violently with a pretty woman with a dog virginia fox when he sees the <UNK> calling him a murderer he thinks he killed the man he is being chased in this town by a suspicious chief of police joe roberts and <UNK> loses roberts in the park a statue of man of war is being constructed and the <UNK> is <UNK> a clay model of the horse keaton is seen <UNK> on the clay model trying to maintain his dignity as the clay legs of the horse start <UNK> under his weight br br keaton manages to meet the pretty ms fox who invites him home for dinner only he doesn't realize her father is roberts the last five minutes of the film deal keaton fleeing and avoiding roberts while he and fox get away together br br it's a funny comedy and a wonderful example of keaton's work at his best
<START> go fish garnered rose rightly or wrongly the reputation of a film maker with much promise br br its then hard to understand how she could turn out a movie made up of stereotypes that one associates with inferior sitcoms the entire film rings hollow i <UNK> the whole way through br br its supposed to be a look into nineties human sexuality well not much more here to be learned than from in and out by now most of us actually do know that there are men who are sexually attracted to women and there men who are sexually attracted to men and there are even men sexually attracted to both <UNK> br br seldom has this revelation been portrayed on the screen with so little wit and style br br pathetic
<START> what is the story what is it on the screen at first i must say do not touch this movie it is for your own best it sucks and really what is the story in the beginning it seems okay but after ten minutes it all gets worse and that is not all you can hardly see what it is on the screen it is too dark all the time br br do not touch
<START> i saw this when it came out in theaters back in 1996 i remember i was already familiar with <UNK> <UNK> work that's right he made stuff before lord of the rings and the <UNK> tie ins to the film were pretty <UNK> <UNK> water guns were even <UNK> br br adults were reminded of the old movies and tv show and for <UNK> sake took their kids to see it who were excited because it was a movie about a <UNK> and a stupid boy br br unfortunately it wasn't what anyone expected and <UNK> severely you know a movie's in trouble when a boy <UNK> away from a hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean and a pack of <UNK> scare the shark away and the kid instead of getting out of the water into a boat <UNK> in the water for five minutes <UNK> his <UNK> for saving him apparently he hasn't taken into mind that the shark is still out there perhaps even below him br br another problem is paul hogan he looks old <UNK> and tired of <UNK> his croc <UNK> <UNK> by now no one even remembered crocodile <UNK> much less hogan and i half expected him to suddenly start pretending he didn't know what a hair <UNK> was for the sake of fish out of water social satire laughs br br all in all this is a really poor family movie that is amateurish and almost hard to watch at times i hated it when i saw it in theaters back in <UNK> and i hate it more now
<START> i can only say this from <UNK> i couldn't say it better the worst movie i've ever seen and i've seen lots of crap when i read you comment i thought only about the thoughts i had while watching the movie when i saw who was one of the script writers i understood it uses the same tricks in all his movies and his scripts are not much better either and of course in <UNK> we have tons of <UNK> and <UNK> around the city so we can keep cursed nuns to scare young americans coming on <UNK> please be serious and i do not want to talk about the quality of the actors there is something remarkable too it is fair to recognize it compared to the usual level all the spanish actors use a fairly good english
<START> what a great movie this was is it heaven hell or something in between i disagree with many reviews of this movie saying that this is a depiction of hell it is not even clear if the opening scene starts the movie or is a flashback from the end further it is not clear that the main character goes to hell but perhaps <UNK> in between the review i read on imdb says this is hell but i disagree whole <UNK> take into consideration that perhaps good people who commit suicide may not be condemned to hell this only one religious belief this is indeed a <UNK> and i have would recommend it to anyone who likes that type of movie definitely worth it
<START> a very moving and thought provoking film that raises issues of mental health <UNK> illness and <UNK> sound a bit too heavy it is a little but this is all treated in a realistically straight forward way within a story of the changes that take place to the family who have to deal with these things this is a positive story of facing up to life and responsibility that isn't <UNK> by the subject matter br br <UNK> is beautifully shot and crafted film set in modern times and dealing with modern issues it is a character driven enthralling film with a strong cast and some very good performances br br unfortunate it is not the sort of film that always performs well at the box office so catch it while you can
<START> ladies and gentlemen the show begins with this documentary film it's structured in three chapters each one <UNK> arranged the first presents the classical physics and <UNK> to einstein the second studies in depth the quantum physics and enters in string theory the last reveals the everything theory the difficult concepts used here are introduced in a very simple way with daily objects although you must believe them without checking by yourself if you are not a scientist and even if you are a scientist the film is not a masterpiece by its fabulous technique or the way it's produced what really <UNK> is the story and what a story
<START> the whole set up of this contrived disney family film ad <UNK> gets his teenage daughter a horse because she wants one more than anything else in the world is just an excuse to film the big climactic horse show at the end all the other ingredients the ad campaign for the stomach <UNK> kurt russell as a potential boyfriend for the <UNK> lloyd <UNK> as a potential rival for dean jones over the affections of diane baker are <UNK> near the end simply to showcase the horse over half the picture is padding and worse it is whiny and obnoxious the kid is the sort who cries on the couch with a dog in her arms and as usual she gets her way from
<START> alice a new york doctor gets her license suspended when she treats one of her patients with an drug resulting in the <UNK> death without a job alice is forced to go to where she tends to the brother of a wealthy white <UNK> the brother thinks he's a zombie and is deeply involved in the local people's voodoo practices and <UNK> ritual is a mediocre horror flick the action is pretty dull the plot twists are silly and there is no suspense there is a bit of gore as someone is killing off white people with a <UNK> but not too much the cinematography is decent however the acting is truly <UNK> definitely one to avoid 4 out of 10
<START> don t be fooled into thinking that this is a remake as in this years remake of the time machine is based on an earlier film it s not because this is a pointless re film that is the director has used the original camera script shot for shot similar to the remake of the get away from a few years ago the scenes are identical to the original the dialogue is identical to the original the camera angles are identical no attempt whatsoever is made to <UNK> or <UNK> the original script but with a director like van <UNK> at the <UNK> we should be thankful he sure t no hitchcock in fact i might even be correct in saying the costumes might be the same because the private eye wears a <UNK> pie hat <UNK> t they go out of fashion in the late 1960s br br bottom line avoid
<START> i just love this film it totally rocks nicolas cage looks hot and tommy does not i definitely feel that fred and randy should have had a little more time together on screen cause they're totally cool my favorite part is when he says peter <UNK> picked a pepper i guess i did
<START> 2 <UNK> succeeds admirably at showing us what australian teenagers feel and don't say these are the stories of real kids and i think we would be naive to think otherwise the only new thing 2 <UNK> really brings us is an australian point of view we often watch troubled american children but often fail to link the same problems to our own teens executed with clever and <UNK> cinematography i did however upon immediate recognition of the disappointing final song find the musical direction lacking in sophistication i applaud the fabulous casting of this film these are regular looking aussie kids who invite plenty of sympathy because of this great performances all round and you can't top gary sweet this film made me remember why sometimes high school sucked and unless you're <UNK> or you like to leave with warm and <UNK> go and see 2 <UNK>
<START> i saw five fingers at the drive in in what 1973 it was the the first kung fu movie i'd ever seen and i was greatly entertained i recently bought it on dvd and watched it again i was greatly entertained the second time too i believe this is probably the one most kung fu movies are <UNK> after rival schools different styles revenge white hat good guys and black hat bad guys they even threw in the japanese very bad guys styles of karate and <UNK> i remember being amused by the dubbing dialog along the lines of hey you you are a very bad guy and they should not get away with this i will have a go at this bad crowd this time it wasn't so distracting i guess i'm used to it if you have even the slightest appreciation of this genre this is one you should see
<START> way back in 1996 one of the <UNK> pilots where i used to work gave me a copy of this film he told me that it'll make me cry i never believed him and we even made <UNK> after seeing the film i cried a bucket even after the seeing the film i found myself in the bathroom crying it was actually the most touching film i have ever seen i like the part where <UNK> mom confronted <UNK> mother the line went something like your <UNK> best friend just died today and it's not gonna be easy if you ever lay your hands on him again i will kill you the last part where <UNK> took <UNK> shoe was a scene that never left my mind until today honestly just thinking about it makes my eyes <UNK> a story of what true friendship is all about my girlfriend loved it too she hated me for letting her see the film i cried a bucket she cried a river
<START> i'm sure that the folks who made this movie think they're doing something wonderfully politically correct because they manage to criticize u s wars in afghanistan and particularly iraq by suggesting that the u s does war well but doesn't clean up afterward thus the <UNK> for future trouble furthermore they do this without making the enemy and without making <UNK> the enemy since it's the <UNK> that are in office and are doing this supposedly great thing bringing down the <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> a war in afghanistan br br but seriously now do we really want a movie that repeatedly says let's go kill some russians like that's the greatest thing a red blooded american can do and are we supposed to find this <UNK> adorable because he <UNK> himself with women with big hair and revealing clothes even his supposedly smart assistant who is always dressed <UNK> keeps looking at charlie like he's just the most wonderful <UNK> greatest guy around as if she's nancy reagan to his <UNK> julia roberts does a bang up job in her role but basically women are really <UNK> in this movie and it was really annoying
<START> i first encountered arthur <UNK> four friends late one night on hbo having never heard of it i expected very little but watched because i was interested in seeing what a creation by a <UNK> of penn and screenwriter steve would be like for the next two hours or so i sat <UNK> watching this incredible <UNK> of talent and the story they <UNK> a semi <UNK> tale of a young immigrant to america growing up amidst the <UNK> of the 1960s four friends follows the story of an eastern european immigrant the brilliant craig <UNK> from his arrival in the united states through a decade that changed the american landscape accompanying on his journey are his friends georgia the <UNK> <UNK> in a role that sadly she has never had the opportunity to equal tom jim <UNK> and david michael four friends covers way too much territory for me to attempt to explain it here but if you haven't seen this film i urge you to find a copy it's just been released on dvd and watch it you won't be disappointed script is wonderfully poignant  at times funny at times incredibly sad but always fascinating and honest penn directs with a sure hand and an obvious love for the period and the people whose lives we're following the cast is uniformly superb this film should have made a major star out of <UNK> who is truly one of this country's most wasted talents <UNK> not your standard brainless hollywood <UNK> <UNK> up the screen in a performance that makes the audience fall in love with her character as easily as the characters in the film <UNK> and subtle performances could easily be overlooked in the shadow of their co stars but they are excellent and help anchor the film also superb are <UNK> simon and elizabeth lawrence as parents as well as reed <UNK> and lois smith i have not been without a copy of four friends since the day after i first saw it on hbo those many years ago it has been and remains one of my all time favorite films for more than 20 years now i can't recommend it enough and feel if you give it a chance you'll feel the same way
<START> a dangerous <UNK> killer <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> up in the abandoned and rotting <UNK> hotel alone with his nightmares until eight teenage <UNK> show up for community service duty along with the cop who wounded <UNK> four years ago when one of their own is kidnapped by the killer and her fate uncertain the remaining petty criminals must fight for their lives see no evil was directed by the porno filmmaker gregory dark and it stars wwe superstar kane as <UNK> psychopath the supporting cast is terrible and there are no surprises to be found here but there is enough extreme violence and gore for slasher fans to enjoy overall i liked this film and you should too if you are into mindless slasher flicks sure it's cliché but who cares 7 out of 10
<START> one of my favorite villains the evil princess is just the perfect villain for this movie full of space travel horses <UNK> mystical characters colorful backgrounds evil characters etc etc very bright full of action you will not get bored great movie
<START> when i saw <UNK> <UNK> jr and boris karloff in the cast i was expecting to find a typically <UNK> 1950's style horror movie the opening scene a graveyard with a wolf howling in the background seemed to confirm this once i began watching it though what i discovered was a nifty little mystery about an <UNK> richard green seeking to discover what had happened to two of his friends who had disappeared in the black forest and if necessary to take revenge against the evil count stephen <UNK> who ruled the territory <UNK> as the <UNK> had a rather limited role one which reminded me of the <UNK> of <UNK> dame actually while karloff had a somewhat more substantial role as dr in fact was one of the more interesting characters in the movie and it was difficult to know until the very end whether he would be established to be a good guy or a bad guy the castle set was magnificent and even the limited depiction of the black forest was real enough it certainly didn't come across as low budget compared to other movies i've seen anyway the only disappointment i thought was rita performance as the <UNK> she seemed somewhat dry and didn't seem to put much passion into the role br br that aside i found that this movie held my attention throughout and there was enough suspense about how this was all going to turn out to make it well worth the watching definitely recommended with a 7 10 rating
<START> although i rarely agree with i have to say that this film while not awful just didn't make me care at all and it all just seemed to be out of place it had its moments three or four ones that made me <UNK> but most of the time i was just sitting and wondering why why did the characters do this even hot shots characters felt more thought out and fleshed out br br if you want to see a nice film then watch there it was more than random <UNK> that just walked around shooting each other on the swedish <UNK> br br i am so disappointed
<START> of course i have disappeared into the movies the neil young concert film <UNK> of gold ' br br there have been many great concert films through the years the best being martin <UNK> 'the last which filmed the <UNK> last concert at west a phenomenal concert and a phenomenal film that is if you love rock and roll and felt as if you had been born into it and were part of the music and could be in the band if you had a better guitar and someone would show you the <UNK> and that with a few <UNK> and a <UNK> or two you could change the world as you can guess i felt all five to the bottom of my twenty four year old soul br br neil young was in 'the last <UNK> ' they had to <UNK> before digital actually they had to <UNK> <UNK> a big hanging cocaine rock that from his nose so in the film there's a bright light that is not the star of <UNK> <UNK> above his lip and below his <UNK> it's a famous bit of rock and roll history br br but 'the last was made when the band and neil and everyone else was in their thirties and <UNK> of <UNK> was filmed last year when neil is in his sixties and his band looks as if they are in their late nineties and the entire movie could visually be used by the christian right and the <UNK> in the same way that those <UNK> state <UNK> films of the <UNK> of drunk driving were used when i was in high school showing dead teenagers hanging through front windows or <UNK> from trees or bloody in a <UNK> br br close your eyes and it is a terrific concert open them and view <UNK> <UNK> hidden portrait case in point the once <UNK> beautiful harris literally coming out of the darkness to sing with neil and from dark to light appearing to be a ring <UNK> <UNK> full <UNK> out of the river in front of ghastly <UNK> a nose that doesn't appear in nature and is not an <UNK> for plastic surgery eyes that make buttons on dolls look <UNK> and the ability to express any emotion human or not <UNK> by <UNK> over <UNK> in <UNK> my mind <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jack daniels living hard for decades my god sweet harris who i saw sing for free at <UNK> in <UNK> a face a 2000 year dead <UNK> would not accept but the voice as pure as a thick <UNK> bottle of <UNK> beer from the waters of <UNK> creek and i closed my eyes and <UNK> an homage one must use homage at least once in any film review to <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> mall and the steve martin pink <UNK> movie br br it would have been a terrific concert sitting in the dark in <UNK> maybe twenty <UNK> back but close up in close ups it was a medieval morality play depicting the horrors of <UNK> and the consequences of a <UNK> life br br the concert theme <UNK> on the scenery a <UNK> wind the last song <UNK> i counted eight and i wondered if irony was at play i don't think so a native american bass player a lead <UNK> who looked and dressed like buffalo bill a piano player whose face looked like the face in the scream the chick singers actually <UNK> singers mostly reminding one of the lost youth of senior united flight <UNK> still <UNK> the friendly <UNK> dressed in matching full length <UNK> <UNK> dresses no it was played straight br br none of them had seen i would bet a mighty wind br br it will be a great cd and would be glad to tell tales of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when neil was a long haired canadian <UNK> whose <UNK> lyrics seemed to mirror <UNK> and loss feelings as universal then as now br br but only in a dark bar
<START> well it has to be said that monster man is a huge mess of a film but somehow multiple different genres and a clichéd plot come together to make one of the most enjoyable modern horror films i've seen in ages the two biggest styles that the film mixes are a <UNK> <UNK> style teenage comedy and a <UNK> chainsaw <UNK> style redneck horror vibe and while one gets in the way of the other quite often director michael davis manages to keep things moving thanks to the fact that the constant shift in tone means that we're never quite sure where the film is going to be taken next things start out <UNK> as we're introduced to two characters both irritating in different ways adam is a <UNK> virgin while <UNK> is a fat big mouthed a hole they're both driving across the desert to attend the wedding of some chick they both liked in high school after a couple of strange events they pick up a <UNK> <UNK> and then find themselves being chased by some maniac in a monster truck for reasons unknown br br the idea of someone being chased by someone else in a bigger vehicle is hardly original but the way the monster truck is used here is one of the film's biggest <UNK> the truck itself looks spooky because it's so <UNK> and rusty and the fact that it <UNK> around the screen makes the unfolding action exciting and suspenseful after a while you begin to get used to the characters and once <UNK> brooks enters the <UNK> things start to look up the teen comedy side of the movie actually works pretty well as justin <UNK> is always on hand to deliver some entertaining lines of dialogue and the scenes between the <UNK> virgin and the hot female <UNK> <UNK> are interesting enough just when you think the film couldn't possibly get any <UNK> things take a turn for the weird in the final third without spoiling things it has to be said that monster man features the sort of ending that couldn't possibly be seen coming and along with the twist is a big surprise some people may feel ripped off by the sudden turn at the end but i actually thought it worked quite well as it fits the film in that nothing here really fits overall this isn't a <UNK> film by any means but if you're looking for some silly entertainment monster man should hit the spot
<START> <UNK> 2 surpasses the first movie by just a little bit the stuff that improved in here was the acting the <UNK> make up and story this one is more of a gore fest it <UNK> have the supernatural elements like the first one did in this installment <UNK> kills his victims in more normal ways he <UNK> set them on fire and he <UNK> shoot them with bullets that were in his mouth the only thing i didnt like about this movie was that the ending was a little half <UNK> in fact it was half <UNK> they killed <UNK> in a very cheap way i would strongly recommend this to anyone who like horror movies seriously the first movie was good but the second is better 9 out of 10
<START> i loved the first movie the second one was okay disappointed john <UNK> wasn't jean bob anymore as hes my favorite character but the third one what happened to the animation it looks low budget like a sat morning cartoon except for the flashback which was taken from the first movie they really should have stopped after number 2 this just makes the rest look bad <UNK> voice has changed but its not as recognizable as jean bob rogers also looks very strange i also don't understand where came from i thought he died this movie made me want to turn it off as much as i love the first one i was very disappointed with this installment they will never beat the original
<START> a 10 year old kid fed up with his parents arguing decides to hot wire a car and go on a surreal journey across america to find cards which is a gas station card game that if he can find to spell out he has a chance to win 500 million dollars he meets many bizarre characters along the way no one can make an cult <UNK> joe previous after hours achieved that by sheer merit an amazing director but it wasn't instant this movie on the other hand is just bizarre just to be bizarre no rhyme or reason to any of it the plot is incidental at best and seems to exist just to showcase various cameos it's just not a fun film nor a thoughtful one it's way too slapped together i've heard many comparisons between this and david lynch films that's damn near <UNK> as even lynch's <UNK> film worst in quotes as he doesn't have an bad films really is still miles above this dreck br br eye candy <UNK> king is topless very briefly br br dvd extras trailer for joe
<START> a young theater actress reluctantly accepts her first major part in a staged play as lady <UNK> thanks to the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> falling in front of a moving car a success winning her <UNK> betty christina finds instead horror as the one responsible for getting her to this point <UNK> her in cruel ways br br first her stage manager boyfriend <UNK> william <UNK> is <UNK> stabbed with a knife while she has to watch rope tied to a <UNK> in his <UNK> vast mansion keeping her eyes from closing thanks to <UNK> <UNK> taped under her eyes with <UNK> a result if she <UNK> allowing her to escape betty again finds herself in this unfortunate position when a specific gold chain is found on her lady <UNK> wardrobe that had been torn to <UNK> by the madman after killing a series of <UNK> which escaped from their cage in the equipment room by the clothing designer who is first knocked to the floor by an iron and subsequently stabbed <UNK> by a pair of <UNK> to cap off this nasty scene the chain falls into her throat with the killer having to cut open her throat to find it while not specifically <UNK> this act <UNK> uses the ripping sound of the <UNK> for <UNK> effect with the camera often <UNK> back to the <UNK> dead face having nowhere to turn inspector alan <UNK> playing him cold and bland at request promises to catch the psycho as betty relies on her few remaining friends for comfort the theater director <UNK> ian <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> of fire who would later die of aids a sad <UNK> <UNK> revealed in an interview that <UNK> informed him at the end of the shoot that he was hiv positive attempting the stage after a successful horror movie career despite being rejected by critics and pal mira daria former squeeze her agent and confident but the serial killer is quite driven and a showdown between them will of course occur in the theater as <UNK> has added an interesting change to the production using the <UNK> at his <UNK> br br i think this is <UNK> at his most savage <UNK> although he has certainly made later gruesome films such as his masters of horror entries and <UNK> would suggest this film really ups the <UNK> in pure violence towards the victims of the psychopath his method of forcing betty to watch was admittedly a gag by <UNK> regarding the type of audience who like to look away from the more horrific parts of horror movies i found myself <UNK> my eyes every time she just has to blink brilliantly <UNK> shoots the <UNK> from point of view achieving a <UNK> effect from our perspective as if we were the ones with the <UNK> taped <UNK> holding our eyes open i like how <UNK> will show the <UNK> eyes of betty horrified at what she's being forced into watching as little blood tears down the <UNK> when she has no choice but blink the <UNK> work of <UNK> taylor is impeccable such as the point of view shot in the theater at the end as it <UNK> for the killer or when the camera travels through rooms in the theater following the killer who wishes to see his <UNK> from a box seat or the dream sequence where we are taken into <UNK> memory of an event regarding her mother's death by a certain killer <UNK> the same mask and <UNK> as the one causing her trauma at present the highlight in my opinion is the <UNK> bullet fire sequence <UNK> staged by all involved as the camera follows a bullet which shoots through the eye of a victim exploding from the back of her head going through a <UNK> betty planned to use to call for help we even get a crow <UNK> the <UNK> from the killer to add to this vicious scene the crow is shown with the <UNK> rolling around in it's <UNK> only aspect i didn't care for often pointed out by <UNK> of the film is the final ending which i personally felt was a bit unnecessary but i guess <UNK> wanted to point out that betty was indeed not like her mother a woman with <UNK> <UNK> which in a twist relate to why the killer <UNK> our heroine the rock music used during the violent scenes didn't bother me because i felt that those moments of wicked graphic attacks needed a jarring <UNK> which heavy metal can often provide
<START> the <UNK> in this film like suit supply take away from the story cause it's supposed to be set in the eighties it's not a very thrilling film also the single from on the soundtrack is very bad it has a chorus that is repeated numerous <UNK> like i'm a cruel man i take it all away i'm a cruel man i'm here to stay couldn't those have come up with something better than that i guess they wrote it in a couple of minutes br br it's really annoying just like the product placement in this that <UNK> in on the controversy and publicity around a criminal who should not be a celebrity like he is now made out to be but should be forgotten like rats ought to be
<START> low budget murder mystery about a public <UNK> trying to clear his client of a murder the man had been convicted of 12 years previously <UNK> things is the fact that he escaped custody after his conviction but the <UNK> believes the man to be innocent of the murder and works to find the real killer gig young as the <UNK> is okay and james anderson as the convicted killer is actually pretty good but the picture as a whole just <UNK> along with little suspense and despite some good character actors in the cast the performances are generally below par director george was apparently more at home making westerns he was <UNK> out gene tv series at columbia at around this time but even if he had tried to <UNK> any <UNK> into this picture the hack script would have defeated his attempts average at best the film <UNK> with a courtroom scene that's straight out of an episode of perry mason and is just as predictable
<START> i have fond memories of watching this when it came out it's one of those films that you know is rubbish even when you're a kid but at that age you overlook the ludicrous acting special effects and plot so there's a race of big <UNK> <UNK> living underground huh and just enjoy the campy monsters for all they're worth
<START> i was flipping through the channels and had to stop and laugh when i came across this movie it was so clearly about teens in the early 80s and i called my mom <UNK> turn to channel such and such the kid totally looks like if dad were a kid br br um yeah turns out this movie is about my dad his friends br br even without it being about loosely based on my <UNK> childhood i'd say watch this movie br br it is just bizarre to say the least the <UNK> <UNK> in teens even back then this is a good human interest and showcases some strange sides of the psyche
<START> this is a <UNK> bad b movie actually it really is much better quality than a lot of b movies it had a consistent script decent direction and i have seen worse acting the zombies were great clearly these were romero zombies and was really a interesting zombie story obviously not oscar material and if your not into zombie movies or b movies you probably wont enjoy this but if you are you'll like this movie br br the main clint eastwood <UNK> western character guy is pretty good although they never really clearly explain how he can <UNK> himself from <UNK> and zombie bites but if he has more than a line of dialogue that where his bad acting is really evident br br it was a good ending to at least i thought so romero should be <UNK> if he ever saw this
<START> island of death is not really a good movie by any standard but it is a curious one imagine if natural born killers had been made 20 years too early as a greek <UNK> porn film that's what you get here the quaint story of a young <UNK> british couple cutting a deadly <UNK> through the population of a lovely little greek island br br i'll spare you a detailed breakdown of the plot it's not really important except to set up increasingly perverse or violent sex scenes followed by <UNK> brutal murders often lovingly photographed for <UNK> by our charming young couple it could have been brilliant in its own sick and nasty way but instead br br instead i found myself <UNK> checking the run time and chapter <UNK> to see how much longer the parade was going to last <UNK> pacing and <UNK> bland acting turn even <UNK> into and connecting scenes into an eternity of dull plodding ah well you can't win 'em all
<START> every time the supposed <UNK> and we the audience is <UNK> to set its first sights one of the <UNK> new worlds for some <UNK> reason the filmmakers decided to distract with an <UNK> or some false alarm or some bit of artificial dramatic suspense br br so instead of <UNK> enjoying the surface of or standing over the rings of <UNK> or <UNK> on the magic of flying by a <UNK> or an <UNK> we are distracted into worrying about the <UNK> and survival of the characters big let down br br the filmmakers seem to be unsure what they want a documentary of the natural wonders in our <UNK> system or a suspense thriller in which the viewer cares more about the characters than the subject matter come on br br hello if i wanted suspense and tension i'd watch a real narrative sci fi movie br br sure it's a <UNK> drama but the characters and their survival here the risks of such a mission should be secondary to the subject matter wait yes the risks of such a mission are an important part of the subject matter since essentially this is a film about a space mission not just about the <UNK> system but it was <UNK> and distracted strongly from the discovery of new worlds we were supposed to be enjoying br br otherwise the film was remarkable in giving a very realistic feel for the human elements of a space mission the <UNK> the tensions the weight of responsibility the near fatal mistakes the sacrifices etc also it would fit very well in the hard sci fi <UNK> in fact it would be one of the best because here the science was almost closely <UNK> to br br but the <UNK> were awful br br otherwise i missed showing the effects of being in space for several years on the <UNK> after landing on earth also not
<START> it must be so difficult to tell a story where not much happens yet still grip the viewers attention i think this short film achieves this with <UNK> quality <UNK> has an amazing voice that is very <UNK> wise and <UNK> i'm not gay it reminds of the qualities that robert redford has in <UNK> the end is very sad but beautiful one wonders how long harry has left will he be lonely and will he get to say his <UNK> also one gets annoyed at mr <UNK> for not getting involved in more work of this caliber lets hope he continues to do fine work in holland and stays away from hollywood br br worth watching
<START> the 1979 film musical of hair was loosely based on the infamous 1960's broadway musical that became famous because of its infamous nude scene the stage musical isn't really much more than a group of skits strung together with some amusing musical numbers however for the film director <UNK> <UNK> who won an oscar for directing one flew over the <UNK> nest and the writers have taken the basic premise of the play and the score and constructed a real story to make the show more user friendly for the big screen in the film naive farm boy claude hooper john savage is about to go into the army and decides to spend a couple of days in new york where he meets a group of aging hippies treat williams <UNK> wright annie golden don who get him involved in a group of nutty <UNK> including the pursuit of a <UNK> society girl beverly <UNK> the story <UNK> into a series of vignettes that range from the ridiculous to the sublime but it is all <UNK> photographed with a clever use of nyc locations and <UNK> staged musical numbers <UNK> choreographed by the legendary treat williams lights up the screen as <UNK> the unconventional and free spirited hippie who does his best to get claude to <UNK> up and is matched scene for scene by savage as claude who brings a lovely <UNK> to the role of claude annie golden is a <UNK> as <UNK> the pregnant hippie who is pregnant by wright or doesn't know which one is the father and doesn't seem to care there is one outstanding musical number after another here <UNK> is a tour through central park which includes dancing horses treat williams <UNK> a fancy dinner party in i got life black boys white boys features the late <UNK> carter and ellen <UNK> <UNK> the ethnic virtues of men and easy to be hard is a powerful rendering of one of the best songs in the show by original cast member <UNK> barnes who plays <UNK> ex girlfriend and mother of his child this is a beautifully photographed well acted sung and <UNK> psychedelic acid trip of a movie that must be seen and once seen will <UNK> multiple viewings as this <UNK> has to much to offer to catch it all in one showing
<START> i wonder if i could take sitting through a whole musical comedy from russia or east germany or other countries that for decades put out almost always <UNK> film anti fascist films anti war films as this documentary points out that just reflected the dark <UNK> times under <UNK> and life behind the iron curtain it's fascinating then to see the other side of the <UNK> the sorts of <UNK> and rebels with music at their side to try and please the masses more often than not stuck in the <UNK> walk of life one film actually seemed rather impressive called jolly <UNK> by the <UNK> of the very small group of musical filmmakers from the clip s i saw of that film i'd <UNK> that it was one of the only works to actually step out of itself and go into just wild manic make you laugh kind of mode but as this film shows if you were a filmmaker looking to entertain it better be with a <UNK> br br through interviews some occasional quasi <UNK> of russia germany sort of motion picture association at the censorship table and clips one gets the full picture of what it was like both behind the scenes and on the screen to just make sheer entertainment for the masses some of the films well most of them as apparently only 14 screened over 40 years in the countries mentioned made a good <UNK> of change but for what purpose really one also gets drawn into the culture of it all how it <UNK> greatly from the american way of <UNK> it works make em while they're <UNK> attitude but at the same time perhaps out of this <UNK> some interesting funny and from what i saw up beat films were made they <UNK> been fairly typical of what was asked to be shown to the masses under fond but demanding terms like life with <UNK> it gets to be even <UNK> a story though as we get shown what it was like in the 60's the last wave of musical comedies as rock and roll and pop tunes finally hit their <UNK> br br in short some good stuff but only if interested really i was shown the film in a class on documentary films and half the class fell asleep so be warned on the one hand though on the other if looking for it it can make for a really rewarding trip into european film history
<START> i'm sorry fans but i was disappointed with this concert at the cbs television city in los angeles it's decent music wise but the presentation is simply boring big time most of the songs sound the same and lead singer writer jeff <UNK> is about as animated as a store <UNK> he has a pleasant voice but he isn't much to watch he just stands in one spot and sings for an hour and 40 minutes the songs all sound like 1970s 1980s <UNK> stuff pleasant but not exciting br br <UNK> is accompanied by a very pretty woman <UNK> but she isn't too animated either the only song out of 23 that creates any excitement is the last one roll over <UNK> now if only some of the other 22 songs had that excitement to them this could have been a much better concert dvd
<START> this movie is about a depressed and emotionally <UNK> man has a distant relative move in with him in his apartment in <UNK> as time passes their relationship becomes more and more strained until finally he begins yelling at his house guest who is out of work and doesn't appear all that eager to find work that's most of the movie in fact the problem is that although emotionally <UNK> and depressed people are very <UNK> and non <UNK> they don't make for a very satisfying movie that's because most of the time he and his just stare into space and say nothing i think all these flat moments could have been <UNK> to make a 30 minute movie i certainly wouldn't have minded
<START> i must admit ashamed though i am that as an <UNK> young teenager this below par horror <UNK> was one of my favourite all time films nine years after first viewing stephen king's frightening story however i have now come to my senses and am able to <UNK> fritz work more reasonably br br indeed king's tale of a small <UNK> <UNK> community that is turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is truly disturbing on paper but it makes for a cheap average horror show on celluloid a lot of this outcome can be attributed to the fact that almost allows the beginning of the film to become a <UNK> slasher show and then turns the finale into a <UNK> <UNK> special effects nightmare br br the cast are reasonable but they can only portray as much credibility as this rather incredible over the top movie will allow them and the soundtrack by jonathan <UNK> is than the pictures br br a real shame that george <UNK> screenplay turned stephen king's haunting short story into a shocking horror <UNK> and all the other children of the corn aren't really all that scary br br sunday august 7 1994 video
<START> this is one of stan <UNK> best solo <UNK> before the <UNK> <UNK> with oliver hardy laurel is a very good actor in the film and provides good comedy the best scene in the film is when stan dances with mae laurel his real life common law wife at the <UNK> <UNK> stan does silly dances that are funny without you hearing the music i will recommend this to any stan laurel fan
<START> may contain spoilers br br clearly who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections i just can't see it any other way what really surprises me is no one used the name allen <UNK> and more surprising everyone involved didn't use this name br br anyhow where to begin the bad dialogue the crummy costumes the sorry looking film stock the unintentional comedy the over the top characters and more inconsistencies than george w <UNK> college career i don't know what was funnier the guy losing his arm because of a <UNK> or the slow motion scene where all the baby jack were getting killed also one of the great lines of all time was <UNK> in this film how do we know it's him like there's another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with <UNK> a great camp film but a very bad film overall
<START> we really don't know where to begin when talking about this movie but we'll start with the plot we sincerely suspect that <UNK> wrote produced directed this movie never read the book because they missed the entire point satirical not horror just a hint second the bath scene enough said third the added characters the <UNK> gothic french lady and her black page who enjoys holding hands and we don't understand where this came from either and then there was the casting all of them were really unlikeable we were very upset that catherine and mr ended up together because they were so unlikable that no one would ever wish to see them happy and the music we think that the bbc producers ran out of money so <UNK> their <UNK> attic and they found some old records <UNK> <UNK> female voices and an occasional electric guitar <UNK> br br plus the best line ever since you left the white rose bush has died of grief if anybody has any explanation we would love to hear it because it makes absolutely no sense br br we are still wondering what on earth everyone involved was thinking when they <UNK> released this pathetic excuse of a movie out on the public we think it should be considered a federal offense torture is illegal br br this movie is by far the worst we have seen to date and i've seen a lot of movies br br our recommendation give this movie to <UNK> you hate they will watch it and want to kill themselves and we agree with a previous post we would give this 0 stars if at all possible do not watch and we strongly suspect that everyone who commented so far in favor of this movie were involved in its production or were mentally insane these are the only reasons we have been able to come up with that would <UNK> giving a <UNK> review
<START> the english translation of the title on the dvd version of this film is graveyard of horrors but i think that must be an error it should have been called graveyard of horrible acting horrible editing horrible story and horrible music all make this a horrible film best left in a horrible graveyard br br horrible
<START> the film is essentially an older form final destination in which several car <UNK> teens have their souls separated from their bodies and must cheat death who is chasing them the film has its moments and its concepts the idea of <UNK> souls being separated from their bodies is a pretty nifty idea if this movie were remade with a few good actors actresses and some awesome special effects it could turn out to be extremely awesome as for the actual film i recommend watching the mst3k version the pure version might be too boring to sit through unless you love bad movies staring martin <UNK> brother
<START> simply one of the best movies ever if you won't get it sorry for you i believe that someday people will include this one in their all time top <UNK> not now but in the far future
<START> i am really amazed how little fame this film had i think it has to do with distribution companies and etc br br don't be idiots if you are looking for a good fun take this movie this is very nice movie to pass few hours with and the music is great br br it's about well girls and boys and whats between them with not too much story but not all movies should be pulp fiction should they it's nice and cute and gives good time the girls are also very good looking and this makes the whole movie even more enjoyable br br why i gave it only a 9 well the story could be little more convincing from the middle and on in some point you start to see events that are little less reliable small spoiler the baby is crying and the father goes in and tries to relax him now i am not talking about some small cry but no <UNK> cry and 30 <UNK> after that the father goes out and baby is sleeping excuse me when and how exactly did you make him calm and sleep and be able to leave his room in 20 30 seconds but ignore this kind of small picking because the film itself is not <UNK> it's fun and this should be overlooked
<START> this movie is not worth anything i mean if you want to watch this kind of stuff flip to hollywood movies this totally is a disgrace to the bollywood name <UNK> n <UNK> seriously sucked never watch this movie as for the actors it appears the acting <UNK> <UNK> a generation couldn't have worn less and <UNK> obviously was just picked because he was the director's spoiled son all of that <UNK> re was amazingly stupid the songs are eh and i hope the director did not spend to much money on it bottom line i hated the movie do not let your kids watch it and if you have it in your house it is a stupid movie so <UNK> it buy the cd if you must as i said the songs are eh at least it is better then the movie
<START> seriously i <UNK> really get why people here are bashing it i mean br br the idea of a killer snowman <UNK> havoc on a <UNK> island paradise is pretty absurd the good news is the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the vein of army of darkness br br especially in the second half of the film when the little killer <UNK> attack i laughed my ass off for example the put one of the little creeps into a <UNK> a la <UNK> 1 and mix it after that it <UNK> back into a <UNK> and <UNK> with a high pitched voice that was fun br br bottom line incredible movie rent it
<START> i was hugely impressed with this movie if for nothing else than for the comedy it might not be the <UNK> <UNK> humor at all times but i found it appropriate to every scene br br the flow of the film is certainly a bit <UNK> almost confusing sometimes but that is how the characters feel sometimes we're watching a bit of slapstick and other scenes <UNK> around a <UNK> <UNK> on relationships this might be a bit frustrating to certain viewers but it brought me closer to the characters' <UNK> of <UNK> chaos br br the acting is great from everyone i'm a huge andy <UNK> fan but i wasn't head over heels for his part like everyone else seems to be he did very well but <UNK> nicholson and lauren graham stole the show for me both in their respective ways jay <UNK> performs as expected if you've seen him in other films i've always liked him br br overall the movie is very funny and offers some nice <UNK> for a few types of relationships when it comes to relationship questions and problems some films try to surprise there's nothing surprising about the conclusions offered here but it's entertaining to watch them be revealed throughout the film
<START> before watching this movie my thoughts were like another israeli typical movie but i was <UNK> to watch i great israeli drama the plot is really good and the actors act great one of the best <UNK> movies i saw so at the <UNK> i really recommend this movie
<START> i like <UNK> so 12 years after having first seen star trek v and thinking it was <UNK> bad i gave it a second watch hoping i would find some redeeming quality which i missed the first time around br br i didn't br br the writing is half baked and although at first the quality of the acting is stable enough to keep the movie on its feet albeit <UNK> the further we get into the plot the <UNK> it gets the last quarter of the film is just plain ridiculous what was even worse from the original <UNK> <UNK> is that this was the first st movie to be released after the franchise returned to television with next generation and the average episode of next generation would put this to shame including the special effects what an embarrassment br br the final frontier isn't thoroughly wretched i gave it 4 out of 10 but it's so far below the standard of its predecessors yes including the first one that the only reason i can think of to watch it is because you'll appreciate the other movies more br br unless it's an episode with <UNK> mother in it
<START> i attended a screening of fierce people at the 2006 <UNK> film festival i hesitate to label it a premiere of any sort since it was shot in the spring of 2004 and had its world premiere at <UNK> in 2005 it played several festivals that year release seemed <UNK> then it disappeared <UNK> <UNK> or so it appeared to the film going public rumors of a theatrical or dvd release have popped up now and then but all proved <UNK> then this screening was announced perhaps one can call it a re premiere it certainly felt as if i was witness to a buried treasure and what a treasure it was br br i suppose one could <UNK> fierce people as a coming of age drama but it also has elements of comedy and tragedy as well as mystery and a bit of farce thrown in in short real life that makes it hard to <UNK> which puts it more into the category of an indie as opposed to a hollywood movie but its high production values big budget feel and star caliber cast seem at odds with the indie label so let's call it a hybrid and perhaps that's why it's been lost it defies br br meet <UNK> earl anton <UNK> 15 whose father is absent in fact <UNK> has never known him but he sees him and hears him via the collection of home movies sent from south america dad is a renowned <UNK> and has made a name for himself by setting up shop with the the tribe of fierce people who live to kill and well <UNK> all their activities are built around those two tasks and <UNK> is captivated by it mom liz diane lane is also somewhat absent although present physically she is lost in a world of cocaine and alcohol so <UNK> becomes an adult in his little <UNK> world with his <UNK> of film br br one summer mom decides to drag <UNK> along with her into the <UNK> of new jersey a <UNK> <UNK> mom has <UNK> to a wealthy client <UNK> c <UNK> donald sutherland in a tour de force performance and he has invited her for an extended house call at his <UNK> estate tribe includes an assortment of eccentric rich kids servants and village idiots among whom <UNK> will find himself part of his own <UNK> study will his experience with <UNK> films help him survive life as a visitor to this tribe will he be accepted or will he be seen as an <UNK> <UNK> struggling with his own identity as an adolescent such is the stuff of fairy tales and i suppose this would be if not for the dark <UNK> which director <UNK> dunne and writer <UNK> <UNK> have <UNK> into this magnificent story br br with anton voice over <UNK> pieces of <UNK> home movies <UNK> must learn to go back to being the teenager he never really had a chance to be stop being the parent to his mom allow newly sober mom to be parent to him and learn responsibility on the way to <UNK> the way it should have taken place all along yet he needs to make this transformation in a dangerous dark world where playing with fire is <UNK> to this <UNK> family br br this is first and foremost a story driven film and <UNK> dunne <UNK> as much in the intro to the film he bought the rights to <UNK> novel even as it was being written and <UNK> own screenplay comes to life in the hands of the masterful dunne in a way that's a work of wonder br br this is also largely a character driven film and sutherland has never been better his star turn as <UNK> stunned those around me and will likely leave you amazed as well diane <UNK> character ultimately <UNK> so many personalities that it's hard to imagine another actor pulling it off so well she is breathtaking but more than anything fierce people is anton film he has a long resume as a child actor but <UNK> little as a teen other than the little known house of d also a gem he is best known as <UNK> on tv's <UNK> in january he will be seen in <UNK> dog also sitting on the shelf since 2004 a film i saw at sundance this year and in which he is the heart and soul his performance here goes far beyond what one would expect from someone so young and is nothing short of spectacular br br this complex quirky film has remained out of sight long enough fierce people is a treasure filled with light and shadow comedy and tragedy joy and pathos but mostly wonder
<START> surely this deserves to be in the bottom 10 films of all time pity it's just a tv movie rubbish that only we british can produce it perhaps has some merit in the so awful it's good scale watch out for scene where they start dancing
<START> there is a solid group of people that have lives like this girl going through the process at school the <UNK> absence at all important <UNK> in lauren school search provide interviews only and draws the interviews with them at below <UNK> quality review that in 30 minutes <UNK> four years of high school <UNK> the incident of anger in her mother obviously block a mothers display of possible physical abuse of her or her disabled sister at one time or another thus <UNK> her mother's <UNK> involvement in family <UNK> the daughter lauren really has done something big trying to make her mother <UNK> and then that plan itself somewhat heroic in light of the age she is still giving when everyone around her taking <UNK> on her a heart not yet connected to her head something that age has never had a genuine answer to even to this day her replacement of a significant other not necessarily <UNK> a father image however a trusted authority nonetheless being imagined if not real a pure cup without a <UNK> see the movie everyone needs a friend to see through understanding of a <UNK> world she made hers up on what she knew of life at the time she has all the mental capacity for higher learning though having no friends present for her time makes the ending a <UNK> tragedy in progress given a bird in a cage not a puppy that would a least get her walking two times a day ideas out of the roof she is under would be the developing on her sidewalk life sad is the <UNK> psychiatric ending how could she be committed at a time when she has proved an important responsibility believe it or not taking of a dog is a better witness than taking care of a bird at this time of her life the symbolic cage of her in a cage is too much mental and self fulfilling of some of her <UNK> within the story the neighbor college <UNK> is developed just fine he is as developed as the training education will allow for the mental maturity that <UNK> her eternal purpose compared to his <UNK> <UNK> i myself eventually just went to the <UNK> magazine and got a 20 00 degree saying i was an it offered all the education that buying the truth would and independence to skip <UNK> content run the world or do not get your own home was the college offer who was <UNK> anyone for superior time for the learning the only sin is not having your pleasure right what fight on that she has been denied an act for life <UNK> to her love for life what is college a reward for failing high school do you graduate with your class or without it what is the exchange a lifetime of youth with only questions could lead occur w o a question the loss followed as much for good as bad when was she given a mind for sexual <UNK> or growth for her good self to be <UNK> why didn't good people treat her with good things if good people do not do good things for good people what is good for she is young pretty and walked on long before personal development is given a winning game her act taken in life with a closed door perhaps the title would be better as christmas doors not
<START> i never saw any of the work until early last year although when channel <UNK> one night i caught the end of one the series three episodes but last winter i fell in love with the show and its dark eccentric and sometimes downright sinister characters so when i <UNK> they had made a film in which the show's lovable creators met their own characters i couldn't order the dvd fast enough and near on <UNK> it from my hands when he delivered it i was so excited to see what the <UNK> had done and how they'd done it br br and it was excellent from the beginning where jeremy michael sheen is <UNK> by edward <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> why didn't you play yourself he's perfectly capable as viewers of the infamous house of horrors know to <UNK> <UNK> yet another one of her flock to <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> discovering that they are characters which is a great scene the scenes set in are very enjoyable with the <UNK> turning their hands to yet more characters and an all new plot david <UNK> turn as doctor <UNK> is fantastic slightly camp and very funny br br the league have always been brilliant at <UNK> humour with sadness and emotion and the climax of this film where <UNK> is struggling with the idea that he and the other <UNK> residents are just fictional people who will never be able to change who they are or their purpose and to witness how it's breaking him down is really sad and beautiful to watch at the same time and that really shows the talent something for which they are terribly overlooked for to this day br br and then you have that rather clever ending where you sit in wonder with <UNK> beautiful theme music playing and you know you've enjoyed a very clever and funny film
<START> grim instead of amusing mean spirited instead of playful boring instead of interesting it won't give you the <UNK> but it just may gross you out or send you to sleep and it will certainly make you wonder what were they thinking 1 2
<START> i usually like <UNK> martial arts fantasy movies but i hated this one once upon a time in china <UNK> assassin a chinese ghost story and even big trouble in little china are my favorites but this film sucked too much fancy tricks and stupid story br br 4 10
<START> i had just finished reading the book and was really looking forward to seeing this tv adaptation which was broadcast on the hallmark channel on monday night 5 30 <UNK> the key to the whole book was the <UNK> which was stolen by the man with steel teeth but i watched for an hour out of 3 1 2 and i saw the man with the steel teeth but i never saw him steal a <UNK> i saw someone steal some virus but what did that have to do with the book it's too bad because this film had great production values and a good cast but isn't the idea of turning a book into a movie tv or film to get the people who read the book to be part of the audience they only kept me for an hour i thought the premise of the book was great and what did they do but throw out the whole premise this book had a great <UNK> to <UNK> hitchcock but they ignored it and it said in the titles that <UNK> was involved in the production they sure must have paid him a lot of money
<START> although it doesn't seem very promising for a long stretch <UNK> french <UNK> ends up being an effortlessly charming film the story is cliché a <UNK> girl <UNK> is discovered by a night club owner jean <UNK> steals her from her baker boyfriend and drops his current girlfriend both of whom come back for their former lovers has to choose whether to go back to her humble life with the baker go on with the show with her <UNK> oh or become a princess as a prince falls in love with her at one point too i'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have the film ends with the opening of new night club the <UNK> <UNK> and a couple of gorgeous song and dance numbers the first of them de la <UNK> which also provides the base of most of the film's musical score is simply one of the most gorgeous songs ever written and <UNK> himself wrote it if you're a fan of <UNK> <UNK> 2001 film <UNK> <UNK> you'll recognize the tune as it comes up near the beginning of that film sung by <UNK> <UNK> although it isn't very prominent in that film everyone i know who owns the soundtrack loves it in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french <UNK> also boasts one of the <UNK> leading ladies ever to grace the screen it's hard not to fall head over heels in love with that girl 8 10
<START> so i give it one star for true quality but i'd give it an eight and a half for sheer <UNK> an incredibly strange hybrid of sex comedy and vigilante thriller young warriors is just the sort of bad movie you usually hope to find when <UNK> around the video <UNK> yet so rarely do it starts off with about half an hour of wacky hi <UNK> sex jokes and juvenile <UNK> including an <UNK> in the <UNK> joke that has to be seen not to be believed then the main character's younger sister gets gang raped by a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> scene that keeps me from giving this a 10 for entertainment value rape is not entertainment and the main character gets the rest of his sex crazed frat brothers to help him in a quest to clean up the city find the responsible <UNK> and kill anybody slightly criminal they run into along the way br br it's hilarious non stop fun apart from the very unpleasant rape scene and is essential viewing to any serious bad movie fan trust me i've put my time in on these things and this is one of the best highlights include a wonderful visit to the library a great <UNK> <UNK> mo shootout in a sleazy bar with a shot of a guy blowing his own foot off that's pretty impressive a couple of decent <UNK> actors richard <UNK> ernest <UNK> a couple of semi famous recognizable faces <UNK> day george scream queen <UNK> <UNK> and a couple of relatives of famous people chuck <UNK> brother mike van <UNK> clan member james it even has one of those great what have we become type morality lesson endings although the turning point comes when the vigilante gun down a couple of kids robbing a store with a toy gun i've always wondered why that was the <UNK> that got the hero thinking after all whether they were kids and not hardened criminals and whether they had a real gun or not they were in fact still robbing a store so as far as i can tell it was just another job well done for our vigilante frat boys right wonderful stuff highly recommended just don't blame me when you enjoy it despite yourself
<START> i want to say i liked this film i really do but when it <UNK> down to it it was just far too boring it starts off looking promising and even once they get inside the mines the creepy atmosphere and mood is great the problem is the monster or lack of it as people have said it's a stop motion monster but that's not the problem stop motion can look great if done properly the problem is that we don't see enough of it and we don't get to see any deaths this is meant to be a horror film so a lack of monster and a lack of deaths equals boredom there were some scenes i liked such as when one girl is using her camera in the dark and the monster is coming towards her there are also a few other creepy scenes but they are far too few to hold your interest and definitely not worth watching the film for it's a shame because i can see that had it been handled correctly it would've been an effectively creepy horror flick the saddest thing is that films like this will never be made again because film makers over polish their films these days and rely on crappy cgi effects
<START> no it's just a cheap 1940s serial using the good name if you are a fan of the comic book you will be greatly disappointed they have <UNK> changed the character no shield no no fighting the nazis no wings on the side of his mask and most importantly captain america is now a district attorney and no longer a <UNK> br br dick <UNK> as captain america don't look too closely when he changes into his costume it is pretty obvious that he was not in the best physical shape when he made this serial can you say <UNK> it is also very obvious that a stunt man is performing most of the action here almost every chapter has an obligatory fist fight that is shot and performed in exactly the same way the villain is rather bland and although he uses an <UNK> the <UNK> he doesn't wear a disguise of any kind the story is repetitive and very simple the effects are laughable and the action is average on the plus side we have sexy <UNK> gray as the d a 's assistant and the good captain gets to ride on a cool looking motorcycle in one early chapter overall ok but nothing special
<START> back in 1982 a little film called making love shocked audiences with its frank and open depiction of a romantic love story that just happened to be about two men br br i have been waiting for years for a good old fashioned romance between two men latter days is all that and more br br yes it is <UNK> melodramatic cliché ridden and quite corny that is what makes it so wonderful there is nothing like a good romantic movie and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word br br as to the issue of religion sorry folks but these things do happen and are happening to gay people even now it is not just the mormon church that rejects its gay members gay people in every religion have faced harsh judgment and <UNK> br br i loved this movie it has a perfect blend of a fantasy romance grounded in the reality of the day to day lives of the characters if i could give it more than ten stars i would good love stories never go out of style great love stories like latter days are unforgettable br br it's about time
<START> spoilers this movie called eaten alive here in the uk is quite possibly the worst film ever made and is brilliant just for that a sexy rich girl teams up with a rugged action man to search for her sister in the new guinea jungle what follows is an <UNK> crap mixture of <UNK> insane <UNK> and religious <UNK> that has to be seen to be believed the <UNK> scenes are quite horrific but are so badly staged and acted that they prove quite amusing the cast are awful except for janet as the female lead who is excellent look out for the scene where she is stripped naked and covered with gold paint my rating 1 out of 10
<START> i love <UNK> boot i hoped for something along similar lines a realistic war movie portraying and civilians on both sides as real people with both the joy and pain of combat br br unfortunately <UNK> appears to have been written by a third <UNK> and directed by a fifth grade student major pieces of the movie simply appear missing leaving it completely disjointed the dialogue in translation is ridiculous but appears no better in the native tongue you only have to watch the actors' faces during the bad moments of dialogue to realize just how bad this movie is
<START> dorothy <UNK> is the only reason to watch this unfunny sci fi spoof and her appearance is a disappointment though she has the title role her <UNK> is limited and she only speaks a few lines of dialogue if you're not a <UNK> fan pass this one up
<START> the writers and creators of this film should actually be <UNK> for <UNK> the world with this crap man in the mirror is in fact beyond horrible way way way beyond br br and people i'm not just saying that because i'm a michael jackson fan or due to the fact that this is truly one of the most retarded depictions of his life i've ever encountered br br i'm saying it because this is a waste of time money and celluloid i feel ashamed of myself just having seen all of it that's 1 hour and 26 min of my life i'll never get back i'm telling you watching grass grow is literally more entertaining than this film br br consider yourselves warned
<START> whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely the lone ranger is not camp but the icon for good <UNK> all over the world and it's a total <UNK> of the spirit of the character that the only real lone ranger mr <UNK> moore was forbidden to wear his mask in public appearances when this movie was released br br long story short the single saving grace of this gross and poorly done <UNK> was that in that year i had the honor of meeting mr <UNK> moore in <UNK> <UNK> as part of a tour resulting from the bad press over mr moore's treatment needless to say mr moore's character integrity and presence far <UNK> the movie br br some things cannot be done better there is only one lone ranger
<START> these three directors are off to good <UNK> the three stories are remarkably well done for independent productions and capture those traumatic feelings of coming out when you aren't really sure it's a good idea i laughed at those <UNK> <UNK> around the dressing room in pool days i <UNK> at the notion that fans of bette midler judy garland and barbra streisand are assumed to be gay in a friend of dorothy ie <UNK> through the cd music <UNK> and i <UNK> over the jock in the disco years whose memory of sweet sex was now <UNK> by <UNK> it all seemed so real i look forward to more offerings from this trio of directors
<START> i may be a good old boy from virginia in the <UNK> states of america but this man does it for me that mustache gets me <UNK> up i remember when i first saw a video of his that girl he beat was amazing the depth of his acting when they cut to his <UNK> <UNK> was a new level of <UNK> it reminds me of the <UNK> <UNK> of our <UNK> <UNK> if i could ask him one question it would be if you were a hot dog would you eat yourself will be doing a reunion tour take note from the <UNK> like gordon <UNK> true music from the heart never fades away <UNK> la john denver <UNK> my friend o f f l fan for life
<START> although flawed in it's view of <UNK> this movie will shed light for the viewer about the <UNK> and inaccuracies concerning aids despite the depressing subject matter this film depicts a warm friendship between two boys and will make you laugh as well as cry very well acted by all especially joseph and brad the language is a little strong though appropriate and it's an entertaining and intelligent film for the whole family but remember to have the <UNK> ready
<START> a gem of a british caper comedy poor american <UNK> <UNK> green richard jordan playing another bad guy but this time an adorable one gets out of a british jail and tries to go straight but his <UNK> man job in a bank is too attractive for his never <UNK> criminal friends headed up by a really nasty <UNK> david niven in one of his last roles <UNK> <UNK> but the lure of all that money is just too much for him things unravel and and it's all <UNK> to watch jordan must have played 20 bad guys in his career but he never played the same one twice this one is just too lovable to hate niven never played a <UNK> bad guy oil all over two fine actors we've lost that i wish we had back
<START> martin lawrence could be considered a talented man but those days are long gone shows a man who at once tries to play the sympathy card to his plight yet takes responsibility for it whenever he thinks it'll benefit his ego the sad truth is that at this point in his life his best days were behind him his half funny show was dead in the water after his co star left and to today he faces a career of voice acting and god awful action films br br one gets the impression that this concert film wasn't made to give <UNK> career another boost after his <UNK> but rather a childish attempt to clear the air by both trying to <UNK> salvage what remained of his life and somehow twist it into something to be proud of some defining moment in which he showed himself to have his fame sadly the concert is nothing but a <UNK> voiced martin <UNK> trying to be funny <UNK> pathos and then claim he doesn't care about it at all because hardcore the sad truth is that this is the real public embarrassment for lawrence the way he <UNK> on <UNK> sad pity laughter makes you wish that he would just strip down to his underwear on stage wave a gun around and just <UNK> it all over again there is no real insight to his performance at all much like the childish title states martin is trying to make his ultimate moment of truth his own in his way and fails miserably he would have been better off waiting for the e true hollywood story instead of running on a stage and making an idiot out of himself for the second time br br perhaps the saddest thing about this concert film or rather career <UNK> is that martin didn't put any thought into this what was this film supposed to prove sadly that his fame was fleeting he was a flash in the pan before the underwear incident and now that the only way he can get work is will smith or a pixar production they might as well called this concert because that's what it is martin lawrence just dies on stage here and with it goes what could have been an interesting career now just a pathetic side note in history

<START> the polar express was an awful movie what makes this movie worst is the <UNK> to present itself as a innocent <UNK> and harmless tale for children about the true meaning of christmas i never read the book of chris van in what it was inspired but the most disappointing is that it was directed by robert <UNK> the same who made the great who framed roger rabbit a excellent movie where he proof that the animation could be appreciated for kids and adults equally while in this movie it seems that he was victim of his own ambition and he give too much importance to create impressive level of detail than a interesting story i'm sorry to say this but the polar express have so much artistic level as a publicity campaign of a video game or toy everything in this movie seems to be so lifeless the characters could look like humans but they don't have nothing of life on them and they have a <UNK> touch in their eyes br br but the worst is the message in this movie you could see it at some parts of the movie and believe me it was vile take for example one scene where one kid refuses to enter to the polar express notice that the character that looks like tom hanks makes a gesture like saying you are stupid to don't accept my offering second when the girl says that the toys are so warm and things like that all the damn movie the kids keep talking about how big would be the gifts that santa would give to them there is even a song about the gifts the <UNK> is a irrelevant and weak character and in the last scene the character seems to discover the true meaning of christmas and what would be what do you think the gifts many christmas movies are close to say something like it but the polar express it's a <UNK> to the <UNK> and greed i refuse to call it a children's movie because if is that what the kids would learn i don't want to think how would be our future
<START> of <UNK> is my favorite <UNK> files episode of the entire series this episode shows a side of jim <UNK> that is usually ignored to wit jim is genuinely in love with a beautiful woman and is shown as a father figure to her young daughter the woman is recently divorced and she and jim have recently returned from a weekend <UNK> along with the <UNK> through a strange turn of events the woman is discovered missing after they return to her home br br <UNK> to his father rocky of the events leading up to the woman's disappearance is reminiscent of mickey <UNK> mike hammer series from an earlier era after much brooding and reflection and with <UNK> jim stumbles upon the clue that sends him off investigating the disappearance with his usual br br unfortunately <UNK> girlfriend karen <UNK> witnessed some mafia activity while they stayed at the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the crime bosses <UNK> by killing karen and <UNK> another woman into <UNK> car the <UNK> ostensibly asleep in the back seat made her exit immediately upon arrival at the home a couple of cover up murders ensue and jim proceeds to their solution while under suspicion of the l a police department even as <UNK> are <UNK> for his arrest br br this episode evokes more emotional reaction than all other <UNK> files episodes combined james garner as jim <UNK> is seen at his most vulnerable moment and yet he <UNK> the presence of mind to pursue the case this is personal for jim <UNK> in this case he is not hired to do a job but he is trying to recover his lost love to save her life unfortunately this is not possible but jim tries hard to sort out his feelings but it is apparent that he will not soon get over his hurt br br despite the appeal of the main story line many key questions are raised but never answered in this episode 1 what becomes of the young daughter of <UNK> girlfriend 2 what did karen actually see at the hotel that made the mafia kill her 3 how could jim drive for hours with an <UNK> in his back seat without <UNK> this 4 the daughter stated that <UNK> didn't come back with us so why didn't the girl scream or cry when she noticed that her mother was absent for the hours long car ride regardless of these <UNK> of hand is the <UNK> files episode which comes closest to being a tear <UNK> the suspense is compelling and the story is told in a sensitive and vulnerable style which makes us feel pain
<START> dead man walking absolutely brilliant in tears by the end you can not watch this film and not think about the issues it raises how can you justify killing whether it be murder or the death penalty and to what point is forgiveness possible not just in a spiritual way don't watch this film when your down but watch it
<START> pretentious storytelling such as this always uses the same technique 1 throw <UNK> <UNK> threads around to <UNK> the audience 2 deal only in <UNK> topics such as life death and god 3 make it appear profound with scenes of life death sky etc 4 depend on an intellectually weak audience to give you the benefit of the doubt 5 and finally laugh all the way to critical acclaim br br this movie is pretentious faux <UNK> at its <UNK> not only do these filmmakers not answer any questions they're afraid to pose the questions to begin with the film is held together by <UNK> directions are raised and dropped <UNK> pop cultural references are <UNK> and <UNK> there is so little to point at that any critical stabs will miss br br critics who found an intellectual base to this movie are afraid to admit the truth they have no idea what this movie is about good news neither do the filmmakers satisfying attempts at answers to profound questions about human existence demand wit intellect poetry and genius sadly this movie demonstrates none of these traits
<START> warning i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment br br when i first started to watch this movie my expectations were it was a vampire movie that is going to be awesome considering how rodriguez and tarantino both helped make the film i began about 15 minutes into it and already my hopes for this movie were down the drain which shocked me first the story it was going with was not at all appealing in anyway possible and just flat out boring and <UNK> to the point where i just wanted to turn it off i was getting more frustrated with this movie as it dragged on but i guess i had hopes that it would get better then when it finally showed vampires it blew my mind in a very bad way i thought okay this movie started with some horrible story about these two criminals then very slowly turned into some vampire movie which i thought it was going to be from the beginning in like the last 30 minutes to add on to that they try to make the main characters all cool and awesome and mean around the end when they're just not a bunny would've been more <UNK> than these characters this movie is a horrible piece of crap from <UNK> till dawn <UNK> me and left a terrible taste in my mouth <UNK> thoughts in my head and left my body unable to move from the horrible shock that i just wasted <UNK> minutes of my life away on a horrendous film i do not understand how george clooney quentin <UNK> cheech <UNK> and danny <UNK> all being the good and honorable actors that they are could take part in this useless filth in my opinion from <UNK> till dawn is one of the worst movies ever made that i have suffered my eyes on do not see it you'll be doing a great favor
<START> all i have to say is that this movie is the bomb you are going to cry when you see this i mean this is a reminder for everyone how hard and easy it is to fall in love it reminds you of the days during your youth when you were <UNK> and everything that was bad for you was washed away with a single kiss even though i am still a teen this is how i live my life when i am with that certain someone everything that was negative in my mind was <UNK> so i give this movie a 10 for it's heartfelt message and touching plot actors josh <UNK> and chris <UNK> i also give a 10 for having a cute face
<START> as i was watching it i was getting ready to <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> critique of this film it is actually video but then i saw that someone already did i pretty much agree with him but then again it looks like a lot of effort and millions of <UNK> went into it so i guess you gotta give them some credit for trying however that being said anyone who doesn't already know the <UNK> world and that this is what they were trying to convey will probably think well i suppose that not only is it really bad but it makes absolutely no sense thank god i read part of the other review a little <UNK> maybe which revealed that this guy also did the <UNK> house which looked pretty bad judging by the dvd box so now i can avoid it and save my mind from any further exposure to such <UNK> of the brilliance of h p <UNK>
<START> don't even try to figure out the logic of this story but do ride along with 10 year old gus on the most bizarre road trip ever witnessed more weird characters and implausible situations than a twin peaks reunion nothing makes sense yet it's impossible to stop watching now where can i find that <UNK>
<START> so many literary adaptations are <UNK> there are many reasons for that but usually it is the need to cut down a complex novel to the size of a screenplay the dead is unusual it had to be as the short story itself is a tiny relatively short gem it may in fact be the finest short story in the english language in beautifully spare language it tells of the realization of gabriel <UNK> that his life and the lives of so many around him are controlled by memories of the dead even his own wife of many years loved a man now dead more than him br br to bring such a short story to the cinema was always going to be <UNK> john huston did a magnificent job he never gave in to temptation to play it up or use fancy technique to expand on the story it is simple and true with outstanding acting the only slight miss step is the use of music to <UNK> the devastating final <UNK> br br its rare indeed for a movie version of a literary masterpiece to be itself a masterpiece but i think its fair to use this term for this movie its not a <UNK> piece of film making but it is simple and pure i always think of <UNK> movies when i think of the dead its at that level of <UNK> and simplicity and deep wisdom
<START> not being the least bit familiar with the characters from the comic book series i expected this film to merely accomplish the basic introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics present a plot and end with the destruction of the main <UNK> and perhaps hint at the possibility of a sequel and that's exactly what this movie happens to deliver br br however unlike with most other comic book movies i felt that this one did it with a bit of class <UNK> a more limited audience with strong language and graphic fight scenes blade presents a very modern believable and dismal world whose little nuances effectively managed to <UNK> a sense of dread as minor as it may have been from a viewer who rarely ever becomes involved in a story unless an emotional i e sappy aspect is concerned br br yes the movie has <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> unrealistic situations such as a standard female doctor being <UNK> enough to <UNK> what no one else has been able to for several thousand years but when you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie and fight scenes with involving and exciting camera cuts and special effects such as this what else matters it may run a little long but for what it sets out to do blade stands out in sharp relief among most other movies in this genre
<START> this is a very modest very lovely movie with a great score by <UNK> and frank <UNK> with a standout number we're the couple in the castle that is totally <UNK> of the period and <UNK> back to <UNK> <UNK> just as the opening premise coming may well have inspired fred and <UNK> opening <UNK> coming in <UNK> six years later i totally agree with those posters who have noted that were the name disney <UNK> to this it would by now have achieved <UNK> status rather than have fallen into neglect it's wonderfully inventive never more so than when objects barely noticed in the <UNK> world assume a much greater significance both pro and con in the <UNK> world actually it is a classic albeit a minor one
<START> i am sitting here watching the film tango and cash it led to a discussion about other great late 80s movies the ridiculous and <UNK> connection came up br br granted i have never seen and if i still value my life i never will joshua quotes this as his movie of the year wow wow i am utterly <UNK> that this movie exists but so much more than that the fact that joshua likes this move <UNK> me to the core i think joshua is one interesting guy br br br br
<START> this movie was hilarious it occasionally went too far but isn't that what we expect from them the theater <UNK> with laughter and at all the incredibly crazy stunts it's rude crude and occasionally <UNK> intense the whole gang is back and even more out of their minds which in turn provides for some great entertainment i don't want to give anything away but the little snippets of clips going around the net are nothing compared to what comes after br br this is a great movie to go see with friends try to see it with a big crowd you will not be disappointed just don't go with anyone who can't take it see above it will not go over well you can be sure of that but that's pretty obvious in the first place if you enjoyed the first one you will <UNK> this one
<START> what i hoped for or even expected was the well known stop motion imagery and extreme slow motions extreme <UNK> and all <UNK> fish eye takes in short the art of a finding interesting visual events and b capturing them in a way the human eye is not capable of to be <UNK> so that the human eye can see the stuff that made the other hits br br i just wondered how the creation of the whole would fit the title br br having watched the movie i got the feeling that the focus in this third part was on the message and not on the <UNK> that's fine especially since the message is so valid but i already knew the message and it appeared there was nothing else left for me more then half the film was or <UNK> or or transformed through some other <UNK> it looked a lot like the effects your video camera does but you never use a lot of the images would have been <UNK> without the <UNK> like the <UNK> and <UNK> chase you could say that or whatever human based <UNK> source <UNK> our beautiful <UNK> but why use these seventies effects to <UNK> that at the point that there had been more than 10 minutes in a row of this cheap looking effect i was ready to leave the hope that the rest just couldn't be that bad made me stay but then there was the slow motion slow motion is good because it gives you time to analyze the moving picture but if there are no more than 24 or maybe 50 or 60 frames a second then there's just not enough motion to slow down please record the motion to be <UNK> faster like was done with the beautiful shots of the <UNK> and <UNK> water some of the laughing people and the <UNK> song singing soldiers i acknowledge that archive pictures can't be <UNK> but i had already seen a lot of that footage anyway it could have done without it it must have been a lot of work to search through the archive footage and the effects can't have been that easy to apply and <UNK> as well on top of that a lot of the work was mixed with each other it shows that the creator wasn't out to <UNK> the movie or to spare himself but i didn't like the mixed stuff one bit the idea behind it was sometimes nice or even clever but the <UNK> was <UNK> the computer generated images didn't bother me that much however out of date the <UNK> along <UNK> in the first part of the film looked more recent and were nice is always fun the mountain was less i was pleased to hear a <UNK> playing a major role in the music a little less <UNK> at certain moments would have been appropriate with <UNK> music but that's a matter of taste as is all of the above of course i do hope that there will be another story to tell soon where computer imagery will have a less significant role and that will inspire somebody to get into the field again br br
<START> god i never felt so insulted in my whole life than with this crap there are so many ways to describe this piece of crap that i think that if i said everything that came to mind i would get banned by this site br br how do i begin well for one it doesn't take knowledge of the original series to know that this movie is a slap to the face of people who've seen it the biggest <UNK> of a theme song ever made is here from a metal version to a freaking rap version what were they thinking how does underdog and a electronic heavy musical style match the story is so basic that i will do something i don't usually do and not even give a summary just think this a dog gets <UNK> fill in the rest that's how predictable this movie is and then comes the jokes please kill me now this style of humor that might not even get the kids laughing it's that bad well expect that punch line after the <UNK> that was slightly funny br br but what surprises me the most is why jason lee ny name is earl patrick <UNK> <UNK> new groove and jim belushi according to jim are all here in the shows movies i mentioned the actors in my opinion do a good job and <UNK> lee are the best actors in this movie but that says very little the rest deserve golden nominations for this crap i am very sad to see such good actors buried by this disaster br br all in all this is just as bad as which i reviewed as well and again my head would explode if i saw anything worse than this
<START> i rented this film out of the local video store one day you know the kind of movie with box art that just reaches out and tells you to <UNK> well if you see this dull film in your video store walk on by fight the urge rent a porno because this film is despite the interesting opening the film <UNK> into repetitive murders and a <UNK> cop stumbling around dealing with the usual problems wife bastard of a boss etc wondering if the fast forward function on your vcr works rent this film and put your concerns to the test
<START> this was a flick doomed from its conception the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg 13 film and make a complete non sequel while changing its tone to a pg rated family movie i wasn't the least bit interested then came the trailer not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and i'm not <UNK> every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer it's like a 3 minute <UNK> notes version of the flick so obviously i wasn't gonna pay to see it but once it hit dvd i thought sure i'll watch it for free maybe steve carell can save it br br nope br br i'm still <UNK> as to why he signed on for this he must have <UNK> someone a favor the jokes were all so flat and obvious and the director obviously asked him to go for very broad comedy style like the original bruce jim carrey but it's just not funny the studio obviously tried to cash in on the success of 40 year old virgin complete with several of <UNK> past co stars a reference to the flick on a theater <UNK> and another musical closing credits sequence but even the talented <UNK> can't save this his co stars don't fare much better with people like morgan freeman <UNK> hill and ed <UNK> just wasted <UNK> sykes isn't wasted she's just a waste in anything she does and her horrible one liners and reactions just make you wish people would stop giving her work br br the story itself is just predictable and lazy it pounds you over the head with obvious <UNK> like <UNK> disregard for the environment drives a gas <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to use wood from <UNK> trees for his house hates animals and by the end it's just over the top preachy on both faith and the environment br br why the movie was made at all is puzzling enough but i really don't understand how it reportedly became the most expensive comedy ever the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the <UNK> of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue green screen work i've ever seen maybe the rental of the live animals on set cost a fortune who knows but whatever it was that cost them so much it didn't translate to quality that's for sure but hey it wasn't the worst film of the year by far there's still plenty of worse <UNK> like <UNK> and death proof
<START> do not see mr <UNK> it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen leslie <UNK> was not funny in it he has not been funny since the naked gun movies well it won't take long to figure out that this is not a naked gun movie the movie's plot is ridiculously foolish nothing in the entire movie was funny the first few minutes of the film were animated to look like the old <UNK> cartoons i wish the movie would have stayed that way
<START> within the first 5 minutes of this movie i knew i was in for one of those pick at the faults kinda movie the acting was terrible the script was even worse who ever let these people write write such crap for a movie need to be feed the themselves with russian <UNK> posing as u s air force <UNK> and <UNK> that can miraculously shoot 50 60 rounds rapid fire without <UNK> is poor detail to any story in one scene <UNK> are killing special forces troops at night while in another they are explaining how the and <UNK> are cold blooded and don't come out night also with fantastic special effects available in today's movie industry they were only average even for this low budget movie br br all that being said i did watch it to the end curious as to what other wonders bad film making could produce shame shame shame for producing such <UNK> br br this movie should have been left on the cutting room floor
<START> because while i thoroughly enjoyed this film it seems from other user comments that i'm in the minority maybe not one for the <UNK> <UNK> there are some wonderful scenes here particularly the <UNK> and the great life adventure story originally portrayed go see for yourself
<START> this can hardly be called a good movie actually it's not even close but i have to say that there was a few things that made me not laugh not giggle but something like that the dogs parody was one of them the rest are not important enough to be remembered br br to be honest i was a little disappointed by this movie the plot sounded like an idea but it quickly fell to the ground the whole thing was just to messy and the actors where not good for the characters most of them simply <UNK> there was also a whole lot of sequences that was a total waste of film i do realize that it would make the movie about 20 min shorter but it would only make it better br br now with the good and the bad things <UNK> up let's go to the conclusion two out of six toilet seats up for this one
<START> the c class cast and poorly <UNK> scenes complete with terrible acting have led me too believe this would make a good tv only release such as the fx presentation of a <UNK> <UNK> at my local blockbuster however about 9 copies are held on the shelves none of which were checked out when i rented the title i wonder why anyway this title was almost ridiculous in the fear factor the director was going for the whole death count on the bottom of the screen completely <UNK> the plot at times such as when the <UNK> was going over <UNK> and the <UNK> was <UNK> at a <UNK> pace from 23 million to 24 however as the movie ends possibly several hours or even a day or so after the <UNK> has landed the death <UNK> counter is <UNK> back too what it was at the moment the <UNK> was approaching the area the movies end left a huge whole in <UNK> entire plot and god knows nobody is waiting for the sequel anyway do not rent this i only advise watching this if you have <UNK> the title with no <UNK> loss and you are in the mood for a cheesy suspense movie
<START> as a kid i never understood why anyone would watch this very crappy show it was pretty stupid and i always wanted and jim jim to get in some sort of fatal accident they were that annoying br br now almost 40 years later i have a new attitude about the cartoon while i still think it was complete crap this is only in regard to the american version of the show that's because i was reading a book about anime and found out that the shows we watched growing up were completely different from those originally shown in japan you see the idiots in charge of the series thought it was too violent so they cut this out of the episodes that's bad enough but what else they did is beyond belief they actually chopped the episodes apart and spliced them together to create shows that were nothing like the originals for example one episode might be made up of parts of episodes 3 6 18 and 27 as a result i really don't know if the original show really was bad it might have been brilliant but who can tell considering all we have to watch is this <UNK> mess
<START> i like the star wars series i like a good <UNK> sci fi flick every once in a while too heck i even like the roger corman produced <UNK> and dime br br i do not like the ice pirates though br br for one it just looks too cheap you know for a movie that's supposed to take place in outer space it feels <UNK> and closed in like it's being filmed in the front seat of someone's and the special effects while appropriately cheesy look more than anything like <UNK> rubber painted <UNK> gray br br usually i don't let things like that bother me especially if the story and the characters are worthwhile br br they ain't br br the whole storyline about these <UNK> do well space pirates who decide to find a planet loaded with ice they can melt down and sell as water a hot <UNK> in the future i guess is about as original as the jokes which is not a compliment br br the humor comes in at about <UNK> level like that <UNK> machine you'll see early on and everyone seems to have a <UNK> attitude and who told john that he was funny whoever did shame on them good old robert <UNK> tries but he's a reliable actor on board a badly sinking ship or starship in this case br br i watched this one about three times and ended up feeling the same way every time br br no stars in spite of of the presence of huston one year prior to <UNK> honor and carradine at the tail end of a once <UNK> career these pirates should walk the <UNK>
<START> i loved the great lighting and was <UNK> by this story of american working class society and life in the first half of the 20th century i was drawn in by the timeless <UNK> of this realistic performance see and feel the star power <UNK> greek comedy anybody in the mood for a shot with a beer back or a little ginger hey <UNK>
<START> <UNK> tale of paris the <UNK> a <UNK> girl and the <UNK> <UNK> a more subdued but highly entertaining version of the opening of the <UNK> <UNK> jean <UNK> gives his usual excellent performance the technicolor photography on the print i saw was exquisite an easy <UNK> viewing chris w
<START> being a huge fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this film i was eagerly <UNK> a laugh a minute roller coaster ride alas br br where to start on this mess i think its a good start to say that its hardly <UNK> and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funny i was still waiting for the first laugh after a good 20 minutes of viewing many aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they <UNK> and decided to leave out of the final cut br br the overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and <UNK> which i suppose is good if they want to portray the guest house the 2 <UNK> attempt to run but to me its just puts an even higher on a sorry state of filming that should never have been created br br the acting at times is pathetic <UNK> is wasted as the loony mrs and i've seen simon pegg have much better <UNK> br br i'd recommend guest house <UNK> to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible <UNK> much more but to any bottom fan who hasn't seen this film and is expecting true <UNK> and eddie action you have been warned
<START> this film is the proof that a good actor is nothing without a good direction ed harris is awful how could you cast an actor built like rambo to play the <UNK> he shows no credibility at all and <UNK> <UNK> most of all long <UNK> doesn't look good at all on his head the main actress is missing all the subtleties needed for its character the camera shots are cheesy and too conventional the lights are to close of the characters feelings bad casting and cheap direction too bad the only scene that worth the movie is when i hope you don't care that i call him <UNK> his <UNK> is turning the girl's song to a joke any way i hope that harris could find his way back to true movie where he can really shows his <UNK> talent
<START> i first saw this movie around 1968 and if i don't see it once or twice a year i'm surprised i've always found it engrossing well acted and for hollywood surprisingly accurate historically i <UNK> give it 10 stars and recommend it highly
<START> i didn't hate this one i just couldn't adapt to the story it didn't really grab me michael mann is a very good director but i have to disagree with his methods in this i'm also a fan of daniel day lewis some projects he's been in are pretty rubbish but his acting is brilliant my favourite daniel day lewis films are there will be blood and gangs of new york br br there is one thing i loved about this and that was the musical score it gave the film a lot of atmosphere thats about all i liked in it though this film has a high vote as well which is a bit random i can see that a fair few people will like this but not enough to make the overall rating 7 8 br br i would give this film a miss if i was you but there is a lot of high votes for this so i guess you should watch it and make your own views on what you think i didn't really like it 4 10 j d <UNK>
<START> when i heard disney had the rights to underdog i figured at the very least it would be a cool pixar <UNK> affair and we'd get a great adults kids film like the <UNK> alas i forgot how disney must dumb down classic material for today's <UNK> down youth what were they thinking underdog was a product of the 60's your prime <UNK> is in their 40's and 50's why would you it to 5 year olds it should have been done ala roger rabbit half animated half real instead we get characters like riff <UNK> a wolf <UNK> into another dog underdog can't have an energy <UNK> as we're now so <UNK> it would obviously be a <UNK> or drugs reference the only good casting was patrick <UNK> as <UNK> because he actually sorta resembles the cartoon version otherwise old school underdog fans should avoid this like the plague it is what next a live action version of the go go disguised as a re history lesson my advanced apologies if disney jumps on this
<START> the large bell in a bar <UNK> rings for last orders and the inevitable rush to <UNK> forms at the counter  do we want what we need only when it's too late or is the irony of the opening <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a more <UNK> reflection of our <UNK> on individual existence there's an endless fascination about where writer director roy wants to take us in his fourth feature you the living with fifty or so semi related vignettes strung together by a <UNK> for hyper reality its <UNK> interpretations and symbolic instances of life that <UNK> us all in this great big <UNK> <UNK> struggle the sheer simplicity of these vignettes act to the and immense of being apart of the <UNK> relationships we have with one another might <UNK> down the complexity of the human condition through harsh and fast cynicism more than he should but he also reminds us of the inherent <UNK> glory of waking up each morning to a new tomorrow when we're all aware of our own distinct forms of arrested development
<START> you know after the first few chuck norris movies i got so i could tell that a movie was produced by <UNK> <UNK> even if i tuned in in the middle without ever looking at the credits or the title what's more i could tell it was <UNK> <UNK> within a minute of screen time something about the story structure the goofy relationships between the characters the mannered dialog the wooden acting <UNK> with the occasional outright terrible performance the scene <UNK> and <UNK> that made albert <UNK> look like john the paper thin plots and not ready for prime time fight choreography <UNK> <UNK> has been incredibly consistent over the years in style subject matter and point of view br br what can you say it must work for them since they've produced literally dozens of movies you go to one of their productions and you know exactly what you're getting and it ain't brain food folks br br ninja 3 is another piece of in a long line of products from the g g <UNK> factory and offers the typical limited pleasures to the movie <UNK> <UNK> you've got a bad ninja <UNK> up cops and criminals and anyone else who gets in their way you've got a good ninja <UNK> to stop him you've got a <UNK> thrown into the mix so we americans can identify with him or her in this case and be <UNK> that we can still beat those <UNK> <UNK> at their own game you've got a love interest who is usually also the worst actor in the film <UNK> with the hero you've got your endless string of <UNK> <UNK> and lingering shots of men <UNK> in agony while an arrow or throwing star sticks <UNK> out of their eye neck or chest you've got your <UNK> white guy <UNK> in suits calling a ninja a <UNK> of a b and throwing a <UNK> punch only to get his ss handed to him you've got a final confrontation between the good guy and the bad guy which goes on for 20 minutes and just sort of stops like a <UNK> cartoon instead of reaching a climax or a resolution br br ninja 3 is a little different in that the plot revolves around a <UNK> female athletic type getting possessed by the bad ninja so she ends up killing a lot of the cops and criminals and <UNK> white <UNK> in suits while under his spell but all the other elements are there as <UNK> in their way as a <UNK> play or a drama br br i actually thought <UNK> <UNK> was pretty likable in this film she's nicely <UNK> and <UNK> has great <UNK> and some athletic to her movements and you can actually suspend belief enough to accept that her character could do some of the <UNK> she pulls off in the movie she can almost but not quite carry this thing one extra start for her participation and good energy br br naturally sho <UNK> is in here and he pretty much <UNK> the last 10 15 minutes of the movie and just to show you how 3rd rate and uninspired g g movies are the director and editor inter cut the last climactic fight between <UNK> and the bad ninja scene with numerous reaction shots of <UNK> and her boyfriend watching the life and death battle with an expression of mild <UNK> i'm serious for all the emotion and reaction they show to the proceedings they could be looking at a sea turtle in an <UNK> at i can only imagine how <UNK> must have felt when she saw the finished product she probably wanted to run the editor through with a <UNK> for real because those reaction shots make her look like a complete idiot br br an enjoyable waste of time but it definitely is a waste of time maybe if you are a sho <UNK> fan or even a linda <UNK> fan you'd find it worth your while
<START> this movie is very scary with scenes where the devil uses horn to open heaven and pull the good angel dogs out and them on the devil sings and dances to a few songs about the <UNK> of being bad and at one point eats a live rat br br we got this movie free with a pizza you get what you pay for
<START> on my continuing quest to find the worst movie of all time my friends and i stumbled upon this little gem it is hilarious through and through especially if you don't know like we didn't that it's a semi sequel to another horror series br br i won't bother going into the plot except to mention that everyone complains about the horrible <UNK> that was coming it was equivalent to the characters just screaming <UNK> at the camera and waving their arms and in some odd twist of fate the snow storm ever occurs budget problems i guess br br add that to a magical front door that is opened or closed depending on what scare effect the director wants to create and the electricity being cut off until the gym teacher decides to take a shower with lots of soap i'll admit it i had trouble breathing at points br br the only actual decent part of this movie as it turns out was from the original <UNK> party massacre movie it's so much funnier now that i know that br br spoiler the end where it is revealed that the slasher did it because her drunk friends stumbled in on her and a female friend making out and then the friend driving into a train or something is probably the funniest psycho killer origin ever <UNK> by the fabulous use of <UNK> and stock footage i'm glad all of the friends forgot the incident completely until a flashback was necessary br br run don't walk to pick this up and see the hilarity of course the continuity editor should be given an award for all of this if only they weren't stuck in that horrible snow storm
<START> in a film as successful as this it is difficult to single out any one factor all <UNK> work in perfect union to create on of the most moving human dramas ever put on film br br the production is a tribute to the ensemble efforts of the writers producer cast and crew to name but a few the magnificent score of hugo is a <UNK> marvel the subtle yet striking photography of greg and the unbelievably effective direction by william <UNK> all combine with an ideal cast to create an american classic br br the dvd format version is a special treat to view what a pleasure to see the best years of our lives so beautifully <UNK> for generations to come to enjoy
<START> i should've realised it was a sign of things to come when the trailer for this film bored me br br having watched several indie films on the strength of the reviews on here and subsequently finding that my view is completely opposite to those other reviewers i began wondering if it's possible i am watching completely different films from these people or are they perhaps friends family etc of the film makers trying to <UNK> <UNK> their work hmmm br br are you interested in seeing an homage to pulp fiction and 11 14 except done with worse actors a silly score <UNK> various scenes and unbelievable jumps in logic if not then skip this film br br here is my open letter to two of the players in this film br br <UNK> morgan please please please stop trying to <UNK> samuel l a la pulp fiction no one can do what he does as well as he does br br director please come up with something original it does you a <UNK> to <UNK> out this stuff pretending to be quentin tarantino br br simply dire and i really cannot see how anyone could say this is a good film it is a disgrace that people have somehow managed to put a score of 8 5 on this the same as films like pulp fiction or <UNK> it is no where near these movies a 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average rating i give it a 3
<START> casper van <UNK> what can i say i enjoy the guy his movies bring a certain flair to them that is actually not brought on by the director or producer but by him recycled plots check rip offs of better movies check wooden acting check it's not that van <UNK> is a bad actor he has been effective in hollywood <UNK> as starship troopers and sleepy hollow he just really has not been offered a script worthy of his talents and yes he does have acting talent other than being eye candy this movie offers a slight hint of what van <UNK> can offer but is <UNK> down by the production of it all the script can be better developed see oliver <UNK> u turn the directing can be better <UNK> see robert from <UNK> <UNK> dawn the <UNK> could've made the desert more exotic see russ <UNK> faster <UNK> faster kill this script is weak because this is something we have seen before many other times so the double triple crosses are expected the direction is weak because it is not offering anything new and <UNK> many of the weak script moments the cinematography at times paints a lovely <UNK> desert flavor to it but at other times it doesn't take advantage of the <UNK> light and the beginning sequence is horrible in blue br br now to the acting van <UNK> shows some grace and charisma to his jake he neither gets too <UNK> nor too campy in his role a nice balance especially since the rest of the cast seems too distracted as to how they should be acting in this film bad script or bad direction you make your opinion the only other person worth mentioning is bryan <UNK> villain as it provides the only real credit for acting in this film aspiring actors forget trying to learn how to act in green screen try learning how to act in a horrendous script and take notes on bryan brown in this film he adds extra depth to his role and is a nice counter part to van character jake always seem to either be one step ahead or control of any situation whether if it is out of his control the femme fatale is weak this is a desert noir after all and is another nail in this film's coffin you decide script or direction the character should've been <UNK> forward in the movie instead of being pushed into the back ground later on to make room for the real femme fatale so watch the film for van <UNK> and brown and for fun try to skip a rock across the plot holes laced within the film
<START> the plot has something about white hunters captured by a tribe of white women in the african jungle <UNK> its a turkey and the some what it really is is wildly <UNK> footage from early sound and silent films mixed with badly shot recent to the release footage of men on a <UNK> there are scenes of a man in a gorilla suit south <UNK> natives at sea used to represent people in the middle of africa women in <UNK> horrible narration and a guy in a <UNK> cloth with make up all over his body <UNK> <UNK> i think so this is a movie to sit and make fun of but only with lots of alcoholic drinks and witty friends at any other time this is going to be a chore to get through its a bad bad bad movie beyond that i'm speechless
<START> one type of western i greatly enjoy is when the apparently weak which is reluctant to fight and answer the challenge of the strong finally decides there is no other way there is a great moment in this film when john <UNK> glenn ford goes into the saloon and decides to stand up to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it is the type of scene that makes the audience applaud in my opinion the violent men is a great western i would rank it among the best it makes great use of the wide screen a spectacular scenery of the mountains the women have a crucial part caroline may is engaged to <UNK> but you feel that she is only using him as a means of getting out of there and moving east she wants him to sell the ranch no matter what price martha barbara <UNK> is tired of helping her crippled husband lee edward g robinson but she will do anything to have an always bigger ranch and more power meanwhile she is <UNK> her husband with his brother brian keith her daughter <UNK> diane foster is seeing all that happens but feeling <UNK> to react because she does not want to hurt her father <UNK> <UNK> all the small <UNK> and uses the <UNK> he learned in the army to go against the anchor ranch like he had warned lee don't make me fight because you won't like my way of fighting
<START> the death of a performer at a broadway stage play brings a theatre critic and a police detective together as an unlikely crime solving duo the dead <UNK> niece becomes not only the object of affection for our critic but also a prime suspect in this death and some other murders that occur at the theatre 'the phantom <UNK> sets his sights upon the young woman as his next victim so it is a race against time for our heroes to catch the killer according to the dvd <UNK> synopsis br br <UNK> screenplay puts a little spark in this low budget mystery <UNK> <UNK> dave o'brien as anthony tony <UNK> does well in the lead role his skills as an actor appear to be much greater than the productions <UNK> him o'brien and cab driving sidekick frank <UNK> as <UNK> romeo would have made a fine 1950s tv detective team leading lady kay <UNK> as <UNK> moore and the supporting cast are also good unfortunately the story becomes meandering and anti climactic br br the phantom of <UNK> street 5 2 45 albert herman dave o'brien kay <UNK> frank <UNK>
<START> 'a comedy of biblical proportions ' those masters of <UNK> the movie tag line writers at it again the sequel to <UNK> bruce almighty raises barely a chuckle the only thing which raises my interest in this movie above total indifference is its <UNK> christian undertones sorry make that overtones br br steve <UNK> ignoring jim <UNK> good sense to decline a role plays <UNK> <UNK> the smug news anchor from bruce almighty who has just been elected to <UNK> with a new life in virginia and the stress of moving into a house the size of the <UNK> the pressure of all the change takes its <UNK> on his family his wife lauren graham evidently <UNK> in from <UNK> and three sons jimmy bennett graham phillips and johnny simmons who do a stilted job of looking sad to a piano <UNK> pray for the family to become closer and almost out of guilt so does <UNK> br br in what must be the greatest shock of all time god morgan freeman actually shows up but does the whole <UNK> <UNK> in mysterious thing all over the place by telling <UNK> to build a <UNK> esquire <UNK> in <UNK> for a great <UNK> instead of just giving him a pool table or and x box or something and in true mischievous <UNK> style he also forces <UNK> to grow a beard long hair and wear worn and <UNK> <UNK> now back in the day i'm sure <UNK> were hard to come by so the beard was somewhat of an <UNK> for <UNK> but i'm almost certain it had nothing to do with <UNK> same with the <UNK> a massive construction job is surely made all the more difficult by such <UNK> clothing couldn't god have <UNK> up a pair of steel <UNK> boots and a hard hat for the poor guy apparently not br br to <UNK> bill <UNK> i find the idea that god is messing with us somewhat unsettling and so does <UNK> who fights him every step of the way and who wouldn't god essentially gets him fired drives away his loved ones makes him a laughing stock and at one point actually threatens him of course god turns out to be right and the rational hard working family man who was getting on fine by himself is forced to eat a large slice of bittersweet humble pie it's almost as if to be left alone by god <UNK> had to tolerate and humour him what kind of message is that br br <UNK> almighty does have a highly commendable <UNK> <UNK> with the underlying theme being that the federal government is blind to the damage being done to the world around us it is also the first film ever to <UNK> its <UNK> and this should surely be considered a landmark achievement by a hollywood studio were it not for the trite condescending <UNK> of american christianity flying high above it <UNK> almighty could have been an <UNK> family movie with a <UNK> <UNK> record but with its confused religious dogma and relentless <UNK> message it ranks as one of the most <UNK> movies of all time
<START> this series is formulaic and boring the episodes are the same thing every week simply with slightly varied settings some purely evil character does some <UNK> deed walker goes after him and it ends in a karate match the villains are super cliché super stereotypical evil villains the good guys are all pure honest and <UNK> and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic after about 2 episodes the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least <UNK> fans certainly not <UNK> best work his other work may be cliché but it usually does not drag on for weeks if you enjoy formulaic boring repetitive clichéd <UNK> <UNK> then this is for you
<START> hmmm not a <UNK> on the original from shaw brothers the fighting is average and looks very clunky the story line is as to be expected from a 70's kung fu film confusing and <UNK> stupid voices for women dubbed in posh english accents for men i turned this off early and i love martial arts flicks get the original its so much better than this average movie don't be fooled i bought the wrong flick what i wanted was the shaw brothers movie i have just started commenting i'm only doing foreign and martial arts films this is just the beginning of my movie collection i personally own most modern martial arts flicks hope you don't waste time watching this one its for die hard fans of 70's kung fu only
<START> i go to blockbuster pick out a random movie got this and yeah br br this was a good sexual porno the quality kind of sucked and it kind of gave me a damn headache to me this movie was good for its sexual things but not as much for the horror and suspense it was magical br br the suspense not as good as i would have expected i wanted to be at the edge of my seat hoping to jump up in fear but instead i lay down on the couch and didn't see much br br the quality not really good at all i mean if you pay close attention during when the people are on the cold mountains their barely wearing anything it doesn't make much sense too br br so if your looking for a crap not really suspenseful and a pretty much sexual movie you've got this
<START> so unfortunately me and my mate watched this it was showing on a sky channel over here called zone horror which basically shows crappy b movie horror films 24 7 it was a boring friday night so decided to have a laugh and give this one a look apart from the atrocious acting the awful plot the dire effects the shoddy camera work and the brain numbing <UNK> of it all it was ok lol in all seriousness it was quite a laugh picking holes in it and laughing at the goofy actors there is a bit of semi nudity which <UNK> the movie up a bit unfortunately it was the who got topless as my mate calls her <UNK> if you're bored one evening and this happens to be playing take a chance you just might like it
<START> you have loved the <UNK> redemption pulp fiction vertigo <UNK> and i guarantee you will love this one more its a brilliant thriller the story is so simple yet so gripping it keeps you at the edge of your seat till the end the slow moving scenes simple music adds more perfection to the movie its so genuine the performance is top class the direction the sequences they are too perfect if i could i would place it in top 10 thrillers ever made most entertaining thriller i have seen in a while my vote help me move this movie to top 250 br br you will love it
<START> this is another good western which i enjoyed it's not an epic or anything but it is good for what it is <UNK> about 3 fur led by a men named jed who is crude and <UNK> jed and his two friends find themselves as <UNK> for a <UNK> that is the only thing standing between them and and indian band who <UNK> the americans on their land and want to take it back that's the <UNK> of the story what follows is action excitement even a bit of humour and forbidden romance one of <UNK> friends gus reminded me a lot of the character <UNK> played by robert shaw in the movie jaws they both have that <UNK> gruff demeanor anyway if you're a western fan you should find lots to like about this particular entry i think it deserves a 7 10
<START> beautiful coming of age romance about an english boy and french girl who run off and grow up br br i saw this movie as a teenager and loved it i saw it again this year and loved again br br
<START> william shakespeare's the <UNK> of <UNK> is about a jewish and his bond to <UNK> a pound of flesh from the wealthy <UNK> antonio the of a debt the jewish of course is <UNK> and he is given such a <UNK> performance by al pacino that even outstanding actors like jeremy <UNK> joseph <UNK> and <UNK> collins fade into the background the film is set in <UNK> century <UNK> and director michael <UNK> relies on setting mood and realism to tell its story <UNK> lavish period costumes or a modern setting with rock music to appeal to a wider audience br br <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> three hour length to a <UNK> two hours and eight minutes and also provides some historical background in the opening narration he tells us how jews came to england were subject to increasing <UNK> and eventually <UNK> from england they were forbidden to own property could make <UNK> only by <UNK> money at interest and were forced to live in a <UNK> a <UNK> of darker events to come in the film the <UNK> antonio jeremy <UNK> <UNK> upon <UNK> in public yet feels no shame in going to the <UNK> to borrow 3000 to help his friend and suggested lover joseph <UNK> to properly court <UNK> collins a wealthy <UNK> though <UNK> has been insulted by antonio he agrees to <UNK> the money without interest for three months on the condition that of the bond <UNK> him the right to exact a pound of flesh from <UNK> heart br br the play is primarily a drama of hatred and revenge but like many of shakespeare's works there are touches of broad comedy as well here the comedy involves three <UNK> of lovers and friend and and <UNK> another friend of and jessica daughter has offered herself to the person who can pick the right treasure from one of three boxes made of gold silver and lead the prince of <UNK> chooses the one of gold the prince of <UNK> the one of silver and both are disappointed however loves her for herself and opens the <UNK> <UNK> to find the portrait within adaptation conveys a remarkable feeling for time and place <UNK> at <UNK> suggests one of those splendid summer homes complete with <UNK> gardens and art <UNK> hanging in every room and <UNK> well with the <UNK> look of city with its <UNK> <UNK> br br when it becomes clear that antonio cannot <UNK> the debt returns to <UNK> leaving behind when he arrives the <UNK> is in <UNK> and <UNK> is demanding his pound of flesh even when backed by wealth offers many times the amount in <UNK> is intent on revenge not only for the loss of the money but for a lifetime of <UNK> status the duke who sits in judgment will not <UNK> as enters in the <UNK> as a lawyer to defend antonio it is here that the film reaches its dramatic heights as all parties come to court to achieve a final resolution br br the <UNK> of <UNK> is not only about an <UNK> debt but also about the <UNK> of jews from christian society and their desire for <UNK> it has been one of shakespeare's most controversial plays and <UNK> have <UNK> for a long time whether it is an anti <UNK> play or simply a play about anti <UNK> that reflects the prevalent view of christian society in <UNK> england although <UNK> is definitely a caricature he is an ambiguous figure and there are many <UNK> that shakespeare views his flaws as human <UNK> not jewish ones the duke <UNK> that he is simply a man who has failed to <UNK> to the compassionate language of the <UNK> br br in the monologue i am a jew <UNK> not a jew eyes <UNK> you <UNK> us do we not bleed if you <UNK> us do we not laugh if you poison us do we not die and if you wrong us shall we not revenge <UNK> shows a universal humanity expressing the <UNK> of all men though we are horrified at the sentence he wishes to carry out we can feel his pain <UNK> over the years <UNK> performance brings new <UNK> to the text and his often over the top persona is replaced with a <UNK> more understated demeanor that brings understanding to his cause during a toronto international film festival interview last september <UNK> said about pacino you work with a brilliant actor you have a great machine it's a bit like driving a powerful car you have to dare to do it he has <UNK> and we are all the <UNK>
<START> rarely does one find a movie so bad that it achieves the often sought <UNK> of having so little redeeming value that that alone makes it worth watching <UNK> i am happy to report is such a film br br i knew i was in for something good as soon as i found the <UNK> i am at least its fourth owner it has a used movie sale 9 95 <UNK> on the front and a yard sale <UNK> for one dollar i picked it up at a <UNK> store for fifty cents br br the used movie sale <UNK> covers much of the front cover artwork meaning that what i see is a truly odd <UNK> still of the front of the <UNK> super bike a car flipping over on fire and heather thomas wearing eighties hair with her mouth open in an expression that says i a <UNK> i saw that and thought all right the case honestly was enough with nowhere to turn and no one to trust <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> into a <UNK> of danger and <UNK> but i surprised myself by actually getting around to watching it i always make time for the really bad films that fight club tape can wait br br meet <UNK> <UNK> is a stunningly well crafted character as we can tell from her introduction in which she and her friend do <UNK> that highlight her breasts and later her then <UNK> goes off to hook up with her boyfriend for the evening that goes horribly wrong before she knows it <UNK> is driven straight into a web of deadly double crosses in <UNK> the vhs box tells it like it is br br left out of the box summary perhaps out of some faint hope that actual copies of this film would be sold is how awful the acting is it might have been just me but i kept thinking i could read the characters' thoughts through their eyes this is dumb thinks heather thomas i know thinks bad guy with too wide mouth br br a driving force no pun intended for the second half of this epic picture are the car chases those were actually pretty good although i'm inclined that <UNK> doesn't need <UNK> on how to explode what really impressed me is that in all the chases the streets were pretty much empty it's like there are only twenty people in this huge city br br i know what you're thinking you're thinking gee i have to see this movie the sad thing though is that you can't find it oh no <UNK> is a film that finds you just wait some day perhaps during lunch perhaps late in the evening perhaps when military scientist <UNK> combs <UNK> is murdered by hired <UNK> you will hear the <UNK> of and know that it is time
<START> roger <UNK> isn't the worst director and he did a good job on the underrated sci fi thriller the sixth day a k a the box office downfall of mr <UNK> however air america has to be one of his most inept projects br br it comes across as an <UNK> between drama comedy and war film it's not a very convincing mix in fact i found it to be overbearing br br robert downey jr during his <UNK> stars as a pilot <UNK> into a top secret cia organization operating during in the vietnam era mel gibson plays his co pilot and he stumbles upon the knowledge that they're <UNK> drugs and what not br br the movie was hyped on release because it starred two famous faces and had re recorded the doors classic love me two times for the soundtrack br br the <UNK> of the song is pretty poor which suits the film
<START> if like me you <UNK> seek out the <UNK> and <UNK> and often most awful that world cinema has to offer then you should look no further than the supernatural horror <UNK> of hong kong in the early 80s often mixing bizarre black magic with kung fu and silly comedy and usually packed with plenty of creepy snakes worms <UNK> etc these movies are about as bizarre as it gets br br is definitely a case in point featuring a mountain tribe whose women keep their men from <UNK> by casting nasty spells over them that should they leave cause them to fill up with <UNK> creatures and die an <UNK> death some so so martial arts and lots of real life animal killing much of which is <UNK> by a geek who has absolutely no bearing on the story this film is just plain strange br br a prolonged scene in which the <UNK> hunt for snakes and insects casually throwing the creatures into the <UNK> on their backs is quite fascinating a <UNK> feast that sees a poor <UNK> <UNK> on the head and then torn apart is totally disgusting and the moments that show worms <UNK> in open wounds and being <UNK> onto the floor will have the <UNK> losing their <UNK> for a while br br however it's the live animal <UNK> that really qualifies for legendary status amongst fans of out there movie making it's thoroughly vile to watch and yet strangely compelling the geek <UNK> on a snake down a fat <UNK> <UNK> nasty and <UNK> <UNK> a mouse biting off its head and then <UNK> the rest in afterwards br br not a great movie hell it's not really even a mediocre movie is recommended only to people who think they've seen it all this one gets 4 out of 10 from me which is probably more than it deserves but i <UNK> respect it for being able to make me feel slightly ill
<START> i saw this film as a sneak preview before the <UNK> opening at the film festival your reaction to it will largely depend on your attitude about <UNK> the text of shakespeare on the plus side pacino gives a very good performance indeed as <UNK> <UNK> collins is a fine and the film has a <UNK> look br br the <UNK> are predictable the <UNK> of <UNK> is arguably the most difficult of all of shakespeare's plays to stage today largely because we look at it through the <UNK> lens of 20th century history the romantic plot with and presents no problem the character of <UNK> does because we lack the original frame of reference of the <UNK> audience <UNK> is simultaneously a human character with human qualities and motivations and an <UNK> of the <UNK> quality of the old law when he says <UNK> not a jew eyes he is a character when he <UNK> i will have my bond he is an <UNK> the long passage on music and <UNK> harmony in the final scene here moved and cut to <UNK> is the key to the play in that it re <UNK> universal harmony after the <UNK> and evil the <UNK> of the trial scene forces are <UNK> it is possible to make psychological sense of the character of <UNK> by showing his gradually going mad and turning into a by the time the trial scene rolls around the key is that at a point he must <UNK> being sympathetic br br <UNK> performance almost does it but not quite the film can't quite make up its mind on the one hand there is the right movement in the character of <UNK> and on the other there is a great deal of <UNK> footage of jews being abused and <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> no doubt to show the <UNK> of antonio et al shakespeare was not writing an <UNK> like social drama he was writing a comedy following the classic pattern of <UNK> of social order and the <UNK> of social order <UNK> by marriage with a theme of love versus law at the center of the <UNK> plot br br in this sense the film is a travesty surgery on the play and direction almost force us away from what the play really means taking the beginning of the final scene cutting most of it and moving it before the trial scene is the most extreme example there are some other significant difficulties jeremy <UNK> a fine actor plays antonio as if he were <UNK> on <UNK> joseph <UNK> is pretty but shallow as most of the actors with the exceptions of collins pacino and the actor playing the duke in the trial scene <UNK> their dialogue br br final verdict a pretty film with a few decent performances it's not shakespeare it's poor interpretation not really worth your time or money although <UNK> collins as almost <UNK> it
<START> my wife rented this movie and then conveniently never got to see it if i ever want to torture her i will make her watch this movie i've watched many movies with my 4 year old and i can take almost anything barney is refreshing after a shot of <UNK> br br the plot dialog cinematography acting were one step above or equal to a cheap porn film i feel cheated out of 3 <UNK> that we paid to rent it and then 90 minutes of my life i will never get back i will say my 4 year old liked it luckily it was a rental we had to return right away br br i just hope that the younger actor's careers are not ruined from being in this movie
<START> i wanted to like this movie i really really did i was so excited when i saw the preview which scared the hell out of me but when i saw the actual film i was disappointed the acting is stilted and the attempts at comedy are woefully out of place and forced and i'm sorry but a boy being chased by a turd in a is not funny or scary it's just stupid i grew up on the bell witch legend so i know quite a bit about it a lot of facts in the movie are right on target but this film should have been much better the entire birthday party scene for example lasts about fifteen minutes adds nothing to the plot or the story and should have been left on the cutting room floor a more heavy handed editor might have been able to get a decent film out of this mess br br please understand i'm not in any way shape or form involved with the other bell witch movie and i'm not trying to attack this imdb listing i'm just telling it like it is
<START> i'll <UNK> my review by stating that i am not a fan of the independent <UNK> to <UNK> genre that owes a great debt to the <UNK> films of the 60's i don't own any i've never rented any so i might lack the appreciation for these tongue in cheek low budget <UNK> that many other people have br br i caught this movie on <UNK> late one saturday evening with a lady friend please don't ask me why i was watching <UNK> late one saturday evening with a lady friend we were bored with world championship poker some <UNK> bad acting courtesy of misty <UNK> and i wish she wouldn't own up to being from <UNK> as we actually turn out some very bright <UNK> here caught our attention now normally the aim of some good soft core porn would be to get you and your partner in the mood some good sex tongue in cheek humor and who know what could happen after about 15 minutes and a scene where the title character <UNK> a <UNK> victim my lady friend said <UNK> you want to watch the rest of this fine i am going to bed so i don't have to please turn the volume off ' here is what i gather from the plot <UNK> character is a <UNK> nerd who gets bitten by a spider and turns into a super sex <UNK> with super web <UNK> powers that don't come from her <UNK> there is some sort of evil <UNK> involved who didn't look particularly evil or sexy <UNK> saves the day has sex m j who is male in this film constantly gets <UNK> by <UNK> bad gay <UNK> and somehow the evil <UNK> gets pushed off a building to her death br br what was good about this film it ended br br what was bad about it acting to make a third grade <UNK> look like oscar winners a script turned out by people who i picture to be drunken college aged sex <UNK> who wouldn't know what sex is if they took a class taught by dr ruth special effects that were about as special as someone jumping off a <UNK> humor about as funny <UNK> well i have yet to encounter anything that is <UNK> the sex scenes if we were watching a video the only thing those scenes would have turned on is the fast forward button and the action scenes some of my old <UNK> games had better choreography br br now i know this type of film is supposed to be enjoyed for it's inherent badness companies like don't set out to make good movies they have a <UNK> and they target it my experience as a tells me they are right on the money in their audience but after my brief exposure to i for one can say i am not <UNK> into that world again any time soon maybe the problem with the filmmakers in this type of genre is this they spend so much attention to making the films bad that if they made an effort to try and focus on those things they do very well they would turn out some very enjoyable <UNK> cinema a la troma films in the 80's sorry folks the spirit is there but the effort isn't br br though i have to admit that alice in <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is a new <UNK> movie the graphics were really good they made the movie seem partially realistic i used to do ballet and this movie made me want to continue it this movie was kind of like a cinderella movie but a little bit different a father of 12 <UNK> gets very sick his cousin <UNK> him and wants the throne the girls find a secret magical land thanks to their dead mother's stories its up to them to save their father and society with the help of their handsome prince it was a funny movie and me and my friend had fun watching it we enjoyed it a lot and also enjoyed the indian talking parrot the music was very nice and made the movie even greater it had a great classical orchestra the voices were great and the characters were <UNK> sweet and cute i liked it so enjoy the movie its great for the family all in all i'd watch it again
<START> nurse betty has that odd but winning combination of a <UNK> <UNK> inducing plot with extraordinary characters in the same way i <UNK> <UNK> on first viewing then realized i was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow i liked nurse betty a lot more the day after i saw it hard to understand harder to explain as others have said it's quite forced in many ways but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking br br fair job by greg kinnear great work from morgan freeman although i worry that he's being stereotyped as the <UNK> villain chris rock was good but not a standout <UNK> z is so natural it's unnerving i e unnerving to be natural playing someone not well in the head also liked the sort of <UNK> <UNK> performance from allison in a small part br br don't go expecting as much of a road movie as you might assume from some <UNK> there is road but it's only barely relevant rated 8 10
<START> wow as a big fan of larry western tales and the <UNK> <UNK> series in particular i was s o o o looking forward to <UNK> moon what a tremendous letdown maybe my expectations were set too high because of the all around excellence of <UNK> <UNK> the story the characters the cinematography the music it all worked br br <UNK> moon by comparison comes across like a bad saturday night live skit the characters are completely <UNK> the dialogue is <UNK> and the plot <UNK> <UNK> all over the place it seems like the actors are all reading from <UNK> i couldn't relate to any of the characters good guys bad guys not even the incidental characters david performance stands out in particular it looks like it was <UNK> out of an <UNK> grade middle school performance i'm sorry i'd like to find something positive to say about <UNK> moon but i just can't do it there's nothing there
<START> with the <UNK> of repetitive and derivative sitcoms <UNK> fall summer winter and spring line ups it's nice to see a show that sets itself from the lot in more than one area br br takes an unusual approach it's not about the daily <UNK> of an eccentric family <UNK> nor about the other boring stuff you see everywhere in sitcoms the show is about this small time white trash thief earl who <UNK> off a <UNK> card and scores big time right at that moment took it away from him <UNK> he learns that that unusual incident was probably because of all the bad things he's been doing so he sets off on a mission to right every wrong he ever did and he's got all his deeds on a paper br br this is a brilliant premise for a sitcom thankfully it landed in the right hands the execution of the show produces extremely satisfactory results you get an innovative comedy that is genuinely funny and really touching at many times you can't help but fall in love with <UNK> sincerity and <UNK> simple mind good heart and observations on life wild flamboyant personality and <UNK> demeanor that really him to you very easily br br when you combine the show's <UNK> with its genuine humor good heart interesting characters and well written dialogue you really have a keeper with shows like this and the <UNK> the office nbc is obviously on to something did they finally free a <UNK> or two for quality <UNK> let's hope so and let's hope for more quality shows like these will <UNK> the line ups shows that'll make both us tv viewers and nbc executives stop crying over the long gone days of <UNK> golden days <UNK> seinfeld friends
<START> ok i'm 26 so i've been thru all the action heroes 80's hype and chuck norris along with seagal van damme and the rest of the guys were my childhood heroes fighting the bad guys shooting dozens of bullets from one round only i saw the <UNK> of this movie on tv a couple of days ago chuck norris was throwing some <UNK> from his fingers <UNK> <UNK> is a must see crappy movie ' i said and indeed it was only a lot lot worse it is very difficult to see all the movie stuffed with some religious thoughts ridiculous zombie like monsters who serve satan all the idea of a plot set in some forgotten community which represent whole mankind it is a load of christian wet dreams br br i've nothing against christianity even in the movies but this one lacks taste it lacks almost everything that <UNK> with a common sense c'mon chuck norris playing an angel whose job is to look after little town where satan lives the whole plot is so damn straight and boring not mentioning its silliness yes it's not stupidity anymore we're talking silliness like like a retarded child's joke make altogether terrible movie made as far as i suppose for elder people very much devoted to catholic church because young viewers laugh at almost every scene technically it's incorrect the fx are worse than the ones you've seen in early 90's in tv series the plot seems very stupid actors could be easily <UNK> to cardboard stands not mentioning the music which as far as i've heard was played on a childish toy piano i've seen a lot of movies even the worst ones the ones from the imdb bottom list like <UNK> or <UNK> hands of <UNK> but believe me nothing <UNK> to this ridiculous terrible horribly acted quasi movie which brings some <UNK> prank movies to my mind rather than regular production avoid it at all cost avoid it there's even nothing to laugh at chuck norris has officially finished his movie career
<START> working girl kitty <UNK> is engaged to bill kelly who <UNK> her by working long hours at his garage in order to save money for their marriage after being stood up on her birthday kitty goes on a double date blind date where she meets department store heir bob hamilton she falls in love but leaves him when his <UNK> of love appear to cover a desire for her to be his mistress rather than his wife faithful bill <UNK> <UNK> to comfort her and at last she gives in to his repeated <UNK> to <UNK> their engagement <UNK> in part by <UNK> support of her family after she loses her job when bob returns however convinced that he wants marriage after all will kitty follow her heart or her conscience br br this film was a lot better than i'd expected it to be the character of bill at first comes off as the sort of loud comic <UNK> type that jack carson played so often but kelly and the script <UNK> the character with real compassion and love and bill turns out to be the best person in the entire group viewers may find themselves rooting for him against the <UNK> the tone of the film <UNK> however between light hearted romance and a much darker side especially in the depiction of a dance marathon and a rather horrific accident at <UNK> garage br br the cast is rounded out by the <UNK> jane <UNK> as <UNK> mother an <UNK> but not yet thoroughly obnoxious mickey rooney as <UNK> younger brother and spencer <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> do well father
<START> wow i thought <UNK> was the most awful and embarrassing first sex movie ever but i had forgotten that germany always tries to compete in this case the well known german film producer was successful in producing even worse crap is stupid not believable and predictable and above all not funny it's almost a tragedy that so many kids went to see this in germany and i'm afraid also <UNK> br br <UNK> 19 looks too nice to have no girlfriend and too <UNK> to be 15 and his character is too dumb to be true tries real hard to make us believe that he doesn't know anything about sex but that doesn't help seems to be made by someone who watched al <UNK> and took him too seriously br br the best actors in the movie are <UNK> and <UNK> who play semi liberal parents and are stand up comedians who are not particularly talented in movie acting still their performances are the <UNK> and in comparison br br a complete failure
<START> to start this movie was sick here your wife is dying and you go <UNK> around town with this blond <UNK> by your side then your wife dies and within 2 months you are together with this <UNK> hank james <UNK> is definitely moving fast throughout this movie i called him fast hank fast hank marries this beautiful lady and before you know it she is having sex with his best friends the part that gets me is when she is doing it in the <UNK> with kevin and gets caught by another one of hanks friends kevin gets up and leaves she drops her <UNK> and <UNK> right into the arms of this other guy and they start doing it right then and there i guess he is finishing up what kevin started how gross i am like this is lifetime movie its a typical old man young woman movie that says you can have my body if i get your money
<START> 2 glass shadow stars <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with kicks a karate <UNK> who helps a cash jolie escape from her creators who look to <UNK> her and destroy a rival company along the way billy <UNK> and karen shepherd show up to the duo while jack palance is there to deliver <UNK> to the duo on the run one of the things that is quite shocking about the cyborg franchise is how the series has managed to have quite prolific and off beat actors in the cast the original had jean claude van damme and don't know her well she was in a bunch of 70's <UNK> this one has jack palance <UNK> <UNK> billy <UNK> and angelina jolie the third one has william <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> mcdowell okay so cyborg <UNK> cast isn't that impressive i've never seen cyborg 3 but i did see this on sci fi channel and must admit i wasn't impressed actually strike that cyborg 2 is an often lovely looking movie it's shot with excellent style and the visual detail make this easy on the eye however cyborg 1 was the same way indeed the movie was directed with a certain amount of style slow motion and music that made it all easy on the eye unfortunately like the first this one doesn't have any new ideas or anything resembling a plot or <UNK> most of the ideas are taken from blade runner and max <UNK> so for various reasons the movie doesn't have much to offer beyond it's look another aspect is the terrible acting karen shepherd and billy <UNK> are absolutely terrible and angelina jolie isn't much better <UNK> <UNK> and jack palance come off fine but seriously palance is playing a cyborg warrior and <UNK> is a karate <UNK> i guess on the positive side you can't <UNK> michael <UNK> of not being ambitious with casting still the movie is dull and i for one lost interest in the story fifteen minutes in also why did they tie it in with cyborg anyway it has nothing to do with it's predecessor which this manages to be worse than br br out of 4 bad
<START> for the most part michael is a disaster  ten minutes of charm and <UNK> worth of <UNK> br br travolta and <UNK> do their best frequently rising above nora <UNK> numbingly banal script but the film moves like a <UNK> and even within its fantasy context the characters behave <UNK> on a regular basis <UNK> who <UNK> let the story of a lifetime  an apparent angel living on earth  out of their sight br br someone forgot to tell romantic comedy <UNK> <UNK> that william hurt brilliant in so many other films is no tom hanks the movie's climax <UNK> the word contrived <UNK> may be shooting for heaven here but unfortunately michael is a long long ride through cinema heck
<START> other <UNK> have described this movie as classic 1950s scifi with clever use of stock footage and documentary footage and clever character interaction br br nothing could be further from the truth br br yes this is classic 1950s scifi but 1950s scifi at its most <UNK> stupid worst br br consider that the first prey is a radar station shown first from the air then on the ground but the station is from the air <UNK> as on a with snow on one side and semi <UNK> dark ground on the other side but when on the ground <UNK> visit the site it's suddenly on a flat <UNK> white plain miles from the nearest mountain br br consider also the ludicrous pseudo scientific <UNK> of the highly recommended expert who is brought in to examine a huge claw he says well we know one thing it can't have come from an animal because every known species of animal has a <UNK> <UNK> even <UNK> and birds have bones he then goes on to say that some creatures <UNK> insects do not have <UNK> <UNK> me let's define animal here not even in the 1950s could anyone over the age of six take this man as an expert in <UNK> since he clearly doesn't know what an animal is nor have the ability to name several broad categories of animals who lack <UNK> <UNK> sharks <UNK> <UNK> insects <UNK> <UNK> you get the idea the characters are cardboard <UNK> stock types scientist sidekick girlfriend big bad monster nothing here shows any sense of creativity no pulse no life signs br br <UNK> no witty dialogs the special effects are silly even for their time and the stock footage is employed with a reckless disregard for continuity this is b movie making at its dead worst with a production crew that clearly couldn't be bothered to try even br br use <UNK> as sleeping medicine or punishment for small children <UNK> easily offended by bad science
<START> this was is an incredible movie with incredible cast music singing story etc it is a tragedy that some arrogant families the or can keep it from being available to generation after generation i have wanted to see it again all of my life i just found this site and read why it has not been available shame on these families for their <UNK> my wife is from germany and she has never seen the movie neither have my step children or my <UNK> it is very sad that a movie of this depth and quality is not available for them to see where do these families get off making such a <UNK> self important <UNK> condescending decision to <UNK> generations from enjoying this film these stars these performances this music release the video and let them world judge and enjoy
<START> angels and demons 3 out of 10 clearly something bad has happened to ron howard i don't know what exactly but something has gone very wrong br br howard has always been a decent <UNK> director while he will never be mistaken for an artistic <UNK> both cinderella man and apollo 13 were excellent films <UNK> was pretty good and even angels and demons prequel sequel the da <UNK> code was a fun romp in addition none of his films have been downright awful note i have seen neither how the grinch stole christmas nor his <UNK> film <UNK> <UNK> says no to plastic whats more howard managed to hold this quality is such <UNK> genres as star driven oscar bait a beautiful mind star driven costume drama far and away star driven revenge fantasy <UNK> and comedies about prostitution and <UNK> night shift <UNK> br br angels and demons is at its center a poorly directed and shot film scenes are too dark camera angles are all wrong the actors block each others shots and the whole affair is often out of focus this makes the telling of an already confusing story even more muddled br br dan brown gets picked on a lot but i found the da <UNK> code a fun <UNK> romp so sue me the movie version of the da <UNK> code kept the same where are they going to next vibe of the book and added an attractive cast and attractive location shooting br br angels and demons however takes place in the claustrophobic confines of <UNK> city and since howard wasn't allowed to film in many of the real locations we end up with a lot of running around a cgi back lot the entire film is as if rick did a <UNK> city special and instead of actually visiting the holy city and pointing his camera rick had to use <UNK> <UNK> and a second hand art book with all the tits <UNK> br br while the da <UNK> code had what i still think is an intriguing central mystery again sue me demons and angels story consists of a plot by the roll eyes now to destroy the <UNK> their idea was to take positions in schools for the deaf around the world and <UNK> every student in the ass repeatedly <UNK> my bad apparently the <UNK> doesn't need any help on that one br br anyway their plan is to <UNK> <UNK> large kill the head priest and steal three <UNK> of anti matter this begs more than a few questions can the create anti matter can you capture the anti matter once created why is the <UNK> collecting it perhaps they fear a godzilla attack why is the head of anti matter gathering a <UNK> priest now once they get the anti matter they are going to use its incredible destructive power to take over the no just kidding unfortunately the haven't quite <UNK> that <UNK> and the brain level of sophistication just yet instead the current <UNK> has just died and it's time the top <UNK> <UNK> for the final four <UNK> <UNK> are all kidnapped and the are killing them one by one seven style they being good sports however are leaving clues at every murder like some latin themed <UNK> oh and the last kidnapped <UNK> has the anti matter and if he isn't found in time rick will have to go straight to <UNK> next year to see decent <UNK> if only there was some latin themed batman to save the okay the story is truly awful and it is poorly told but maybe this is one of those films saved by great performances a true character okay you know where this is going tom hanks gives an incredibly wooden performance and simply looks awful he is also to old to play the character by about twenty years his love interest israeli actress has zero chemistry with either hanks or the screen ewan <UNK> plays the personal assistant <UNK> boy as an irish man who looks like he is about to break into a musical number at any moment providing no one steals his lucky charms br br on the plus side <UNK> <UNK> puts in a fine turn as head of <UNK> security and as far as we know no deaf children were raped during the making of this film which puts it ahead of its <UNK> critics in at least one area
<START> i agree with who said that there is a lot going on between the lines in this film while i do think the pacing of this film could be improved i do think that the complexity of the relationships between the characters is fascinating br br examples br br pierre is going to marry his cousin even though his love for her seems very cousin y br br pierre and his stepmother have a rather curious relationship br br pierre <UNK> and seem to have a <UNK> relationship and the actual points to the triangle are not quite certain br br brother is a bit of a <UNK> or is he br br and isabelle who is she really br br overall i think it was worth my time an interesting film and one that makes me want to read <UNK>
<START> not bad performances whoopi plays the wise warm role quite well still the storyline and situations can not be believed forced pc stereotypes at times it is good jews and blacks vs the evil white christians ho hum a typical hollywood fantasy the film does have its moments but it is not one that i would recommend to go out of your way to view
<START> i lack cable vision and no longer have <UNK> so being a rural resident i have to wait for dvd releases being a lover of <UNK> but not <UNK> i of course not only have <UNK> wire but i have the complete first season i've not yet found <UNK> or a second season for i have the <UNK> <UNK> wedding dvd i have the issues of playboy that pamela denise anderson <UNK> in i could go on i love pamela there is no one or anything that could make me feel guilty about enjoying but there are certain elements that i dislike but live with for other series depict smoking and alcohol <UNK> too some times but those are my personal <UNK> and i try not to let them ruin the fun of a series like this for me i too was taken <UNK> by the change in animation style but i adapted however the amount of female nudity <UNK> and that is a big disappointment as one expects a lot of it in a series with a premise like this but then again i adapted one of my favorite episodes of <UNK> <UNK> was when they got to meet robin williams so of course one of my favorite episodes of is when pamela tommy visit the club and the comparisons begin if there really is a season 2 i hope that i can find it for as a <UNK> i need to complete my collection i recommend this for other <UNK> of the female form and lovers of <UNK> hey <UNK> blonde <UNK> are the feminine form for spelling blond your <UNK> should already know that
<START> this flick is so bad its beyond belief even for an independent low budget film it just well sucks i can't even believe even troma would put out such crap i have been a fan of some troma flicks for years toxic <UNK> squeeze play <UNK> vampire to name a few but lloyd come on this goes way beyond the boundaries of any taste it features some of the worst acting imaginable i think it would have been possible to find unemployed street people who could have been as good oh wait that is what they did i mean it these characters have negative charisma with any luck the producer and director of this film will have a huge <UNK> debt because of this atrocity as will the special effects people but beyond the terrible acting and the horrid special effects the dialogue is absolutely traumatic to the ears the script is full of plot holes the size of <UNK> and there are severe continuity problems the worst part however is that it not entertaining in even the smallest way and this is the most unforgivable sin in film making but don't take my word for it go out and waste four bucks renting it just don't say i didn't warn you
<START> the only reason this movie is not given a 1 awful vote is that the acting of both <UNK> <UNK> and robert ryan is superb <UNK> <UNK> who is lovely as usual becomes increasingly <UNK> as she tries various means to rid herself of a madman robert ryan is terrifying as the menacing stranger whose character guided only by his disturbed mind changes from one minute to the next seemingly simple and <UNK> suddenly he becomes clever and threatening ms <UNK> character was in more danger from that house she lived in and her own stupidity than by anyone who came along she could not manage to get out of her of her own house windows didn't open both front and back doors locked and <UNK> from the inside with a key you could not have designed a worse fire trap if you tried she did not take the of having even one extra key nor could she figure out how to <UNK> help from nearby neighbors or get out of her own basement while she was locked in and out of sight of her <UNK> i don't know what war her husband was killed in but if it was world war ii the <UNK> in her house the styles of the clothes especially the children and the <UNK> company car are clearly <UNK> i recommend watching this movie just to see what <UNK> you can find
<START> man were do i start everything about this cartoon from the episodes to the stories script an animation is to me the stupidest and most annoying cartoon that walt disney television animation ever created and made im so glad that both <UNK> disney 2006 and disney channel to stop airing it in the u s as of this may 2008 br br believe me it's a wise choice to skip this out cast and black cloud of a cartoon if you watch it don't say i did not alert an warn you br br your in for a boring and down right dull and confusing time i wish and pray i never even saw 1 episode of this cartoon buzz of star command if i could i would have the part of my brain removed that remembers watching it yes it is and was that bad
<START> when i saw this movie the first thing that jumped at me was the acting of kelly a young and <UNK> and coming star actress that i saw for the first time totally blew me away she is amazing on screen and i'm really looking forward to see what the future brings her br br the movie it self was good in the sense that it let kelly do her stuff and take the for a ride not much new tho i had the feeling that i had seen it all before but a good experience i would recommend this movie if only to see kelly this stage actor takes the screen by storm i give this movie a vote of 7 5 for the acting performance and 2 for the rest of the movie br br and on a last note sorry about my bad english if this is <UNK> for you p <UNK> ignore me
<START> i can't believe they do this kind of filth out of a serious theme totally unrealistic they seemed to want it to be highly realistic but all the elements are based on clichés real propaganda stuff after seeing this an addict probably just want to continue his her career i gave it 2
<START> i rented this movie the other day b c i love romance stories but this has got to be the worst one i have ever seen in my life i find it hard to believe that sam would fall in love with <UNK> after they've said hardly no more than 2 words to each other when she has a great long time boyfriend who's devoted to her completely i thought <UNK> was a major jerk throughout the movie and he never changed at all the only good thing about the movie was josh <UNK> i thought he did a wonderful acting job and i'm going to start watching more movies of his
<START> it would seem a given but if a viewer forgets context he risks missing an opportunity of enjoyment br br it is easy to from the <UNK> heights of the 21st century at styles and <UNK> of the great depression years but the intelligent viewer will remember that magic word context and better understand and thus enjoy <UNK> will happen br br among the actors ronald reagan again showed himself a good looking and <UNK> guy and again gave a right on performance br br a reviewer earlier said gloria blondell played the nasty wife but that was wrong she plays the <UNK> stand clerk who has a crush on the reagan character eric <UNK> but keeps hands off as long as he is married br br gloria was cute not as <UNK> beautiful as her sister joan she was still attractive and a good actress perhaps her looking somewhat like joan was a <UNK> to having a more successful career and it is certainly our loss br br sheila was mrs <UNK> and played it well br br other actors included dick <UNK> and the great earl got to play something besides a villainous cowboy br br again most of the players never <UNK> the household name status many of them deserved but they by gosh gave good performances here in a story that is still current
<START> one of my favorites non mgm musicals it's a classic rita hayworth is in top form her beauty leaps out of the screen gene kelly shows off his dancing skills and introduces to musicals his edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are <UNK> phil <UNK> is the perfect second <UNK> and eve <UNK> <UNK> this movie with a lot of class br br the structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why in this era where major broadway shows come from the movies cover girl hasn't been adapted to theatre
<START> fi i saw the d i in 1957 two and a half years later i joined the <UNK> br br web and company got it as right as they could in boot in was more like in fact exactly like the boot camp shown in full metal jacket yes a black <UNK> in my training platoon was called <UNK> i was called stick because i was skinny as a <UNK> every <UNK> had a <UNK> some rather vile that stuck with him through his service in the <UNK> getting <UNK> or knocked on your ass when you screwed up was <UNK> drop and give me fifty got to be ho hum then it turned into drop and give me two hundred br br the d i 's were a bunch of sadistic <UNK> but it was a controlled <UNK> and with a primary purpose of keeping us stupid alive when we hit combat 200 years of experience was <UNK> in that <UNK> and everything the d i did or said had a purpose <UNK> to his mission br br a bad d i gets <UNK> killed a good d i though seemingly the world's biggest <UNK> keeps 'em alive you can't kill the enemy if you're dead br br in case you didn't know the marine <UNK> has one primary mission kill the enemy br br everything else is pure bravo <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> problems 1 although billed as a loving tribute to poverty row a lot of the old footage is not even from poverty row films much of it is from <UNK> the most dangerous game 1932 with some from the silent version of the lost world <UNK> br br 2 much of the old footage is just used as filler the old <UNK> footage or as silent shots for example of bela walking looking or staring often repeated br br 3 where is the <UNK> of poverty row master <UNK> bela boris <UNK> <UNK> jr george <UNK> john carradine buster <UNK> tom <UNK> etc <UNK> their lines as punch lines to the <UNK> characters jokes as in woody allen's what's up tiger lily or steve <UNK> dead men don't wear <UNK> even mike <UNK> feeble commentary on the <UNK> <UNK> madness is funnier than this br br high point the long but extremely <UNK> lecture by gregory which makes you give new respect to and admiration for bela john carradine and george <UNK> that's worth the price of the dvd alone
<START> my husband received dvd of for christmas and it was the best gift we received we watch it every time we need to laugh and so far we have viewed it 12 times the scenery in this movie is beautiful and the music is outstanding we also purchased the soundtrack and we play it in our vehicles and at home when ever we need a pick me up and that too is daily if anyone needs a suggestion for a good gift for movie lovers this movie is it the characters are hilarious charming and their facial expressions are too funny to describe i have always been a fan of george clooney but now i am also a fan of tim blake nelson <UNK> and john <UNK> pete and am now looking for them in other movies you gotta see this movie
<START> after having seen the lost child for quite a number of times since its release in 1995 and having read the <UNK> comments mostly about jane background and helen <UNK> superb role in it it strikes me more than ever that no comments are made upon the brilliant role robert is playing as chris hughes even after 10 years it is still one of the most credible ways of portraying the complex personality of a child <UNK> carrying the weight of his own past watching the episode for the full one and a half hour makes you constantly switch between feelings of love and hate for this guy in which the hate <UNK> because of the gravity of his actions i have seen more brilliant roles of my favorite actor but this one never fails to make the largest impression possible to me helen <UNK> would never shine without these wonderful actors next to her praise for robert
<START> <UNK> tells of a naive <UNK> virgin who decides to have a baby but isn't quite sure how to go about it this easy going little sleeper is full of quirky characters and tongue in cheek <UNK> humor fresh fun mold breaking stuff i happened to really enjoy this flick for whatever that's worth recommended for lovers of romantic comedy who want something different
<START> this abomination and the sequel one more time no thanks and the hideous jerry lewis disasters like don't raise the bridge lower the water why not just <UNK> instead drove cinema owners to close their doors rather than be forced to run these films true in the 60s block <UNK> of films was still <UNK> on hapless suburban and country cinemas this means that in order to get a good film the cinema was forced to run <UNK> like these i remember well in 1974 keen to screen <UNK> on the roof or something good like that i was <UNK> up in the united artists <UNK> office by some <UNK> salesman who <UNK> a sheet of <UNK> before me and <UNK> now before we get to that one <UNK> see ya date these ones first which basically means book these <UNK> and we will give ya a tired hit this is how and why so many cinemas closed forced to screen and annoy their <UNK> audiences with these <UNK> line failures with lame comedians and bored talent cinema owners exhausted with arguing simply closed sold to a <UNK> station and saw the cinema <UNK> these days the same type of films <UNK> i now <UNK> you chuck and larry get <UNK> to the 20 seat cinema 99 in a mega <UNK> <UNK> instead not much has changed freddy got <UNK> anyone

<START> it's strange how the least known movies sometimes end up amongst the best you've seen this movie has all the elements of a standard modern day thriller guns <UNK> baddies cash etc and yet it stands out from your average hollywood also ran i would credit this to two very charismatic people christopher walken has a cool confidence and <UNK> <UNK> is one of the <UNK> and <UNK> women i've ever seen on screen another major reason why this film stands out is <UNK> the setting shifts to after the beginning the <UNK> resort is so beautiful you'll wish you were there sitting by the pool at night with a i know i did i'm very glad i saw this movie it was just too nice to miss
<START> released at a time when <UNK> was going again from strength to strength black jack which was <UNK> between the overlooked extraordinary <UNK> des and the dazzling stunning <UNK> le <UNK> de paris is a <UNK> which <UNK> himself hated which is not surprising there's almost nothing to write about this dud we can notice that br br 1 orson welles used to admire <UNK> that may explain why <UNK> actors were featured in <UNK> movies joseph <UNK> in <UNK> 1941 and here a totally wasted <UNK> <UNK> it's the first time br br i have not enjoyed performance on the other hand welles borrowed his <UNK> suzanne from <UNK> <UNK> des for his othello br br 2 in any <UNK> movie there's one or two worthwhile sequences and this one is no exception the search in the <UNK> where <UNK> sense of mystery works wonders for a short while then the chase when gets caught up in the <UNK> touch can be felt in the unhappy end too br br as for the rest as my dear pen pal writer's reign writes it's a black joke
<START> i can't believe that there are people out there who voted 10 for this garbage have any of you gained access to a computer in the <UNK> where you are <UNK> kept or is there a special colony where especially crass people are secretly imprisoned that i don't know about br br if i was to say what i really thought of this film none of it would get published br br to begin with its <UNK> is a no talent idiot who acts like a bad <UNK> of jim carrey who has enough angel dust up his nose to <UNK> the <UNK> desert his name will be a total guarantee that i will not watch a future film with him in it even if he plays a rock hidden by a crowd br br as for the <UNK> one more crime that we can <UNK> up to the nazis is that they were so awful that they can be considered fair game as <UNK> in tripe like this mere criminals and murderers would have the audience on their side in a <UNK> br br to the people who made this movie give up making films and if not then <UNK> yourself to making <UNK> where your efforts will at least have the virtue of being fleeting in duration br br finally a criticism of imdb why don't you have the facility to vote for a film or perhaps not to express my contempt for this tripe i would then have to vote double zero or something
<START> time travel into the past is <UNK> at best as a topic in this episode a man who has been thinking about the possibility finds himself at the date and location of the assassination of abraham lincoln he tries everything he can think of in the short time available to him with predictable results of course he is thought to be quite mad he is arrested and eventually to the very man he is attempting to stop <UNK> was bright enough to let him return to the present but is the present the same this is kind of a <UNK> to the time tunnel where time <UNK> on a weekly basis were given the same task <UNK> what had already happened unfortunately the <UNK> of the <UNK> of time and the future always <UNK> the result unless you have something like ray <UNK> the sound of thunder

<START> possible spoilers included but nothing critical given away br br i just watched this classic low budget movie on video and was knocked out by the level of energy present on screen all the actors do themselves proud especially john daniels must see another of his films not only does this movie <UNK> great performances but manages stylish sequences like when the baron throws someone out of a window and we see <UNK> of glass falling into a swimming pool which <UNK> from the impact of the fallen man i love the way slow motion photography was used in 70's cinema dreamy and hypnotic cool and witty black <UNK> <UNK> great one liners while slimy seedy <UNK> of white trash come to unpleasant ends i love it my rating 10 10 if this ever comes out on dvd count me in for a purchase
<START> two soldiers is an excellent example of fine film making the director and producer took a heart warming story and brought it to life with a very skilled and dedicated cast excellent cinematography and very creative artistry br br the relaxed back woods lifestyle of the brothers was depicted with great details and <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> lifestyle that they were thrust into the interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears as they <UNK> with a hard but peaceful life in the back woods of north <UNK> and an even harder life of war br br the acting was great particularly from the younger brother who is new to the big screen played by jonathan to the older brother played by ben allison and the powerful by the colonel played by ron <UNK> the performance was extremely well cast br br it was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of two soldiers and i <UNK> recommend it to audiences of all ages

<START> man oh man this was a piece of dog sh t i read a few reviews on here after seeing the case in the local video store and thought to myself ah this seems like a half decent movie vampires swords thailand how can you go wrong right no no no way f <UNK> wrong jesus if only i could <UNK> out my eyes and not remember this film i would be happy the lead actor had the <UNK> voice ever man it really was bad i gotta save my girlfriend f <UNK> off my buddy and i actually changed the audio track on the dvd to just so we didn't have to hear the guy's voice subtitles and all and this improved the film i'm serious if your anything like me and wondered what this film was like stop wondering i have the answer worst vampire movie ever no good action no good gore and only the smallest <UNK> of nudity just pure sh t for 90 mins don't rent this buy it think about it or watch it at 3 <UNK> it just doesn't cut the cake at all in any way f <UNK> this movie and watch all <UNK> 7 real deep cover you'd have a better time i'm sure
<START> the fact that this film was distributed free with a certain national newspaper which i do not care for did to a degree put me off of watching it but as i had come across a copy that a local charity shop was giving away for nothing i felt i could watch it with a clear conscience br br the film does have its moments the <UNK> of the location is nicely done but it does suffer i feel from a few too many faults firstly <UNK> jones is simply not convincing as the journalist whilst <UNK> himself is an interesting character the truth is that he simply does not have the range of acting ability to pull off a role like this br br secondly who would carry around with them a lost <UNK> that they have been informed is priceless it seemed that everywhere mr jones went this <UNK> went with him <UNK> the whole dickens aspect of the story whilst appearing to be important gets in the way of what could have been an interesting film of corruption in high places maybe i'm just a bit thick but i really could not see the point of the story within a story dickens style this added nothing to the film and only served to confuse matters when things started to become interesting within the modern day story line br br the one bit of praise i will give the film makers is that at least they did attempt something a little different i am all for british independent films that try to be <UNK> of left but this is not a <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> is <UNK> what it is is a bit of a mess and an over long one at that yes it entertains in part but in the end it felt like two films <UNK> together to make a whole and failing both by doing so also i can not help think that i have seen something similar done recently on tv by ian banks set in <UNK> with a story concerning sir arthur conan doyle the creator of sherlock holmes
<START> this is basically just a dumb chase story nearly identical to <UNK> of other chase stories in terms of acting suspense plot dialogue characterization or lack thereof and pacing br br the one area in which 'the <UNK> from traditional chase movies is in its subject material computers unfortunately the <UNK> clearly didn't understand the differences between a pocket <UNK> and a <UNK> br br computer <UNK> shouldn't watch this movie because it will make them paranoid about computers no matter what hollywood tries to tell us it's just not that easy to <UNK> someone's identity by <UNK> there's still too much paper <UNK> in the world and there was even more of it in 1995 br br computer pros shouldn't watch this movie either i mean a magical virus that can melt your entire pc when you press escape please and the whole virus including the cool <UNK> effects of your screen <UNK> what's that all about can fit on a single 1 yeah whatever
<START> victor <UNK> never became a major star he is better known for later character roles than for his early leads but he was very handsome and an excellent actor br br his love scenes with loretta young in this romantic adventure thriller are passionate their kisses look very real and very modern br br <UNK> <UNK> is a standout here also she plays a woman with a reputation but the character has a good heart br br the print i saw was not clear but what a joy that rare movies like this are turning up and they are in some sort of watchable condition still intact this is nothing truly special but if one is willing to <UNK> through movies of its era with similarly intriguing titles one is likely to find some movies
<START> this drama apparently caused a bit of a stir six years ago when it <UNK> on television not taking in much tv news myself it passed under the radar but after having seen it i'm not surprised that it did cause a stir not particularly because of the content although it is a bit more than the usual tv fodder it has more to do with the <UNK> media in this country anyway this three part series is based on a book by sarah waters and puts its main focus on lesbians although the plot also has room to explore some other <UNK> sides of sexuality our main character is an <UNK> girl named <UNK> short for nancy from winchester she is <UNK> by female to male drag performer kitty butler after seeing her at a theatre show and soon begins attending all of her shows eventually catching the eye of the performer and becoming her <UNK> it's not long before kitty is offered a chance to play on bigger stages in london and having become good friends with <UNK> she invites her along for the ride the act gets bigger when <UNK> takes to the stage also and the pair becomes a stage duo but kitty breaks heart leading her into an odyssey within <UNK> seedy <UNK> br br i must admit that my dvd collection contains no <UNK> of sleazy and <UNK> films so there wasn't anything in this one that was enough to shock me despite being rather jaded to it i have to say that i'm still surprised at anyone who says this film went too far naturally there is some lesbian sex and other stuff but it's never exploitative or <UNK> and the film really couldn't have been made without it the main focus is always on the story and the story is really well done the film is almost three hours long in total but if anything that isn't long enough to get everything across sarah waters is obviously an inventive writer and the film remains interesting for the duration the acting is solid as you would expect but i must admit that i found lead actress <UNK> <UNK> awkward and hard to get on with at first although she grows into her role well as the film progresses the execution is a little bit of a problem and director geoffrey <UNK> is a bit too <UNK> for my liking the story does get a little bit sappy towards the end also which is a shame because this film is at it's strongest during the dark moments episode 2 being the high point of three for me there's not really a defined point to the film or at least not one that i could see that's not important as far as i'm concerned however as <UNK> the <UNK> tells a good story and more than <UNK> my expectations worth checking out for people that like this sort of stuff
<START> the basis for this dynamic <UNK> is the true story of one of the most extraordinary card players ever br br is a tight cohesive biopic of a true poker ace whose life is a one way trip down the highway to hell with few <UNK> br br this dramatic feature stands wide apart from other films about poker it represents a rare and earnest attempt to bring to the silver screen a true story of ultimate gambling <UNK> the complete obsession that <UNK> any <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> any chance of redemption this is the least likely movie a vegas casino executive would recommend and it is the sole poker dvd you are likely to find on the shelves of <UNK> <UNK> br br there are scenes in this movie that poker buffs are sure to refer to as some of the best gambling scenes ever <UNK> reading his hand and particularly a texas <UNK> scene br br early on in the movie we see a young <UNK> <UNK> out of his pocket change by a bunch of neighborhood <UNK> poker is for <UNK> seeking revenge it is a game of patience which bullies lack <UNK> can't bully me ' may very well be an underlying sentiment of the <UNK> force that a champion poker player <UNK> upon his <UNK> br br <UNK> will look upon this film as a <UNK> tale of a soul lost in sin they may evoke mark <UNK> 'the best throw at <UNK> is to throw them away ' the young and liberal masses will inevitably have a more simplistic and sympathetic <UNK> they may not have heard of <UNK> quote but will sure remember a remark made by stunned pal who learns from up and coming that he'd won a car from a local character in an overnight game <UNK> to go to hell and they look forward to the <UNK> br br the <UNK> of las vegas vignettes that we see in will long <UNK> in memory frank sinatra the most generous <UNK> forget about it nobody <UNK> as <UNK> as a hot shot <UNK> and for vegas <UNK> who may not know the impact of <UNK> on the quality of their stay check out the scene of <UNK> checking in a vegas hotel br br <UNK> is what i was meant to do this is where i was to be movie stars in hollywood politicians in washington and <UNK> in vegas '
<START> i picked up this movie because it caught my eye as movie with a jewish comedy focus something i had not seen before br br i approached this film with an open mind and was interested in the way it began the opening is well put together and the first half of the film gave me many reasons to laugh and this is good br br however the humor soon became repetitive the plot became confused and strained and i realized i was no longer enjoying the film i have tried to avoid saying this but the movie became rather cheap not a bad thing for a comedy if the humor holds up but it didn't i confess that i may have missed some of the humour not being jewish myself and having little experience with jewish culture however considering how heavily <UNK> the bulk of the humour was in this film it's unlikely i missed much br br the idea is a good one and perhaps if a little more thought was put into it the film would have been watchable all the way through i wish i could give the movie a higher rating but strictly speaking it would have been better as a tv series or as a series of skits there was just not enough worthwhile fresh material for a full length movie br br one thing to say about the casting the lead role looked as if it had been designed with ben stiller in mind but i don't think the movie would have been any more worthwhile if he had been in it
<START> in this unlikely love triangle set in 19th century italy the beauty and the <UNK> is being turned upside down and inside out and then some <UNK> an army officer and the very image of male beauty is being transferred away form his married lover clara and sent to a small <UNK> somewhere in there initially much to his horror  the <UNK> ugly cousin of his commander develops an obsessive love for him he suffers her passionate and demanding displays of affection out of pity and concern for her health she is <UNK> ill but becomes more and more fascinated by her  until the dramatic br br do not miss this most unusual love story as twisted as it may sound <UNK> who deservedly won a price for her portrayal of is as <UNK> as she is touching buy the video read the book go see the musical
<START> i was kinda surprised by the pg rating on the back of the dvd case i certainly wouldn't want my kids watching this one i think this would scare the crap out of a 10 year old br br plot a girl trying to fit in to the <UNK> is <UNK> and tormented by the <UNK> crowd ' they talk her into spending the night in this creepy <UNK> that reminded me of phantasm and they proceed to torment her in the night little do they know a recently deceased <UNK> is coming back to life and raising the dead around them it sounds awfully cheesy but given the age and the budget which was no doubt pretty small this film is fun on many levels br br watch for an early <UNK> daily as one of the in crowd <UNK> i enjoyed it and it scared my girlfriend br br 7 out of 10 kids
<START> this was an 1970s type <UNK> comedy <UNK> fun at the psychiatric profession and at beverly hills i didn't mind that but i did object to more that <UNK> regarding marriage and religion two topics which <UNK> filmmakers meaning about everyone in hollywood and elsewhere just can't stop <UNK> br br walter matthau plays a <UNK> character donald <UNK> who walks around with a collar on which <UNK> me but when has hollywood ever been worried about <UNK> christians br br anyway despite that nonsense the film has its entertaining moments and even some charm to it dan <UNK> is good at paying a nut case and donna dixon laura <UNK> is a <UNK> i am sorry she didn't have a bigger role
<START> i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film i enjoyed it its a sci fi film if you want a thriller watch another channel this is what the scifi lovers want excellently produced by one of sci <UNK> best producers <UNK> ok the special effects weren't excellent but what a great cast some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films films like mission impossible and braveheart are great but these aren't sci fi films sci fi produces excellent films like <UNK> alien hunters etc well done keep them <UNK> out
<START> <UNK> is my favorite movie i have seen it a number of times don't remember the count now and every time i just love it this is the best movie of raj kumar <UNK> the comedy dialogues and performance is amazing all the actors and actresses have done a superb job you cannot stop laughing while watching this movie its just hilarious <UNK> khan and salman khan have done a great job and acting by <UNK> <UNK> was excellent as always the music is inspired from the old hindi movies 60s music and is good the entire cast of the movie has done great job br br overall its a great indian comedy movie to watch
<START> i'm not even going to waste more time describing how bad this movie is bottom line it was horribly acted had enormous plot holes and went absolutely nowhere the only good thing about it was the description my digital cable gave for the movie a married man with a struggling business has a <UNK> with his secretary huh wrong movie apparently although it may have made things slightly more interesting if any of the description were true br br <UNK>
<START> of all the major 30s star actresses <UNK> hopkins has been the most <UNK> overlooked and underrated her string of excellent 30s and 40s films is quite impressive but she is often referred to as <UNK> or <UNK> yet she had a great sense of humor and was memorable in several comedies including this film old <UNK> with bette davis and the smiling lieutenant with maurice <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> hopkins was famous for her dislike of hollywood and the results has been a bad <UNK> <UNK> br br in wise girl she play an <UNK> trying to rescue the children of her dead sister from their guardian the sister's brother in law ray <UNK> the film offers several hilarious scene such as hopkins taking a bath is a hopkins joining <UNK> and <UNK> williams in a <UNK> village restaurant for 3 <UNK> to act as <UNK> and hopkins going <UNK> during one of <UNK> fights <UNK> is also excellent and very funny br br hopkins and <UNK> make a great couple the film also boasts solid support from williams walter <UNK> henry <UNK> james <UNK> margaret <UNK> grace <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the two girls are ok br br but hopkins drunk on a slice of wine and wearing a <UNK> together dress that is twice her size is hilarious as she blows at stray <UNK> while smoking a scream
<START> i originally watched this because i thought it was going to be the sequel to the league of extraordinary gentlemen and this movie is a whole different thing entirely going on here a comedy however i loved it anyways br br the league of gentlemen is apparently some british tv series with some rather odd characters and some sharp humour this is british comedy so it revolves around being very silly dressing up in costumes and making lots of fun of germans and french homosexual references in short it's very very funny br br the plot revolves around the writers of the tv show deciding to <UNK> some of the characters and the characters coming out of their dimension into the writer's dimension to stop that from happening it's a fun twist and there's plenty of great scenes in this idiotic adventure i laughed out loud numerous times and <UNK> the <UNK> style of humour this makes mr bean look like the watered down <UNK> he is <UNK> is much better in black <UNK> series btw br br this is not monty python but you can never escape the comparison when you are talking british humour and there are a few similarities but not so many as to keep it from being it's own thing and being fresh it <UNK> more towards the young ones and guest house <UNK> in its' comedic style br br if you liked this check out the young ones series and guest house <UNK> movie and of course i assume the tv series league of gentlemen must be rather funny as well
<START> this is an ok adaptation of the breath taking book of dan brown i can't say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy given the excellent story the result could have been better though the movie is pretty long but at the end i was feeling like some things were missing sound effects and sound tracks were very good acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak for people who didn't read the book things may look happening too quickly from my point of view instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper what makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of <UNK> you see neither of it in the movie too much rush and using the time not in a good way these are main problems of the movie so it is worth watching but could have been done better
<START> this movie was horrible and the only reason it was even made was because the story <UNK> to the far left i consider my self a <UNK> so i was able to see this film as the pile of garbage it was while i'm not a bush fan your dislike for <UNK> is not enough of a reason to see this movie br br to start the movie was shot on such low grade film that it comes off as cheap rather then artsy additionally the characters are seriously lacking in depth chris <UNK> character was a poor parody of george bush better suited for saturday night live then a dramatic film the rest of the characters are walking clichés and are poor of other characters from much better movies br br avoid this movie at all costs
<START> love the but this was a lame episode didn't have the same feel that the series or the movie has looked like it was put together in a hurry i didn't enjoy it at all the so called acting was awful the cast appeared like they knew this was a money grab of an episode to get to market quickly i hope we don't have an <UNK> special next because that will be it for me the writing of this episode was definitely mike worst in the history of this show the direction left a lot to be desired and i almost felt bad for the cast and crew of this weak attempt at a christmas special like i said i love the but this one goes to the trash bin
<START> this film by the well known czech director and writer <UNK> <UNK> is remarkable for its but annoying and distracting in its details taking its theme and title from a robert graves poem it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life who's trying to survive and protect her two children 15 year old <UNK> and little blond <UNK> <UNK> adam the poem is much in evidence but the theme it gets a little lost br br anna the beauty and roman have lost everything in the <UNK> <UNK> of 2002 and have nothing left it seems but good sex which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that <UNK> and <UNK> in front of the telly must hold their ears against the noise <UNK> such <UNK> and <UNK> on the edge of embarrassment or shock there's no good explanation precisely why but financial desperation has led to <UNK> stolen cars in the big garage that his his car thief <UNK> drives off a posh <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> has left with the keys in the <UNK> while visiting a large property he owns is a super nice guy but no fool his <UNK> is <UNK> for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that leads the cops straight to garage and he and his <UNK> are off to jail br br beauty in trouble <UNK> to the good angel on whom she can rely begins the graves poem but actually this <UNK> leads to when he meets her at the police station he introduces her to <UNK> and how to drink wine and <UNK> her with a picture book about <UNK> where he though <UNK> born owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life he's here to <UNK> the house in <UNK> now occupied by a couple with an ancient and <UNK> mother whom he allows to remain every gesture is <UNK> even though he doesn't prevent from going off to jail br br in the circumstances must <UNK> with <UNK> and <UNK> to depend on the charity of her mother <UNK> and the far less tender <UNK> of present husband the <UNK> <UNK> richard <UNK> who for the kids starting when they commit the <UNK> sin of <UNK> his <UNK> proves to be the uncle from hell <UNK> <UNK> the film at this point and never quite lets it go even in the final scene he is a figure of <UNK> menace it is surprising that the obnoxious richard doesn't sexually abuse one or both of the children he is <UNK> that needs to get out on her own and when offers to take her under his wing he and richard become improbable allies improbable perhaps implausible why should like him but then what is whole story about some things the film gives too much information and about others not enough br br clearly the good angel is kind and a polished good looking older man whose manners <UNK> his italian upbringing it's only at the end when he's pushed to the limits over his <UNK> property by the <UNK> <UNK> he proves that he is not one to won't lie down and be walked over br br also to be dealt with is religious fanatic mother <UNK> and her interactions with and richard are something to watch but she is just another wild card that does not <UNK> the deck br br the poem has been set to music in a czech translation and is sung on screen by the <UNK> first in a tiny scene then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by and the car thief pal if you <UNK> as an auteur you may <UNK> this sequence otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous also included are a number of songs by <UNK> of the oscar award winning irish musical film <UNK> ' including the <UNK> theme song falling they feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their <UNK> from though this film came first br br people are <UNK> even little has his shakespearean child moments and a wealth of charm but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to <UNK> and to over expand the property <UNK> <UNK> may be useful for showing he has a tough side but such an elaborate <UNK> wasn't necessary the acting is fine and there is a wonderful with <UNK> and <UNK> but the basic themes of love sex and money get lost in the <UNK> and conflicts and how she <UNK> them never become clear it's fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to poem that still has hot sex with during a <UNK> to <UNK> after moving to <UNK> with and her kids but there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious richard or of annoyingly <UNK> mother how come all of a sudden we learn is getting letters from india <UNK> to be from his dad who's in prison when did that come about interesting details <UNK> <UNK> in this seems a world in which you can't see the forest for the trees
<START> i've heard a few comments particularly from prisoners of war that is not historically accurate and that it is disappointing perhaps it is for those who actually had to live through this stuff and much worse but for the rest of us who really have no idea of how prisoners were treated by the japanese during world war ii is a remarkable introduction but isn't a war documentary if it had have been then the historical accuracy aspect would have been paramount it is a miniseries drama with fictional characters and fictional situations though based loosely on actual events i've heard and read about and at the centre of the story is the ideal of this group of young australian soldiers taken prisoner by the japanese and held in appalling conditions for years became mates through <UNK> and the strength of their friendships continued throughout their lives after the war it is also a cultural study of the differences between the japanese of the time and the western world with its music games and entertainment in part 5 when it is becoming clear that japan will lose the war after germany has <UNK> in europe the japanese prison camp colonel insists that his country must study the culture of their prisoners in order to defeat a people one must defeat their culture and to do this one must understand it all in all australia continues its rich tradition of producing exceptional television miniseries and is an <UNK> world leader in this regard for the <UNK> award with is my brother jack the adaptation of george <UNK> novel and also a worthy winner miniseries in recent years include day of the <UNK> the story of the investigation into the train crash kings in grass <UNK> the adaptation of mary historical account of her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> palace about a group of friends from a country town in australia who travel to london and change and grow apart and the somewhat disappointing adaptation of powerful novel the <UNK> factory less recently nancy <UNK> sweeping saga of life on the murray all the rivers run cusack <UNK> brilliant novel about <UNK> life in sydney come in <UNK> <UNK> outstanding <UNK> saga the thorn birds the river kings ruth <UNK> novel the <UNK> in the south <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc etc of course there have been some not so good productions for instance <UNK> dick do or die on the beach thorn birds the missing years etc generally though if an australian miniseries comes your way make sure you see it and this goes double for a superbly directed masterpiece rating 9 10

<START> another popular screening for a british picture at century theatre a well crafted solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing in the <UNK> as the lies <UNK> up a <UNK> of acting by a flawless cast well by first time director julian <UNK> outstanding performance as usual by tom <UNK> but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors linda <UNK> and john <UNK> our audience was <UNK> by this film which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you <UNK> a good tight production at around only 80 minutes probably produced on a very limited budget but a success which should see <UNK> directing again for the big screen some publicity for the film seemed to suggest it was set in the 50s as per <UNK> novel but obviously this is not the case recommended viewing
<START> it's a shame that someone so by many kids as well as parents should <UNK> himself in appearing in this exploitative <UNK> jumping tripe i often wonder if mr wisdom in his later years looked back at his excuse for a film with any pride at least sally <UNK> had the decency to <UNK> to doing something worthwhile after appearing in this low budget rubbish a cameo by some long forgotten pop called the pretty things cannot rescue the film from it's awfulness if you want 60's nostalgia <UNK> in <UNK> we go round the instead starring barry evans and <UNK> sister judy instead
<START> when my six year old fell asleep at the theater during this movie that was all the <UNK> i needed that this film is a stinker it was boring the scary parts were boring the <UNK> parts were boring even the funny parts with two minor exceptions were boring and predictable and did i mention predictable examples 1 the gruff but loving dad <UNK> his brat of a kid 2 the gruff but loving dad buying the farm while singing a song 3 the brat of a kid deciding to cut and run but thanks to his friends sticking things out because they need him 4 the brat of a kid winning against incredible odds 5 and a sassy character voiced by an african american actress gotta credit these filmmakers for that bit of originality and for <UNK> that stereotype i did mention two funny bits in both cases contributed by minor characters the mouse <UNK> on the <UNK> pulse was funny the farm dog falling victim to his <UNK> weaknesses while <UNK> for <UNK> was funny but the rest painful someone tried to make a <UNK> thru <UNK> movie and make it even <UNK> by making it a computer animated film and this was the result and why make the <UNK> batman villain dumb by with their victims rather than just eating them oh yeah no blood needed in this film for kids already <UNK> on mock alcohol <UNK> destructive behavior and <UNK> humor and the fuzzy thing in a box just what exactly was it a <UNK> <UNK> devil what besides a really stupid plot device to help <UNK> the cow win the mother of all battles <UNK> is a bomb and i didn't even need to mention the
<START> i liked this movie that's pretty much all i can say about it lou <UNK> did a good job even though i'm still very disappointed in him after all the iron eagle movies and even if i was smiling on the inside when the first main teenager dies i won't give it away it was done in a nice fitting fashion pretty much everyone in this movie does a good job so check it out it's another one of those movies i found real cheap so i bought it and i recommend the same
<START> why is there so much angst among the imdb reviewers who hate this film it isn't a masterpiece but having viewed it twice it does come across as compelling drama set in the world of network tv robin stone is the epitome of every dan rather phillip stone and brian what's his name on nbc a <UNK> of a man incapable of love who succeeds <UNK> but fails miserably in his personal life i worked for eight 8 years in network news and robin <UNK> do exist br br the supporting cast works for me from cannon who can be annoying but isn't in this film to greene who plays pathos just right to <UNK> who scores as the young model in love w the image of prince charming and can't <UNK> that image w the true <UNK> inside also of note is the ending which some imdb reviewers claim is a cop out it's not listen to the song he's moving on for clues as to the arc the robin stone character travels that brings him to finally face his issues he realizes the answers don't lay w the life he's lived and the symbolic walk away from those he's associated himself with at the end is perfect
<START> this movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof its attempts to parody various sports movies are half baked and not at all funny br br even things that should be funny like the female <UNK> from india who's always wearing traditional dress over her uniform aren't really funny the fact that the football team studies and gets good <UNK> which makes the coach mad didn't get any laughs either br br the plot of having a traditional loser get one more chance by <UNK> a loser high school football team really had potential as a spoof it's a classic and trite sports theme but alas the screenplay was too weak for any cast to pull it off and this cast is no exception br br there is gratuitous use of women in <UNK> and underwear so it's not all bad from that aspect br br but animal house or <UNK> nights this is not
<START> it's not often that a tv series grabs me right off the bat a recent chance <UNK> of the pilot for surface had me glued to my seat for the entirety of the episode after which i immediately set out on a <UNK> search to learn everything i could about this wonderful series to my <UNK> i found out it had been canceled after a mere 15 episodes despite its strong ratings and extremely <UNK> reviews such a shame br br since then i've acquired the remaining episodes and found the first 5 or 6 to be among the best television i've ever watched just fantastic from start to finish and as another reviewer commented i loved how they ended every episode with a huge finish i imagine watching it each week i would've been screaming with tension and just captivated desperately waiting for the next episode to be released growing up i always heard that was how early serial movies used to do it ending with a huge cliffhanger to get the crowds back into the theater for the next episode br br well it seems for some reason or another the suits decided to kill this off and apparently the people behind the show must've seen the writing on the wall because after episode 6 things definitely take a turn for the worse i wouldn't say the episodes actually become boring but a lot of the plot elements become a bit more clichéd and i've got to say the final episode really left me feeling cheated i just wish the show's creators were given a fair chance the only other show that left me feeling like that was the first season of stargate sg 1 which just <UNK> tremendously feeling very true <UNK> and made from the heart surface was a great series and maybe one day some well <UNK> tv lover will see all the <UNK> of emotion about the show's <UNK> and bring back this show one can hope at least
<START> a sound of thunder one of the greatest short stories ever written by one of the <UNK> grand masters of fantasy ray <UNK> what a great story br br but what a <UNK> movie br br in <UNK> science fiction short story a company called time <UNK> offers big game hunters the opportunity to go back in time and kill dinosaurs rule number one is stay on the path a floating <UNK> that <UNK> no interaction with the <UNK> environment during a hunt a man steps off the path and inadvertently <UNK> a <UNK> when the hunting party returns to the present the world as they know it has drastically changed though there are <UNK> in any time travel story <UNK> tale was a quick <UNK> stroke a <UNK> of the <UNK> effect br br a sound of thunder was published in <UNK> according to <UNK> the most science fiction story of all time and illustrated chaos theory <UNK> and the <UNK> effect which would only be <UNK> in the 1960s by edward <UNK> in <UNK> story the wonder of time travel was overshadowed by corporate greed in turn overshadowed by the mortal danger to <UNK> existence itself br br while in the movie a sound of thunder directed by the uneven peter <UNK> one <UNK> odyssey two a <UNK> of bad actors goes through the time <UNK> again and again to try to <UNK> their mistakes like an <UNK> version of back to the future the movie has nothing to do with <UNK> powerful tale except the initial <UNK> of the time traveling <UNK> hunting party <UNK> liberties are taken with <UNK> story <UNK> faced <UNK> plants <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> time waves <UNK> through the city cgi <UNK> for which <UNK> should sue the pants and <UNK> and ass <UNK> off the filmmakers br br <UNK> writers thomas dean <UNK> joshua <UNK> and gregory should start a big balls agency for thinking they could actually add elements to a ray <UNK> story that would improve it how do these guys walk in a straight line with balls this big ben kingsley is the corporate owner of time <UNK> with a so bad it looks like a edward burns is his lead hunter travis and catherine <UNK> who was in braveheart is the scientist with the best breasts br br i can't possibly relate the hundreds upon thousands of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> pieces of dialog but here is just one spoken by david <UNK> as some kind of scientist he refers to the <UNK> star <UNK> the seven sisters they look like stars don't they but each of them is a whole galaxy uh no idiot scientist they're actually uh stars br br those three morons who <UNK> <UNK> story forgot they didn't know anything about physics or <UNK> or writing br br best part of the movie is catherine chest <UNK> against her <UNK> one size too small <UNK> br br review by the <UNK> for movie <UNK>
<START> stay the hell away from this one no really i'm serious i know you might think this is a fun campy cheesy hong kong action style b movie i did but trust me it's not in fact the only thing accurate about that description would be the words hong kong and then only used in a strictly <UNK> sense br br yes <UNK> <UNK> has co directed it jackie chan has a cameo the guy <UNK> <UNK> from storm riders plays the lead it got vampires it should be good or at least fun charming and action packed once again it's not br br i could <UNK> on why this movie sucks i could <UNK> it hack it to tiny <UNK> pieces but where to start there's so much to hate br br to make it easier and to give this hate fest some let me say that i'm usually a big fan of <UNK> kong cinema the <UNK> drama stuff as well as the more lighthearted action and or comedy the really good movies as well as the really cheesy ones i can sit through hours of bad <UNK> jokes lame enough to make first <UNK> roll their eyes i can handle lovers as <UNK> and <UNK> as a convention of nuns that and pretty much anything else the average film goer would bang their <UNK> <UNK> against on their way between action sequences also hong kong or any other origin i love it when a movie goes from just being bad to bad enough to be good br br but this <UNK> it's just horrible stupid unwatchable garbage so far from being funny or charming it's actually painful so derived of action it makes a bergman movie look like the texas chainsaw massacre br br why why waste such an opportunity this could have been so much fun
<START> this movie is very long but totally worth splitting up over several nights it has an all star cast and if you are a patrick <UNK> fan this will get your heart to <UNK> my mother is a civil war buff and a history teacher and every summer we would watch this movie we had recorded it off tv over several several nights until we got through the whole thing we had every line in the movie <UNK> lol pop some popcorn sit back and enjoy the action and romance it's a great movie for those that like action war blood guts but also for those with a soft romantic side the clothes the women wore were gorgeous sometimes i think i was born in the wrong era lol
<START> i was looking for a documentary of the same <UNK> quality as <UNK> or fog of war by errol morris instead i was appalled by this shallow and naive account of a very complex and disturbing man and his regime <UNK> this movie should be called the return of the director <UNK> she made a perfect movie because <UNK> both pro and anti <UNK> when in fact it is a very biased and <UNK> piece of work br br the movie has few crucial facts wrong br br 1 she uses the so called <UNK> election of 1995 in which was re elected with <UNK> of the vote as an example of the massive popular support of but we all now know to be the fruit of a very organized <UNK> fraud br br 2 the movie states that shining path killed 60 000 people in fact the truth final report states that there were <UNK> <UNK> deaths due to political violence in <UNK> 33 of those were caused by <UNK> that leaves the other <UNK> in the hands of the police military and other groups the fact that she uses the same misleading information that has been using for 10 years it is another example of how terrible this movie is br br for any person with some education on <UNK> politics and history is clearly a <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> character and <UNK> <UNK> his regime was very far from being <UNK> he is still a menace to <UNK> despite these facts the director lets tell the story not only on how he wants the camera to be <UNK> but the narrative and direction of the film seem to be part of his political agenda he always seems to have the last word there are no <UNK> <UNK> just soft questions and <UNK> remarks where is when we need her the director when <UNK> after the screening didn't hide the fact that she was deeply impressed by his charm and intelligence yes she has been definitely <UNK> by him and you can tell by looking at this film it's obvious she has a very hard time to <UNK> the <UNK> of facts that point towards his responsibility on the corruption murder and deception that took place she assured the <UNK> audience that was really a <UNK> when few moments earlier one of the leading <UNK> <UNK> was very <UNK> in telling us that was above all a <UNK> she went on to say that despite all the <UNK> not a single dollar was found on any bank account on his name etc etc it was like hearing again the same gang of ruthless thugs that ruled the country for 10 years defending their master it was a sad moment for <UNK> br br this film makes injustice to history it is an insult to hundreds of dead people disappeared or <UNK> <UNK> by regime no wonder she later <UNK> that all the <UNK> <UNK> she <UNK> while making the movie felt betrayed by it <UNK> the words <UNK> and denial come to my mind instead
<START> having seen just about every movie on record that a child of the eighties could have seen this ranks at the very very very bottom of the heap of bad movies i have ever seen it's depressing and just plain painful to watch <UNK> said
<START> the film had it moments but was disappointing in my eyes anyway it was a <UNK> of <UNK> walter hill and so the treasure of the <UNK> <UNK> with less tension bite and human emotion there was some nice acting but the story was limp and lacked any real depth i watched the movie for mr reno and mr <UNK> neither were inspired and both had little to say or act out of their skin for this movie has been done to death in the past and did not have to be made eats up money which could be used on better movies for an action movie it was sparse of action and as a thriller did not thrill better than watching snow fall but not for me
<START> every time i watch larry king live he rolls out the most <UNK> questions for his guests he rarely gets any useful information because he doesn't ask the hard questions this comes from his start on radio br br king established himself on the radio and basically has not changed one bit of the format for television except for his talking head being visible he becomes like a puppy for his guests the only time he really gets useful information from them is <UNK> they <UNK> it or a <UNK> to the show actually asks a hard question br br larry is a nice <UNK> type of <UNK> this means he should not have a prime time show on a major news network if you consider <UNK> one i don't because of the history of <UNK> br br <UNK> ie cable new network was started by ted turner as an alternative to network news in that it could broadcast news 24 7 when it first started the only tv competition was from nbc abc cbs because of this <UNK> copied the format of their competition achieved respectable ratings br br this worked fine for <UNK> until they got competing networks which were innovative provided better <UNK> news coverage in response to the <UNK> up of competition <UNK> went into denial <UNK> its <UNK> who were eating their lunch ratings because <UNK> wanted to resist change this didn't work very long their ratings began to <UNK> br br now the <UNK> news network is trying to re mold itself by re <UNK> itself by <UNK> the leading news network format unfortunately this show represents a big piece of the problem it is 21 years old showing it's age very badly br br sorry to say king needs to be moved out of prime time or <UNK> altogether
<START> <UNK> minute version extremely hardcore or so i hear or the r rated version released into theaters both are terribly awful of course peter o'toole and malcolm mcdowell have both claimed they wish they had never made this film the latter of the two men reported this in an imdb interview and i can see why nothing but a nonsensical mess of <UNK> porn and a half hearted attempt at a plot br br not much of anything here other than cheap tricks and stupid scenes i liked what mcdowell himself said about the film it was like one moment i'd be staring <UNK> my <UNK> or something and the next scene would be two lesbians going at it br br how true br br what an awful movie br br 1 5 stars
<START> the first season of bones is playing in <UNK> and i can't believe the amount of <UNK> that this show puts on the characters are shallow poorly directed and clumsy br br it's a poor <UNK> <UNK> or actually <UNK> without coherent plot although bones has potential it fails due to the lacking of the director who hasn't been able to <UNK> the essence of the show from the actors it's actually sad to see a show throw it all away when it could had been a descent show with just a <UNK> more thought from the start you get the feeling how awkward the acting is br br long story short don't waste your time on bones
<START> i like vampire movies i like b movies i love b vampire movies but this one has nearly nothing going for it some of the acting is horrible especially by 3 of the male leads the story is not particular interesting at a relative short <UNK> minutes it still seems too long and you'll find yourself fast <UNK> quite a bit there are an awful lot of kung fu vampire attacks sound cool it isn't when it's done on a low budget it gets repetitive very quickly there is some minor blood and gore nothing to get excited about there some good wire work where you can see the <UNK> it has some good landscapes being filmed in puerto rico br br not worth the rental
<START> my friend gives me these 3 huge boxes they're <UNK> of flash gordon serials he says i'm gonna have some giant <UNK> i say but not so this serial rocks but i had to <UNK> <UNK> to almost everyone i knew to find a <UNK> player for em br br there is really a little of everything in this serial there are lion men <UNK> men shark men i guess you'd call em men the sets costumes combine greek roman oriental egyptian and there's even <UNK> like english knights awesome costumes and some of it was a riot those horrible <UNK> with shorts over em worn by are beyond description and the guys in the <UNK> scene seem to be wearing <UNK> br br it's also funny the way they <UNK> the <UNK> to an the <UNK> to and the tiger to a there's even a dragon a godzilla like creature who threatens flash on a couple of occasions before being killed off br br you like the invisible man this has got you covered you like sword fights wrestling both animals men fist fights plenty for any taste we have an underwater city a sky city a city on top of a mountain and <UNK> of secret <UNK> and <UNK> br br hokey effects massive amounts the sky city is supported by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> like old time the are powered by fireworks and have constant <UNK> and or <UNK> noises lots of <UNK> are visible holding things up like food when flash was invisible and of course there's clouds out in space but none around the earth when viewed from giant <UNK> show up briefly fighting sea creatures supposedly <UNK> flash co on the way to the shark men's underwater city the <UNK> in dr lab crack me up and they seem to be the same ones no matter what lab he's in he worked in <UNK> lab and br br and yeah we have romance everyone wants <UNK> <UNK> flash but at least one person wanted princess aura prince baron just not the person she would have preferred in fact it seems a lot of the sub plots concern intrigue on the part of princess aura to try to win flash br br man i think the characters are awesome that fat horse laughing king was hilarious how he managed those wings was pure artistry and <UNK> what can i say about <UNK> he was perfect they should have had him for the emperor in <UNK> has got to be my favourite character in this serial princess aura was quite a little character too and she pulled it off nicely i think she's a better actress than <UNK> <UNK> by a long shot even the <UNK> high priest had a distinctive role was good but not the strongest character and he always stood in the background during fight scenes holding <UNK> now we get to flash flash of course was the strong point the leader the hero and he did it well <UNK> is a good actor and this role fit him perfectly br br after watching this i think i know where george lucas got the main idea for watch this you'll see what i mean br br if you ever considered watching an old serial or any serial for that matter this should be your first choice the only reason i didn't give this one a 10 is because of a few story holes that could have been fixed easily the way the giant <UNK> seemed just tacked in there and a couple of weak characters king of shark men king of lion men
<START> <UNK> drive proves once again that david lynch is the master of cinematic expression at the screening last night i witnessed a brilliant addition to the history of cinema the performances are astounding the score <UNK> and the photography mesmerizing david's ability to <UNK> the many elements of film making into a unique and stunning cinematic experience is as i watched <UNK> drive i couldn't help but realize that with david lynch in this world we are truly blessed the cinema is blessed as well for in the films of david lynch we are shown that one man's vision can be realized with stunning results we realize that blockbusters are not the only path we realize that a true cinematic artist has a chance in this world and in that we are blessed indeed
<START> there is a reason why the world forgot these creatures they are dull this is a hammer production which means that whoever made this movie should be struck with a hammer several times if possible and where it most hurts most people put more thought into taking a dump than these idiots have put into making this movie br br seriously the movie begins with some <UNK> hunting an thing now <UNK> must have evolved a lot from those pre historic times because they actually attack and kill people here after that it's time to meet the rest of the tribe more <UNK> men some fashion models and even a couple of very old grey haired <UNK> and these old <UNK> obviously never heard about cave people not <UNK> the age of 30 they refused to bow to the will of both logic and pre historical records so they remain alive one of the <UNK> isn't <UNK> he is clean <UNK> not quite as clean <UNK> as tarzan the lord of the <UNK> clean <UNK> ones <UNK> the jungle since childhood and without a razor but <UNK> br br what follows is the obligatory <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> destruction sequence which causes a lot of our not so hairy friends to meet their doom it is interesting to note that before the <UNK> the fashion models showed their breasts more after it they must have gotten shy or something because they covered their <UNK> for a while maybe they were covered by ash so i <UNK> thought they were covered more action follows in the form of two fashion models wrestling in the sand the next best thing to female mud wrestling i suppose after a good deal of the desert has been crossed our black haired tribe meets how else could it be a blond tribe yawn br br more <UNK> stuff follows there is that <UNK> fashion model who is bothered by seeing a cave teen kill a <UNK> <UNK> thing there is also the scene of a woman dying at birth those cave fashion models are so <UNK> eventually we get to meet an even darker haired and skinned tribe i e an evil tribe one of them becomes a <UNK> champion after he actually beats a huge bear thing in a wrestling bout 1 2 3 and it's done the bear is the loser we also witness a jealous <UNK> miraculously recover from two major <UNK> first he gets stabbed with a big <UNK> into the <UNK> yet he walks away from that as if it were but a scratch then he gets thrown off a cliff onto a big rock by the blond <UNK> two shoes <UNK> yet he walks away from it as if he were thrown onto a giant <UNK> it's unclear in the end whether he dies from falling off an even higher cliff or from that voodoo doll being crushed oh yes voodoo was used in pre historic times by white <UNK> that live in the desert and whose females were fashion models it's always important to learn from movies br br the message of the movie is as insightful as it is educational cave people liked to fight for local power and they loved their fashion models too as if any self <UNK> <UNK> would fight to be leader of such a sorry bunch
<START> yes this is one of the better done television movies and i wouldn't expect less from joe <UNK> one thing for this reviewer is that i was also a great fan of the <UNK> i got to sing all of their material in <UNK> school and middle school choir and i got to do much of the solo material of which karen sang lead i thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's and being a child teen singing these songs and learning music the one thing i was looking forward to was meeting this woman i never got to she died three weeks before that was to happen and yes that did effect me for i knew nothing of <UNK> and could not understand completely what happened br br when this tv movie got produced i got quite an understanding maybe not everything in karen and <UNK> life is open to the television audience but in opening the parts that were shown i got to understand much from the music industry of that time what <UNK> me is that i am writing of that time and seeing now no one has learned a <UNK> thing even though this was a very informative and heartfelt look into a family's problems in the music industry br br these films aren't done for fun they're done to open a door and show us something here was a wonderful woman who got caught up in the whole idea that her talent was based on weight she was fine didn't know it she got mixed messages about her weight from the brother she loved the parents she loved and the music industry that cared more about her looks weight than the talent within with the <UNK> of mtv it got worse with <UNK> it's like a <UNK> <UNK> in an english accent br br a wonderful tv film i am sure later someone may give it an hbo treatment but either way many lessons to be learned and the absence of another wonderful talent
<START> a refreshing interview with the legendary italian cinematographer producer director who passed away in 1999 with close to 200 features to his credit as director a large portion is spent on <UNK> <UNK> sex films including his notorious <UNK> entries with laura <UNK> they also briefly cover his porn career which kept him <UNK> during his last decade or so more interesting to me is the section focusing on his horror and action efforts <UNK> has plenty of great <UNK> about actors and his low budget film making including a story about an assistant accidentally collecting real bones amid the fake ones while shooting in a 2 000 year old other <UNK> include george <UNK> and al <UNK> i would have liked a bit more conversation about his <UNK> <UNK> productions not a single question about <UNK> 2 granted it wasn't the cult film then it was now
<START> charlie <UNK> little tramp or little man character wins world war i called the great war at the time single <UNK> even capturing the <UNK> something the entire allied armed forces were unable to do too bad it all turns out to be a dream which is somewhat of a cop out and the weakest part of this mesmerizing silent short almost a feature film at <UNK> minutes br br there are inventive gags <UNK> including charlie having to put on a gas mask to eat <UNK> cheese sent from home then using the cheese as a weapon against the germans charlie sleeping underwater in a <UNK> <UNK> next to a soldier he continues to annoy charlie <UNK> himself as a tree one of his best sketches ever and charlie pretending to beat up his friend who has become a <UNK> then <UNK> him when the enemy is out of sight br br one amazing feature is how much charlie when he is behind enemy lines dressed as a german resembles hitler over ten years before hitler and his nazi thugs rose to dominate german politics obviously hitler <UNK> his appearance after charlie's from this film
<START> the movie touches the soul of the audience very much some scene in the movie is ultimate and tears comes out automatically i'm surprised by seeing this movie that any director can direct this type of movie in the year <UNK> as a student of cinema i can say this movie helps a lot to understand use of montage first time when our teacher told us about this movie means genre of this movie we thought nothing could be there in this movie to understand but finally when sir explained it then we came to know how great this movie is lastly i can say it helps a lot understanding films and being a cinema student i can the viewers that they can see this movie
<START> this movie is on the level with welcome home <UNK> <UNK> for biggest pieces of garbage that have ever hit the silver screen if these guys weren't adam <UNK> gay friends this script would have ended up where it should have as some big time movie toilet paper i hate this movie it makes me want to <UNK> people i will admit that i have high standards but honestly i'd rather watch step up 2 the ultra sad part was when i <UNK> onto imdb and read that you pieces of trash actually gave this movie a 6 9 rating this is a testament to all of the <UNK> in our society that will go watch terrible movies that are just hour and a half long dick fart and <UNK> jokes with little to no originality after seeing this rating i would like to suggest tyler <UNK> house of pain to all of you guys who enjoyed this film you'll see some high quality humor there on about the same level of this <UNK> abomination
<START> ordinary decent criminal is sad because it is obviously trying to succeed and equally obviously hasn't a chance in hell of making it apparently <UNK> to the absence of a clear sense of purpose a abysmal failure at <UNK> irish comedy with spacey as a thief who enjoys the cops and his competition becoming a sort of folk hero in his own mind this flick manages to be mildly amusing when it's trying to be funny slightly more than boring when it's trying to be interesting and forget sentimental or poignant or endearing though it takes shots at those qualities as well ordinary decent criminal has a clumsy screenplay naive direction <UNK> execution thin story poor casting mediocre acting and eventually becomes lost in itself and sinks into a <UNK> of hopeless mediocrity pass on this one d
<START> when underdog the cartoon <UNK> in 1964 at the age of 7 i was hooked immediately he was top dog pun intended in my book that is until batman premiered on abc a year or so later even when it was clear that disney was going to make a live action version of the once popular saturday morning cartoon it was equally clear to me that it was going to be a piece of crap even reading the reviews in the papers seemed to confirm this however i made it a point to a never attempt to write a review unless i have seen the movie from start to finish and b never to spend one red <UNK> on a movie that i'm almost certain i will hate br br thanks to youtube i a am fully <UNK> to write this review and b it only cost me <UNK> minutes of my hard earned time br br it also proves my point namely that this movie is not merely a piece of crap it's a steaming pile of dog <UNK> it resembles the tv series in name only even though they almost got it right with simon and <UNK> br br all in all underdog is a huge waste of time and money which thankfully i didn't have to spend br br rating 1 2 out of
<START> the only reason i rented the movie was to see <UNK> ryan in it <UNK> that was the most boring pointless movie i've ever seen how lame i mean really give me a break after voyager i'd hope she'd be offered better roles br br if i were one of the last people on earth i would not still be living in a travel trailer in the <UNK> this is just such a bad movie the thing about the indian tribe and how he compared it every 10 seconds really really got old poor <UNK> better luck next time
<START> i actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule and amazingly i found it really original i have commented on other <UNK> films before and i agree that <UNK> movies tend to have a similar scheme and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous <UNK> but let's face it the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated unfortunately this is how real people speak the storyline and the pacing are brilliant and it could be to any country in the world the acting was great and the script is to me one of the best ones ever produced in <UNK> <UNK> i think that anyone around the globe can get a good one hour and a half of entertainment with a beautifully well directed <UNK> black humor comedy it kind of reminded me of films like snatch and others of the sort i highly recommend it and hope it can be viewed by more people since <UNK> movies seem to have started to be more <UNK> focused since last year
<START> this is a low grade cold war propaganda film crossed with a it may have some long term significance as a <UNK> of 1950s us thinking but there is little else to <UNK> in the <UNK> storyline wooden acting and grating style there are some interesting photos of long gone aircraft but that was not enough for even this aircraft <UNK> to leave it on the screen for the full length
<START> a complete and utter <UNK> of my precious two hours the entire movie could have been made in less than 60 seconds by simply showing people getting <UNK> up a car crashing people getting more <UNK> up people having sex people crying and people getting more <UNK> up the <UNK> for this movie should have read come see how f up our characters are they're stoned they're coke <UNK> they're a mess who are these people do you really care does it matter just give us your money please because we sure don't care about anything else an absolutely terrible movie it never went anywhere you never got to know the characters they never even said what these people did to earn such a big house and so much money and cars and coke and it was just downright boring you might like the movie a little more if you're a <UNK> yourself but for the vast majority of us that aren't this movie is a waste of film and of time
<START> seriously i don't understand how justin long is becoming increasingly popular he either has the best agent in hollywood or recently sold his soul to satan he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing the only film that he has attempted to anchor that i've remotely enjoyed was waiting and that is almost solely because i've worked in a restaurant but i <UNK> aside from it's terrible lead this film has loads of other i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive lewis <UNK> considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most <UNK> when he is <UNK> which the pg 13 rating certainly won't allow the film's sole bright spot was <UNK> hill who will look almost <UNK> to fans of the recent <UNK> due to the amount of weight he lost in the <UNK> his one liners were funny on occasion but were certainly not enough to make this anywhere close to bearable if you just want to completely turn your brain off or better yet don't have one then maybe you'd enjoy this but i can't recommend it at all
<START> a tedious mixture of <UNK> efforts at humour with romantic relationship melodrama fails to provide this <UNK> made film with any <UNK> of reality as action opens reno a j <UNK> enters his apartment there discovering his girlfriend in <UNK> <UNK> with his roommate who <UNK> tells reno well at least it's with someone you know resulting in <UNK> decision to never have another roommate this decision told to viewers by means of a soon abandoned voice over the storyline then proceeds ten months where we find that reno is indeed true to his word concerning <UNK> of roommates although this appears to beg the question due to his <UNK> of a live in lover holly holly fields with whom he has generated marital plans the plot briefly shifts to a sleazy hollywood strip club <UNK> <UNK> uncle <UNK> <UNK> of a dancer whom he finds <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> over dead <UNK> the <UNK> bar after seeing the <UNK> charms displayed by the object of his affections it is apparent that <UNK> had been aware of the flawed condition of his heart because he created a video tape during which his commentary <UNK> his large and <UNK> in hollywood to reno and we see the latter deciding to contrary to his <UNK> interview <UNK> for two roommates as <UNK> with he and holly sharing the selection process in an organized manner following an inane sequence involving bizarre <UNK> candidates all of whom reno and holly <UNK> find <UNK> for living along with them in their house they unknown to each other each <UNK> a <UNK> of the opposite sex with the lovers <UNK> cool toward the choice of their partner the <UNK> <UNK> and nicole would seem to have little discernible point to their existence other than highly <UNK> <UNK> with a broad range of partners and it is not long before jealousy mars the <UNK> relationship of reno and holly reno is bent upon and <UNK> a type of sporting travel bag and as he has given an engagement ring to holly the potential success of this <UNK> adventure is of great financial significance if he <UNK> to advance his marital plan unfortunately the <UNK> team of <UNK> and nicole whose every action is ostensibly laced with lust is likely to <UNK> any future wedding intentions of reno direction is slack <UNK> far from fulfilling basic needs of the players although an <UNK> composed script provides <UNK> material with which actors may work and ad <UNK> falls embarrassingly flat as a result the performances are <UNK> not aided by <UNK> editing while the manner of camera work changes as abruptly and often as a tail light filmed with a low budget and on location only a <UNK> of skill is required for the <UNK> <UNK> but a larger measure of value might have been placed upon the tasteless d j background soundtrack generally <UNK> and nearly always <UNK> a good deal of discussion has been <UNK> by the movie's final sequences that are apparently not expected by a viewer based upon what has come before but in reality these <UNK> probably the only thoughtful portions of a poorly <UNK> screenplay and <UNK> fair to make the work almost watchable despite the <UNK> quality of the production as a whole
<START> officially the first martial arts movie in <UNK> cinematography featuring actual martial artists like and russian bruce lee bad people a ship in the high <UNK> but fortunately just about everybody on board is a trained martial artist a <UNK> for martial arts <UNK>
<START> if this is film noir then noir must be french for <UNK> slow take a cast of completely unlikeable characters give them nothing to say <UNK> the whole thing with gratuitous ultra violence and you've got the formula for an <UNK> dash could be subtitled sleazy hollywood types attempt to make money from <UNK> rip off bruce <UNK> one minute part is orders of <UNK> better than anything else in this flick by the way i didn't like the film
<START> okay i marked this spoiler so don't be upset when i wrap this up now i went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie and i was right as almost every horror flick i have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most what helped was the story i did not expect there to be a why to <UNK> madness but there was and while somewhat <UNK> you still got the idea and understand the madness now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for but if your a fan of saw or some other movies that claim their fame thanks to sadistic content this is a movie to watch now where i really throw in a spoiler for a second warning i give this movie a 9 perhaps because i'm a fan of the wwe and a fan of kane but who doesn't like a movie a little bit better when it stars somebody we love however this movie could have scored a 10 for me if spoiler at the end of the movie when it showed kane dead on the <UNK> while a dog <UNK> in his eye was cute it could have been classic with the kane undertaker quick sit up and turn of the head a perfect 10 would have been awarded if that would have happened it was a perfect opportunity but either the wwe didn't think of that or a future sequel will begin with that very sequence i mentioned that's all 9
<START> the producers of this film should be <UNK> for the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> namely the advanced <UNK> dragons <UNK> <UNK> fear and ignorance breed the sort of mindless propaganda that inspire garbage like this film if any of you have any doubts about the innocence of <UNK> dragons why don't you go to your local <UNK> store and see about sitting in with a <UNK> group so you can see for yourself that d d is nothing to be afraid of
<START> one of the dumbest movies in the history of cinema wait i take that back this movie can't be included in any category related to cinema it belongs in categories like waste <UNK> or similar categories ironically it's even about two <UNK> the movie is men at work a lightweight crime comedy starring the <UNK> sheen brothers from 1990 setting aside the <UNK> and implausible plot line bad acting bad dialogue poorly executed stunts and slapstick continuity errors and high rate of no name actors never to be seen again all in all it was a pretty bad movie anyway at its core i mean it was the kind of movie that might be good for one thing you can watch it about 200 times learn every line and in a campy kind of way repeat them back and forth in public with your wasted friends thus <UNK> your status as the biggest <UNK> in your <UNK> grade class br br to make matters worse i actually <UNK> an imdb trivia entry along with this bad review to the movie's imdb web page if only because i spotted a silly little punk music joke that apparently nobody else spotted yet about the <UNK> statue i'm so conflicted about why i should even waste my time <UNK> what looks like a supportive trivia note when what i really want to do is blow up acting career no wait he's already done that himself thanks dude i'm so glad i wasted only time on this not real money for that matter can i maybe have at least one <UNK> of their budget anyone other than this director <UNK> could have made two or three much better movies with just what they spent blowing up cars carefully placing bikini clad <UNK> in the background and beating up useless extras henchmen in <UNK> suits i'd mention writing credit but it would be a stretch to call this screenplay writing it's more like <UNK> <UNK> cartoon ideas and charlie sheen if you're reading this i assume m a w must have been made during the part of your career in which you were a <UNK> up hooker loving hollywood brat who had not grown up yet <UNK> sorry i guess that part of your life isn't over yet get well soon you half a man such a promising talent so wasted  oh look there's that word again
<START> this movie is without a doubt the best i have seen in my entire life the stellar star cast is only an added bonus over the amazing special effects and profound story and sublime choreography the movie is about an ancient love affair that <UNK> down into the modern world two lovers in heaven the wrath of a great <UNK> and are cursed subsequently the woman is born again on earth while she is in college she is raped and commits suicide the rest of the movie basically focuses on the hunting down of the people who were associated with the rape by her lover who possesses <UNK> strength and the <UNK> of several languages delivers a very mature and deep performance in this film and all the other actors do almost as well <UNK> action scenes with akshay kumar are mind blowing and must not be missed you simply have to watch this movie
<START> it has been since 1972 that i saw this movie and i still remember it as one of my favorite all time movies i would buy a copy if it were on dvd and it is too bad it isn't you would think that anything starring peter sellers would be brought back much better than being there and as good as the pink <UNK> series <UNK> <UNK> had a small part for such a well <UNK> performer she is bonus in this movie i think the medical field may not appreciate this film as it really makes fun of the profession and it also makes one appreciate that sellers was never available to treat them as his bed side manner sucked as well did his analysis of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> you may not believe this but when the credits to this movie rolled i looked for the director's name when i saw it i burned it into my memory and i never forgot it this movie is beyond terrible it makes ed <UNK> films look like <UNK> welles at least b movies are entertaining this was a soul <UNK> experience the quality was so bad i began to wonder who allowed this to happen br br i hear uwe boll runs <UNK> miles a day this is because wherever his movies are viewed the people must run him out of town with flame and <UNK> the script was terrible the lighting was like that of a high school football game and the cinematography was just above the quality of roger bigfoot video the acting was executed by people too ashamed of the production to say their lines with any credibility in the end was a film alan <UNK> wouldn't have put his name on i learned that day to avoid any movie by this man despite the circumstances from what i hear this is not a bad thing to do
<START> one wonders how flynn could have failed so badly as a cinema release in 1997 with guy <UNK> <UNK> in the lead role it is not often that the casting of someone so famous is so exactly right flynn was a at the box office and did not end up on cinema screens in australia even after la <UNK> from a dazzling nude scene in the first few minutes presumably by guy <UNK> flynn gets off to a fairly <UNK> and interesting start sadly flynn runs out of steam after about the first 35 minutes and with the entrance of hammy steven <UNK> in a <UNK> to new guinea looking and acting like he wanted the <UNK> kinski role in the film starts to resemble a <UNK> movie rather than a major cinema biography believe it or not by about the 70 minute make it is boring and you are glad to see it over but such promise <UNK> is flynn but the movie caused a <UNK> at the box office and unlike the bounty <UNK> without trace
<START> three words piece of art this film is just great it's beautiful sad frightening and thought provoking at the same time the score constantly stays in my head the acting is wonderful the scenery scary and beautiful at the same time br br it was more by chance than on purpose that i saw this movie at the time i decided to watch this movie i was just bored and read lists of asian films which maybe good well i saw the title a tale of two sisters which sounded very interesting then i read the summary of the plot and decided you don't just watch this film you've gotta buy it said done i bought this film and was hooked from the very first minute br br the plot kept me interested from the beginning till the end the twist near the end of the film made me scream i really didn't see something like this coming and the ending scene made me cry it just made me cry it was so sad br br well i recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a film that combines an interesting plot with scary scenes and atmosphere although you should be aware of the fact that the ending is as i mentioned before a very sad one but this just fits in the mood of the film doesn't it
<START> i wrote spoiler alert but there's not really much that can be spoiled it's like spoiling rotten meat this movie is probably the worst i've ever seen not because of the actors or the special effects but because of the sheer number of mistakes both factual and physical first of all the <UNK> aren't actually <UNK> at all they're <UNK> and they're french and how the heck can dad <UNK> the <UNK> his son makes to fight off the <UNK> without a g suit and why would <UNK> try to board his plane without a g suit and how could doug defeat the enemy pilot ace with such ease anyway i did not like this movie and the worst part is that it has 3 sequels the latest one from as late as 1995 now that's scary
<START> i believe there are two angles to the story first it's the world <UNK> view presented in an obvious <UNK> manner <UNK> the <UNK> spectacle behind some of life's most common but also pleasant or comfortable moments and elements which are usually enough to keep man <UNK> in society like a good job a good home a good wife a good car and even a good mistress apart from this so called common bliss there are some who cannot help asking themselves some more uncomfortable questions like where they come from or weather they can have some other form of bliss weather there could be a reason for them being or weather there could be something they missed out on or even more sinister weather there could be something the system itself is <UNK> from them br br second the most interesting aspect of this film i believe is the fact that it attacks head on this natural <UNK> to <UNK> the world around us questioning it by our personal judgment and usually <UNK> it because it doesn't serve us better because it's not <UNK> made to suit us as a person br br the symbolism behind the train accident i believe suggests that our own will can be <UNK> by fate or some other universal greater power even in the face of our so called power to decide when we want out instead the man gets to be <UNK> by this greater power let's call it the system because the authors clearly avoid calling it god perhaps further <UNK> that the system is man made and therefore can be <UNK> by man unlike fate which is a concept closer to religion on it's own terms not by killing him but by showing him that there is a place for the man who asks wants too much suggesting maybe that true <UNK> does not come from the outside world but from within and if the outside world decides to provide you with some comfort you should learn to accept it without questioning the fabric of every little aspect of it br br <UNK> but makes you <UNK> some existential questions which have become mainstream in the last century like what can man do in a world increasingly <UNK> of substance a <UNK> driven world in which man can be <UNK> without making a difference to the bigger picture but only as long as he is of some use to the system
<START> well i think i've finally seen my last woody allen movie i read the review in the newspaper and went to see this movie with the expectation of having a good woody allen experience as i've had many times in the past well that was not the case this movie has nothing to offer even with the wonderful performance by the talented sean penn this movie failed one of the features of his other movies is multiple characters variety witty dialogue this movie basically consisted of only one character very one dimensional it had almost no laughs it probably looked good on paper i think the only thing special was the performance of samantha <UNK> now i'll be looking for her movies in the future so in conclusion this movie was a major disappointment
<START> okay now i am pretty sure that my summary got your attention and my commenting that <UNK> <UNK> is satan is not without some basis let me explain the film at first appears to be a dandy b movie about an evil organization called the crooked circle and their <UNK> of revenge in the form of murder on a rival organization dedicated to solving crimes while this is very odd especially the idea of a club of private citizens who solve crimes and could have been interesting this film falls apart despite a rather impressive list of familiar supporting actors why well because <UNK> <UNK> never one of my favorite actresses spends most of the movie whining just like <UNK> <UNK> with a bad <UNK> while murders are being committed people are being kidnapped or whatever you can always count on <UNK> whining at full volume almost like someone's obnoxious 3 year old who wants everyone at a party to pay attention to her at the same time she's not an integral part of the film but received top billing why she is even there is beyond me i assume it's just to <UNK> and yell as a result i found the movie practically unwatchable and it was completely ruined now you probably know why i referred to this actress of dubious talent as satan i'm sure that when the actors in this film saw the final product they too felt pretty much the same way i did about her horrible overacting and amateurish performance br br this film is in the public <UNK> and can be found for free <UNK> on the internet i can see why
<START> this gem captures early 80's life brilliantly as a <UNK> <UNK> boy br br myself i must say that valley girl along with fast times at br br <UNK> high stands out as the class of the teen sex film br br genre the characters are accurate <UNK> of the era the br br vapid mall chicks pseudo punk rebels <UNK> <UNK> are all br br represented here br br i have seen this over ten times now the music in the film was top br br notch unfortunately these tunes could were never as popular in br br their era as those by <UNK> like journey <UNK> or br br before the soundtrack existed i searched out records br br and tapes it was the 80's after all of <UNK> <UNK> sparks br br and modern english br br this movie deserves respect it isn't just a good 80's teen flick it is br br a great film period
<START> taut <UNK> political thriller taking square aim at the controversial us policy of rendition another appalling <UNK> ian phrase <UNK> damage anyone for the illegal <UNK> even torture of terrorist suspects by passing due legal process the <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> by the egyptian chief of police himself the target of a <UNK> suicide bomb plot thus <UNK> the two main plot lines of the movie both work very well the bombing set piece graphic and chilling in its realism with its denouement revealed in a stylish tarantino type flashback and the torture scenes on an innocent man also <UNK> portrayed in all their gory detail the film scores telling points about the use of torture as a credible means of intelligence gathering in the war against terrorists and against the <UNK> <UNK> here <UNK> by a suitable cold meryl streep as the cia boss who casually gives the order for rendition which can ruin innocent lives never mind <UNK> fiction think more the recent killing of the innocent brazilian in london in 2005 with the head of the <UNK> police still in his job and no one tried for the poor man's murder the acting is excellent throughout the two key roles of the innocent man and terrorist <UNK> are realistically and <UNK> played by the unfamiliar actors omar and similarly as the <UNK> chief of police and as his idealistic <UNK> daughter ring true with their performances their lack of <UNK> at least to me adding to their characters' credibility of the bigger hollywood names present <UNK> stature grows with <UNK> films here playing the initially detached but later conscience stricken and <UNK> government man who does the right thing in the end <UNK> plays her <UNK> wife part mainly in one key but is believable all the same while david <UNK> and alan arkin convincingly show up self serving <UNK> and their <UNK> <UNK> only go so far to help you until their career <UNK> are <UNK> there are a few weaknesses plot wise there's little dramatic need to create the suspense surrounding el escape and <UNK> character is perhaps too obvious a <UNK> man woman worst of all is the meaningless inclusion of <UNK> on the spot girlfriend around merely for decoration and a brief gratuitous love scene on the whole though an engrossing thought provoking cinematic experience
<START> there are several ways to <UNK> this movie and a couple of them have been shown in some of the past comments this is a movie to be <UNK> as a free recreation of a known subject and therefore not to be compared with the opera the book or other carmen movies seen before it just stands for itself and i must say that this carmen does it very well it is a mistake to compare because that is the first step to deny movies the chance to be <UNK> creative works of art <UNK> is a master of atmosphere and the art direction the costumes and the photography are extremely well put together to achieve a pleasing aesthetic experience let's take it as it is br br and that brings us to the next <UNK> someone complains about the typical spanish clichés in the movie well historically the movie is extremely well <UNK> and you can see the results of that very serious work in every scene it is not only an accurate portrait of the black spain of knife and that <UNK> portrayed so vividly but it's also of that part of history as seen by a <UNK> fascinated with the <UNK> side of that society honestly anyone who doesn't want to see any cliché about spain shouldn't buy a ticket to see carmen but in this case those clichés are presented before they became one and the way to see them is getting rid of our own prejudices br br another important <UNK> to understand this movie properly is to speak the language it is not acceptable to criticize any actor performance for not having understood his or her lines if all the rest of the audience did the problem most likely lies somewhere else paz vega has an <UNK> <UNK> with her <UNK> accent and all she says is understandable and credible her <UNK> partner <UNK> gives also a convincing portrait of the <UNK> officer that became a <UNK> and her accent is very well learned br br no less important is to have a <UNK> open approach to the material to say that paz vega is horrible suggests that the author of the phrase entered the theater for the wrong reasons we already had in spain a critic in one of the most <UNK> papers that used to recommend us pictures he found <UNK> <UNK> without mentioning it <UNK> and that was not totally fair for the rest of us especially for the ones that hadn't <UNK> that the man was writing with parts of his <UNK> that many readers didn't necessarily had to care for i'm not suggesting at all that the reviewer had the same motivation but the expectations must have been different as the ones of those among us that went to see a talented and beautiful actress play an almost classic role because that's what we got paz vega is carmen and an excellent one in <UNK> movie
<START> this is definitely one of the weaker of the series of carry on films it lacks the usual fun and <UNK> and even the cast seem embarrassed by the poor dialogue by the time this came out the series was in <UNK> decline and boy does it show if you're coming fresh to this series avoid this one till near the end
<START> i hadn't planned on watching because i didn't like that much i thought was a nice but slightly boring little bank robbers movie with a sensational <UNK> of stars anyway i was talked into watching one night and i <UNK> it a lot the plot is not only boring but also senseless i honestly don't even know what it was all about i left the movie after 3 quarters and got some coffee with another girl who didn't like it much more pleasure i can tell you that but even the guys who stayed till the end later reported to me that the plot continued being awful and useless my advice don't watch go watch team america hilarious btw and forget about <UNK> twelve br br in my opinion the most boring and senseless peace of crap to be on the screen in years
<START> remember the wooden <UNK> literary adaptations of the 1970s at their worst you will when you see this <UNK> acted unintentionally hilarious piece of chocolate box adaptation most <UNK> of all is catherine z j who while undeniably easy on the eye <UNK> <UNK> a big dress and looking <UNK> for actually turning in a performance played <UNK> faced like a melodrama or cold comfort farm without the jokes this effort is not helped by a scriptwriter with a tin ear for dialogue who misses entirely the <UNK> sense of irony or tragedy a shame given the quality of the acting talent on offer joan <UNK> claire <UNK> steven <UNK> all deserve better than this
<START> set in the near future a dark stranger walks into some southern american city plagued by zombies <UNK> with a group of friendly face inhabitants our stranger learns the harsh realities of city life there are two groups of people the upper classes who <UNK> safely behind the <UNK> walls of the city being provided by at the right price the state police then there are our friendly face inhabitants these lower class folks live along side the zombies there only means of survival is to trade goods which they for during the day with the police in exchange for <UNK> of food our stranger discovers why his world is plague by zombies a new <UNK> that <UNK> the <UNK> for was the foundation the human <UNK> desire to shed fat caused the down fall of society as we know it these <UNK> <UNK> the desire for <UNK> i e meat even the pet <UNK> however there was one more grave side affect after death people became <UNK> with an even stronger <UNK> for <UNK> namely human flesh br br with what i feel is an imaginative introduction i felt that this film many realise some inventive material what better way could explain the cause of the zombie race than by a contemporary idea of people's desire to make any sacrifice to change their body without the hard work of the gym however the imagination of this film soon stopped after this exposition this film falls into the old trap of 'i can not imagine what the world will be like when society when you watch this film you do not escape to a different world as you do when you watch planet of the apes original alien mad max or texas chain saw original in this film the alternate society is define by people with hair <UNK> orange and green face paint and charity shop leather <UNK> there is no <UNK> about life in this alternate society just healthy faces and over made up zombies films should allow you to escape not remind you that you need to clear out your wardrobe and take your old <UNK> to the charity shop br br forget about some of the pitiful acting or the over made up zombies this film fails because it is too polished too <UNK> and too predictable i have watch films like this since the early eighties if you are going the make a film of this nature i suggest you need to watch again such films as dawn of the dead original and remake threads or <UNK> zombie to see and experience that feeling of desperation in a <UNK> society
<START> this is one of t v 's greatest mini series it comes to life almost as well as the book did also the cast was outstanding to play the roles i'd recommend this movie series for anyone who likes the civil war or the history leading up to it
<START> how can stuff like this still be made didn't seinfeld arrested development the office etc etc kill this old fashioned unfunny crap off apparently not br br i'm actually quite a fan of michael <UNK> and have enjoyed his various cameos and supporting roles <UNK> friends but in this he sucks but anyone would struggle with this script br br my wife enjoys it but she's brazilian and if you've ever seen a typical brazilian sit com you would understand why she would think this so funny br br just to demonstrate how predictable the show is and to prove a point with her i guessed what the next 3 or 4 plot developments lines would be while watching it for a while and was correct almost word for word i felt very smug this annoyed my wife as she hates it when i do that can understand why but i felt good so screw it
<START> the first full length film featuring the <UNK> characters wallace and <UNK> manages to bring in elements of all the previous half hour show which aired on television br br wallace runs a company to <UNK> capture rogue <UNK> from people's <UNK> gardens and has the bright idea to try out his invention on the hapless <UNK> once they're caught of course as in other wallace and <UNK> films things don't quite work out as planned br br similarly to a close <UNK> there's a love interest for wallace in this case the village lady posh and a big mean villain with a <UNK> dog <UNK> is beautifully animated with a wide range of expressions making the character laugh out loud funny and of course peter provides the voice of wallace again and is a perfect fit br br and as in a grand day out cheese features heavily to great comedic effect as the film moves along br br on the negative side this film is a little on the long side there are great effects and some pieces which make you sit up and watch but perhaps this story would have worked better as another short subject rather than pushing it to feature length
<START> if you are among the imdb audience that put high <UNK> in the all time top 200 then this movie probably is not for you this film is as as steve <UNK> is self <UNK> hip <UNK> <UNK> is excellent as a hip <UNK> magazine writer who returns to her suburban bucks county nest in order to care for mother streep who delivers yet another hall of fame performance william hurt is <UNK> cast and the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> husband if this movie doesn't move you to cry and laugh then you are much too hip to enjoy it
<START> i was pleasantly surprised to find a very enjoyable film that kept my attention throughout i am a horror fan and i see almost everything in that genre but dead line managed to freak me out the pace is very cleverly set and <UNK> does a good performance as a desperate man what is underneath the main plot a trip to madness how can you end up like that martin sanders ask him self while he sees a homeless speaking to him self alone in the street close to the end of the film the character of aaron <UNK> asks the same question while he sees another homeless doing the same thing not knowing yet that this homeless is martin sanders answering the question of the beginning of the film the broken <UNK> in two are a clear symbol of <UNK> and division of personality the ending is jaw dropping and you just know that a sequel would have to be made
<START> the description of the mood of the movie may be considered as a spoiler because there is not much action in fact br br great one br br is it for my peculiar interest for the and is it for the atmosphere of the movie or is there some more magic if yes it is for sure the <UNK> human one br br this film is no doubt extremely artistic artificial depends on taste i can imagine most of the people who hate to watch slow movies and those of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who i didn't enjoy other times are one of the <UNK> that i know suffering during the movie yes people are unable to slow down and to let time pass and to watch it without feeling they waste it one can take this piece as torture or as a therapy br br the topic at the surface the lack of communication even if we live in rabbit <UNK> one next to each other but not really together people are tired sick of something and unable to describe it just don't want to meet touch talk confront the others like if they had disappeared the big block of <UNK> looks void and the rain falling constantly evokes the strange melancholy inside and sometimes it must be something <UNK> unexpected some <UNK> <UNK> as a hole in the floor of <UNK> that allows us to reach each other br br one of the possible ways to look at it is this don't <UNK> the inner world of the characters consider the whole movie space to be inside of yourself and ask why is it there where could these <UNK> states and <UNK> come form is there a place for them they don't have a right to be here and search for the answers if you need them among the walls and <UNK> of the block instead of inside hardly transparent mind of a man br br the key to understand is not to understand to let a movie borrow us as a subject of study inside itself and at the end safely return us to our more colorful and normal looking reality br br then maybe you will reach like me the feeling of real possible non pathetic hope that in core we are still humans and this state of mind can help one much to live in this world
<START> let me first state that i really really wanted to like this film for the most part the actors and actresses looked their parts and did fairly well in their roles but the movie lacked any real plot it seemed so up in seeming that no interesting story ever <UNK> through also the camera work was often sloppy attempting camera work and failing miserably most of the time shots meant to look cool ended up being confusing perhaps something was lost during translation but some of the characters were just stupid the crazy pretty boy who <UNK> people like a dog ok overall a fat <UNK> 1 10 not worth your time
<START> there have been several comments already on the site focusing on the <UNK> feel of the film and there is a lot of heavy weight talent on show from <UNK> and scott thomas to the <UNK> rendered design and <UNK> to the <UNK> direction no wonder that andrew lloyd <UNK> acceptance speech for <UNK> at that year's oscars began well thank god that the english patient had no songs in it writing of oscar winners takes me to juliette <UNK> who in a stellar cast gives a beautiful performance it is <UNK> to see that the dynamics which seem to influence the award for best actor often going to <UNK> display aren't at work in the female categories just as emma <UNK> hugely well deserved oscar for her portrayal of margaret in <UNK> end proved that one of the hardest things that an actor can do is make the portrayal of goodness involving so <UNK> win proved that it could be that and seriously sexy her performance in this terrific film is a thing of beauty
<START> first i have to admit that i have had some doubts about the director he has done some movies with about the recent czech east history or more precisely about families individuals how did they survive some historical moments but it was always like the food sour sweet this movie was totally different it was pure it shows the bones of life it shows the variations of human <UNK> this film is an excellent piece of art story acting picture music but it shows you the life around you in much <UNK> light that we don't want to see by the way i have saw it on a dvd with english subtitles but i am afraid that in the usa i wont be able to get it
<START> this was one of the shows that i wanted to follow up on but i'd just couldn't bring myself on <UNK> my time to this show to have a show that centers on the topic of politics you really need a strong plot with twists and turns to enhance the mood of the show something like the west wing or commander in chief rob lowe was ok but actors like kyle chandler just couldn't act he was awful in early edition it was a pain to sit through this show with its lack of suspense urgency and characters who can actually act i just had to give up on this show and am glad it was canceled so i would have nothing more to miss br br grade d
<START> poorly acted poorly written and poorly directed special effects are cheap best performance is by <UNK> but that's not saying much story is a confusing mess about corporate greed leading to <UNK> of a space station and an attempt to rescue those stranded aboard br br there is little suspense and even less action there's one car chase that's not bad but the rest of the movie is simply a waste of everyone's time
<START> <UNK> br br usa the <UNK> uk <UNK> br br aspect ratio 1 85 1 br br sound format <UNK> <UNK> sr br br following a series of bizarre and apparently unrelated an experienced tokyo detective ken <UNK> the help of a young <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who believes the victims were acting on a post hypnotic suggestion but their subsequent <UNK> reveal an even darker force at work linked to a young girl <UNK> whose life has been <UNK> by sadistic abuse br br based on a novel by this <UNK> plotted mystery takes inspiration from a variety of sources italian <UNK> traditional japanese ghost stories etc though some of the images in the climactic showdown reveal a more immediate influence the recent commercial success of <UNK> <UNK> ring 1998 for all its ambition however <UNK> is a routine <UNK> which stumbles badly after a <UNK> opening the are particularly impressive despite some feeble cgi effects though director <UNK> who co wrote the script with <UNK> <UNK> proceedings for an extended finale in which the startling secrets are finally revealed is best known for his film adaptation of novel turned video game <UNK> eve 1997 which also starred leading man <UNK> a member of japanese pop group <UNK> and while <UNK> echoes that movie's strong visual sense it falls short as drama and most of the characters are mere <UNK> <UNK> the emotional pay off which is a shame because the final half hour is <UNK> by a series of dynamic set pieces most notably a concert hall sequence in which <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is transformed into an <UNK> of murder and is well served by an excellent production team however those <UNK> by the promise of gory carnage may be disappointed the film is long on <UNK> and short on splatter br br performances are varied due to the <UNK> limitations but <UNK> <UNK> is outstanding as a young woman suffering from multiple personality disorder which the subtitles on the print under review <UNK> us isn't recognized as a <UNK> medical condition in japan who falls prey to a sleazy tv <UNK> <UNK> a prime suspect in the murders <UNK> is bland in a one dimensional role and he's constantly <UNK> by a veteran performer whose career stretches back to the series of the 1950's br br japanese dialogue
<START> well i was hoping i'd heard wrong about this film as i'm a big fan of <UNK> <UNK> and really didn't want to see him slip up but unfortunately this giallo <UNK> supernatural load of nonsense is just as bad as i'd been lead to believe it would be and that's pretty terrible the plot doesn't work at all as the film attempts to blend murders and a supernatural theme through a <UNK> and it all feels very forced and silly furthermore the plot doesn't make much sense at all and you have to ask yourself what's the point numerous times throughout the movie the plot focuses on a young woman living in an apartment block and being <UNK> by a <UNK> the best thing about the movie is undoubtedly the presence of the beautiful english actress charlotte lewis and unfortunately the good points pretty much stop there there are a handful of deaths scenes some of which are gory but all of which are incredibly stupid the one that sees someone get killed by <UNK> sticks out especially in that respect overall i really can't recommend this to anyone non <UNK> fans are unlikely to impressed and <UNK> fans are likely to find the film depressing avoid
<START> a heist film with jean reno matt damon and laurence fishburne sounds great on paper i suspect it must have done when someone green <UNK> the production of this movie but the end product is terrible br br the story is dull the action boring and for a film that is only <UNK> minutes it seems to just drag on i could feel my life <UNK> away and was sure there was something better i should have been doing any paint to watch dry somewhere perhaps br br sigh i'm a huge fan of jean reno but what on earth was he thinking when he signed up to this there are so many other great action movies around go watch one of those and let this movie be best forgotten
<START> i heard an interview with the main actor who said that the film was not intended to be a horror movie but he himself would describe it as mental horror i strongly <UNK> to that br br it is not clear why he travels to this place but everything there is monotonous no bright colors no honest smiles nothing personal everything is ordered and everyone seems to be satisfied living this kind of life our hero though from the beginning seems to be misplaced and feels it himself br br what makes this film so important and good is the remarkable similarity to life in many large cities or even countries nowadays you have to function you are not supposed to let your colleague know your weaknesses you show off on your wealth your car etc and most of all you lack the true love of life that children have naturally in this film you see neither children nor old people they simply do not fit in a society of strong workers br br i would recommend this film to everyone and make sure that this <UNK> does not come true
<START> no way out 2007 was a really bad and if it is the road to <UNK> they choose the wrong road br br chris benoit the hardy boys <UNK> <UNK> in my view this was the best match of the night some good wrestling here but not much 7 10 br br championship open which <UNK> <UNK> won awful no high flying at all really quick and boring 3 10 br br little bastard <UNK> <UNK> little <UNK> the <UNK> this was more comedy than wrestling some laughs 5 10 br br kane <UNK> king booker a decent effort by these two but they could do better 6 10 br br wwe tag team championship paul london brian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> domino another boring match no high flying by the <UNK> 4 10 br br <UNK> world title mr kennedy <UNK> bobby <UNK> in my mind the worst match of the night truly awful i thought <UNK> was no rules i was wrong 2 10 br br john cena shawn michaels <UNK> <UNK> the undertaker an okay match but could have been a hell of a lot better 6 10 br br overall this was <UNK> it id give it a 3 10
<START> this is one of the better feel good films of 1999 with kate <UNK> leading an all star cast about a small town and a love letter first off the scenery is beautiful and anyone who sees this film and doesn't want to move to this location is crazy for the cast <UNK> is stunning as the lead actress who <UNK> the emotional roller coaster role tom everett scott is charming as the author of the note throughout the film and the always delightful ellen <UNK> is hilarious <UNK> <UNK> and the actress who plays the <UNK> <UNK> are both terrific too although it was <UNK> the film is great as it is both short and sweet and well as very romantic 10 10
<START> the director <UNK> this film with false depth by repeating a gimmick throughout the film every single shot in this movie is 3 times longer than it needs to be you could easily cut out 1 5 hours of this <UNK> long 2 5 hour film without <UNK> one word of dialogue one image one event or bit of movement br br this was one of the most gratuitous wastes of film i have ever seen other reviewers have called it pretentious which is an understatement is pseudo intellectual trash designed to be anti hollywood so that the cannes judges could <UNK> their independence from the oscars br br the imdb reviewer states unlike hollywood movies which usually force the audience into <UNK> this forces the audience to slow down and look at some of life's <UNK> and most mundane features in great detail you would have to be <UNK> to stare at some of these images this long and move as slowly at these characters this isn't real life unless you are heavily <UNK> br br finally i felt that portrayal was a sad rip off of peter <UNK> masterful <UNK> he uses the same facial expressions and <UNK> he even gardens in many respects there are parallels between these two movies the main difference being that being there moves along and doesn't rely on shock and gimmicks to create a meaningful experience while questioning various things we take for granted in life
<START> it's boring br br it's slow br br where are the nasty and brutal murders where is the tension that is supposed to scare us this is like watching <UNK> street without the funny characters of ernie and bert or <UNK> br br it's really lame br br maybe it was the writing maybe the direction maybe the acting maybe the editing maybe the cinematography maybe the special effects maybe the makeup br br maybe all of the above brought this to something barely able to keep your eyes focused on br br i wanted to get scared not bored br br this didn't scare me it didn't even interest me i had more fun watching the time on the <UNK> instead of watching this film br br don't bother to buy it and if you see it on television by some freak chance there is no need to <UNK> the kids asleep
<START> the movie was better than what i expected i was working on the movie set for a short period of time when <UNK> was making this film the gun fire stunt and acting came out pretty good on the editing tip all <UNK> the the music wasn't all that great better music would have top this film some of the music sound like the hippie days <UNK> remember you have gang violence <UNK> some <UNK> or hip hop would have did it it was more realistic than blood in blood out the casting was picked real well did a good job in this film the movie brought back a fill of a life style i use to live but than at the end you do not always win and in my history thats how it was i adapted to the movie the first time i watched it <UNK> on this film
<START> i have seen many japanese and i have to say that some of them are really interesting but they are all pretty much the same this one is no exception the ghost is a black haired girl that scares it's victims by doing nothing else than walk and look dead the difference is just the motive for the haunting the rest is the same as every time black haired girl strange things happening with some media photos creepy acting while watching this flick i constantly found myself asking why i was wasting my time watching stuff that someone else has done so much better before some scenes where quite nice though i'll give it 3 out of 10
<START> the cast for this production of <UNK> is excellent sings <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> pavarotti also sings <UNK> is a fine <UNK> is a famous older singer who sings the maid giovanna sings sings both <UNK> and as <UNK> is probably the most convincing acting singer in this hard to beat ensemble of great singers kathleen in the <UNK> all principals are well known and world renowned br br this is an exciting <UNK> visually as well as <UNK> br br i have it on both laser disc and dvd you should have it too
<START> i was just watching a <UNK> files marathon on court tv the episode was identical to the plot of this movie right down to the incest secret and the affair with the sister subplot i don't recall any based on a true story <UNK> but the case does have <UNK> written all over it apparently it chronicles the real homicide of ruby morris by her husband earl sentenced to 25 years to life for her murder just goes to show you truth can be stranger than fiction because i thought the lifetime plot was contrived and a more than a stretch <UNK> as believability goes i'm with the other posters who said the acting was bad i didn't notice it with all of the players though it was really the lead character the daughter whose performance was bad
<START> i was rather disappointed the first <UNK> made me an instant fan from the first 5 mins of the film it was fresh innovative and just different i rather enjoy having a movie be in your face and push all those make you <UNK> buttons <UNK> did just that where for me few movies can br br for those of us who enjoy getting a breath of fresh air those that appreciate those offbeat styles used that make indie films so worthwhile ii will likely be a if your looking for that visceral hyper <UNK> feel of the first movie skip this one as thats all been stripped away <UNK> ii is for some odd reason just a typical hollywood style action flick i was rather confused however it's still worthwhile in my opinion for any die hard fan
<START> after seeing this movie i came to the realization that drew barrymore is a great actress this movie wouldn't have been watchable without drew the fact that somebody as attractive as drew could actually gross me out and she did when she was <UNK> her attempts to transition as the cool girls called it were hilarious especially her trying to dance at the night club br br we also had snl favorite molly shannon playing a great part as anita best friend one of the funniest scenes in the movie was anita trying to teach the class sex ed this was one of <UNK> funniest performances and best br br <UNK> <UNK> also had a great part and i really felt for her because i know people like her that got tortured like that br br this movie is a must see for drew barrymore fans because drew makes the movie
<START> i can remember reading that <UNK> had a pivotal experience in the <UNK> islands seeing the vast range of animal life there and <UNK> penned his theory of evolution not according to this movie it was inspired by the british countryside ok and as john <UNK> would say right i also did not think that <UNK> was a man suffering from deep personal conflict and someone who suffered dark <UNK> and <UNK> of anguish according to this film he was it is sad that he apparently lost one of his daughters to illness but i don't think him losing a family member would have <UNK> on the mans scientific abilities very much well not according to you get the picture i think there is nothing worse than when science gets turned into fable and to an extent this film comes off as trying to <UNK> <UNK> theory by saying it came from a man who was emotionally unstable which to me is just plain gross i think charles <UNK> was the soul of scientific <UNK> cool and calm and always thinking <UNK> this film seeks to <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> clear headed scientific exploration it is like a tale i would not recommend it
<START> my wife is a mental health <UNK> and we watched it from beginning to end i am the typical man and can not stand chick flicks but this movie is unbelievable if you want to see what it is like for someone who is going through these type of struggles this is the movie for you as i watched it i found myself feeling sorry for him and others like him br br spoiler plus the fact that all the individuals in the movie including the people in the mental institution were the actual people in real life made it that more real br br a must see for someone in the mental health profession
<START> the whole movie made me think of the first circle of <UNK> <UNK> where the souls who themselves in believing that they are happy go to they never realize they are actually in an <UNK> but nothing is enjoyable they just move on without any emotion in that sense <UNK> thought that they the were in the worse part as they would never <UNK> try to change their situation nobody can die in that place but trying to certainly does hurt i am not sure if the writer based his story on this medieval <UNK> or not but the resemblance is absolutely striking br br i didn't enjoy the movie when i was watching it as i was expecting a climax which never came nevertheless it made me think afterwards and now i actually think it's a good film it surely does stick
<START> what the heck is this about kelly jennifer seems to drop all moral behavior as soon as she arrives to the island she finds this juan p <UNK> existing and exotic though she witnessed when he slapped his ex in the face which he also justify later on in the movie right or wrong these two guys are the first to find each other on the island kelly are totally lost in every sense and the great juan p can fish and built a somewhat house mr <UNK> they seem to have a great time then billy zane jack characters husband shows up and of course two days without knowing what his wife has been doing <UNK> this gorgeous juan p he is a little bit jealous billy z is the stereotype rich guy and maybe not the <UNK> man in the world he <UNK> juan p for hitting his girlfriend at the <UNK> who can blame him hes also is arrogant but he paid loads of money to rent that boat and juan p who is the <UNK> everything cant even <UNK> him a beer <UNK> in 20 min wouldn't you be upset yet billy is probably the guy you want to punch in the face if you meet him but at the same time he is not to be blamed for suspicious about the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has kelly and billy just lost some dear friends how convenient he just happens to have them no matter what however for some strange reason kelly likes this girl hitting <UNK> and starts to hate billy for being jealous ok billy is <UNK> thats for sure but kelly isn't doing much to convince him either she spends more time with juan p and even wants him to sleep with them since hes been so nice and even though <UNK> <UNK> at her and calling her things for asking him some intimate questions but kelly is so <UNK> yeah right and then she starts to have sex with this juan p it should be said that kelly and billy seems to have a working relationship before this island incident at least they have intimate sex on the boat and talks like people do when they like each other now you can think that this scenario is possible but for real is it are you cheating your husband after two days on a <UNK> island just because hes jealous and acts like a drunk in the bar i wouldn't disagree if there relationship was really bad but the director doesn't give much hints if thats the case for christ sake juan p hasn't really shown himself being a good person catching some fish and built a wood house to get into <UNK> <UNK> is that showing a good side not trying to <UNK> husband in anyway which would be very simple by letting them be alone most of the island time simply be respect he doesn't care about their relationship and kelly cant figure that one out he just want to have sex with kelly character is just not <UNK> if she was stranded with billy and another attractive girl wouldn't she be upset or what or maybe she is billy zane plays a not very nice person and juan p isn't actually much better if you really think about it and poor kelly is so confused and believes having sex with juan p will solve everything because her husband is so strange and so aggressive towards poor juan p so for all of you who reads this what do you think about it if you where the kelly character would you consider cheating on your husband knowing one day you'll be back in real life and all of a sudden <UNK> maybe not that horrible person after all hes just too jealous and if you where <UNK> character what do you say is he totally wrong in his behavior and juan p character what do you guys really think of him one thing is for sure exist ps the voodoo thing is so totally wrong here what the heck was that about seriously anyone tell me
<START> i sat last night to see this film being played in greek television because of the upcoming olympic games <UNK> by my city knowing that it is an american film i had already expected it to focus more on the american <UNK> story and i was really ready for it but what i saw was too much i mean when a movie has such a title first <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> even being of american origin you would not expect it to be so <UNK> and on the same time ignorant towards other <UNK> <UNK> and efforts the american <UNK> seem to have all the gifts of nature strength <UNK> <UNK> kindness <UNK> in contrast to their sin <UNK> in the games who seem being unable even to speak their thoughts or express feelings the number of times the american <UNK> is played during the film must be an all time record in filmography <UNK> at it's best it even uses <UNK> facts which <UNK> the greek nation such as greek citizens serving the foreign marathon <UNK> with wine in order to help the domestic ones win the race so much for the olympic spirit br br think of it being a greek and putting a bad mark to a movie whose title is also greek is something that doesn't make me happy at all but according to what i have seen i cannot give it more than 4 out of 10 being pretty generous actually
<START> a group of four young men attending a <UNK> private school belong to an old <UNK> that was formed by their <UNK> during the time of the witch <UNK> of the late <UNK> they each possess a power that ages them whenever they use it and they suspect that a new kid at the academy might be from a family that was thought to have <UNK> long ago this new guy wants everyone's power for himself br br this not a horror movie as it tries to present itself as yes there is magic and all that supernatural stuff but this is really just an action movie a very mediocre action movie focusing almost solely on being cool and slick and paying only minimal attention to the plot which has plenty of sadly <UNK> room for interesting twists but none were put in and even before the movie is half over you'll know what is being played and by whom br br there are a few good scenes here and there most notably an exploding car that is magically <UNK> after <UNK> with a big <UNK> but that's about it what's worse is that director <UNK> <UNK> who has some very entertaining if not smart movies to his credit relies heavily on <UNK> metal music and overly sexy leads to carry that film and that makes it quite possibly the <UNK> horror movie since the disastrous alone in the dark it is not as bad as alone in the dark since the few slick scenes are actually slick and not ridiculously incompetent but in the end the highest this film can hope for is a nice and <UNK> home on late night cable 3 10 br br rated pg 13 violent action
<START> a magazine <UNK> who writes about life on her farm house when in fact she lives in a ny apartment must come up with a plan when she learns that her <UNK> and a war hero will spend christmas with her after a slow start it turns into an entertaining little screwball comedy thanks to a fine cast in a big departure from her previous role as a femme fatale in double <UNK> stanwyck displays a nice comedic flair morgan is smooth as the <UNK> war hero while <UNK> is well cast as the <UNK> however steals the film as a chef trying to master the english language while speaking with an almost incomprehensible european accent
<START> i think this is a pretty good movie but one thing makes it very interesting to me it is blatantly obvious once you look out for it the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for the bullies on the simpsons is <UNK> john is and tony is dolph there is even an episode of the simpsons where <UNK> uses the line i <UNK> her with a stick br br the <UNK> connection is the most obvious with the <UNK> hat and long hair and the voice has the <UNK> head unlike john but is the big dumb one the tony dolph connection is pretty obvious with the long <UNK> <UNK> and even the second <UNK> status
<START> i just spent the last half an hour reading through the other reviews and i don't know if i want to laugh or cry there's no way that is like harry potter danny phantom fairly <UNK> other then a secret magical world which has been close to overdone also no way is anime anime is very much a drawing style and some will say more such as plot and japanese origin either way is not anime so stop saying it is and if you're looking for something that is like anime look else where like teen <UNK> and <UNK> br br is typical it's just like all the other disney shows an arrogant main character kid who thinks he knows everything and doesn't bother to listen to people <UNK> older than him and continues to make the same mistakes best friend <UNK> plot with a hint of a twist and sibling rivalry can't they once make a character that has brains and isn't full of himself can't they have kids respect their <UNK> can't they think of something different with the plot can't they have the siblings get along and not hate each other is just too generic because you also have bad guys that get defeated and come back again and are also complete idiots that have no background for their hate c'mon you'll think that someone who's at least 30 will be able to out wit a 13 year old br br watching is like watching nearly anything else on tv these day same thing over and over again nothing special just new designs characters and one small idea that has been used again and again
<START> well first and for most i'd just like to say that i'm back out of retirement from writing well deserved comments about horrible movies only the movie in titled scarecrow gone wild could bring me back so here i am br br with that being said i like to start off with this comment <UNK> this movie was really horrible i mean i know it was going to be bad but i had no idea that i would be spending 60 minutes out of a possible 90 minute film laughing at what i thought was a horror movie br br let's start with the biggest flaw of the film to me that is ken <UNK> now if memory serves me correctly <UNK> is one of the worlds most dangerous men now if memory serves me again he was also in this stupid movie being a stupid comic relief or that's how it looked to me i mean how else do you explain all of his lines my all time favorite line of his in this so called movie was it's been a long time coming ok the <UNK> thing about that line was that no more then five minutes prior to him say that he was sitting on the beach talking to the soon to be dead kids about how the <UNK> scarecrow could not be killed so if he has knowledge of this why on earth would he start trying to combat it as soon as he sees it the scarecrow that it like i said before he must have been the comic relief except i don't think his buddies where laughing br br now that i've finished that well deserved paragraph on to the movie br br i'll admit that i can't remember a lot of scenes and that's not good considering that i just watch the movie no more then fifteen minutes ago so what i'm going to do is list the top five things wrong with this film 1 usually when horror movie monster have their own theme music it's not heard by the victims or even by the monster itself so why were just about every person involved in this movie able to here this pathetic <UNK> i mean i saw the scarecrows face and nothing about it said that he was the <UNK> type br br 2 why on earth were there murders on a beach i'm sorry but threw out history <UNK> are associated with party time and vacation type feelings but i guess this horror movie thought it was going to be such a success that it would change all of that plus was it me or did the beach seem to be the size of someone living room i mean every time an actor or actress was running around on the beach it looked as if they were running in the same spot br br 3 the girl running in the gray sweat pants that really bother during the duration of this film i mean she looks so ridiculous plus it didn't help any that she looked as though she was the youngest out of the whole group i mean what was she like twelve or something there no excuse for someone to be that thin on camera i mean doesn't the camera add like ten pounds or something so what was her excuse br br 4 people trying to get record deals on camera just when i thought that this movie could not get any <UNK> out comes the wanna be brooks and oh man was he lame i <UNK> remember the whole scene but from what i do remember it was not pretty this one guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing and i mean nothing to do with what's going on in the film the funniest part of the whole happening is how everyone seems to being enjoying this i mean the only person who doesn't really know how to response to this is the token black guy and that's sad because if i'm not mistaken he was the one that encourage this latest addition of american but here's where it gets funny while this guy is all into his new song or whatever in the far distance we see or villain aka the scarecrow and boy does he look <UNK> ed off at this i mean there's actually a moment where he looks like he's really jealous of this guy so what does he do about this jealousy well i'm glad you ask he for the guy to finish his song and then he the guy i don't want to give the death scene away but i can tell you this if that scene doesn't make you laugh then nothing on this earth will br br 5 this movie was way longer then i expected and it didn't help that they tried to pulled some pathetic twist <UNK> t at the end to squeeze another 10 minutes out of this film i mean i'll admit i didn't see the twist coming but that had a lot to do with the fact that i was hoping that the film was over and done with but no they had to do they twist s t needless to say that when i say that coming i just turned off the t v and said f k it there's no way that movie could have gotten any <UNK> thanks to my rather fast judgment i can say that i'll never know what was to happen next but i promise that i do not care all and all the movie is good for a laugh but please don't buy it just hype it up to one of your friends and watch it on there <UNK>
<START> <UNK> and the <UNK> is the first animated <UNK> movie in over 12 years since the 1994 <UNK> <UNK> america it also has the honor of being the first <UNK> colored <UNK> animation which makes the largely entertaining story a lot more breathtaking to behold br br every scene of this movie is vividly rendered in bright cheerful <UNK> <UNK> closely to the color schemes of the comic books it was based on the character designs also stick relatively close to the comic for better or for worse <UNK> the simple but unique look of the characters being simple in terms of character design this allows for more time and effort to be spent on the actual animation which by the way surpasses many other big screen theatrical animated movies character movements are very fluid and possess a quality that looks way beyond what a modest budget would usually produce there is always something moving in every scene and no evidence of the usual cost cutting animation short cuts 3d computer images are <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> animated <UNK> art if anything the style of <UNK> makes the 3d elements look more like traditional comic book paintings than cgi models br br the storyline takes much of its elements from the <UNK> and the comic and this is where its main flaw lies as an adaptation of said comic <UNK> and the <UNK> takes way too many liberties with its source material long time fans of the comic would no doubt find much to dislike about the movie's story and its lack of <UNK> to the source br br on the other hand one can see this story as a really fun one if taken on its own without comparing it its source material highly comedic well written jokes pepper the upbeat script the funniest parts were the numerous pop culture references and <UNK> at modern day 21 century life mobile <UNK> the shopping channel commercial <UNK> and even sports cars are <UNK> to great effect excellent chemistry and acting by the cast i watched this in english by the way though a couple of voices like i found really irritating but i guess it is all part of his character br br if there is anything to criticize about the story it is the lack of <UNK> this story seems to be more like story of teenage romance and coming of age with <UNK> and merely playing supporting roles this gives a pretty big sense of <UNK> since much of the story's elements are the usual <UNK> of such teen movies derivative and clichéd at times only the witty comedy and traditional elements the <UNK> the pirates etc manage to save this film from falling into plain mediocrity br br while not the best installment in the <UNK> animated movie library it is certainly one of the funniest the best scripted and the most beautifully animated dvd seems a little hard to come by
<START> many funny scenes about the people that you don't normally pay attention to in a movie and what they have to do to get work and what happens once they do lou myers was very funny as half step wilson any guy that has a tight group of friends can relate to many of the non movie related scenes scattered throughout the movie
<START> you get an hour and a half of <UNK> i have to save the world action all the way one liners and a woman somewhere in the <UNK> this time he plays a guy who help people in the witness protection program to quote the cover of the movie he <UNK> their past to save their future this have to be cool i bet younger people will like it though but it is a little over the top for my taste and the one liners are really something else and i don't mean that in a good way after killing a crocodile he manage to say you're <UNK> if you are in the right mood you may enjoy the movie and as far as <UNK> action go this is not very bad but almost before the movie starts you know exactly what is going to happen but if you like these kind of movies you will probably enjoy this one i rate this movie 4
<START> closet land is not at happy movie neither is it connected to any kind of social realism this is perhaps its strength the distance from specific time and nations <UNK> the message makes it more powerful and rips away the burden of <UNK> and propaganda you often sense in movies made to criticize nations in of ones own i am of course primarily speaking of the usa propaganda in some commercial film br br bit closet land is so much more than a message it is a film of pure <UNK> beauty filled with the same clean <UNK> form you find in work such as 1984 and it's equals br br i am of old a big fan of alan <UNK> the man with the golden sarcasm and i might add the sex appeal the between him and madeleine <UNK> is brilliant <UNK> i see him he seems to play a character even <UNK> than the last one br br but enough the film lacks in action i dont want any crashing cars but i want something to happen except pure talk after an hour i got really tired of the the predictable actions and more than anything i wanted a more complex view of it all the world the former lives of the characters and all the rest of the <UNK> that was missing for some people a nice touch for me something less positive br br anyway closet land is a movie worth it's time if you are ready to make a trip into the <UNK> of the human nature br br and of course for us who really loves the always evil alan <UNK>
<START> i really felt the movie was ahead of its time the one potential daughter in law was such a strong career oriented woman she knew what she wanted and was <UNK> but firm with the over bearing mother in law to be the mother's role was played extremely well you just loved to hate her her need to control her son's lives was <UNK> evil if you've ever been in a relationship where you've been judged and found lacking and everybody involved knew it this may hit too close to home it's been years since i saw this movie and i remember thinking that this plot and dialog would work in a 50's or 60's movie it is difficult to watch because of the mother and <UNK> dynamic but i would love to watch it again i keep hoping to find it on one of the old movie channels but so far no luck attempts to buy it were also <UNK> i don't believe it's on tape or dvd
<START> for many and many years <UNK> have visited japan for learning martial arts instead of <UNK> any knowledge on it have been told only could achieve the <UNK> performance required to show some techniques in a public performance such as a movie br br this one special movie made by sho <UNK> not only shows all of those techniques and skills but also teaches many and many lessons on how to achieve them and one can <UNK> that by seeing a <UNK> <UNK> performing fantastic and unforgettable acting skills in br br i strongly recommend watching this movie more than <UNK> because three times is not enough to seek out hints and <UNK> given so easily by sho <UNK> to those who really seek knowledge itself the
<START> i'm big into acting writing and directing but not famous yet my friends and i frequently rent bad movies just for fun and a good laugh but when we went to the local family video and found a movie called biker zombies from detroit we knew it was gonna be the worst movie of all time and it was biker zombies from detroit has no script they can say they do have one but they're <UNK> there was a 4 minute scene of just two guys <UNK> about women and sexuality and you could tell it was improvised and if they're going to <UNK> it should be at least decent but it wasn't and you could tell by the two actors <UNK> up lines and saying stuff that didn't even make sense br br to give you an idea of how terrible and retarded this movie is here's the beginning a girl flicks a guy off he punches her in the face and beats her up then rapes her then we see zombies who attack and they both turn into zombies br br this is the beginning of the movie not to mention the lead zombie voice over that carries through the whole movie trying to be sinister and thought provoking but sounding like <UNK> <UNK> having a <UNK> fit br br worst movie ever bottom line folks but watch it if you like movies with no script no plot bad acting bad editing bad music and over 100 f words used in the movie br br if this can hit video stores my future films are gonna win oscars
<START> a group of friends discover gold deep inside an old mine but by taking the gold and thinking they've hit it big they <UNK> a long dead <UNK> who's hell bent on protecting his treasure <UNK> massacre is a <UNK> b horror movie in the extreme you've got all your familiar clichés your group of intellectually <UNK> teenagers characters going off on their own to investigate strange noises a few pop scares the mysterious sheriff the old lady who everyone thinks is nuts played by top billed karen black no less and so on nevertheless it's done in an amusing non pretentious fashion that makes the film <UNK> entertaining in a so bad it's good kind of way the characters and dialog are what you'd expect from this type of routine and unoriginal the actors all do a decent job though actually seen bigger budget films of it's type with worse acting i know what you did last summer anyone and add a bit of credibility to the film itself the villain in this film the is obviously derived from the <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> all the way down to the brown <UNK> the hat and the long white hair like the <UNK> he never talks and is butt ugly to boot the gore is somewhat disappointing in my opinion there are a couple of fairly gruesome moments but too much is off screen and the death scenes are often laughable spoiler ahead there's one truly hilarious moment where a girl gets decapitated by the said villain and to achieve this the filmmakers <UNK> the <UNK> body beneath the <UNK> coat with her head <UNK> out and put some fake blood on her neck seriously you could see the outline of her shoulders i think they could have done a little better there even if the budget was low and i'm sure it was but the special effects are cheap but <UNK> effective and for the most part moderately well done for a low budget film either the effects guys or the director seem to have a thing for explosions and fire almost every scene towards the end of the film has at least a couple of characters being burn to death always filmed in slow motion or something exploding be it a car or an old mine cave seriously hasn't anyone ever heard the term stop drop and roll br br <UNK> massacre or curse of the forty what ever you want to call it is cheesy and dumb albeit entertaining and as long as you don't have expectations through the roof you'll be <UNK> entertained br br i'm feeling generous so i'll give it a 4 10
<START> i was completely bored with this film melodramatic for no apparent reason every thing just becomes so serious and people are swearing with really dumb expressions then there is a serial killer who apparently can kill one person to get the title of serial killer well the serial killer likes <UNK> and is illustrated by sound effects you might hear in the dream sequence of most modern films br br why oh why i no idea it really really wants to be scary but i think in this universe scary equals talk a whole bunch and add dark <UNK> noises just for the record this is in no way is a horror film its most definitely a thriller barely really movie makers nowadays need to do their <UNK> before making horror films or at least calling a movie a horror film it makes me say in too may words ironically <UNK> you take forever to say nothing
<START> after all these years of peter <UNK> brilliant <UNK> giving of his soul film after film at last hollywood <UNK> him an oscar recently br br country dance showed up one night late and of course blew me out of my <UNK> <UNK> in my alleged life how does he do it br br york again also is brilliant in this kind of play both psychological <UNK> loaded for bear br br bravo to author director cast and camera crew no wonder the <UNK> lost to these irish <UNK> english <UNK> brutal honesty hurts back in the 70's when i personally believed honesty was pure and absolutely vital to trust i have <UNK> my edgy extremes and will settle for more human warm flaws within myself and others br br forgiveness allows humanity to have a reverse gear and allows us to fix our own bull headed <UNK> and erotic mistakes
<START> i watched this film <UNK> thinking that it was that other radio station zombie flick the <UNK> production values and low rent cast soon gave away that this was another one of the those cheap sci fi channel style knock offs br br the central performance from bill <UNK> is initially quite engaging as the dubious radio shock jock but as the film goes on becomes less and less convincing as he is actually required to act the rest of the cast have little to do other than look concerned and have no depth whatsoever br br the cinematography is dull flat and completely uninspired like so many of these kind of films it doesn't even manage a decent bit of convincing gore the zombie make up is literally pathetic apart from one notable exception towards the end of the film br br the film tries to <UNK> originality and a message into it's <UNK> of half baked and ripped off ideas by somehow <UNK> this <UNK> with <UNK> towards islam and the war on terror this is woefully handled with all the intellectual <UNK> of a 6 year old as the characters and seemingly the writers are unable to <UNK> the difference between race and religion describing all people of a certain skin colour as muslims most notably one character is revealed to be muslim by skin colour alone at the same time the muslim terrorists who cause the <UNK> are the usual <UNK> stereotype br br presumably the far far superior had a similar budget as dead air yet shines everywhere where this film fails miserably
<START> being a big fan of horror films and always manage to find something good about a picture but this film just did not hold my interest or attention this story revolves around a father and his daughter and a girlfriend since his wife died a few years back these people encounter a horrible situation in a town they stop off and visit and all the senior citizens in this town gang up against these people and almost kill them this film reminded me of a film called children of the corn because it really involves children who are being presented to satan and are his <UNK> of terror there is plenty of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a toy tank that completely destroys an entire family in their station <UNK> as well as dolls who kill a husband and wife
<START> you'd have more excitement cutting off your <UNK> than watching this clearly a trick to get you to rent descent instead of the descent which is a much better movie br br this is a total rip off of the core and much much worse as regards special effects i could do better with a box of <UNK> and a roll of i mean come on that mole thing bore more resemblance to a <UNK> <UNK> than a <UNK> vehicle br br don't watch it if you do you'll find the room your in has a funny smell for days after and you'll have this <UNK> feeling in the back of your head that you should go kill yourself or something
<START> just finished this <UNK> nutty affair and whilst i can't say as it was as good as i had hyped it up to be in my mind it was still an effective and at time pretty nasty piece of brain <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> j trash its story tells of a poor gal searching for her sister who winds up getting raped and drugged by <UNK> <UNK> and the helpful lady doctor who sets out to avenge her doing so in <UNK> gruesome fashion after a similar bout of rape and <UNK> oh yeah and there's a bit of straightforward sex in there as well sadly its all soft core as per the japanese <UNK> of below the belt nudity but is minimal in fact only really noticeable in a hilarious blow job scene although writer director <UNK> <UNK> fails in creating an especially compelling tale this is at least pretty <UNK> stuff diving early on into the well of filth with a pretty unsettling rape made worse by the fact that the gal looks kinda young though i'm pretty sure she was of age also for the most part this is pretty professional looking stuff maybe not stylish but it has a certain flair and the content is handled reasonably well with particular kudos for largely avoiding having to employ much things are mostly sex rape based for about two thirds of the sharp runtime and its pretty watchable if you groove to such fare it gets a bit numbing after a while but the ladies are easy on the eye and it is reasonably harsh at times the music from <UNK> is occasionally effective though hardly a key part of the show it does in a few spots <UNK> the action neatly at any rate enough for me to notice it more important are the effects by which pack an <UNK> <UNK> punch when they appear helped out by the lunatic nature of the climactic <UNK> things even pull to a curiously affecting ending sure it ain't a <UNK> or anything but for a film so <UNK> level for most of its runtime it is relatively poignant altogether this is a pretty entertaining <UNK> for mean spirited trash fans especially those with a taste for japanese adventures i could really have done with a longer revenge section and more gore also perhaps more of a point brains but hey it kept me watching and it is pretty nicely <UNK> with <UNK> wtf moments so if you dig this sort of <UNK> junk probably worth your while just maybe don't expect the second coming
<START> this is a very strange film with a no name cast and virtually nothing known about it on the web it uses an approach familiar to those who have watched the likes of <UNK> in that it introduces a trilogy of so called horror shorts and <UNK> them together into a connecting narrative of the people who are involved in the segments getting off a bus there is a narrator who <UNK> on about relationships but his talking adds absolutely nothing to the mix at all and just adds to the confusion as for the stories themselves well i swear i have not got a clue why this movie got an 18 <UNK> in the uk which would bring it into line with the likes of nightmare on elm street and the exorcist nothing here is even remotely scary there is no gore sex nudity or even a swear word to <UNK> things up this is the kind of thing you could put out on children's tv and no one would bat an <UNK> i can only think if it had got the rating it truly deserved a pg no serious horror fan would be seen dead with it so the <UNK> probably <UNK> the <UNK> until they <UNK> anyway here are the 3 tales in summary 1 a man becomes dangerously obsessed with his <UNK> car to the point of <UNK> his <UNK> 2 a man who lives in a filthy apartment is understandably freaked out when a living <UNK> evolved from his six month old <UNK> <UNK> 3 a woman thinks she has found the perfect man through a computer dating service that is until he starts to act weird and there you have it some of them are pretty amusing due to their outlandish premises my favourite being number 2 but you get the feeling they were meant to be a frightening and b morality plays unfortunately they fail miserably on both counts to sum up then this flick is an obscure curiosity for very good reasons
<START> i can't believe that anyone would green light this let alone <UNK> star in it i will never be able to get that 90 mins of my life back br br this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen some films are so bad they're good this has gone so far round again that's somehow it's so bad it's terrible i was not exactly expecting much it being a low budget <UNK> jumping rehash of a b movie but it still came in way under my expectation levels even tv movies have higher production values br br there were very poor special effects shocking dialogue terrible acting and a completely unexplained plot who cursed her and why why did the 6 inch snakes turn into 15 foot snakes has anyone ever heard of highly <UNK> <UNK> snakes or <UNK> 100 passengers 3 000 snakes so many promises none delivered br br some comments would have you believe that this film is worth watching for the last five minutes it's not even worth a rental stay in and watch a low budget tv movie you'll enjoy it a lot more br br why was this made oh yes to shamelessly cash in on the internet phenomenon that is soap shame on you brothers shame on you
<START> all this show is is the same plot spelling is in danger of failing school he needs to pass to become emperor he needs to learn something which he thinks is stupid he then uses it learns more about it and realizes it's not so stupid posing as the principal tries to <UNK> into some animal to stop him every episode br br jokes from the movie are copied incredibly complicated plans breaking the 4th wall constantly <UNK> they should try hiring some writers br br 2 10
<START> this movie could have been an <UNK> epic but the makers seem to have done their <UNK> to make it appear foolish even god himself is not <UNK> in this movie in that his words are <UNK> with childish jokes the result is <UNK> and annoying only people who don't care to see a cheap parody on the biblical story may perhaps watch this film without embarrassment the makers of this tasteless production should see the <UNK> according to <UNK> a film of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who shows that it is unnecessary to <UNK> the words of the bible to make a good story the most <UNK> result is <UNK> by a sincere rendering of the plain text itself
<START> would someone explain to me when the <UNK> learned to speak this was a horrible film i loved <UNK> and <UNK> 2 but what's this unless you want to kill yourself please stay away from <UNK> 3 on a scale of 1 to 10 <UNK> 3 gets a 1
<START> korean romance about the owner of a camera store who is <UNK> with a fatal disease as he goes about his daily routine and <UNK> for the end he becomes <UNK> with a young girl who is a <UNK> a friendship and romance grows eve though neither expresses any sort of affection for the other good film is unlike anything you are likely to see remade in america simply because the studios would insist that the couple act on their feelings he will not say anything because he doesn't have that long to live she won't because its not the thing thats done and he is not <UNK> as she thinks he should of course its much more complex than i'm making it out to be and in all honesty its the sort of thing that you should discover for yourself is it a great film no but it is a good one that will move you emotionally the final lines of the film still <UNK> me i always knew that love would fade like a photograph but you will remain in my heart as you are in my last moment thank you and goodbye it may seem odd out of context but with in the context of the film it is very moving
<START> so what can i tell you about this movie if you cheated a lot in high school you do recognize some br br this is the best thing i can tell you about this film br br if you like american teen movies maybe you also like it br br but i don't see this kind of movies as something funny sorry to say but if you are older then 10 years i shouldn't advise you to watch this br br because there is one shot with a couple of beautiful women girls in this movie i'll give it a rate of 2 br br so deal for yourself good luck
<START> circus could have been so much better if they had reduced the number of twists and developed each better the film features a very gifted cast that mostly perform well however it totally loses the audience basically everyone is back stabbing everyone else and not back stabbing them at the same time because they are <UNK> someone else and working with did i lose you well the film is even more confusing clearly written by a first <UNK> writer it has some redeeming qualities though in the acting especially <UNK> <UNK> shines as lily but sadly gets a lot of useless screen time just standing there doing nothing the dialogue is a bit cheesy and the accents sometimes irritating but its still worth watching if you're a fan of any of the actors especially john and <UNK> who get the most screen time just remember to watch it with a <UNK> so you can write down who is double crossing who every second
<START> from 1936 1939 peter lorre made a string of highly successful mr <UNK> films while technically b films they were much better made than typical films of the genre however lorre tired of making these highly repetitive films and told friends he wanted out of the series when it was canceled in 1939 lorre was thrilled but his plans of getting more complicated and satisfying roles did not <UNK> when he moved to columbia pictures island of doomed men is one of these films and it's pretty obvious the studio isn't putting much effort into the movie as i think the plot was written by <UNK> talented <UNK> perhaps but still the movie made little sense at all br br it begins with a guy <UNK> to be an undercover agent for the government he is to <UNK> an island in the us where something strange is <UNK> now they easily could have just got a search warrant to do this but given that <UNK> were writing the film the agent takes the rap for a murder he didn't commit and spends a year in prison for this he apparently hopes that he'll be <UNK> to this island as many are sent there when they finish the term br br there are some more serious problems with this idea first they only have him serve a year before getting <UNK> but he was convicted of murder and he refused to <UNK> who he really was they would never <UNK> anyone in a case like this second what if he wasn't <UNK> to the island he would have spent an entire year in jail for nothing third why not just have <UNK> <UNK> or or cops in <UNK> come to the island talk about a contrived plot br br once on the island the agent discovers that evil peter lorre has set up his own private prison and <UNK> it with guys on <UNK> as slave labor what about the men having to report to their <UNK> officers this was never explained but lorre was using them to mine for <UNK> and they were treated <UNK> now another question i had was that if lorre was discovering huge <UNK> there he was a very wealthy man so why not just pay people to mine for the <UNK> why set up your own version of devil's island and <UNK> beat and kill the men br br eventually lorre gets what's his and the <UNK> slaves are released unfortunately by then i really didn't care overall watchable but rather dumb <UNK> career only took a turn for the better when he moved the following year to warner brothers with films like island of doomed men i could see why his stay at columbia was short
<START> i and a friend rented this movie we both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be <UNK> the movie's plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending we both agreed that the movie could have been <UNK> into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot
<START> i'm sorry but this movie is just way to shallow for me in it <UNK> is a taxi dancer with boyfriend keitel trying to make it as an actress first of all what the hell is a taxi dancer even after sitting through this i still don't know oh yeah <UNK> also <UNK> to follow her like a <UNK> puppy there's no reason behind the love it just kind of happens there are times when the characters and events really try to pull at your <UNK> but it rarely works the only character you really do feel anything for or with is <UNK> character and that's only because he does such a good job with it any other actor and the character would have been just like the others br br the script is basically an uninspired <UNK> about how hard it is to make it as an actor actress it's been done and said before the language and dialog sounds like it was written by a street <UNK> the ending is well i don't want to spoil it let's just say it feels unsatisfying i'd be more upset if the story was any good to begin with the directing is average with nothing truly wonderful but nothing that is really painful to watch either to <UNK> the acting the only one that does anything worth watching is keitel though i could have lived on without seeing him in tiger print bikini underwear br br oh yeah eddie <UNK> shows up as random as that mention is that's how random it is in the film and tarantino does his director buddy a favor by showing up for about 20 seconds
<START> where do i start lets list the good things about this movie first br br 1 <UNK> <UNK> is great as the gangster thomas this is the only character you will actually care about and he's a bad guy never does anything bad and is generally a pretty likable guy 2 is always great he's a bit toned down here but he is quite funny still 3 the movie looked pretty good by swedish standards good use of depth of field and lights br br now the bad this is by far the worst script to make it into the big screen ever the acting by everyone else was pretty bad and over the top the direction was horrible a totally meaningless story totally unrealistic characters and events and 1 5 hours to long during emotional scenes pretty much everyone in the theater laughed people just started walking out during the course of the screening br br there's no way to actually <UNK> the story into something coherent so i wont even try every cliché ever conceived is in there and in all the wrong places i'm sorry to say this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life br br watch it for a good laugh but try not to pay any money for it br br r
<START> horrible writing directing and acting the writer director has portrayed <UNK> especially southern law <UNK> as ignorant backwoods <UNK> and racist a very popular yet ignorant stereotype that the film industry loves to <UNK> the acting or overacting and the writing came across as amateurish and low budget the plot line is the same old stale hollywood story of the mean <UNK> racist and <UNK> <UNK> who are ultimately defeated by the <UNK> people from <UNK> br br i was raised in the small <UNK> town where this movie was filmed and looked forward to seeing the film but was immediately disappointed during the first few minutes of the movie the start of the film depicts a gay bar located in the <UNK> of <UNK> how ridiculous a concept there are a lot of gays and gay bars in south <UNK> but no gay bars in the <UNK> or small towns of <UNK> we then are introduced to the sheriff who uses the phrases in the worst southern <UNK> and overdone performance ever then there is the scene where the local police are watching porno on duty in the police station i could go on and on about the horrible cheesy acting or the stale stereotypes or ridiculous scenes br br this director and his crew were welcomed into this small friendly town and shown true southern <UNK> the <UNK> of lake arthur and the state of <UNK> were only to be insulted and <UNK> in the final editing the good people of lake arthur were excited and <UNK> with hollywood being in town not knowing that in the end they would be portrayed as ignorant racist and <UNK> country <UNK> in a low budget amateur movie that went straight to dvd my advice skip this one or watch it on late night <UNK> if it ever makes their <UNK>
<START> horror films are a curious thing sometimes they manage to stumble across a formula that works very well sometimes they try <UNK> to tell a worthy story despite time and budget problems sometimes they're so bad they're actually kinda fun and sometimes they're the <UNK> br br a good horror suspense film should contain <UNK> that keep you guessing they should allow you to be interested in the characters and their motivations so that you actually have some sort of reaction when they die however the <UNK> chooses instead to introduce elements that work at first only to be by it's own lackluster storytelling br br all the characters are completely forgettable and any actual back story that might make any of them even remotely interesting is <UNK> out within a 30 second monologue making it impossible to do anything more than laugh as characters are picked off almost at random and on more than one occasion in the least possibly frightening way br br to spoil a scene a bit one victim is taken during a complete <UNK> which might have been a little frightening if the sound effect used to indicate his killing wasn't reminiscent of stirring a pot of too thick <UNK> and cheese add to this formula the camera that work makes me think the director saw one too many nine inch nails videos and an ending which in an attempt to be shocking serves almost no purpose but to annoy and confuse the viewer and you have an almost completely unwatchable horror film that fails on every level br br i'll be honest with you if you want a claustrophobic <UNK> horror movie go watch the descent and i feel weird saying that because i didn't particularly enjoy that movie either
<START> this is a bottom of the barrel type of b film from one of the poverty row studios <UNK> in the mid <UNK> the kind that filled out a double bill br br only reason i watched was to see what jackie <UNK> was like in a leading role as a page boy at a radio station who attempts to solve a murder he played phil in gone with the wind only two years earlier and this was one of his last teen aged roles he's no mickey rooney br br the script is as hapless as the production values and is full of cliché ridden situations with a cast of uniformly <UNK> individuals <UNK> <UNK> is the girl who is discovered by a radio producer and sidney miller is the nerdy friend of the hero who's afraid of his own shadow br br mercifully it's over in an hour when the murder is solved after a round up of all the suspects terribly <UNK> the only quiet performance of any interest is given by jon as <UNK> the cowboy but he bites the dust after too brief an appearance br br there are several songs but all of them are forgettable as are the lame jokes and dialog
<START> so well made no cgi crap has anyone else been on the jumping <UNK> tour of <UNK> <UNK> river before black water was way realistic rogue was a bit <UNK> br br thought the blonde chick was excellent in it haven't really seen her before and the other chick is a babe she is always excellent br br v suspenseful i would compare it to jaws over any other man eating animal flick br br got the hole aussie thing down pat without going <UNK> with and as well br br loved it
<START> i'm working my way through the horror classics 50 movie pack collection and the mad monster is one of the movies in the set br br i am sure that george <UNK> was a good actor but this was only the second film in which i saw him the first being dead men walk in which he played two parts however even good acting couldn't save the mad monster br br <UNK> plays a mad scientist dr cameron who was banned from <UNK> because of his <UNK> and <UNK> experiments he believes that he can control evolution by bringing out the characteristics of one animal into another br br in this case like so many others of its <UNK> it is a <UNK> of i assume <UNK> blood into humans his goal is to create an <UNK> army which he can control through the <UNK> the subject of his experiments is his hired hand a retarded <UNK> whose dialogue slows down this <UNK> paced classic to almost a full stop br br beyond his experiments dr cameron also plots revenge on those who <UNK> him using his transformed <UNK> however he loses control of his subject who begins to <UNK> without the <UNK> <UNK> br br the werewolf <UNK> are classic hollywood stop action makeup effects no doubt these were groundbreaking techniques of the time but in today's digital age it's hard to imagine audiences being scared by this
<START> this movie was painfully awful most of the movie consisted of people running in the woods walking thru the woods or dancing in the woods more than half at least then two kids who discover two <UNK> <UNK> in the woods return to the woods the very next night for a romantic walk there is no time continuity its day its night its day its really really night its <UNK> its pitch black its day all the woods scenes go on like this until you think you will lose your mind really bad the sheriff discovers a five foot claw print <UNK> in the dirt of the woods and that a super large alligator may have learned to walk <UNK> really a silly movie with no real motivation written in for the characters might be entertaining for young kids as an alternative to really graphic stuff
<START> this was more of a love story than one about an angel who comes down here to earth although both angles of that story are given a good share of the movie br br if i took this movie to heart as someone who knows and believes the bible i would have <UNK> it pretty quick but i don't think the general atmosphere was either mean spirited or <UNK> it was just ludicrous or just plain stupid br br i mean john travolta as a <UNK> angel smoking scratching his <UNK> <UNK> the beatles a <UNK> angel who knows nothing about heaven an angel who <UNK> with all the women yes it's all absurd and certainly <UNK> incorrect br br i could tolerate all that but i don't know how many people whatever beliefs they hold who could stand a boring film which this turned out to be during the second half of it it begins to drag when the romance begins between william hurt and <UNK> <UNK> some of the dialog during that romance is so stupid it's insulting to any <UNK> viewer br br this is another nora <UNK> directed film man i can't believe how many incredibly stupid movies this woman has either written or directed at least she's consistent
<START> <UNK> is an adequate made for tv movie about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the town where br br she grew up in and where her childhood best friend was murdered turns out that every year on the same date another br br young girl is murdered and <UNK> played by claire <UNK> must solve the mystery before she ends up dead claire <UNK> meet joe black <UNK> new york is the female lead and does a pretty good job of it <UNK> supported by the rather delicious oliver and a still <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the script adapted from a nora roberts novel is <UNK> standard and the plot br br is <UNK> predictable that however is <UNK> again by like i said the rather delicious oliver hudson
<START> if as i just pointed out in the goat keaton is following the tradition of the comics finding themselves at odds with the law this <UNK> short the last released before he did tramp tramp tramp was based on another comic <UNK> being married to a <UNK> <UNK> and trying to get away for some secret two timing dating laurel hardy did this in several films as did fields and chaplin br br i have a problem with it why do these characters always marry such nasty women and there is an interesting <UNK> side issue why don't you find female comics married to male counterparts to these <UNK> i can't recall any except in a carol <UNK> skit where the two <UNK> members of two couples discover that they prefer having someone give it back as good as they get a kind of mutual <UNK> <UNK> but also <UNK> that their not married to a <UNK> <UNK> type as for the fact that the comics do marry <UNK> i suppose one can imagine they get what they deserve or do they ollie really deserves a wife who throws <UNK> and <UNK> at him yeah he went to that convention in sons of the desert that ruined her plans but he wanted to get some private time there is nothing suggesting he and stan cheated on their wives actually he is <UNK> by mae <UNK> because he <UNK> to her while stan <UNK> and told the truth to his wife br br here harry's wife alice ward is shown at the start talking to her mother about how she keeps him under strict control we see harry at his job it is saturday morning and the job ends at <UNK> for the rest of the weekend this was before the idea of a five day a week 40 hour a week job in industry he works in a where he hits red hot metal into shape an early joke about <UNK> he is a small light man not the muscular type to swing a <UNK> hammer he just misses his <UNK> trying to give a man a light he calls home to explain things and gets an <UNK> from the <UNK> for being two minutes late br br on the way home harry meets his pal steve <UNK> <UNK> who has met two nice sweet girls who would just love to have a date harry is <UNK> but agrees to it after talking to the girl he agrees to pay for the hot dogs for the <UNK> he has a <UNK> silver half dollar in his pocket but his plans seem <UNK> when his wife discovers his hidden <UNK> of <UNK> he keeps it hidden under the living room <UNK> and finds it by walking along the edge of the <UNK> but his wife spies on him and <UNK> all of it later she <UNK> him talking to himself and <UNK> her in contempt she gives him back a dime and says he can treat his date to a <UNK> br br but harry has a second <UNK> of <UNK> and dresses up for the date and goes out he and <UNK> are apparently late and <UNK> blames harry but harry tries to make it up to him he produces two prostitutes they get into a <UNK> when <UNK> wisely says they are not the type of girls he'd term as nice eventually the girls do show up and the date begins but soon harry is hiding in the <UNK> seat as his wife drives past in her <UNK> and the girls boy friends turn up angry at their two rivals br br the short works well and is amusing and gives one a better idea of the persona that harry <UNK> developed in his brief stardom as a comic master he is constantly put upon by others he misses his <UNK> because some stranger keeps asking for a smoke and a light and in the end the stranger gets his own the nice girl who is harry's date has a little dog who chases him away he rests between two cars that both start driving away and he ends up wrapped around a pole it certainly demonstrates that <UNK> had his screen persona down pat by the time that he made his features if only he could have kept the complex whole together beyond those three first features
<START> br br having read the unemployed <UNK> review i went to a screening of radio not knowing what to expect thankfully the unemployed critic now appears to me anyway a frustrated film director movie critic his review is <UNK> and totally <UNK> for br br this is a movie that will make you laugh it will make you cry and in the end it will give you a moment of pause br br to <UNK> a line delivered by actor ed harris in the final <UNK> scene and all this time that we thought we were teaching radio truth is he was teaching us he treats us all the time like we wish we treated each other some of the time br br yes the movie <UNK> at the <UNK> yes it is emotionally manipulative and yes cuba gooding jr in an oscar worthy performance is a little over the top at times see the christmas day dance scene but you know what so what every once in awhile the community of america needs to be reminded what tolerance can do for our great country we need to be reminded how great we can be br br this is a solid cast i was particularly pleased to see s portraying <UNK> mother do something outside of law and order i always wondered is ms a great actor or is it the quality of writing delivered buy a strong cast on law and order after watching this movie it is easy to see that she is indeed a very fine actor br br also joining the cast in small but important and powerful roles is <UNK> <UNK> as the principal debra <UNK> in a career <UNK> role of coach <UNK> wife and chris as protagonist frank clay br br we cannot over look ed <UNK> performance as coach harold jones after <UNK> on this movie and having grown up in the deep south my self it is hard to truly appreciate mr harris and his contribution to this film as coach jones ed delivers a quiet rock solid performance that of a man on a mission coach harris will not let the town or circumstances <UNK> him from what he knows in his heart is the right thing to do br br if you see this movie make sure you hang around for the end credits you will be in for a treat as the real james robert kennedy now in his mid 50's is shown still leading the t l <UNK> football team on to the field every friday night br br one final note if you were a teen in the mid to late 70's this movie is worth the price of admission for the sound track alone
<START> from the late teens to the 1920s stan laurel was a solo act in films during this time period laurel was definitely not among the upper <UNK> of talent and his humor isn't nearly as good as <UNK> such as lloyd or keaton however for second <UNK> short comedies he did create a decent <UNK> as far as the quality of the films go they varied wildly some such as dr and mr were terrific whereas most were of average to below average in quality br br frozen hearts is an odd film like many of the films he made for hal roach and distributed by during this period the costumes were absolutely first rate and the film looked very nice however despite this and having support from the likes of james <UNK> one thing they forgot to include in this film was humor none of the jokes seem to work and the film looks almost like a drama not a comedy only the really silly <UNK> cards <UNK> the type film it's supposed to be br br my advice is try to see all his laurel and hardy films and then see the solo films in addition to dr try seeing the and mud and sand two of his more tolerable solo shorts
<START> abysmal <UNK> action film from legendary <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> for future <UNK> <UNK> like and <UNK> or <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> while simultaneously <UNK> poor rising action star pat o'brien with a hackneyed backyard script and three <UNK> of hair <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> his impressive 1984 <UNK> this guy's physical <UNK> resembles a more femme mark gregory and his next credit would be second <UNK> to chris mitchum as tom <UNK> powerful at least the action is mindless and non stop with some daring asian <UNK> <UNK> their lives for what is essentially a poorly constructed movie by teens and or <UNK> <UNK> with no concept of reality one poor extra gets <UNK> <UNK> by an electric <UNK> <UNK> and many more are killed by getting hit in the head by odd objects such as a motorcycle wheel or cardboard box classic rape scenes are tasteless and priceless and <UNK> dialog such as i would rather trust a <UNK> are delivered with such <UNK> and <UNK> from the third rate voice actors random highlight some crazy dude eating live <UNK> movie also holds the record for most cars driven through walls 2 10
<START> so <UNK> this woman has a <UNK> that sucks people into it when they <UNK> do it and there's this dude who like follows her around everywhere and <UNK> is <UNK> in love with her and she cant love him back because of her <UNK> well her <UNK> starts talking to her sort of it just says feed me over and over and she tries to feed it hot dogs but that doesn't work because it wants fresh meat so this woman heads to the red light district where she picks up tourists but only the really sleazy ones cause i guess they deserve it and after a while this dude comes looking for her and even though <UNK> like right there he doesn't see her so eventually he gets involved with <UNK> twins but he only likes one of them cause the other is a real <UNK> this isn't bad good like i thought it would be cause like the novelty sort of wears off within the first 1 2 hour and it goes on for another hour i think it killed off a few brain cells cause i sat through this whole thing and now im a little brain damaged either way man this is the worst man eating <UNK> movie i have ever seen
<START> of course going into it one would expect it to be a typical stupid t a flick and it is but it really does have some fairly well thought out humorous moments given the era in which it was made and the obvious exploitation aspect it is still one of the better b comedies of the time br br while watching this movie you will see quite obviously the inspiration for many of the scenes in revenge of the <UNK> and numerous other films of the same genre most of the acting is horrible and way over the top but that's exactly what i expect in a movie like this what it lacks in the way of acting ability it more than makes up for with its camp value and complete disregard for anything of merit br br the amazing thing about this movie is that there was obviously some money that went into it films like this made today just don't have the same style if you can turn your brain off and turn your sense of humor up for an hour and a half you will enjoy this flick i dare anyone to not find at least something in this movie that they think is funny if not hilarious
<START> adam eric and obnoxious best friend <UNK> justin <UNK> are driving cross country to a wedding along the way they pick up sexy <UNK> sarah <UNK> brooks then for no reason a monster truck keeps trying to run them off the road and maybe kill them who is doing this and why br br pretty good horror film its energetic and full of flashy direction which gets you right into the action it's also a horror comedy most of the humor is <UNK> and really gross but actually somewhat funny also this movie really <UNK> on the gore at times but that's a good thing the acting is ok <UNK> his nerd role a bit much <UNK> is stuck with the hopeless role of the foul mouthed sex obsessed best friend but pulls it off brooks is good too in a limited role br br but i could see the twist ending coming long before it happened and logic totally disappears at the end especially the rescue still this is a gory sometimes funny and sometimes scary horror movie i give it a 7
<START> everyone's already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obviously from people who either had a stake in the film or had friends family who had a stake in the film and that's okay if i'd made a movie all of my family and friends would be in there <UNK> it too in all honesty there are some good things along with the bad things in this movie unfortunately the bad things far <UNK> the good good the overall plot was mildly interesting the music was overall pretty good several of the songs when you could hear them were actually pretty cool the only musical issues i had were 1 the first suspense scene with some sort of quiet <UNK> it really seemed to take away from the suspense 2 the song being played when the lead characters went to an <UNK> party at a friend's house and 3 the songs that were good were too quiet especially when a heavy metal song was playing in the background while danny <UNK> hung a man sounded like a pretty cool song but it should have ripped out across the scene when danny <UNK> got now for the completely bad stuff the script was atrocious i mean horrible i've seen <UNK> dialogue in a star wars movie advice to the writer from a part time writer and full time movie buff when you write dialogue ask yourself is this something that people would actually say honestly the script was laughable i want to slam the acting but with that kind of writing it's hard to know if they have talent or not the mildly interesting plot was seriously <UNK> by the crappy dialogue i know it was low budget but words don't cost money if you have a good script even semi competent actors can pull it off this movie didn't seem to have either but hopefully the director will get a second shot at making a better film
<START> my <UNK> above of the <UNK> on the back of the dvd box sums it up this film was far more horrible than horrifying br br this is the worst film i have seen in as long as i can remember my wife accidentally rented it thinking it was the tom cruise version the laughably crude special effects on the menu screen should have <UNK> us off the gratuitous nudity already in the opening scene made us more suspicious br br but as the film wore on we were <UNK> by clumsy acting both over and under acting non continuity in directing and editing trite writing and crude special effects we gave up after a half hour or less after starting this badly it couldn't possibly get better br br since i despise reviews that pan a product without giving <UNK> here are some examples of the film's especially awkward moments even if they amount to spoilers br br the lead says good bye to his young old son as the latter is about to drive away with his mother the latter <UNK> because it's their wedding <UNK> but the lead is not coming along due to sudden business the son asks quietly worried will i ever see you again perhaps it's supposed to come off as a <UNK> but it instead comes off as <UNK> behavior for a child that age in that situation br br a huge alien <UNK> has crashed to earth and sits in an enormous <UNK> a crowd of people stands nearby <UNK> at it <UNK> but otherwise looking generally one woman finally says it's <UNK> br br after this craft has laid waste a village and its inhabitants the lead and a <UNK> now alone near their homes and trying to load their cars for an escape have an exchange something like this in a quietly puzzled tone br br what was that thing anyway i <UNK> br br a crowd attempting to <UNK> over a bridge is <UNK> by the military since part of the bridge is destroyed when an alien ship shoots an explosive at it the crowd starts to run away seemingly only because a director told them to and not because they're frightened or in any kind of real danger let alone unusual circumstances br br and so forth writing about the film falls short of the experience of actually seeing it but please please save yourself the bother even if your morbid curiosity is <UNK> the film is so bad it can't even be enjoyed as unintentional humor versus say king <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> starring <UNK> <UNK> wearing a wig life is too short to waste watching such nonsense there must be something more <UNK> and enjoyable to do like walking the dog or cleaning a <UNK>
<START> <UNK> looks like it's gonna cost you a <UNK> 00 to buy a copy either dvd or video format from <UNK> direct br br <UNK> br br sorry about this but imdb won't let me submit this comment unless it has at least 10 lines so br br br br
<START> i watched this film during a special advanced preview in reading br br the two main characters michael and <UNK> strike up a friendship when <UNK> is introduced to the care home that michael already <UNK> michael is amazed to find someone who can finally understand him as until now his <UNK> made people think that he couldn't communicate br br <UNK> introduces michael to the life that he's missing <UNK> is a <UNK> character who doesn't let his condition muscular <UNK> get to him br br they bond and apply for independent living and find a lovely flat and assistant and have all the fun that they could ever dream of br br don't go to see this film if you are after some entertainment do go see this film if you're willing to see something a little different br br the storyline is strong the actors are fantastic and despite the sadness that comes with the film the mood is uplifting br br i thoroughly recommend it though if you are anything like me and prone to crying take <UNK> as you'll need them
<START> charlie <UNK> war is an excellent example of how films should be made this movie is of the highest quality and is cast perfectly tom hanks play the lead and delivers an exceptional performance furthermore tom hanks is <UNK> by the <UNK> acting ability of the incredible philip seymour hoffman i have never seen him in a role that suits him so perfectly br br the film is witty intelligent and well written julia roberts also stars in this film but is easily over <UNK> by the other two leads br br i rated this film 10 10 and am pleased to recommend this film to anyone that is interested in quality cinema
<START> i saw this movie in a theater while on vacation in <UNK> co i had just quit my <UNK> job at a hospital i consider the script to be a exaggeration of the real type of stuff that goes on in <UNK> br br the idiots that put it down on production value don't get the point and probably have never been <UNK> and never worked in one for sure billy jack same era was very poorly produced but had a significant social comment and was a very good movie with a real social message br br i have ever since been looking for this movie this is the first site i have found where it get mentioned
<START> being a great fan of disney i was really disappointed when i watched this garbage the animation was pretty and the backgrounds were amazing but i believe that good animation does not make up for a weak script and weak story i'm gonna have to disagree with the people who say it is not suitable for children yes there are some deaths in the movie but isn't death something that children should at least be exposed to but i <UNK> the script is <UNK> with bad <UNK> and lame jokes the kind i could expect from most <UNK> movies the music was <UNK> the morals forced and forced without any charm whatsoever and the characters would burst into song at totally inappropriate times the characters were also cold and i really couldn't <UNK> up any form of emotion towards them bar <UNK> i am a great fan of jungle book <UNK> and new groove but this disney movie was a total and utter waste of time do not watch it
<START> this is one of barbara <UNK> earlier films and it sure does have an unconventional theme she's making money by dancing with men at a dance hall she really doesn't like the work but it's a living her boyfriend seems like a pretty nice guy but she's also pursued by rich guy <UNK> cortez well after marrying it turns out her nice guy is a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and rich cortez turns out to be a heck of a guy by the end of the film barbara simply has had enough as any sane woman would walk from this horrid marriage br br in the 1920s and early 30s hollywood did pretty much anything it wanted and some of their films had themes or scenes that would surprise many today such as nudity adultery and bad language while ten cents a dance isn't a blatant example of this morality it does have a theme that never would have been allowed after the <UNK> production code was created and <UNK> starting in 1934 in some ways the code was great after all parents didn't need to worry about what their kids saw in films such as nudity in ben <UNK> <UNK> however it also tended to <UNK> some of the movies far too much and there is no way this particular film could have been made and <UNK> because it tends to <UNK> divorce a serious no no 1934 and thereafter this is really a shame as i don't think ten cents a dance was bad at all to discuss this especially since the star barbara stanwyck was married to a <UNK> thief even so allowing the film to end with her <UNK> him and marrying a man who himself was twice divorced just couldn't have been br br overall the film is interesting and thought provoking plus it was well paced and suited its relatively short run time give this one a look br br <UNK> sadly <UNK> cortez was actually not hispanic but changed his name because of possible prejudice because he was jewish he was an excellent leading man of his time but today is all but forgotten
<START> the dreams of are to be feared when the right <UNK> of his characters <UNK> the left shocking images of blood <UNK> and various <UNK> are released religion won't save you nor will mother nature or your own family dark poetry because that's what this film really is all <UNK> of <UNK> br br is a current crowd <UNK> on the horror fantasy festival circuit the film's opening <UNK> on madness is both well written and profound the <UNK> desire to <UNK> the <UNK> process which brought him into the hell he <UNK> unfolds with horrific and credible <UNK> from here the film continues deeper into the and <UNK> mother nature offers depictions of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> madness nature is exposed as blood <UNK> and violent in frightening enlightenment br br is disturbing to all and rewarding to those who see past the shock into the mature themes of life lust and madness this very worthy film explores <UNK> <UNK> deserves kudos for his special make up as do david for unnerving sound design and <UNK> for score
<START> this is one of the stooges best shorts it was the only one of their shorts to be nominated for an oscar in this short the stooges play doctors who cause some trouble as usual this short has non stop sight gags <UNK> and jokes the part at the end where the stooges are breaking apart the machine this is definitely a classic i would highly recommend this three stooges short
<START> i saw this when i was twelve it was the movie that made me understand what a good mystery really was i had read the entire happy children's mystery series and they were about a family of child <UNK> who always got their man but we the readers were not in a position to solve the mystery along with them this movie showed me that a good mystery is that which makes the viewer reader at the end say oh of course
<START> there is really but one thing to say about this sorry movie it should never have been made the first one one of my favourites an american werewolf in london is a great movie with a good plot good actors and good fx but this one it stinks to heaven with a cry of <UNK> br br
<START> today i had a real <UNK> for a sci fi movie and so i decided to check out sadly that was one of my biggest mistakes this year br br i see that the director neil johnson has directed over 500 music videos and i suggest he goes back to that music videos are a perfectly good form of entertainment and not everybody can cut it making movies br br the worst part of this movie is probably the voice over and that says a lot since the special effects are appalling at times voice over didn't work in blade runner and it doesn't work here the first hour or so is spent watching the main character walk through the desert while her daughter tells the story i think the story could have made a great movie but not like this br br the second worst part are the effects they are simply bad and they don't blend into the rest of the picture at all so you simply don't believe in them and absolutely all the frames in the movie has been <UNK> and not in a good way <UNK> used as an effect is good 90 minutes of it bad br br and what is it with all the <UNK> talking all the time and not <UNK> up if i had used technology like that i would have gone mad i was just waiting for the guns to <UNK> out with i am awfully sorry but i seem to have run out of <UNK> no stay away this movie is just not worth the time
<START> probably grossly underrated by all who never experienced the hell of living under communist regime although it seems hard to believe all of it happened actually the reality was even worse than the movie it resembles <UNK> fiction only this is no fiction john hurt is excellent as always yes the screenplay is not full of action but life is not either plot is breathtaking yes people were shot yes thousands of them their was that they wanted to leave communist without government at times the movie drives tears in your eyes we need more movies like this to really appreciate what america provides for us excellent movie highly recommend god bless our country usa
<START> occasionally i accidentally leave the television on after south park and i end up catching some of the train wreck of middle school humor that is mind of <UNK> it's the only time i wish my room was <UNK> because i'd be able to find the remote that much faster the truth is comedy central was in need of a replacement <UNK> show and what they got was a show that appeals to idiots that either miss dave so much they'll <UNK> to any minority variety show or are satisfied with the plain <UNK> love jokes that carlos <UNK> <UNK> in every week i am to understand though that there are some people out there that actually find <UNK> <UNK> funny i firmly stand by my words when i say i believe these people to exist only in myth however if you are indeed out there i ask only that you never enter into my <UNK> district and read these major differences between carlos and <UNK> show br br 1 dave was funny you may want to highlight this one br br 2 <UNK> show was five times as edgy as <UNK> could ever hope to be yet every time a <UNK> for his little show <UNK> it's all about him <UNK> his own horn about how he's nothing we've ever seen before you've got that right carlos and not in a good way didn't need to tell people he was edgy and funny we all just kind of stuck around to watch the show to find out for ourselves br br 3 actually had race jokes that <UNK> into some depth of the different cultures things that some people didn't know about like his i know black people game segment the grand prize was some hair cream that black people use that's deeper than <UNK> would ever dare to dive so how dare he call himself edgy if <UNK> were writing that sketch the grand prize would have been fried chicken and <UNK> aid and my <UNK> have some merit i saw a <UNK> for his show which i have <UNK> come to call <UNK> t v <UNK> taking a s t for thirty <UNK> a few days ago and it was some stereotype <UNK> sketch which i admitted to myself was a pretty funny concept then i saw that the mexican that won received a green card as a grand prize that's it that's as close to the fire as you wanna get who couldn't think of that back in <UNK> grade for you fans of the show if you're ever watching and you miss one of his <UNK> perhaps because you and your friends were discussing how duh de <UNK> never gets old and is in no way the part of the joke where someone funny would have something clever to say just remember that there are only five possible choices for <UNK> anyway green card border <UNK> lawn and of course duh de just remember <UNK> it was it was screamed enjoy br br 4 kind of relating to number two every time he says something that gets a laugh he'll pause to tell people while laughing at his own joke that he thinks he went too far with that last one then don't say it for god's sake or let the people decide by themselves he and comedy central keep <UNK> this tripe down my throat that he's this tell it like it is show that is more controversial than the da <UNK> code you're not you never will be br br i've never been offended by the show's content i would never give it that much credit i'm offended that carlos <UNK> is given thirty minutes to scream unnecessarily yeah i'm literally offended by that fact
<START> like many other <UNK> here i went in expecting a taste of music that would satisfy my curiosity and got more than i asked for i heard and saw a powerful exquisite sometimes haunting sometimes touching lyrical sentimental in the <UNK> way and absolutely stunning blend of music and musicians reminded me a lot of some forms of indian music east indian but at the same time was very very different br br starting from the the first track by <UNK> to the <UNK> singer what a voice to to the jam session or ' as we call it in india in the small turkish bar <UNK> big fan now i enjoyed every minute and wished it wouldn't end br br one of the best music <UNK> i have seen and heard in a long time br br i am <UNK> for a cd of the sound track and hope i can find it online somewhere soon and also for old and latest albums from <UNK> br br a day later the music is still <UNK> in my brain and i don't want it to go away turkey and specifically <UNK> now seem such beautiful and exciting places and i am going to start saving today to go take it in br br faith akin this is a gem
<START> to most of us life is an unfolding process of love for others like <UNK> <UNK> however it is dominated by darkness and fear based on the korean folk tale and kim <UNK> brilliant gothic horror story a tale of two sisters revolves around two sisters <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who are part of a dysfunctional family that live together in a creepy victorian style mansion feeling <UNK> from the world they <UNK> to each other for survival with the older <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> protecting the younger <UNK> <UNK> against danger for <UNK> <UNK> however not coming to terms with the circumstances surrounding her mother's death means mental illness and a mind at odds with reality br br while we may recognize <UNK> such as haunted houses with <UNK> doors that open and close on their own a cruel and overbearing stepmother and other events of high <UNK> a tale of two sisters superbly explores deeper psychological meanings including the inability to let go of inner demons and the misplaced desire for revenge <UNK> <UNK> says do you know what's really scary you want to forget something totally wipe it off your mind but you never can it can't go away you see and and it follows you around like a ghost there is a time line but it is left for the viewer to unravel the plot cannot be <UNK> only suggested and the film keeps us wondering whether what is happening on screen is objective or <UNK> br br in the film's opening <UNK> <UNK> an obviously disturbed young woman is being <UNK> by a doctor in a setting that looks like a mental institution when the doctor asks her to describe what happened that day the film flashes back to when <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> return to the home of their father <UNK> kim <UNK> and stepmother <UNK> <UNK> ah the stepmother is hostile and <UNK> and the father is passive and distant but it is obvious that it is <UNK> <UNK> who is really hurting as the girls try to <UNK> they are constantly frightened by a presence in the house which may be nightmares or supernatural <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> sees a figure at the foot of her bed that <UNK> over her and <UNK> black blood a dinner scene in which the guest apparently sees a ghost hiding under the sink and goes into <UNK> a monster emerges from between the legs of one of the sisters people mysteriously disappear from photographs and many other <UNK> <UNK> devices to keep the viewer <UNK> on the edge of insanity while we sense that much of the story is the projection of someone's mind we do not know whose and the film keeps us constantly challenged at least until an important clue is offered in the film's second half br br shot in gorgeous low light cinematography a tale of two sisters has a unique <UNK> and other <UNK> beauty that <UNK> all the scares and there are plenty it is haunting in more than one sense of the word and its images may stare back at you when you least expect or want them to while the film may not offer the weary <UNK> much in the way of light it shows us where we can end up if we <UNK> for the darkness in the words of a wise <UNK> blame is never the answer whether it is <UNK> yourself or others rather the answer lies in stepping out of judgment entirely both of yourself and others forgiveness and understanding have great power of healing
<START> i was fortunate enough to be an extra in this movie when i was about 13 during the roller <UNK> scenes my junior high school drama class was invited to participate it was a fantastic experience br br gary busey charles martin smith and don <UNK> played the music live all day as a musician i can appreciate the <UNK> work and dedication these guys put in to their roles they must have played those songs 20 times it's very difficult to maintain <UNK> and energy under those conditions this is visible during a cut to a close up on that'll be the day but fortunately the unsuspecting public probably wouldn't have picked it up br br <UNK> around all day getting the day off from school and being transported back in time was a incredible thrill i also had my first date on film i had to walk a girl up to the ticket booth woo <UNK> even with an out of date <UNK> and hot lights melting the <UNK> in my hair it was still worth it fun stuff br br the movie is top notch and is highly satisfying as a whole busey delivers his best role ever and the supporting cast is superb i'm glad to have <UNK> in a great film of the day to think i could have been in <UNK> summer or something not br br a funny ironic ending to this is that years later i was in a video store in <UNK> looking at the movie the week it was released on video gary busey walked in and stood right next to me i showed him the cover and on how great he was and how i was an extra and <UNK> pretty weird but very cool for what it's worth
<START> i honestly don't know what words imdb will allow me to use in this review as a result i'm having a hard time describing these shorts let's just say there's a good amount of gay sex some <UNK> some incest a fair amount of masturbation and several artificial members and i loved every minute of it br br not that it's all crude humor it isn't they stray away from fart gags for the most part with the exception of one sketch entitled pizza in which they use one very well they being 3 of the short lived sketch comedy group that aired on mtv called the state namely david <UNK> michael and michael ian black br br the trio go on adventures usually playing themselves and encounter strange and unusual people people that are often actually more normal than they are the supporting cast is fantastic as well paul rudd julie <UNK> <UNK> cooper <UNK> and sam <UNK> all make appearances in various sketches they're also joined by other the state <UNK> like joe lo and todd the musical <UNK> are also very well placed br br i've enjoyed these sketches over and over again but they aren't for everybody as they're pretty vulgar most of the time if you like clever humor that isn't afraid to push the limits of good taste then i highly recommend this if you liked wet hot american summer directed and written by <UNK> and or the state then you should really enjoy this br br i think it can currently only be ordered online check out their website and stream a couple of sketches to get an idea if you really want this first and then find out how to buy the dvd
<START> i got monster man in a box set of three films where i mainly wanted the other two but still had a very pleasant time with it it <UNK> horror and comedy to reasonable effect helped out considerably by the decent performances of eric as the geeky lead justin <UNK> as his a hole friend and <UNK> brooks as the love interest the film is fairly predictable and mines ideas from a host of other films but stays fun throughout with some good gruesome gore thrown in sure it doesn't measure up to the classic gory comedies but this still does fine director michael davis even manages one or two creepy scenes such as in the bathroom or the bar the film is watchable throughout if a little <UNK> plotted and written and for me it only lost it a bit towards the end when the monster man of the title starts to resemble a member of <UNK> and the film tries to go more horror style but isn't twisted or convincing enough the final moments are a <UNK> weak as well still despite lack of much suspense and overall silliness this is a good example of <UNK> often <UNK> splatter comedy that should <UNK> itself to fans of the same
<START> probably the biggest thing about wild rebels that hurts it the most is the hero he's got loser written all over him but that doesn't stop him from getting the girl probably one of the world's worst race drivers imaginable he decides to stop racing after he crashes his car well his new job is racing still as a bunch of biker types pick him to drive their <UNK> car as they commit crimes there's nothing really to <UNK> you to rod even the situation he's thrown into is pretty stupid in the end at the <UNK> scene you'll wish that rod gets killed with all the <UNK> get this he's shot twice once in the arm and once in the leg and still manages to crawl up the stairs a little if only had better aim br br avoid this one unless you're watching the mst3k version
<START> <UNK> no real need to say anything else this movie actually had me <UNK> suicide as a huge fan of the wonderful genre that is zombie movies i found this to quite possibly be the worst attempt i have ever been <UNK> too the film never actually seemed to go anywhere what was the point to it all i am left feeling hopeless and lost hell this was so bad i cant even justify bashing it anymore i'm just gonna go hang myself in the closet ok now i tried to submit my comment but the <UNK> will only accept comments that are ten lines or more so here it goes bad horrible no where near enough gore no tits how can you have a zombie movie without tits as a matter of fact the female lead had one hell of a rack and the only reason i watched the film to <UNK> was in order to maybe by chance get a glimpse nope of course there was one line that does deserve mentioning a line i am looking forward to using myself someday when i just feel the need to get my face <UNK> this <UNK> isn't going to smoke itself this movie is bad so bad
<START> i love brian <UNK> other work even <UNK> stuff like <UNK> but was too much even for me my chief complaint is that it's needlessly exploitative of <UNK> nudity i'm no <UNK> but these nude scenes just drag on and on and on only to <UNK> virtually every time in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of sexual violence the scene where she attempts a coat <UNK> abortion after several minutes of naked screaming is a prime example arnold is utterly turgid but even jeffrey <UNK> couldn't save this <UNK> heap of a film the aliens are boring the uniformly dull lighting <UNK> your interest and the plot is absolutely predictable the only highlights for me were an all too brief glimpse of the <UNK> true form very nice model and the scene where <UNK> finds his wife in the closet was ok too but you've been warned
<START> i have watched this film several times over the years and always find it an entertaining experience as a retired <UNK> pilot i am interested in most <UNK> movies and this is one of the better ones i know that <UNK> was only 25 years old at the time of his historic solo flight to paris and that james stewart was almost 50 when making this movie but i can overlook that fact because stewart has always been one of my all time favorite actors and does one of his usual outstanding performances as the lone eagle br br there is a good mixture of comedy and drama throughout the film and a good use of flashbacks it also helps that james stewart was a pilot in real life both in the military and <UNK> life
<START> unlike the other spaghetti westerns this one has characters that almost make sense and can be identified to some degree it still has the goofy <UNK> of other <UNK> westerns a spaghetti by the way is another word for a western with no plot no characters you can care about and goofy <UNK> that doesn't make a bit of sense for the era and relying on great music to make audiences feel something this one is more lighthearted like the ones that bud spencer and <UNK> hill made together they too were superior to the junk made by eastwood and others which <UNK> <UNK> make their friends watch if they get a chance it looks like everyone had a lot of fun making the movie too it was good to see a giant actor like gilbert <UNK> who wasn't even mentioned on the movie rental box yet who was clearly the biggest name his character was very enjoyable there is a three way <UNK> at the end which is much superior to the one it spoofs the good the bad and the ugly simply because the characters are at least a bit likable and a bit <UNK> not a good movie but has a bit of fun to it
<START> br br heather graham is not just a pretty face she is also an extremely talented actress she adds a unique <UNK> to the movie overall it's an intelligent and yet compassionate look at love marriage and relationships i thoroughly enjoyed it
<START> sci fi channel thinks this is sci fi it's a shame big bugs snakes mythical <UNK> on and on they <UNK> br br some one at universal had the brains to include battlestar galactica the new good one and <UNK> for a brief moment in their line up i know they know they difference between total garbage and extremely high quality sci fi br br a few years back they were on about how they were going all high and mighty making productions that were not just for us mere lame o <UNK> thanks so much sci fi you know you make movies so bad even <UNK> won't watch them so you achieved your goal fire <UNK> ice <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc and a vast <UNK> crap storm later and they're still <UNK> out just faster than the latest <UNK> virus how they do it is beyond my ken why they do it i just don't know how they can ignore these reviews comments <UNK> and e <UNK> i don't know either but it's clear they don't think much of their audience or care about our opinions they seem to think this is what sci fi fans want you would think one or two good productions with some sense would creep through when whoever green lights this junk is on vacation at least they're <UNK> the collection of <UNK> toys many of the sci fi movie of the week actors were in science fiction shows once and now need the cash love you folks and hope you get some better work
<START> in my opinion <UNK> ruined the first show with his ridiculous ego he was <UNK> to his dancing partner tried to <UNK> everyone and had no awareness of the spirit of <UNK> it's well he left the show colin dunne the new male lead is superb and when he and jean butler dance together magic happens <UNK> <UNK> is astonishing as is <UNK> <UNK> and maria fire dance is worth the price of admission when pages and get together near the end of the show for a musical <UNK> well it's a genuine treasure i agree the editing isn't <UNK> but no technical <UNK> can <UNK> this extraordinary tour de force this is the one to get there's never been anything like <UNK> this is the real one
<START> this is certainly a quality movie with a classy cast as far as movies about carlos the go this one beats bruce <UNK> feeble efforts in 'the to a bloody pulp then <UNK> on them i am a bit surprised that this movie hasn't attracted more votes something of a <UNK> obviously a pity because this film is definitely worth a watch it is clever and never dull see it 7 10
<START> this is the first james cagney film i have ever really watched i was never interested in his movies before because i figured i wouldn't like anything in that style of cinema and because i've heard most cagney films are the same i have to say i really liked it by today's standards for movies it was not special but i found it surprisingly entertaining cagney did not have the look of a tough guy but he played the part very well
<START> mary pickford plays annie rooney the daughter of a cop that lives in the tough part of town she is a rough and <UNK> young lady of <UNK> age somewhere between 12 and 16 who loves to <UNK> but down deep has a heart of gold br br this is a very typical style of film for mary pickford like so many of her films she plays a young girl even though she was nearly 40 when she made little annie rooney and like so many other stories she was both <UNK> and courageous as a result i had a strong feeling of <UNK> <UNK> now if you haven't seen her other films this isn't an issue however she is essentially playing a character much like the one in <UNK> or daddy long legs though these two other films are a lot better now this isn't to say this is a bad film just that it's certainly not among her best work mostly due to a rather <UNK> story that is very heavy on sentiment but not especially convincing entertaining but not essential viewing unless you are a huge fan of the <UNK>
<START> the other lowest rating reviewers have summed up this <UNK> so perfectly there seems little to add i must stress that i've only had the cockney filth <UNK> on me during visits from my children who insist on watching the sunday <UNK> my god it's depressing like all <UNK> it consists entirely of totally unlikeable characters being unpleasant to each other but it's ten times as bad as the next worst one could be the reviewer who <UNK> the <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by its <UNK> was spot on if anyone lived in a social environment like this they'd slash their <UNK> within days and i can assure anyone not familiar with the real east end that it's rather more than you'll ever see here take my advice avoid this <UNK> of the british tv industry it is evil
<START> i enjoyed the first toxic <UNK> but the sequel just didn't work there are some funny gags in the opening involving members of the home for the blind but past that point i was simply bored the sequel is also filled with much quirky low brow humor only this time it's not funny much of the gags <UNK> around <UNK> japanese stereotypes almost every japanese character seems to be <UNK> fish does everyone in japan chop fish the troma films are known for being more than a little <UNK> but if you're gonna use humor involving racial stereotypes at least make it funny i can't laugh if i'm handed the same crap i've seen a million times before one thing i have to give credit for is the gratuitous nudity there's even more gratuitous nudity than in the first but altogether i was very disappointed and the film ends with a tedious chase scene which had me <UNK> and <UNK> dying for the movie to fade to black at least there's one hilarious line from the film which had me <UNK> with laughter after the villain says a line from shakespeare to one of the local citizens the citizen an elderly woman responds by saying f k you that's from david mamet br br my score 3 out of 10
<START> since i'd bought the dvd i watched as much of this as i did out of a sense of <UNK> to my <UNK> br br the plot has kirk douglas as a successful first novelist who hired <UNK> day as a secretary falls in love and marries her complications ensue br br douglas is usually thought of as an intense actor given to heavily dramatic roles sometimes hero sometimes rat he's not bad in this thoroughly comic part the problem is that the part isn't particularly comic and neither is anything else br br the plot <UNK> on a dozen quirky characters come and go most <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> friend who does nothing but make <UNK> comments thelma ritter was better at this sort of thing br br well if the plot is weak it could still have been rescued by some <UNK> in the dialog but there is none to speak of some gags are silly others don't clear that bar here's what i thought of as an amusing line douglas has just hired day and wants to get her down to the beach house and seduce her day is disturbed and remarks that she's never heard of a writer working in a beach house <UNK> asks if she liked <UNK> previous book last year's love yes of course she did well most of <UNK> year's <UNK> was done in the beach house ha ha br br nice cast including support but a failed comedy there have been better sitcoms on television
<START> the <UNK> has happened having first witnessed it a few years ago i have had a film that has been my <UNK> for awfulness and that film was called island a family adventure movie with hulk hogan and grace jones i'm not making this up it <UNK> to new depths of movie making and is still the only film i've seen that made me wonder what else the film's budget could have been spent on like new schools or cancer treating drugs however for sheer and <UNK> levels of crap any film will be having to lower their standards even lower if they wish to <UNK> guest house <UNK> to the distinction of being one of the very worst movies i've ever had to watch br br based loosely around the <UNK> but amusing tv show bottom this film introduces us to two of the biggest losers imaginable richard is a hotel manager as <UNK> as anyone you can imagine and so <UNK> as to almost <UNK> <UNK> from every action his buddy eddie director adrian is an alcoholic waste of human life and together they try to run <UNK> worst hotel <UNK> upon a cliff top next to a nuclear power station between them they <UNK> in <UNK> violence with sound effects at regular <UNK> steal anything remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there and stare <UNK> at any woman at all the plot such as it is involves the arrival of <UNK> italian screen <UNK> gina vincent <UNK> who is fleeing from her wedding and attempts to lay low at the guest house <UNK> much to the <UNK> of <UNK> and eddie and that's it br br i used to think that the carry on films represented everything bad about the uk film industry and god knows we've spent so much time and money trying to escape that god awful legacy we've had films like <UNK> 28 days later four <UNK> and a funeral and the brilliant shaun of the dead also starring simon pegg but this this drags those films screaming and kicking back to the days of sid james and barbara top flying off with the aid of a <UNK> <UNK> guest house <UNK> is so low in its ambition that it insults you the minute you watch it i kept watching waiting in anticipation for the jokes to start but they never came just an endless stream of trapped <UNK> gags unimaginative scenarios that defy explanation slightly amusing violence with <UNK> pans and <UNK> doors and almost nothing raising so much as a <UNK> come the first ad break it was on tv you see and i was ready to switch off but my loyal duties to you my readers kept me going i'm watching this so they don't have to became my <UNK> so you guys better remember how much you owe me for this because this was about as much fun as having sand kicking into my eyes and being force fed dog food br br trust me i used to love the bottom tv show the combination of suitably <UNK> acting from and with <UNK> juvenile humour worked for half an hour every week certainly not for an hour and a half as and <UNK> themselves in their little private joke and bore and <UNK> the rest of the audience honestly this makes <UNK> drop dead fred seem like the godfather and should you happen to meet either of these two people who are pretty much solely responsible for the chaos on screen pretending to be a movie feel free to <UNK> deliver a boot to their <UNK> region they'd probably enjoy it pegg and bill <UNK> both as guests at the hotel are dragged down with this sinking ship but at least they survived and should not be so lucky the movie equivalent of and should be avoided as such
<START> i cant believe it i thought this is a good sequel when jim carry in the film has a baby but instead its a film with crappy actors stupid plot and stupid scenes this should be in films of sh t in <UNK> thank god the same director did not make this because this is so stupid with some cartoonish parts like the fart was not funny not the pee and not the dancing i laughed at this because of how stupid the person made this like homer simpson making a movie about a <UNK> i wish someone makes a remake of son of the mask with a plot like this the mask guy jim carry and his wife have a son which is a normal baby when the baby finds another mask he became the mask too and the mask guy tries to get his mask back this is very crap so i'll give it a 1 out of 10 fu king sh t
<START> boring utterly predictable soap opera mary tyler moore is married to ted <UNK> who's having an affair with christine moore is friends with and doesn't know about the cheating <UNK> dies in an accident and is pregnant with his baby yawn br br i'm ashamed to admit i paid money to see this in a theatre in 1986 i liked all three stars but even their considerable talents couldn't pull this off i constantly knew what was going to happen like another poster said this plays like a pg rated lifetime movie br br it does have swearing <UNK> at one point and even moore lets loose once also there's a pointless shots of topless women playing football other than that it's tv friendly the only good thing about this was timothy <UNK> playing moore and teenage son very handsome and quite a good actor that aside there's nothing to recommend this you've seen it before and done better it's obviously been forgotten skip it
<START> my father took me to see this film when it was released in 1976 i was but a child and it scared the crap out of me so much so that i had to leave the theatre during a particularly claustrophobic tunnel scene as it was too intense for me i went home to the safety of my family i saw the film all the way through as i got older and thoroughly enjoyed it shame about the men in monster suits though if you overlook the <UNK> of the production and delve deeper you'll find an excellent performance by cushing a stunning opening score some nice photography and the ever reliable mr douglas <UNK> my childhood hero british police <UNK> the <UNK> at the end <UNK> bang bang cave woman monsters with actors in monster suits <UNK> on <UNK> this has it all superb
<START> i'd been <UNK> this one ever since its dvd release  for one thing because i'd been somewhat <UNK> by this director's two other horror titles <UNK> 1976 and blue sunshine 1977 but also the fact that the film itself is said to have been slightly <UNK> for gore on the media <UNK> <UNK> show 2 disc set i now <UNK> upon it as a rental and am glad i did  because not only is it superior to the earlier efforts at least on this <UNK> <UNK> but i also found the film to be one of the better <UNK> of the texas chain saw massacre 1974 this factor however only helped remind me that i've yet to check out another such example  wes craven's classic the hills have eyes 1977 whose 2 disc <UNK> edition from anchor bay i purchased some time ago but after all halloween time is fast approaching br br anyway the film manages an effortlessly unsettling backwoods atmosphere it was shot in the forest and mountain <UNK> of <UNK>  with plenty of effective throughout but thankfully not too much violence even if the last of the villains is <UNK> in quite an outrageous fashion the principal young cast here one of them played by jack <UNK> son chris isn't quite as obnoxious as those we usually encounter in this type of genre offering  despite <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> one associates with teen oriented flicks and which by and large <UNK> to this day george kennedy appears as a sympathetic ranger though he doesn't have a lot to do his characterization is decidedly enhanced by making him a lover of plant and animal life also notable among the locals is familiar character actor mike in a nice role as the <UNK> who first comes into contact with the murderous duo of the narrative  his warning to the teenagers naturally goes <UNK> but he's later able to lead kennedy to them br br the <UNK> family the teens come across in the woods then is eventually revealed to be hiding a <UNK> in their closet while one of the girls displays genuine curiosity at the presence the rest are openly hostile to them  and in the case of the <UNK> and <UNK> twins appropriately creepy one of them is even prone to <UNK> laughter during his <UNK> at a certain point in the narrative the ranger even offers an interesting explanation as to the nature of their aggressive and generally <UNK> behavior
<START> absolute must see documentary for anyone interested in getting to the bottom of this story told with <UNK> eye and with gripping style if you think conspiracy theories are for paranoid disturbed people this could change your mind something for you <UNK> too a good model for government <UNK> if you like your news all <UNK> and easy to <UNK> this is not for you
<START> i felt this film did have many good qualities the cinematography was certainly different exposing the stage aspect of the set and story the original characters as actors was certainly an achievement and i felt most played quite convincingly of course they are playing themselves but definitely unique the cultural aspects may leave many disappointed as a <UNK> with the chinese and oriental culture will answer a lot of questions regarding parent child relationships and the <UNK> that goes with any drug use i found the <UNK> story interesting on a down note the story is in <UNK> and some of the fashion and music <UNK> of early 90s even though this was made in 2001 so it's really cheesy sometimes the beatles crap etc whatever not a top ten or twenty but if it's on the television check it out
<START> george <UNK> is a who steals a rare copy of hamlet killing a guard in the process months later an associate of his is selling <UNK> of the book for great sums of money one of the <UNK> is sold to a man working for the <UNK> not happy at being taken the nazi front man insists on getting his money back at the same time an investigator working for one of the other <UNK> <UNK> shows up the middle woman in an effort to keep herself safe begins to play all sides against each other and sets up a meeting at the new york public library between various parties however as people begin to die the library is locked down and more murders and perhaps some rare book <UNK> seem to be close to happening complex murder mystery is a good little thriller with a great cast <UNK> is joined by richard and a cast of solid supporting players if there is a flaw the film is almost too complicated with plots with in plots and everyone pretty much out for themselves the layers of <UNK> <UNK> murder and war time intrigue this was 1942 are almost too many for the brief 70 minute running time still its an enjoyable little film with a darkness and sense of <UNK> doom for some of the characters that clearly marks this as one of the first film <UNK> until shows up we're down among some charming thieves whom we like perhaps even more than the hero but its clear from word and deed this is not going to have a completely happy ending and they know it even if they fight it a good little film that's worth searching out
<START> <UNK> <UNK> jr returns to <UNK> along as the mummy <UNK> seeking his mate whose soul now <UNK> in the beautiful host of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> high priest of <UNK> george <UNK> leaves <UNK> <UNK> john carradine in charge of <UNK> to continue their evil doing ways tom robert <UNK> must find a way to save his beloved from certain future mummy terror br br routine predictable entry in the <UNK> series proves that nearly every film follows a specific format formula the city is threatened by a <UNK> one armed corpse masked in <UNK> who seems to have been gifted with <UNK> power to choke the life out of able <UNK> men who are restrained with relative ease by a mere from <UNK> frank <UNK> who saw <UNK> in action and knows a great deal about egyptian history in the previous film the <UNK> tomb proves that anyone who happened to survive a previous encounter with the mummy is sure to die if he returns in the next flick well produced but lacks originality that would set it apart from the other films in the series sadly carradine <UNK> through his role as the evil <UNK> <UNK> embarrassing script mistake has <UNK> who is known for <UNK> a crippled lame right arm carrying an unconscious with both arms for long <UNK> with no ill effects one aspect the shocking climax where <UNK> attempt at <UNK> doesn't go according to plan as <UNK> holds his damsel in distress hostage lifts the film from the <UNK> slightly
<START> this is the worst film i've seen in a time it reminded me of a du <UNK> show i saw in vegas six years ago without the by that i mean a few striking artsy images appear randomly without any <UNK> <UNK> the fake <UNK> <UNK> film is really tacky this device is almost never justified and certainly is not in with apologies to <UNK> lincoln you can fool some of the people some of the time
<START> when we are young we all pick out an ideal <UNK> for ourselves artist actor writer rocket scientist etc while most of us grow out of our <UNK> dreams the main character of american movie mark has yet to let go of his and at a thirty something age too to become a wealthy acclaimed director despite the fact that murphy's law won't leave mark alone and something always seems to go wrong mark is able to <UNK> during each incident with an even greater drive to reach his goals his desire to be a director so controls his character that he sees any person or thing in his life as something to exploit to reach the goal while i noticed other imdb <UNK> are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i think it's an almost justified sort of <UNK> because for mark not becoming a famous director is equivalent to death he talks <UNK> about leaving some kind of mark on the world and he sees filmmaking as a way to do this br br unfortunately any viewer of this movie picks up early on the fact that mark has a near zero chance of ever achieving his dream is he aware of this no not in the slightest and none of his family or friends want to let him in on the secret in fact even some of them believe in him strangely enough though the disappointing future the viewer feels is sure to occur for mark doesn't <UNK> the ability to find humor in the film this is a very very funny documentary most of the laughs come from when mark is filming scenes for <UNK> there's a scene where an actor has to have his head break a <UNK> and it's just not working another scene has <UNK> very old uncle bill saying a few lines to the camera needless to say after 20 takes of a lot of and line stumbling bill finally decides he's had enough a lot of humor sadly comes from mark himself his <UNK> which he seems to think is worthy of a <UNK> is <UNK> bad it's alright it's ok there is something to live for jesus told me so br br american movie is contrary to what people might think a documentary that anyone can enjoy even though my sister who watched some scenes seemed to think it was downright bizarre the fact that chris smith can successfully bring to the screen a film that <UNK> both sadness from <UNK> depressing lifestyle to hilarity with scenes with bill who unfortunately passed away before the film was released says quite a lot about him i wonder how the <UNK> mark regards this documentary does he realize that it casts him in a bad light or that it sets up to show him as a fool in many scenes of the film or does he see it as something that will be shown prior to his own a e biography segment it's an intriguing subject of wonder and i hope the latter comes true for him some day br br i highly recommend this movie 9 10
<START> at <UNK> camp the <UNK> <UNK> two shows lucky <UNK> <UNK> team must get in <UNK> with the <UNK> bad girl <UNK> team of the demons to beat the <UNK> <UNK> team who always seems to win at this camp i guess this being a typical clichéd <UNK> teen lame sex comedy who do you think will win but what the film lacks in originality it more than makes up for it sheer bloody awfulness oh and insanely bad dance numbers and the obligatory <UNK> <UNK> who want to buy the camp on the condition that male <UNK> tommy hamilton stays with the camp of course simply awful forgettable and sadly has a surprising lack of nudity br br where i saw it hbo comedy br br my grade f <UNK> i did indeed give it to them
<START> as several posters have hinted this is a sorry star wars ripoff now if you're going to rip off star wars at least do it right battlestar galactica did and there were a few other space operas that didn't do a bad job of it but this is definitely not one of them david <UNK> the juvenile lead actually isn't too bad though he goes overboard on the cute factor every so often vince <UNK> hasn't improved much as an actor since his ben <UNK> days if anything he's even more wooden than he was ten the other performances are nothing to write home about either even worse are the special effects the best you can say about them is that they're lousy it's <UNK> obvious that the aliens are simply actors wearing rubber masks with a little <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> on them and the battle scenes between <UNK> <UNK> and the aliens are poorly staged and badly shot a very weak effort from roger corman skip it
<START> i just have to comment on this movie because i gave it a 4 rating and in my opinion that's pretty high for a <UNK> <UNK> movie the actual plot is kind of hokey who would expect otherwise but is so incredibly funny and he delivers everything in a voice so it's easy for him whoever wrote the script had some wit definitely i must have laughed out loud ten times and that's not a reason anyone would pick up this movie the only <UNK> movie i've seen which had any merit other than beautiful women and believe me <UNK> is drop dead gorgeous just look at the cover br br any movie that can entertain me considering how poor the plot was and how bad the acting is also considering the movie wasn't made to artistically entertain so to speak it gets at least a four in my book i mean who wouldn't watch this before stop or my mom will shoot
<START> this is awesome there is no <UNK> quite like errol and olivia there love is genuine i'm 24 yet this flick is as captivating now as i'm sure it was 60 years ago <UNK> walsh is an under rated genius his direction is so sweeping so broad yet so intimate the last scene between colonel <UNK> flynn and his wife de <UNK> almost brought me to tears not easy for a old guy its so heart wrenching there is also a deep christian message <UNK> here the faith <UNK> has in taking your glory with you and the trust and <UNK> of his wife to the extent of letting him go in order that he his moral duty to protect the innocent civilians from certain massacre there is no movie that deals with these issues quite like this a must see for anyone who wants to look at this defining moment in american and military history from the inside patriotic for all the right reasons i knew errol flynn was a star and de <UNK> was a screen legend this only <UNK> my <UNK> that they are among the very greatest
<START> excellent story with acting by all of the cast the warmth and insight into who represents moved off of the screen and into the heart of this viewer the and <UNK> of mother in her quest to do his work till her last breath was also done with <UNK> by barbara <UNK> the <UNK> of the personalities of and mother grew throughout the story line with a breath taking <UNK> in the final scene
<START> if you value your freedom br br i first got seriously interested in the branch <UNK> after reading an article in uk <UNK> the times wanting to learn more i rented this documentary and after watching it i was stunned at what i saw this film <UNK> my interest in the subject and i have read several books on the subject since then this film is a must see for people who only know the facts as reported in the so called mainstream media the lies double talk and <UNK> statements made by officials and politicians shown in this film will make you think twice about calling people who question the <UNK> actions in this fiasco nuts <UNK> and <UNK> br br whats scary is that i know some people who consider themselves open minded <UNK> and freedom loving <UNK> who are still convinced that the government did the right thing at <UNK> and refuse to watch this film or read any of the books on the subject they continue to insist its not worth their time because its all propaganda from gun loving <UNK> hating religious fanatic right wing <UNK> nuts one <UNK> from an organization comprised of many so called great minds that claims to be dedicated to promoting reason common sense and <UNK> condemned the film claiming it would poison peoples minds and strongly suggested this film should be <UNK> they even hinted the <UNK> had it coming i won't mention its name since i'm a coward if you are one of those reading this of course you probably would not be reading this anyway i can only say its a shame you won't open your mind
<START> i was expecting this to be just like the others tries to be scary ends up looking silly somewhere along the line the writers must have realised this and so took the film in a totally different direction basically ignoring the other films this feels like a different film rather than the fourth entry in the child's play series the new idea works making this the best in the series by far
<START> the beautifully engaging song with the same name as the film won the best song oscar in 1955 br br love is a many thing br br it's the april rose that only grows in the early spring br br love is <UNK> way of giving a reason to be living br br that golden crown that makes a man a king br br once on a high and <UNK> hill br br in the morning <UNK> two lovers <UNK> and the world stood still br br then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing br br yes true love a many thing br br how can we forget such a beautiful song henry king the director had the <UNK> to work with jennifer jones twice that year for this film and the greatly under rated film good morning miss <UNK> jones was nominated for thing but she could have been easily nominated for miss <UNK> as well br br william <UNK> is just great as the war <UNK> sent to report on the communist revolution in 1949 china his love for jones an oriental doctor was endearing and so memorable to watch br br while the ending is not pleasing this is still one of the greatest romances ever put on the screen
<START> i am usually a big fan of pacino scarface <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but since <UNK> of a woman he pretty much plays the same role and shouts a lot this movie had no endearing characters to warm to brandon played by <UNK> is the least likable of the bunch he nowhere even approached a real human being pacino was hopelessly unlikeable and my goodness how old is <UNK> russo the only high light of this wretched mess was the hot hooker with the perfect <UNK> and she has like 10 lines total even the usually reliable jeremy <UNK> was utterly unlikeable br br note to writers of movies they do not usually work unless one of the main characters is at least a bit likable exception scarface as the movie <UNK> and old brandon is at the airport my only thought was please let a plane crash into the airport and kill brandon
<START> peter falk shines as 90 year old morris the <UNK> who has decided it's time to check out after holding a final blow out bash his three children san <UNK> david <UNK> and judge <UNK> are <UNK> invited by letter and immediately arrive on his <UNK> to deal with their eccentric father there is a great father daughter chemistry with laura san <UNK> whose character happens to <UNK> the most growth from the ordeal it's a well rounded example of your average dysfunctional family and their memories pains growth and ignorance tolerance of each <UNK> lives the musical score is one you'll enjoy and the one liners are well timed and hilarious although i found the actual checking out party a let down the rest of the film is sure to make you laugh cry and leave the theater with a smile on your face move over big fat greek wedding the big fat jewish suicide has arrived
<START> a <UNK> to citizen kane in its analysis of the life of a just deceased <UNK> here reviewed by his faithful secretary in a series of <UNK> flashbacks in spencer <UNK> <UNK> film he already looks middle aged even in the scenes where he is meant to be young br br a little silent screen type <UNK> is understandable given the vintage but this is a most enjoyable well written drama
<START> this sci fi great fortunately has little to do with the first one <UNK> <UNK> jack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets naked billy <UNK> appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget
<START> i played sam the porter <UNK> sidekick in the film dead <UNK> which later aired as alien express and i have to say that for my part i thoroughly enjoyed watching this film as a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people it gave me great scenes to include on my reel and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half no waiting tables the director and steve and scott the producers were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production i made many friends lou todd steven and i consider myself very fortunate to have been able to work with these incredibly talented people there was not a day that went by that i did not laugh my butt off the real tragedy isn't so much the special effects it's that every single person who watched this film didn't get to see what happened behind the scenes and all the talent that truly went into it <UNK> building the set prop masters <UNK> wardrobe makeup artists script the cinematographer production <UNK> extras craft services producers director and actors it's a given that sci fi didn't spend a terrible amount of money on the film 2 million but there was a lot of time energy and man power that was <UNK> into it i look on the film now as a production that brought a lot of talented people together for a fun project that was shot without complications in less than two months it was a magnificent cast and crew and i'm just so glad to be apart of it on a further note to those of you who don't know lou diamond phillips todd bridges and steven brand they are fantastic people who are incredibly funny lou i still am working on my deniro impression and can't thank you enough for introducing me to midnight run todd every time i hear an elvis song i can't forget the story you told me about hanging out with him at his house for dinner can you please pass me the <UNK> im a huge elvis fan steven mr brand you are a true <UNK> and all the advice and <UNK> i received from you will always be appreciated i miss you guys and hope you are well thanks for the good memories stories jokes and friendship oh and miss <UNK> says hello <UNK> <UNK> br br joe
<START> after the success of star wars there was a boost in interest in sci fi movies this was one of those cheap attempts to cash in quickly br br a group of survivors from a spaceship land on a planet inhabited by stop motion dinosaurs where half of them are <UNK> killed off the people not the dinosaurs porn movie level acting cheap special effects even for the time although it looks like a lot of effort was put into them br br costumes were pure 1970's as were the <UNK> <UNK> the 70's i expected a disco to break out at any minute br br nothing to really recommend in this film
<START> the viewer who said he was disappointed seems to be wildly missing the point here this is a superb movie excellent and realistic portrayals of a middle class jewish family in <UNK> beach brooklyn of long ago the nuances are perfect and i felt the casting of everyone was superior i especially found the acting done by <UNK> just perfection especially the speech she has with her daughter when the daughter comes home late one night that scene was oscar worthy but really all the acting was fine i recommend this movie it is a fun family film and delightful to see how a lovely middle class family lived in brooklyn so long ago see it and you will be glad you did has some very funny lines and the eugene character is a real comedian very funny
<START> anyone who knows anything about evolution wouldn't even need to see the film to say fake it's never been <UNK> also is a weak argument saying the universe was created by a giant <UNK> cannot be <UNK> although to be fair it does seem like the only people who do believe are the same people who open email <UNK> from people they don't know or give their bank details to a dude in no bones of any <UNK> are have been found in the united states or canada there is also a good reason why legitimate scientists don't bother studying this the same argument goes for the <UNK> <UNK> monster ghosts and god
<START> i was truly and wonderfully surprised at <UNK> brother where art <UNK> the video store was out of all the movies i was planning on renting so then i came across this i came home and as i watched i became <UNK> and found myself laughing out loud the <UNK> have made a film again but i think the first time you watch this movie you get to know the characters the second time now that you know them you laugh <UNK> hard it could hurt you i strongly would <UNK> anyone seeing this because if you are not you are truly missing a film gem for the ages 10 10
<START> a tedious effort from not yet great director <UNK> <UNK> and pretty but not yet un bland actress nina <UNK> this movie is as one of the other reviewers notes is the <UNK> of a certain kind of b movie it's just not the good kind and a promising premise and an <UNK> fog machine is wasted br br basic plot nina a nurse on leave from wartime duties on account of her nerves has a nightmare she meets a dashing fellow at the resort where she's giving her nerves a <UNK> and realizes he's in the dream even though she's never met him before meanwhile it turns out our dashing guy is working as a spy and is about to go on an extra secret <UNK> <UNK> mission that must not fail br br of course there are nazis and plot holes and smart people acting in a fashion most likely to get them into entirely unnecessary <UNK> so that the running time can be <UNK> out past an hour at the end the movie becomes a contest between which group of spies can act more <UNK> if the fbi and <UNK> had acted like this crew we'd have lost the war in <UNK> br br the movie itself is rather <UNK> shot despite the best efforts of the fog machine and the acting as it seems to be in many of the columbia <UNK> tcm has been showing lately is curiously <UNK> it's less stylized than what one might find from a similarly budgeted warner bros movie but also less fun to watch br br strength of course is a rather matter of fact style which allows the strong stories and acting in his randolph scott westerns to come to the <UNK> maybe the problem here is that such a style is not going to work when the script is lousy and the actors tired from their five film a year schedule
<START> my question is what was the worst element of this movie was it the acting directing script maybe it was the waste of alan <UNK> and jack <UNK> <UNK> and especially <UNK> are capable of bringing extreme <UNK> to a role in this movie it was hard to tell who the bad guy was granted <UNK> was playing an undercover good guy but even in his good guy roles he could be very chilling so the net result was a potentially good movie <UNK> of any feeling of conflict
<START> this movie is hilarious bright and insightful though perhaps the story would work well involving almost any ethnic group the inherent of the characters gives extra meaning to the bounty of wonderful dialog there were so many social issues covered in the plot that for that reason alone it would have been worth seeing but the real treasure was in the warm laughter that spread throughout the <UNK> audience the <UNK> of complex characters with their various strengths and weaknesses play out their roles with all the pathos and humor one would expect from the shakespearean drama their lives seem to parody this is a film about family about the often fragile sometimes invisible <UNK> together of diverse personalities and <UNK> first among siblings and parents and inevitably among the larger family of friends and even strangers the technical aspects of the film have given the movie a pace and development that keep the viewer intrigued until the final scene peter falk is amazing as always in his role as family <UNK> morris strong performances by a fine cast include a surprise guest don't miss this movie
<START> currently playing at the 2007 german film festival in australia http www <UNK> de ins <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> thanks to and especially for her <UNK> on the actors in this ensemble cast br br in australia these movies were sub titled in english and while french movies here often get a mainstream release german movies are still to gather that sort of commercial audience but like <UNK> and <UNK> when germans get it right i really like their films like the time here went so quickly lots of laughs from the audience as each of the 9 men and 9 women moved down the speed dating line 5 minutes at a time br br while many films are overlong this one i could have watched much more of it had the sort of characters and character development for a series given time i will re read review and reference the actors i liked and their other work with a view to keeping an eye out from them i agree most of these actors will go onto bigger and better things some very good character actors in this fine film i did see it in the program listed as a <UNK> mock or otherwise it felt very real and quite romantic in it's way br br <UNK> la
<START> in the same way <UNK> <UNK> was a <UNK> of his father mario who was an extremely overrated director anyway <UNK> is a <UNK> director in the <UNK> <UNK> mold the church has at least one thing to recommend it the incredibly detailed art direction but absolutely nothing else the film is long <UNK> filled with one dimensional characters and almost put me to sleep several times there's a fine line between <UNK> and crap ' and while the church isn't completely worthless you'd be better off watching something else br br 3 10
<START> a traveling couple <UNK> and hamilton stumble onto the town of where kids have slaughtered the adults and are always eager to slaughter more along the way they're separated and peter <UNK> of course must save his wife from these tiresome er terrible <UNK> in this very bad adaption of one of king's best short stories in the original story king managed to create tension and draw personality of his characters however all of that has been <UNK> from the production and all that is left is a repetitive bore which is far too predictable to be all that suspenseful also the effective ending used in the story is in favor dumped for a happy ending which makes the overall impact mute there is some atmosphere and stylish directing but no plot to back any of it up the kids are woefully unconvincing also br br 1 5 matt bronson
<START> never had i seen such a powerful true story movie i discovered a city a country a lost revolution and even a <UNK> prize winner thanks to this masterpiece of cinema br br if you haven't seen this movie you can't say you've seen anything br br a great lesson of courage <UNK> and life br br i haven't seen anything as good since br br t e saturday january <UNK> 1999

<START> too bad i really like <UNK> <UNK> and gary busey but the director failed to put this together there's a lot of action a lot of promise but it all comes off hokey the director didn't do his job promising action comes off lame so much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film this version of the rage <UNK> credits it as 1996 simply isn't worth the time to watch it another director would have done a better job
<START> the movie is made in a style that resembles lock stock and two smoking <UNK> with <UNK> of subplots fancy <UNK> cool music and that great tongue in cheek aussie type of humor you'll find nowhere else how this movie has escaped the european and american audience is a mystery
<START> i've discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise a christmas classic it's also one of the fine comedies of the 40s the story line is simple <UNK> lane barbara stanwyck makes out her living by writing <UNK> <UNK> for a magazine at christmas time her boss alexander <UNK> sydney <UNK> asks her to invite a young <UNK> sailor in the <UNK> farm she write about the only problem is she hasn't got any farm and she can't cook to get out of the jam <UNK> agrees to marry a wealthy friend <UNK> <UNK> who has a farm and flies for <UNK> with her wonderful cook uncle felix br br there's a fine direction by peter <UNK> and the cast is really wonderful stanwyck has never been better as this witty and yet romantic woman <UNK> <UNK> and make hilarious and human supporting characters the only weak point is the leading man dennis morgan he starts well but as the movie goes on becomes really a bore one almost feels sorry for lane to ends up with him rather than with gary cooper or david niven who both would have been more suitable for the part anyway this is a <UNK> christmas time movie with a refreshing score and i advice it to everyone who likes to spend funny and sweet holidays in <UNK>
<START> this film is utterly amazing from the performances of <UNK> <UNK> and to <UNK> screenplay and direction there is not a single <UNK> the film may put some people off with it's hard sexual subject matter and with it's slower pace but it really is a masterful piece of cinema so do not let it's challenging ways keep you away br br powerful and deserving every award it won in cannes
<START> i watched the 1st scarecrow movie and didn't bag out that one though i knew it was b grade it actually had some decent gore and the guy playing the scarecrow was an awesome <UNK> and had some good skills going the effects were better and the costume looked <UNK> better then this movie br br i borrowed this one with an open mind i am also a fan of ken <UNK> former <UNK> and was hoping it was a decent movie br br boy was i wrong the movie sucked the monster was pathetic in both appearance and in actually being scary the storyline was so predictable it was like watching the movie in preview mode as i already would guess what will happen the music was so bad with a horrible lip sync song that made me wanna punch the screen br br overall avoid this crappy movie br br save some money
<START> empire strikes back director <UNK> never say never again a remake of the 1965 james bond movie <UNK> doesn't surpasses the <UNK> young original but this non harry albert r <UNK> film is well worth watching if you call yourself a <UNK> <UNK> nevertheless despite its <UNK> of clever <UNK> and the lack of a vibrant musical score never say never again rates as an above average suspenseful <UNK> thriller with top flight performances by a seasoned cast including sean connery kim basinger <UNK> maria <UNK> max von <UNK> barbara <UNK> edward fox <UNK> <UNK> alec and <UNK> <UNK> the film <UNK> with surprises <UNK> from the <UNK> title credits sequence throughout its generally exciting but lengthy <UNK> minutes unlike the franchise james bond <UNK> with their breath taking moments of spectacle never say never again provides few of these scenes because of its <UNK> budget indeed the film features only three <UNK> an explosive ball point pen a <UNK> with a laser and a <UNK> up motorcycle aside from the <UNK> hall opening theme song ice station <UNK> composer michel <UNK> music score leaves much to be desired <UNK> <UNK> none of those snappy jazz <UNK> that made john <UNK> music for the regular bond franchise so memorable all in all never say never again seems to fit more into the first two bond <UNK> dr no and from russia with love <UNK> on her <UNK> secret service in terms of its more down to earth approach to the subject matter br br never say never again presents sean <UNK> james bond as an older <UNK> who has seen his day and has been taken off active service to teach ironically roger moore was a year older than connery and moore's bond movies treated <UNK> as an active young guy sean connery seems to be responsible for making <UNK> a more mature secret agent and a number of changes take place in the <UNK> <UNK> screenplay that emphasize <UNK> age initially connery had to play bond without a but mercifully <UNK> minds <UNK> and connery sports a he looks <UNK> and fit and appears in better condition than he did twelve years earlier when he was rushed into <UNK> are forever at the last moment to replace john <UNK> connery had been working on another movie and had gained weight for the role that he was unable to remove in time for <UNK> are forever at <UNK> connery still has a youthful <UNK> here despite the contrived demands of the script br br the action unfolds with <UNK> single <UNK> trying to rescue a kidnapped woman on a remote desert island he <UNK> several guards armed with machine guns and <UNK> the woman only to have her stab him with a knife in the side when he isn't looking it seems that this entire sequence was an exercise designed by m edward fox of day of the to test <UNK> ability the new m doesn't share his <UNK> use of field agents m decides that bond needs to clean out his system of all <UNK> and has <UNK> packed off to while at the country clinic bond notices suspicious activity between a nurse and a patient and gets noticed watching them the nurse is none other than <UNK> assassin <UNK> barbara <UNK> of the island of dr <UNK> and she is in charge of making sure that nobody sees <UNK> officer jack <UNK>

and then <UNK> an explosive to his <UNK> car and blows him up indeed the first part of never say never again apart from the <UNK> planning <UNK> belong to as she stay at the clinic and then repeatedly tries to kill bond one at sea with sharks and later in a motel <UNK> with an <UNK> device br br eventually bond meets the beautiful blond domino kim basinger of mother <UNK> and <UNK> into <UNK> charity <UNK> at a <UNK> <UNK> casino where the two face off in an elaborate video game called to see who will rule the world bond <UNK> him and <UNK> hates him <UNK> now because <UNK> is his only rival to domino and a thorn in his side that not even seems to be able to remove bond and have it out after a motorcycle chase when he returns the favor and blows her up their earlier encounter in the <UNK> when she attached a device to lure a shark after him is pretty lame like in the original <UNK> the villains recover the <UNK> nuclear <UNK> at sea but just the <UNK> themselves br br bond flies to the <UNK> where he meets his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> small fawcett no lesser than <UNK> <UNK> of mr bean fame who is worried that bond may kill somebody and ruin the island paradise of course <UNK> small fawcett serves as the film's source of comic relief the c i a sends felix <UNK> <UNK> of guns of the magnificent seven to back up bond this is the first time that an african american portrayed bond encounters his share of problems involving saving domino from arab <UNK> while and he save the world never say never again is a richly respectable james bond thriller with many neat touches but it never <UNK> the air of danger that the franchise bond films have indeed never say never again looks like a <UNK> masterpiece theatre take on <UNK>
<START> some good set design good songs though like the other guy said they aren't performed with much energy <UNK> arthur trying her to do something with the material had an occasional good one liner as friend vera and helped move the song <UNK> buddies along other than that there's nothing here that's worth your time slow pacing incredibly bad not very good singing except from robert preston an awful script bad acting except from <UNK> and a horrible lead actress who thought lucille ball would be good as the classy life loving <UNK> the heads over at warner bros were no doubt on crack when they decided to not use angela lansbury who had done it so well on broadway and instead use ball who wasn't nearly as funny by then as she was 20 years earlier couldn't act the part the right way at all and used a painful as an excuse for singing even if perhaps because making the movie was painful for her to make and even if she <UNK> it she just isn't <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is such a better film and the soundtrack of the broadway musical with lansbury sounds great for the most part there's nothing here that's great engaging or interesting at all forget it unless you're a huge lucy fan who thinks she could do no wrong hopefully after seeing this you'll realize she was only human
<START> incredibly hilarious mid 70's italian with lots of non <UNK> s m lesbian sex gratuitous racial cruelty etc few redeeming cinematic qualities except for the fairly cool theme music with african drums and <UNK> brilliant <UNK> dialog br br white slave owner to white plantation manager you're so dumb i'll bet you forgot to <UNK> that n r <UNK> br br white plantation manager not only did i <UNK> her i did it so well she died before i could get any answers from her br br all the black actors have 70's <UNK> and say yes in a high pitched voice the female lead has sex with everybody on the plantation 10 stars for fans of tasteless sleaze
<START> this movie is breath taking and mind blowing but i think maybe it can only be appreciated by die hard <UNK> it is like a game one problem is the plot is too game like and just has too many twists the twists are excessive jude law gives a very good performance i really like him in this movie just as <UNK> in <UNK> and joe in a i
<START> as a <UNK> <UNK> with some knowledge of the <UNK> history i was pleased with disney's sensitivity to the issues of class in golf in the early <UNK> century the movie depicted well the psychological battles that harry fought within himself from his childhood trauma of being <UNK> to his own inability to break that glass ceiling that <UNK> him from being accepted as an equal in english golf society likewise the young goes through his own class struggles being a mere <UNK> in the eyes of the upper <UNK> americans who <UNK> at his attempts to rise above his standing br br what i loved best however is how this theme of class is <UNK> in the characters of parents his father is a working class <UNK> who sees the value of hard work but is <UNK> by the upper class his mother however <UNK> her son's talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing against those who think he is inferior br br finally the golf scenes are well photographed although the course used in the movie was not the actual site of the historical <UNK> the little liberties taken by disney do not detract from the beauty of the film there's one little disney moment at the pool table otherwise the viewer does not really think disney the ending as in miracle is not some disney creation but one that only human history could have written
<START> this is a charming movie to say the least the main character is an old man who refuses to be among the living dead by which he is surrounded he and his <UNK> go around pulling pranks and getting into trouble all over town meanwhile his family is up in arms about what to do with him from there you see relationships with his wife best friend and son develop it finally leads up to one of the best movie endings i have ever seen br br the characters in this movie are rich and deep they develop well through the course of the film the movie has quite a range of <UNK> it goes from light and funny to grim and dark any slow parts for you in this film will be made up for in the end br br <UNK> spring carries a similar message like a lot of other european movies do don't lose sight of the small pleasures in life if you enjoyed <UNK> the <UNK> day or life is beautiful all great films btw you will probably like this movie br br 8 5 10
<START> i don't normally give movies a 1 although i am a heartless critic i try to find anything that makes the movie worthwhile that is to say watchable the main thing i look for is a coherent plot if it has that alone i can watch it let me start by saying this doesn't even deserve to be called a movie this is more like an <UNK> school project gone horribly wrong and i've seen every sci fi movie special that was ever made br br many times i've read professional critic reviews that say crap like this played like a made for tv etc etc and i kept saying oh come on i wish they'd think of a real criticism well this is worse much worse this is truly the worst thing i've seen that's lasted the length of a movie if i did consider it a movie it would be my new worst movie of all time and i've seen every movie uwe boll made this movie makes uwe boll look like francis ford coppola i'd rather watch jaws the revenge all day then see this one more time even 5 minutes of it there was one good scene and it was the end p ok enough bashing the works of ron hall now for the serious criticism br br the script is poorly written the dialog is delivered in a wooden manner the effects are <UNK> than those in a power rangers show and don't even get me started on the screen zoom in transitions ugh someone actually watched this thing edited it and then said ok release it i would have rather burned this than release it in closing all i can say is thank goodness dvd and vhs players have a stop and <UNK> feature my advice don't rent it if you do you'll be glad you have stop and <UNK> too
<START> i agree with most of the critics above more yet i was shocked by the presentation of the love scenes with the homosexual couple why because while they the director the producers didn't have any <UNK> whatsoever in presenting the different <UNK> couples in the most passionate <UNK> including nudity and super close ups of french kissing and all sorts of nude <UNK> in bed completely unnecessary in their length and in the story when the moment came to show the same experiences with the homosexual couple they only dare to go as far as an excruciatingly painful hug almost among <UNK> <UNK> with two very nervous actors so in reality the makers of this film found homosexuality to be unnatural as one of the characters says in some scene what a difference with the spanish cinema i remember being at the projection of an <UNK> film in an italian cinema in rome and being completely amazed at the total lack of reaction from the italian audience they were afraid to have a reaction when in spain people would fall down from their seats laughing at all the situations and fabulous <UNK> wit and flair obviously in italy there are dark forces in its history that the free <UNK> of some very normal and natural emotions pity i must add that i was quite surprised to find that this same comment was <UNK> by another <UNK> it's very bad and dangerous when we cannot be allowed by the of others to express our opinions about certain matters where is freedom of speech i don't know if that <UNK> will <UNK> of the changes i was forced to make in this comment and i hope he won't receive the same treatment from some other narrow minded judge pity again
<START> i have seen a lot of movies in fact i love b horror movies they are one of my favorite genres however this garbage i refuse to acknowledge that this was given the honor of film was the worst piece of crap i have ever had the torture of watching i actually signed up on imdb purely for the fact that i needed a way to at least voice how awful this garbage was i have watched films they at least deserve the honor done in <UNK> by high school students that were better written and directed i have nothing but pity for the poor actors in this garbage because they were just trying to earn a pay check they will now and forever have this <UNK> on their records like a virgin who was raped and given <UNK> if writer director john has any dignity left at all after obviously <UNK> countless people to get this made he should never allow himself near a camera again and try <UNK> his so called gifts to something more suited for him like <UNK> the floor of a <UNK> show
<START> without john rhys davies i have to admit that this would never even register on my movie <UNK> but in spite of that single fact this is not a bad little thriller considering the low budget the low quality effects the stiff acting and the sci fi channel aspects the blood effects are very convincing and the actually looks realistic regardless of what you think a looks like this is one good looking br br aside from the <UNK> this runs kind of like kolchak the night stalker darren <UNK> remember meets the love boat but in spite of the ultimate cheese of this work it still holds something resembling a plot and actually attempts to gain your respect while making you laugh and roll your eyes br br as conflicted as this work is i still managed to find some enjoyment <UNK> maybe you will too br br it rates a 5 2 10 on the made 4 tv scale br br it rates a 4 1 10 on the movie scale from br br the fiend
<START> one of the most boring pointless movies i have ever seen the title character is self centered self absorbed and wholly <UNK> the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is <UNK> hated it
<START> this is a good film this is very funny yet after this film there were no good ernest films
<START> only if its the last thing <UNK> do and your humour is <UNK> should you ever attempt to watch this if you do watch it alone invite no one they will never return to watch another movie with you it might be an excellent tool for that very purpose invite people you want to get rid of in your life br br apparently i need to write more about his film in order to qualify as a review this is sweet irony for this film it really does sum it up perfectly after wasting my time it wastes more of your time it does have a function i take it all back br br i recommend this film watch it its provocative really go ahead watch it
<START> the animation is great i'll <UNK> to that but disney <UNK> every stereotype we have been trying to overcome for the last two generations and the names i mean come on <UNK> cheesy <UNK> of those are real places where real people live and the real people these real places were named for are probably struggling out of the earth seeking vengeance over this trite little flick disney you're based out of california florida right amidst the rest of the states that still treat us like a foreign country if you can't stick to what you know at least hire and or work with people who know what area you're trying to maybe then it wouldn't be so insulting
<START> almost missed it while visiting friends in philadelphia sometime in the early 1980 s i was channel surfing after everyone else went to bed it <UNK> t just bogart he was obsessed with but rather the entire era of those old flicks those of my age know so well add to that a plot <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> where so many different characters were <UNK> with <UNK> and you have a piece of art as far as i m concerned about ten years later it appeared on tv and i taped it
<START> this film is truly a sorry excuse for film making the pacing is poor the budget must have been <UNK> low and the acting is cut rate that is except for bela lugosi the audio at this point in time is also terrible with so much extra noise in the background that it sounded to me as though a jet were taking off for the entirety of the movie if these things bother you at all don't watch this film br br if you can get past this however you will find that the idea behind the film is a very good one a german plastic surgeon bela lugosi was hired by the japanese to operate on several japanese agents and turn them into the of <UNK> american <UNK> whom the japanese have kidnapped and killed after <UNK> his work he was betrayed by the japanese and thrown into prison he later escapes and travels to america to seek revenge on his patients through a series of highly <UNK> murders br br it seemed as though bela lugosi was the only decent actor in the film and to be honest the rest of the actors were completely forgettable and <UNK> the leading actress ended up being rather boring and stereotypical while the police officer assigned to her case was the common <UNK> and always correct <UNK> male that is found in many films of this time period br br i also found that the camera work was completely uninspired often taking the exact same angles of the exact same rooms time and time again after a while this tends to drag the film down setting a very slow pace for the action which is more or less non existent anyway br br to me the idea is a fascinating one and with a better writer director script equipment and actors it could become an excellent film sadly these <UNK> keep the film back for now and i can't recommend it to anyone but the most open of movie lovers
<START> i strongly recommend it to anybody who likes good plots good actors even if not well known often it's just better that way science and or science fiction presented in an intelligent way on the small screen good special effects even if they did not have <UNK> of dollars to produce it br br much better than any war in the stars br br there was only one comment which was not necessary talking about the <UNK> the <UNK> says that life was maybe brought on earth through a <UNK> that's fun there must be always a chance for a magic way huh that's what's great about life can come anywhere no need of force
<START> i enjoyed the movie and the story immensely i have seen the original 1939 i believe and enjoyed them both to really appreciate the story one must be familiar with english culture and customs the <UNK> peter o'toole was dedicated to his school and the boys in that school it was an english public school which we in the u s refer to as a private school e g he is a very person and on the surface gives the appearance of being stiff <UNK> <UNK> and weak to the point of being <UNK> he is strict in his educational standards because he does care for his <UNK> i e he doesn't want them to get a cheap or weak education he meets through introduction a dance hall girl clark and is totally smitten in england at the time the reference to dance hall carried the <UNK> of extreme sexual <UNK> and was definitely lower class we find that the <UNK> is in fact a very tough and courageous person as well as loyal to people and <UNK> that he loves and or respects clark becomes more than a lover and wife she his personality and allows him to grow as a man and a person much to the benefit of his beloved school and his own happiness the first movie was set before <UNK> ii this one goes through <UNK> ii also it is 1969 we've had the british invasion <UNK> etc clark had hits and was very popular then still is to me the music is great color and photography excellent i think o'toole played the character perfectly there are dedicated people like <UNK> all around us but many do not receive the recognition very enjoyable movie and story
<START> in this film i prefer <UNK> frost he's so sexy i love his <UNK> eyes i like stephen <UNK> and the vampires so i went to see it i hope to see a gothic film with him blade it was very about the future if vampires had been real i would be turned by frost
<START> i didn't personally know karen carpenter nor richard for that matter so i must go by how the movie portrayed her i think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother richard however from what i did see and learn of karen i felt her pain share her sadness and she was a very special person to me growing up i know that i wasn't born until 1965 so i didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but i definitely grew up listening to her music and i have fond memories of her music i remember the song about the radio every <UNK> la la la every <UNK> so fine etc and i remember we've only just begun as a matter of fact i <UNK> many many of her songs and some people quite a few tell me that my voice sounds almost identical to her i am not joking on this i also used to be <UNK> during high school and part of college 1978 1987 to be exact and <UNK> anywhere from <UNK> pounds to eventually <UNK> pounds in 1987 i developed some pretty serious health problems from that which helped me to identify with the actress portraying karen in the movie the mother <UNK> was very much like my mother in many ways and i could also feel the pain that karen must have experienced for my mother was often <UNK> critical and <UNK> as <UNK> was if this was true to accuracy the movie was helpful in <UNK> and getting to know karen on a more personal note by not just hearing her music but by seeing what she was going through it is quite difficult to portray a person's entire life in 2 3 hours and <UNK> every single detail perfectly so i would have to say that there is probably no biography that is that accurate i will give this story an 8 though i wish i did know karen personally i would have died to meet her i would have loved to have <UNK> her hand given her a hug or talked to her i feel her warmth and love every time i hear one of her songs and she is greatly missed
<START> this movie starts out as if it were a comedy it almost appears that the actors are reading off of cue cards especially in the airport sequence william smith plays the role of a hunter who is quite twisted and deranged smith seems to always play villains such as in the ultimate warrior 1975 and the <UNK> kid 1979 to name a few although in this film the villainous role seems laughable this is one of those films where senseless things take place only to fill up screen time such as the girl chasing sequence at the beginning and the long silly motorcycle race i give this film 1 10 i would have liked to see this film on mystery science theatre it would have been hilarious
<START> this movie is a desperate attempt to ride the of the success of the star wars movies the film uses recycled footage from battle beyond the <UNK> which is another roger corman sci fi turd but <UNK> this one is better than battle beyond the stars there is no real acting in this film but its a roger corman film what did you expect again the entire soundtrack was done on a keyboard the sound effects are recycled from battlestar galactica there are no special effects because they were recycled <UNK> space scenes from another movie the costumes look like something right out of 1981 salvation army salvage the little boy in this film gives one <UNK> performance and he'd <UNK> again to star in the <UNK> stallone movie over the top i give this movie 3 stars out of 10
<START> i'm a <UNK> year old fairly jaded gay white man since i don't watch tv i watch at least 250 films a year most on dvd i keep notes on all the films i see and rate them since december 2003 i have seen only five films as great as <UNK> so i've rated <UNK> better than at least 700 other recent films mr bell is far too modest in his film commentary <UNK> is a great film and it also resulted in two <UNK> for me br br i watched the film the first time and i was <UNK> throughout and <UNK> during the last half hour something that's only happened to me three times before five minutes into the film i knew it was going to be very good when jason began <UNK> <UNK> i lost it and then the kiss well that is one of film's great kisses and that scene among <UNK> most poignant and unforgettable when <UNK> blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled i <UNK> i <UNK> i love happy endings i <UNK> br br then i watched the trailer and the previews and thought okay is this <UNK> 000 or so indie really that great so i immediately watched <UNK> again something that's only happened three times before and <UNK> blew my <UNK> off yet again even more so then i watched the making of <UNK> documentary and was completely <UNK> by the cast and mr bell br br so i thought i'd watch <UNK> again with the director's commentary i have never before watched a film three times in one night after the third time at 3 00 am i knew i had just experienced a great film <UNK> now ranks 10 on my top twenty films of all time and in the very small universe of great gay or gay subtext film there is <UNK> mountain <UNK> <UNK> drive and maurice br br thank you mr bell <UNK> is brilliant and fully realized with a magnificent cast a wonderfully moving understated score excellent cinematography an entertaining touching totally appropriate and <UNK> song i can go on but i won't <UNK> too much more br br this film should have received oscar nominations certainly one for best picture the performances without exception were all wonderful ms lovely <UNK> voice was a surprising <UNK> and sir ian <UNK> said awesome br br <UNK> is the reason i <UNK> through over 200 mediocre to utterly horrendous films some in the 150 million plus range a year to find that one treasure that one exquisite magical unique and enchanting perfect egg <UNK> an unforgettable heart br br finally i promise my second first i've never before posted a commentary on any film i've seen br br thank you again mr richard bell breathtaking genius give this man 100 million for his next film he made 700 000 us into one of the top 50 films of all time if i had the cash i'd grant him 75 000 a year living <UNK> and match any <UNK> raised for his next film mr bell is already a great director at <UNK> years old can you imagine him at 45 years old br br wise and witty tender and brutal <UNK> poignant understated yet edgy chilling and thrilling mesmerizing haunting unforgettable <UNK> the masterpiece
<START> who are the people that star in this thing never heard of them but this is one of the funniest comedies i have run across it should win the <UNK> prize for parody the absurd starts with dr <UNK> his <UNK> and turning into a sex fiend he is pursued by <UNK> driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie pay attention to the hospital <UNK> system in the background rather like the system in mash the final scene with hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years oh and the <UNK> nurse is <UNK> peterson who went on to become elvira mistress of the dark br br if you liked the mel brooks classic movies blazing <UNK> etc i suspect you'd like this one br br damn shame you can't get it on dvd anywhere br br it's available on dvd now good thing dvds don't wear out from use
<START> paul naschy as a ghostly security guard in this is scarier than most of his fur and shoe polish werewolf <UNK> the story is not unfamiliar a bunch of kids going to party at an abandoned school the thing is that one of these kid's fathers did the same thing years ago but he's now deceased and the latest group of kids seem to be <UNK> an event from 23 years ago this is fairly well done for films of this type and there's an air of mystery to what's going on because apparently what happened to the kids before is somewhat of a mystery and perhaps the truth wasn't revealed so no not just your standard slice and <UNK> this moves along at a fairly good clip and doesn't let you lose interest like a lot of films do and the oddball story is compelling enough to keep you interested too and there's some suspense which is lacking in a lot of films these days the ending is rather abrupt and i suppose is left mostly to your imagination but then again it doesn't out stay its welcome either 7 out of 10 check it out
<START> as someone has already mentioned on this board it's very difficult to make a fake documentary it requires tremendous skill pacing patience directorial ' a plausible premise a narrative ' and really believable acting aka great acting br br such is not the case with <UNK> <UNK> it starts to show its faux hand about the 20 minute mark with 60 minutes left to watch and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in it's downhill from there br br director gordon simply <UNK> too soon but to be fair to his problems started early as he explains in the extras he began wanting to do a real doc couldn't get funding and settled for a cheaper way of making his film br br the premise people who have secret lives by <UNK> themselves on a porn website was perhaps more interesting in 1997 98 when the film was made does a lot of <UNK> stuff a <UNK> ' hand held cameras <UNK> grainy blacks and whites all i guess to <UNK> a sense of authenticity but it just doesn't work the film is confusing and forced but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue
<START> it kept me on the edge of my seat true the story has a few plot holes but the sheer tension of it the way the director just keeps challenging the premise is simply fascinating br br <UNK> and <UNK> are two of <UNK> best actors see la <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and here they appear as a happy upper middle class couple beneath it all the truth is that all of life is a lie he's not an <UNK> never went to college or does not work in <UNK> central bank <UNK> as everybody else believes we get a few insights as to how he kept up appearances or manage to do it and while not very plausible it is still somehow believable br br the inner <UNK> of the <UNK> are shown <UNK> but it is credible because is a source of self <UNK> and <UNK> he not only believes in the <UNK> he also believes in the film premise and therefore he carries it br br sure it <UNK> belief that a wife would not know the inner <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> for almost 10 years but again since he's supposedly a brilliant <UNK> br br it has been said in a <UNK> tone that the movie is not <UNK> spanish as if that were a <UNK> test for good film true no or odd in this one just a taut thriller you'll want to know how this story ends once you start watching
<START> this movie appears to have been overlooked by everyone someone should bring it out on vhs and dvd it is an excellent film and far superior to the one with brooke <UNK> which was terrible br br jean simmons deserves more credit than she is getting now days it would be nice if all her films were offered on vhs or dvd jean simmons was and still is a very good actress she certainly was a beauty in fact she is still a beauty she also has done extremely well on t v she is so much better than many of the actors today
<START> after a long wait <UNK> and <UNK> made it to <UNK> cinemas not a commercial one mind you and i thought it was fun honest and took a <UNK> at those <UNK> groups running around trying to find meaning in rocks and <UNK> behind my <UNK> it is playing to full houses over here because it tells a story has terrific acting and says something about the human condition
<START> i rented this movie for two reasons the first was all of the good things that i read about it i <UNK> was impressed and couldn't agree more with all of the reviews i read the second reason is because i know these guys i don't know mark as well as i do mike he hasn't changed much from the years we knew each other i know him as the <UNK> from a local <UNK> radio station the way he is in this film is genuinely mike 100 he once gave me a table that he made it was a little one about 15 high that said <UNK> on it the odd thing about it was it only had two legs sometimes it's the thought that counts and mike always has thought about others first
<START> rita hayworth as rusty parker is the cover girl du <UNK> she's one of the dancing girls in danny <UNK> club the most special one according to danny gene kelly and pretty much anyone who comes across her take for example vanity magazine <UNK> john otto <UNK> enchanted by resemblance to her grandmother also played by hayworth in flashbacks whom he <UNK> <UNK> when he fell in love with her he tries to <UNK> his youth by <UNK> what he thinks went wrong between himself and he doesn't believe that danny could give rusty happiness or everything she should be entitled to he even gets danny believing this himself when rusty shoots to fame as <UNK> danny drives her away into the ready and waiting arms of <UNK> <UNK> lee <UNK> so what happens when danny returns to town with his sidekick genius phil <UNK> in <UNK> only to discover that rusty is marrying <UNK> br br as a musical cover girl benefits from the beautiful score and songs written by <UNK> <UNK> and ira gershwin including the oscar nominated <UNK> ago and far <UNK> possibly one of the most gorgeous <UNK> ever written and beautifully <UNK> sung as a <UNK> by hayworth and kelly number <UNK> the more <UNK> <UNK> isn't a <UNK> gershwin collaboration and <UNK> me to the the dancing of course is top notch since gene kelly had more than just a hand in the choreography it shows in the <UNK> of dances for example his dance with hayworth to <UNK> me to the or the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> way for <UNK> number performed by the trio of danny rusty and genius which <UNK> the reaction <UNK> character has to the police cop in the title number in <UNK> in the rain kelly especially scored a technological and artistic coup with the <UNK> dance like its <UNK> in anchors aweigh and an american in paris jerry the mouse and the 16 minute ballet respectively this dance is an example of the incredible <UNK> and creativity kelly brought to the modern film musical wanting to use the film medium to present dances that couldn't be <UNK> on a stage and years before cgi kelly insisted on dancing with the one person who could possibly match him in talent and style himself the number is hardly five minutes long but it and kelly's genius still takes one's breath away even sixty years down the line this is the reason i watched cover girl and if nothing else this dance is truly worth it br br you can tell that a great deal of money was <UNK> onto cover girl and rita hayworth not that she doesn't deserve it witness the scene when rusty hits broadway the large screen <UNK> all the different cover girls gives way to a <UNK> large stage <UNK> for entrance hayworth is indeed one of the most effortlessly beautiful girls on show in the film and she dances with a style and grace that is almost worthy of kelly very few of kelly's co stars have that honour she is hilarious in some scenes for example her drunk scene when john and <UNK> come to get her from <UNK> br br for some reason however her performance still lacks the spark of greatness which would help cover girl overcome its general curse of mediocrity that curse is only lifted whenever gene kelly is on the screen dancing or no or when eve <UNK> as john's long suffering secretary by with another cutting comment or clever observation since the film in the end belongs to hayworth neither kelly nor <UNK> can save it as a whole this isn't to say that the film is bad it isn't it's enjoyable with great songs and cute numbers and lots of pretty girls to look at but it's just not quite a classic the dancing is classic though so watch cover girl for that and you won't regret it
<START> this film moved me at age <UNK> in the same way that all the footage and coverage of <UNK> affected me when i was 13 for all of those who criticized the self promotion of the z boys interviewed they have the last laugh on you that was their whole deal we're better than all of you and here's why insert footage of the <UNK> pool <UNK> imaginable this was a film to tell their story and that was their story whether you like it or not it was their opinion of their <UNK> that <UNK> not yours or mine i thought the film captured their attitude and influence exactly as i remembered it in the 70's the reality is that they did <UNK> <UNK> they were the <UNK> behind extreme sports and they did <UNK> a cultural <UNK> that reached into every corner of <UNK> this movie gave <UNK> to images of on a wave and and jay adams ripping up the <UNK> that was the california dream to an entire culture of young american teenagers that just wanted to have fun and get <UNK> as i watched this film i realized that it was these images that i lived with every day until i was old enough to move out and back down to so cal after my family had moved to nor cal when i was five until i could get back my buddies and i built and <UNK> <UNK> after <UNK> searched for every empty pool possible and <UNK> everything covered about these guys we are all educated and have family's and careers now but this film reminds me who i was at that age and why i still surf this is an inspired film that anyone who has an interest in pop culture extreme sports the 70's or even just good documentary film making will enjoy completely whenever it comes on cable i can't change the channel kudos to <UNK> <UNK> for making a beautiful piece of art
<START> enjoyable film that gives you romance women on the verge <UNK> work place sexual <UNK> adultery and fashion it's all there typical characters found in corporate america joan crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because she's with the big boys hope lange is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body their personal lives is the subplot br br wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell stephen <UNK> <UNK> that a little <UNK> will do ya the amount of in stephen <UNK> hair is distracting at times his character's relationship with <UNK> character was never fully developed which i found disappointing overall the movie is enjoyable br br rating 8 10
<START> i am almost tempted to demand my money back from the video store this movie <UNK> the depths of <UNK> and is almost completely unwatchable i never <UNK> out of a film early but this was painful to view a <UNK> waste of celluloid my vote 1 10 it would have been zero
<START> okay when i bought this flick i though this gotta be the ultimate b movie space monkey landing to the earth and starts right away to kill people br br well it was almost everything what i expected typical low budget scifi movie from the 60's acting has to be the worst i've ever seen especially the girl playing the lead role and the girl that played the waitress made me laughing my ass off br br so why <UNK> doesn't fall in to category <UNK> bad that it's <UNK> reason why is that some of the scenes were just too long and boring for example the scene were the police officers are searching clues in the woods it was just minutes of walking without purpose and then the grand finale the people's waiting for the monster about 5 minutes and when the space monkey appears it get in 20 second end of film br br yeah <UNK> is boring but it got couple of funny moments i can recommend this movie to all who liked films like the thing from <UNK> or of the swamp br br i give <UNK> 4 space monkey <UNK> out of 10 br br rob gruesome
<START> i absolutely like this film a lot it is not very entertaining but it's a feast of bizarre and stunning images there's no dialog only some background sounds and noises if you are into something completely different and original and enjoy the obscure and bizarre then you might like this work of art looks like a film made with the very first camera ever made in a time where strange human like beings live and perform their bizarre <UNK> god has killed himself with a razor and gave birth to mother earth mother earth <UNK> herself with god's <UNK> after an act of <UNK> and gives birth to a son flesh on bone what follows are <UNK> acts of <UNK> torture rape and murder for purposes we do not know or do we
<START> this movie just <UNK> i know that some people will say that anybody who thinks it is no good just doesn't get it i like <UNK> in american friend and wings of desire but this is utter dreck the main character is so annoying that i couldn't care less what he does he is as has been said in another review <UNK> around like a little annoying monkey i just couldn't stand him or force myself to care this is the case with most of the characters who just seem to be trying to hard to be or weird i liked the mel gibson character and the <UNK> <UNK> characters and wish they would have focused more on them <UNK> is of course beautiful pitiful and you really feel for her and what she has been thru and why she is the way she is i see <UNK> character as almost <UNK> like i just wish he would have save <UNK> and <UNK> the hotel down with all the worthless boring characters that lived in it <UNK> rating 10 movie rating 0
<START> i saw this movie late at night on a free to air channel and i must say i was pleasantly surprised being a horror movie fan i often watch these sort of midnight movies during the school holidays more often than not the horror movies shown during this time are usually big certainly does not fit into that category br br <UNK> tales is basically an anthology of short stories based loosely on well known urban legends they are <UNK> together with a setting involving teenagers telling these stories around a <UNK> this <UNK> setting has a mysterious plot in itself however this particular story is weak and confusing obviously used <UNK> to set up the other spooky tales br br there are three tales in this movie four if you count 'the at the beginning all of which are truly spooky and well made i especially enjoyed the third tale 'the involving a guy whose <UNK> breaks down in front of a mysterious household this particular story works well in really freaking you out with sudden flashbacks of the <UNK> history in addition to this the ending of the tale will completely shock you the first tale 'the was also very creepy though the second tale <UNK> can <UNK> <UNK> was somewhat lacking br br being a horror movie veteran i don't usually get freaked out this film certainly did that job well what i particularly liked about this movie is the fact that it's split up into three shorts this means the movie won't <UNK> through an hour or so of character development and setting establishment before the real bloodshed begins that makes perfect for <UNK> parties etc br br <UNK> tales is a creepy crisp horror movie that will make your heart stop more than once it's certainly better than the crap you'll often find in the cinemas these days blair witch 2 urban legends final cut <UNK> find a copy and watch it if you dare br br
<START> screenwriters peter <UNK> joan harrison and of all people dorothy parker <UNK> director alfred hitchcock to <UNK> on what may have been his favorite movie theme innocent man wrongly <UNK> for crime takes it on the <UNK> hitchcock who some credit with <UNK> the story <UNK> a great deal of suspense in plot about a warehouse worker blamed for the explosion which killed his best friend he sets out on journey to find the real <UNK> plenty of excitement on a grand scale with usually <UNK> actors <UNK> lane norman lloyd alan <UNK> doing surprisingly fine work even <UNK> smug robert <UNK> gets into the proper spirit from
<START> this movie came very close to being a good flick the direction needs to be a bit <UNK> to progress from one piece to the next to make it more plausible in particular the main character's need to escape is not explicit enough is he trying to kill himself is he trying to escape his life does not seem to be that bad so it makes it more difficult to swallow that he wants to leave his life so much also it is not very clear how much in love he has fallen with jennifer jason l if the movie was <UNK> with some more attention to these details it would have been great on the other hand for an <UNK> flick it's pretty good maybe if you have a couple of drinks to dull the logical thinking it would be more fun br br
<START> steven seagal played in many action movies most of them were bad but not bad as the <UNK> this one is a z series action low budget movie after operation <UNK> force act of war the substitute 2 <UNK> run the base drive <UNK> etc comes the <UNK> now steven seagal is sure to be considered as a bad actor like mark <UNK> jean claude van damme treat williams jack <UNK> gary busey chuck norris michael madsen and many others the scenario was full of holes and the characters were not realistic maybe because of the very bad actors and the 4 25 bucks you spend by renting the <UNK> are called lost money i give it a half for laughs out of 5
<START> i couldn't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because i found this movie a total drag childish humor cheap looking sets cheap looking effects a plot that makes <UNK> blonde look like the usual suspects and so many <UNK> that i can now officially say that robert rodriguez had brain surgery somewhere after 1996 the only thing he left as his trade mark are some cool camera moves but there's where it ends ok so the guy decided to do something new for a change a children's spy movie well if i were 12 i'd feel insulted the best thing in this movie is the absolutely amazing carla that just stole every scene she was in sadly there weren't many 4 10
<START> i had the pleasure of watching this two <UNK> down from one of the executive producer at the atlantic film festival which was interesting because he laughed at very different times than the rest of us br br filmed in atlantic canada the movie is about three teen aged girls who in one of their last <UNK> of their youth <UNK> a large deal of energy to sleeping with a married 30 year old man despite much br br it's definitely worth a watch but the humour was <UNK> a completely different <UNK> than the one i inhabit male 18 25 so i was shaking my head at the character's antics rather than laughing <UNK> of this the story is strong enough to hold up for itself make it entertaining without so much laughing
<START> eugene o'neill is acclaimed by some as america's leading playwright but for things like the <UNK> long day's journey into night the emperor jones strange <UNK> was a piece of <UNK> he <UNK> where the characters on stage look aside to the audience and say what they really are thinking and then resume conversation it was a nine hour production with a dinner break on broadway so you can safely assume a lot has been sacrificed here br br for the screen the voice over regarding the thoughts is used for all the characters it probably is a technique better suited to the screen sir laurence olivier did very well with it in his version of hamlet but bill shakespeare gave olivier a lot better story than o'neill gave his players in this instance br br players like clark gable norma <UNK> ralph morgan may <UNK> etc are a lot more animated in most of their films than they are in strange <UNK> the story takes place over a 20 year period norma <UNK> is a young woman whose intended is killed in world war i she starts playing around quite a bit although that part is not shown in this version she makes the <UNK> of alexander <UNK> and his friend clark gable she also has as a <UNK> <UNK> ralph morgan a friend of her father's henry b <UNK> br br she marries <UNK> but then is warned by his mother may <UNK> and shown that insanity <UNK> in that family to quote another literary work since <UNK> wants kids and <UNK> and <UNK> think <UNK> train will slip the track if he doesn't get one gable is <UNK> for <UNK> purposes of course you can see all the complications this can cause and o'neill explores them all br br gable is so terribly miscast in an o'neill production but he was an up and coming player at mgm and did what they told him <UNK> does what she can to lift a very dreary story but she seems defeated at the start best in the film is possibly <UNK> who puts some real bite in her dialog br br strange <UNK> ran for <UNK> on broadway in <UNK> <UNK> and starred glenn <UNK> and <UNK> in the gable and <UNK> parts perhaps no one could really have saved the film because two years earlier <UNK> marx <UNK> the out of it in animal <UNK> after seeing what he did i don't think the movie going public took it too seriously br br and since it's not the best of o'neill neither could i
<START> first of all this movie is a piece of reality very well realized artistically some kind of combination between american beauty and as good as it gets and of course something specifically to all russian movies of course the valuable one no dirty propaganda the problem of loneliness of man especially recommended for the people which really want to see beyond all propaganda about communism both positive or negative propaganda a movie about common people their problems lack of <UNK> especially for young ones fear when touch the real and too dirty face of the society and about the fake <UNK> alcohol and violence and probably the only real solution true love of course it's very well located in the space and time of russian <UNK> but it's valid for all the society except a perfect one but don't worry not possible to find this on our earth for the last time definitely recommended

<START> this movie was terrible not only was the plot weak but the acting was unbelievable bad and at times pathetic very unrealistic dialogs people in real life don't talk like this and there is no emotion or feeling in anything said very <UNK> except for the almost <UNK> <UNK> that constantly occurs even the editing is bad the cuts are terrible the camera work was sloppy and shaky on close ups even <UNK> back and forth during conversations there is nothing positive about this movie and george needs to be working on heavy <UNK> or anything where he doesn't have to <UNK> with other humans because he clearly doesn't know how to how did this movie win get nominated for awards oh my god
<START> i love this movie when i saw this movie on tv when i was a kid it scared the hell out of me probably because <UNK> give me the creeps too <UNK> jones molly is an excellent actress she uses her facial expressions especially her eyes at playing terrified chuck <UNK> is great as mr i was happy to see him play such a different roll the other actors in this movie are great too <UNK> roberts <UNK> and robin <UNK> <UNK> are great actresses and i hope to see them in future films especially <UNK> jones br br so if you love scary movies but are tired of seeing the same old thing check this movie out
<START> in america the jewish jonathan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wood <UNK> personal <UNK> of his family for <UNK> a few moments before dying his grandmother gives an old photograph of his grandfather with a woman called <UNK> in <UNK> jonathan contacts the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a family agency in <UNK> to guide him to the location where the picture had been taken to find <UNK> and together with the <UNK> alex eugene his grandfather and a weird dog they travel in an old car searching the missing past of <UNK> family br br everything is <UNK> is a strange movie about a weird young man with the <UNK> behavior of collecting <UNK> from his family to not forget them that seeks the past of his grandfather to understand how could be his life if his grandfather had not moved to usa this bizarre <UNK> character meets a dysfunctional <UNK> family that owns an amateurish travel agency <UNK> in helping jews to find missing relatives and together they have an almost <UNK> road trip through the country of <UNK> the movie begins like a comedy with a sarcastic black humor and ends in a touching and tragic drama recommended for specific audiences my vote is seven br br title brazil uma <UNK> an <UNK> life
<START> i appreciate the effort that the filmmakers wanted to depict the story of <UNK> and the <UNK> of israel and that the film helps viewers to put themselves into <UNK> shoes and gain understanding of the intense burden laid upon <UNK> shoulders as excited as i was to see this film i was greatly disappointed in the storyline i'll leave out the special effects and artistic ability in this review what is most disappointing is the historical <UNK> of this movie and how it is so far from the historical accounts from biblical <UNK> one of the <UNK> principles from the bible is that god led his people out of egypt and he promised that he would take them to a land that is flowing with milk and honey not only did he give this promise but he led his people in a <UNK> of cloud by day and a <UNK> of fire by night he never left them he always was visible to the <UNK> the movie however depicts a god who remains silent during the entire wandering through the desert this movie changed the essence and theme of the biblical text and instead depicts god as a silent cruel void br br in addition the depiction of <UNK> was just as wrong <UNK> was known as a man of faith why else would he be such a father figure to israel throughout the old and new <UNK> even that <UNK> is known as a man of great faith however the movie depicts him as a <UNK> angry insecure loner who <UNK> the calling that god placed on his life ok i'll allow some creative freedom for the filmmakers in the <UNK> story but this is beyond creativity it is <UNK>
<START> takes place in the 1940s right after the second world war main character <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his job to get a chance to make a difference in the bombed out <UNK> europe he packs a book by his favourite <UNK> and <UNK> on a trip which will eventually prove famous statement true nothing is what it seems br br there are two main plots and several subplots to this film which takes place on a train bound for berlin writer director peter <UNK> also playing the role as the conductor of the train has assembled an impressive cast including swedish legends lena <UNK> and robert overall the acting is excellent br br offers some rather twisted slapstick comedy combined with more subtle black humor like the nun who loses her faith and starts <UNK> violently it's like meets peter jackson <UNK> bad taste in <UNK> list i laughed during most of the film and when i woke up the next morning i laughed even more an intelligent film for fans of swedish comedy
<START> having <UNK> in the <UNK> industry as a model i watch this show with a slightly different view than most might while i admit can be a fun and entertaining show as the seasons go on it seems to continue to drift from any reality br br the show seems to be almost pure publicity for its contestants seeing that none of the show's winners or fellow contestants have made much of a name for themselves out from under of the show's <UNK> maybe that's because the truth is any girl with real potential to be a high fashion model shouldn't have too much difficulty <UNK> to <UNK> you can do so via email or <UNK> mail if distance <UNK> you from attending an agency open call <UNK> to an agency and starting a <UNK> career yes the process does not guarantee success but apparently neither does and <UNK> in a reality show seems to offer less of a boost in the <UNK> business than <UNK> to a top or decent agency which only one contestant each cycle has a guarantee of anyway br br nonetheless the show can't hurt certainly can be amusing and has a sort of magic that particularly works for teenage girls i have found though i must add may become a tad <UNK> and dull after watching several <UNK> as it has become for me and besides some unrealistic situations each more outrageous than the last the only other annoyance is the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> seems to genuinely want to guide these girls to success but is it necessary for each of temporary <UNK> to be covered in <UNK> pictures for virtually every <UNK> and challenge to include a story or scenario that <UNK> experienced and <UNK> i think not br br in my opinion take out a little <UNK> put back in a little more reality and could be a 10 star show instead of a 7
<START> no blood no sex though it <UNK> passion no special effects but just one of those <UNK> that comes across your movie screen when you're not really looking and grabs your attention br br great acting great sets great music beautiful storyline if only there were a lot more movies made like this one br br the sets move us through time and make us feel like we were there br br the acting appears like real life and <UNK> us to the level of awareness of <UNK> to whom no one is a lost cause least of all the inhabitants of her own halfway house br br best of all it's a true story of <UNK> learning to fit in i was somewhat jealous of the good times that everyone appeared to be having in the movie could we all spend some time in <UNK> house
<START> if you want to see someone accidentally eat another man's <UNK> or look at a row of <UNK> fake hard <UNK> at a wedding or listen to a man talk about how good it felt to have sex with a girl while she was throwing up then this is the movie for you <UNK> in neck breaking fashion between romantic and gross out comedy is certainly interesting the lovely <UNK> <UNK> plays the wife of <UNK> tell me another one who is found in many <UNK> situations with other women but there is surprisingly no nudity jake busey is thoroughly revolting as a <UNK> dog who you wouldn't want as your friend shannon elizabeth and jerry <UNK> are both good and make a convincing couple but the movie is far too busy trying to disgust to be any good
<START> as i write this norman wisdom is a very confused old man who spends most of his waking hours <UNK> and old catch phrases at his increasingly <UNK> nurse br br indeed by the time you read this he will probably have joined the <UNK> and the <UNK> will record a near 80 year career of hysterical <UNK> making from the lovable with the crooked <UNK> cap what most of these <UNK> won't recall is how norman wisdom had already committed a form of suicide back in the late 1960s with this <UNK> poor yet strangely compelling to his movie career br br the signs are ominous from the off  tony presents go the titles you scratch your head  where have i seen that name before well on the titles of a lot of the <UNK> <UNK> british films of the 1970s so just take your pick br br then it says  a <UNK> <UNK> production oh dear br br from what i could make out what follows is a combination of <UNK> from a holiday camp and last tango in paris <UNK> by the tourist board br br norman wisdom is very versatile at being norman wisdom or a variation of such here even in trash like this he's never off form and somehow keeps you watching through <UNK> fingers as he <UNK> and <UNK> all over a clearly insane sally <UNK> tony and <UNK> <UNK> were between them responsible for some true cinematic horrors but the bedroom scene in <UNK> atrocity <UNK> sally plays the role of a sex toy very well by the way br br i wonder if any of the crazy young cats who <UNK> this movie's party scenes maybe thought to themselves in a quiet moment norman sex hippies get me outta this mess i guess it was a <UNK> for them br br a do feel sorry for the pretty things though they probably thought yeah <UNK> do for us what blow up did for the br br and so old <UNK> leading man career ended <UNK> his little balls off in br br i went there once it was a depressing place
<START> there is a bunch of movies that we say must be seen twice in most cases this is mainly a recommendation you understand the movie anyway after the first viewing and watching it for the second time helps you catch the plot twists you just did not notice however for <UNK> dr this is different the sequence that worked for me was see it first time spend a day in internet trying to figure out what this was all about and then see it second time otherwise most likely you will not be able to enjoy this film to the full extent then you start to understand that this piece is ingenious camera work is stunning and the <UNK> follows you for weeks br br 9 10
<START> its a very good comedy movie liked it i don't know why i love this movie i just love it storyline it is a story of two boys <UNK> <UNK> khan and <UNK> salman khan who want to get rich quickly by taking all the short cuts in the book <UNK> is the son of an honest <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> while <UNK> is the son of <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> in both <UNK> and <UNK> sell their father's shop and house respectively and zero in on a hill station where a beautiful wealthy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has come from london accompanied by her friend <UNK> secretary <UNK> <UNK> kapoor with the intention of getting married to a <UNK> indian the lucky man to <UNK> <UNK> will <UNK> her father ram <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> entire wealth <UNK> and <UNK> see their get rich quick chance and woo <UNK> each trying to out do the other enter <UNK> <UNK> in a double role whose sole ambition in life has been to grab his twin brother ram <UNK> millions so plants and robert in house to help him in fulfill his ambition as the story progresses it turns out to be a mad chase from ram <UNK> wealth full of humor romance thrills and chills will <UNK> <UNK> see through <UNK> and mischievous intentions will succeed in his motives see it all in super comedy br br <UNK> salman <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> at there best br br good music br br good direction br br good story and screenplay br br and very good comedy
<START> i for one absolutely loved this movie br br it is not a typical asian horror where you would see a gruesome looking ghost usually a woman that is going around <UNK> people you barely see any ghosts for a majority of the film but the way this movie keeps you interested in the plot and characters is genius this is not the movie for you if you're into gore e g saw hostel or surprise scares where stuff pops out at you hollywood horror slasher films but this movie has an underlying creepy factor throughout the entire movie which i loved is a <UNK> and somewhat experimental approach to horror amongst the ridiculous remakes and unoriginal crap being released by hollywood in today's society br br please don't let the documentary style of filming turn you off why should it it is far superior to the blair witch project because for one the acting in is brilliant and it really makes you really feel like you're watching something you're not supposed to be seeing br br is definitely one of the best horror movies i have ever seen only a few films have made it into my top 5 horror and this movie holds a solid 1 spot on my list
<START> while it has been many decades since i last read mr wells war of the worlds or the time machine or any other of his works i believe that they were all set in london or at least in england this grade b c movie is set in the eastern part of the united states as was orson welles excellent radio adaptation <UNK> years ago however this film <UNK> none of the quality of the narrative style of the <UNK> <UNK> program thomas <UNK> would not be acceptable in most high school drama <UNK> i was actually embarrassed for him his rolling around in the grass on the hill crying my family my family was almost laughable as was his reaction to the death of his brother of the three film versions of the story that i have seen this was by far the worst with gene <UNK> 1950's version the best this was the first time i ever saw a machine monster dripping <UNK> <UNK> such as did the creature in the alien
