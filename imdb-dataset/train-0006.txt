<START> spoilers spoilers are all teen slasher flicks suffering from a <UNK> of originality it awfully seems so first of all this is a noble premise that could've been <UNK> well a rejected young nerd who grows up stalks and murders all the girls who tortured the hell out of him when he was in junior high can't say you had nothing to work with but this film goes through the same motions as all the other recent slashers everything from the score to the camera angles allow us to predict exactly when a false alarm is coming and exactly when the killer will strike we know the pattern by now these stupid slasher movies push the credibility <UNK> more and more by the minute let me ask you something who in their right mind is going to surprise a friend of theirs in a dark dreary <UNK> in the middle of the night and just surprise her out of the blue while she's all alone and surrounded by corpses does that make any damn sense at all br br valentine is only occasionally innovative one good shot involves the <UNK> of denise <UNK> character she gets trapped inside a pool and the killer <UNK> at her with a chainsaw there's some good songs in the soundtrack including one cool track by orgy the music video is contained in the special features section on the dvd br br even the acting is mediocre at best the actors all sleep through their roles of course david <UNK> is often stoic even in his portrayal as the title character on angel denise richards is a fine actress though and she keeps a <UNK> throughout the movie br br valentine is just like you'd expect pretentious implausible forgettable cheesy and without a good scare in sight don't even bother br br my score 4 out of 10
<START> boring stuff we got here his 5 minute shorts are better than this know why because there only 5 minutes and not <UNK> minutes or how ever long this is br br the plot is kinda eh the last half hour is alright the rest is boring and not funny i had my hopes up the trailer made it look funny but the pace of this movie is pretty slow and sadly not funny just plain boring <UNK> running into each other and trying to make us laugh not working br br maybe next time knox br br maybe re cutting this movie and adding better scenes would do a lot of healing but for now its just not good
<START> there is no reason to see this movie a good plot idea is handled very badly in the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense the reason for the killings are not made clear the acting is awful nick <UNK> obviously needs a better director he was excellent in in the bedroom but here he is terrible <UNK> benson from buffy has to change her character someday even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed even though the movie was 80 minutes which is too short for a good movie but too long for this one there are no deleted scenes in the dvd which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the characters br br don't spend the time on this one
<START> this movie tries hard but completely lacks the fun of the 1960s tv series that i am sure people do remember with <UNK> although i am 17 i watched some of the series on youtube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun sadly this movie does little justice to the series br br the special effects are rather <UNK> and this wasn't helped by the flat camera work the script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour other films with under par scripting are home alone 4 cat in the hat thomas and the magic <UNK> and <UNK> family reunion br br now i will say i liked the idea of the story but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early and i am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy and i was annoyed by the talking suit despite spirited voice work from wayne knight br br but the thing that <UNK> me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of christopher lloyd jeff daniels and <UNK> hannah all very talented actors jeff daniels has pulled off some good performances before but he didn't seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing and elizabeth <UNK> character sadly came across as useless <UNK> hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored and i liked the idea of her being the love interest but sadly you see very little of her not to mention the monster attack is likely to scare children than <UNK> them likewise with wallace shawn as some kind of government <UNK> christopher lloyd <UNK> himself better and as an actor i like lloyd a lot he was in two of my favourite films clue and who framed roger rabbit and i am fond of back to the future but he was given little to work with and had a tendency to <UNK> quite wildly br br overall as much i wanted to like this movie i was left <UNK> instead of being fun it came across as pointless and that is a shame because it had a lot of potential with some talented actors and a good idea but wasted with poor execution 1 10 <UNK> cox
<START> i must admit that at the beginning i was sort of <UNK> about watching this movie i thought it was this stupid little romantic film about a french woman who meets in the train an american and decides to visit vienna with him i was not actually enchanted about this kind of script since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie still i watched it and i was amazed before sunrise is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth we are sentenced to death or that it is a <UNK> idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity or that we humans can afford sometimes to live in fairy tales br br the ending was wonderfully chosen we do not know if they will meet again in six months at six <UNK> in <UNK> station in our optimism we sincerely hope so the actors acted in a very good manner so that i began to believe that i myself could live a love story just like this
<START> <UNK> hamilton is probably better known as the new name in legendary full moon entertainment sadly his arrival to this independent studio happened in a time when budget and production values are at its lowest in years however in his short career hamilton has established himself as a creative director that manages to make inventive and original stories now this doesn't mean that his movies are good but at least they are different to the usual in the horror genre br br in his debut bleed hamilton presents us a creative twist on the slasher sub genre <UNK> debbie <UNK> is a young woman that finally gets the job of her dreams not only that but it seems that she has also found a boyfriend in shaun danny <UNK> it seems that life finally smiles for <UNK> after many sad events until on a party with <UNK> friends they tell her that they created a club where members have to kill somebody to enter br br obviously they are joking but <UNK> wants desperately to fit in that she actually murders someone after that event someone starts to kill the rest of the members of the club one by one it is up to <UNK> to figure out what is going on as anybody could be the killer including her br br <UNK> is a very interesting character wonderfully played by the beautiful debbie <UNK> it is a very interesting twist on the genre to have the lead actress as part of the suspects the concept is so original and <UNK> performance is so good that it is a real shame that hamilton didn't develop the whole story a little bit better the movie feels quite slow at times and overall the feeling is the one of a good idea wasted on a bad movie br br the rest of the cast is weird in the sense that all the female cast is very good while the male cast is painfully bad danny <UNK> is terribly wooden and his performance as a <UNK> is quite stereotypical julie strain <UNK> stevens lloyd kaufman appear in small cameos and are wonderful in their small roles also there is lots of nudity both male female and the cast is very good looking so it is really a plus br br the low budget hurts the film in the effects department as there are very few gory scenes and are not really graphic probably because they would look bad nevertheless considering the budget the film at least looks good br br <UNK> more recent effort the <UNK> venture <UNK> <UNK> die is a better crafted and overall funnier film while this one is not as bad as other better known films it still has a lot of flaws and may be interesting only for fans of debbie <UNK> or fans of independent no budget films 4 10
<START> it's 1982 two years after the iranian <UNK> siege which involved the dramatic <UNK> rescue from the <UNK> and with a war with <UNK> over the <UNK> islands currently taking place what better film to make than a <UNK> ho <UNK> film that re creates the iranian hostage siege whilst using <UNK> number one action hero of the day lewis collins throw in edward <UNK> and a few other well known actors and you've got a winner on your hands well maybe not the film itself doesn't make the situation serious enough whilst the acting is quite second rate it's like a movie long episode of the professionals but without the formula this film goes nowhere fast and is quite predictable maybe <UNK> <UNK> watched this film and decided to <UNK> lewis collins as a <UNK> james bond replacement for roger moore watch it if your a fan of lewis collins or <UNK> stuff in general if not save your time
<START> if the very thought of arthur <UNK> twists your guts don't worry you can still watch and love the ghost train like the equally marvellous back room boy it is a film that is simply too damn good to be sunk by a single performance even that of the lead actor personally i love <UNK> perhaps it's because i go into his world rather than <UNK> expecting him to come into mine which is a mistake too many people make the ghost train is so intensely atmospheric that you couldn't <UNK> watch it without being amazed at the deep dark world it <UNK> you to it is <UNK> in a way that few cheap and cheerful flag <UNK> managed to be during the desperate early <UNK> and it's a film that i would imagine few people have ever watched just the once the cast are without exception extraordinarily good perhaps <UNK> <UNK> lays it on a bit thick but against the backdrop of a lonely <UNK> station in wartime she could hardly play a <UNK> and not stand out the sad passing of the lovely carole <UNK> earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible film and now it really is in the past but waiting <UNK> for us to press play
<START> i just finished watching this movie it wasn't ridiculously bad but i'm really disappointed with it i'm not really sure why someone would make a movie like this it was <UNK> entertaining but i feel like the people making it had a lot of <UNK> on what they were making monday the writer was in charge <UNK> the director <UNK> the guy who gets the coffee etc it almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movies but only had the time and money to make one br br someone else commented that the acting was really good but i'd have to disagree then again if the actors were able to keep a straight face during the filming perhaps they're better actors than i give them credit for br br the back of the dvd gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery something along the lines of a historical law and order or national treasure it starts off like that but then out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the twilight zone or what was that other show that wasn't as good a bad episode of the outer limits br br my main complaint about the movie is that it is just so played out there's the evil guy with <UNK> white hair there's the love interest who when she first appears the wind actually blows through her hair seriously once you realize it's a christian movie the end is also pretty easy to spot br br the cinematography was poorly done especially in the opening scenes way to put your best foot forward it wasn't atrocious for most of the movie but there was the occasional ridiculously bad shot of an old lady praying arms up in a dark room while <UNK> is striking the sort of thing that just makes you a little bit embarrassed to be watching the movie
<START> i just finished reading a book about dillinger this movie was horribly inaccurate it's like they got a list of names and just made everything up his <UNK> and <UNK> were well planned down to the second when the time was up they left whether they had all of the money or not they had notes of every road where to turn etc <UNK> never saw him at the restaurant he was told that dillinger paid for his meal after dillinger left <UNK> never even saw dillinger before the night dillinger was killed only photos of him the way his gang members died were <UNK> dillinger never robbed a bank by himself like he did in this movie if i had never read the book maybe i could have enjoyed the movie the acting was a bit over the top in places the action was overdone as well on second thought i doubt if i would have enjoyed it much even if i hadn't read the book
<START> less self conscious and much less pretentious than guts of a beauty this <UNK> <UNK> gore flick is worth a look at least once br br sleazy <UNK> <UNK> wanna be actresses models to a remote house in the woods in order to sexually <UNK> them unfortunately for the horny boys a long <UNK> demon who lives in the woods has already targeted the girls for fun br br the thing even ends up having fun with the boys that's if you consider <UNK> <UNK> and masturbation with severed limbs fun br br once again it all sounds better on paper than it looks and sounds on film br br just as <UNK> <UNK> living dead at tokyo bay with his <UNK> he also <UNK> this effort and is only saved by some <UNK> violence and some great white <UNK> shots br br don't buy the hype though or you'll be sorely disappointed
<START> more wide eyed hysterical 50s hyper <UNK> that gives new meaning to anti social <UNK> behaviour <UNK> and grayson will leave you begging for mercy br br it's a shame that all the people involved in the making of this movie are now dead or in <UNK> homes i kinda thought about <UNK> them for torture as this movie started <UNK> its shamelessly aggressive operatic assault onto my poor <UNK> ear drums i felt instant strong pain <UNK> my entire being that damn muscular <UNK> can <UNK> soviet tanks into tiny bits <UNK> glass br br why didn't you switch the channel if you didn't like it you might ask <UNK> fair point fair point the answer is that i wanted to but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that i fell to the floor <UNK> in agony with my last <UNK> of energy i tried to reach the remote but couldn't br br a silly little <UNK> with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by niven who then proceeds to <UNK> him lanza is in love with <UNK> grayson but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up this may seem like a rather thin plot but this <UNK> movie is so chock full of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all this movie is relentless forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with <UNK> reign in blood as in a south park episode whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that <UNK> this strange 50s musical world it's all <UNK> as if they were all 6 year olds <UNK> grown ups i can only envy people who find movies like this funny it must be great being easy to please what a world of wonder would open up to me if only i could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious gut <UNK> comedy br br but let's examine this phenomenon the 50s musical my best guess is that 50s musicals offered the more day dreaming <UNK> among us a glimpse into <UNK> or heaven depending on whether you're church going or <UNK> tomb going or at least very cheesy version of these fantasy inspired places <UNK> is more akin to a representation of hell but that's just me i don't seem to get musicals people talk there is a story but then all of a sudden everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened when you think about it musicals are stranger than any science fiction film br br worse yet <UNK> my favourite type of pizza btw is not just a 50s musical but one with opera <UNK> opera is proof that there is such a thing as over training a voice to the point where it becomes an ear <UNK> weapon rather than a means of bringing the <UNK> pleasure the <UNK> example of this travesty is when lanza and grayson <UNK> their dark side vocal powers for a truly unbearable <UNK> i tried <UNK> the volume i <UNK> it from 18 to 14 then from 14 to 10 then 8 i ended up <UNK> it to a 1 which is usually so low that it's only heard by specially trained dogs and certain types of <UNK> and yet i still could hear those two <UNK> like <UNK> br br take the scene in the small boat in the river <UNK> starts off with one of his <UNK> brain killing tunes and then nothing no animals anywhere to be seen even the <UNK> who are mostly deaf have all but left if you look carefully you might even see the trees change colour from green to yellow in a matter of minutes no this was not a continuity error it was plain old torture of the <UNK> and those trees were just <UNK> paintings imagine how real trees would have <UNK> br br the reason glass breaks when a high c is <UNK> out of the overweight belly of an operatic <UNK> is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and <UNK> but because glass is only human hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous self explosion i can listen to the <UNK> least friendly death metal band for hours but give me just a minute of a soprano and i get a splitting headache
<START> first than anything i'm not going to praise <UNK> short film even i'm mexican and proud of his success in mainstream hollywood br br in another hand i see most of the reviews focuses on their favorite and not so short films but we are forgetting that there is a subtle bottom line that circles the whole <UNK> and maybe it will not be so pleasant for american people even if that was not the main purpose of the producers br br what i'm talking about is that most of the short films does not show the suffering that <UNK> people went through because the terrorist attack on september <UNK> but the suffering of the other people br br do you need <UNK> about what i'm saying look in the <UNK> short film the message is you cry because of the people who died in the towers but we the others east europeans are crying long ago for the crimes committed against our women and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you br br even though the <UNK> <UNK> story is more in comedy there is a the same thought you are angry because <UNK> bin laden <UNK> you in an evil way but we the others <UNK> should be more angry because our people is dying of <UNK> poverty and aids long time ago and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you br br look now at the sean penn short the fall of the twin towers makes happy to a lonely and <UNK> man so the message is that the power and the greed <UNK> by the towers must fall for letting the people see the sun rise and the flowers <UNK> it is remarkable that this terrible bottom line has been <UNK> by an american there is so much irony in this short film that it is close to be <UNK> br br well the ken <UNK> very know because his anti capitalism ideology is much more clearly and shameless in going straight to the point you are angry because your country has been attacked by evil forces but we the others latin americans suffered at a similar date something worst and nobody remembers our grief as the whole world has done to you br br it is like if the creative of this project wanted to say to americans you see now america you are not the only that have become victim of the world violence you are not alone in your pain and by the way we the others the non americans have been suffering a lot more than you from long time ago so we are in <UNK> with you in your pain and by the way we are sorry because you have had some taste of your own medicine only the mexican and the french short films showed some compassion and sympathy for american people the others are like a slap on the face for the american state that is not equal to american people
<START> how come i've never seen or even heard about this junk movie before it's right up my alley with bloody <UNK> laughable plotting and an irresistible 80's cheese atmosphere hanging around it for some reason nobody is really interested in the staff and students of an elite catholic university are butchered by an unknown psychopath <UNK> <UNK> teacher julie parker becomes involved when all the people she has contact with either turn up dead or behave strangely this movie is hilariously bad there's absolutely no logic or <UNK> and every character is equally meaningless to the others for example there's a girl killed and her body dumped in a <UNK> then and for no reason the story suddenly moves forward three weeks yet the murdered girl is never mentioned or even missed not even by her boyfriend the acting is pitiful and there isn't even a bit of nudity to enjoy the revelation of the killer is quite funny because the makers really seemed convinced that it was an original twist it's not guys splatter university is easily one of the worst horror <UNK> ever
<START> inappropriate the pg rating that this movie gets is yet another huge <UNK> by the mpaa whale rider gets a pg 13 but this movie gets a pg please parents don't be fooled taking an <UNK> school child to this movie is a huge mistake there were numerous times i found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary br br but all that aside the cat in the hat is still a terrible movie the casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving <UNK> the beautiful kelly preston and the always likeable or <UNK> in this case alec baldwin are both good in their roles even though preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this the kids are <UNK> actors and it shows especially with <UNK> fanning fanning is the only human aspect of the film that kept me watching and not throwing things at the screen br br did i mention there was an <UNK> talking cat in this movie mike myers is absolutely <UNK> i didn't like him as the voice of shrek and i truly believe now that myers should not be allowed near the realm of children's films ever again his portrayal of the cat is a slightly toned down version of fat bastard and austin powers br br in the end the cat should not have come he should have stayed away but he came even if just for a day he ruined <UNK> minutes of my life <UNK> minutes of personal anger and <UNK> br br the cat in the hat may be the worst kids movie ever

<START> everyone in a while disney makes one of <UNK> movies that surprises everyone one that keeps you wondering until the very end in the tradition of pirates of the <UNK> this movie is sure to turn into a ghost and kill and rape your village it's terrible if you want a mindless senseless predictable action movie go right ahead i believe that young kids might enjoy this as they like it when good always wins but me i like movies where it's a toss up who's going to win this movie never lets the bad guys have the upper hand by the end when <UNK> heroes are left in an <UNK> pit you just know that they can get out everything works out perfect for cage and his friends he never has to think over a <UNK> or clue for more than 10 seconds no matter how complex it is see this movie if you want to see some impressive set designs not if you want to see good acting or a good film go watch a superman movie it would be much shorter and the kids would like it more for instance the scene where cage is fleeing from armed <UNK> and the bullets are all <UNK> by a the <UNK> of a fire escape and i'm not talking about a fence or anything just one little pole this movie shows the <UNK> of films and the film industry to cheap gags and dull unrealistic action which this movie provides in huge <UNK>
<START> this movie could be used in film classes in a how not to script a b movie course there are inherent <UNK> in a b movie budgets are tight time is precious scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days and the actors are often green and inexperienced the one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you <UNK> script seems to have been written in a drunken <UNK> i could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie but i'll just mention one the <UNK> the character of the <UNK> is introduced about an hour into the movie he seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie he is shown with his daughter who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie the <UNK> is given a couple scenes to act <UNK> in and then is killed to pad out the body count why give the <UNK> a daughter why give the daughter a boyfriend why introduce them so late in the movie why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline scarecrow doesn't seem to care br br the story of scarecrow goes something like this lester is a high school kid played by and actor who'd i'd <UNK> to be in his early 30's who is picked on by the other kids he is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a <UNK> named judy his mom is a lush and the town whore one of her <UNK> boyfriends makes fun of his drawings by calling him a <UNK> for drawing birds instead of monsters and <UNK> if you have a high school student still drawing <UNK> i'd think him to more likely be gay than a high school student who draws <UNK> and later kills lester in a <UNK> under the titular scarecrow magically <UNK> soul goes into the scarecrow somehow this <UNK> changes <UNK> soul from that of an artist into that of a <UNK> <UNK> i know some reviews have called the scarecrow a kung fu scarecrow i disagree the scarecrow practically does a whole floor routine before jumping onto the truck during the climax of the movie the scarecrow then goes on to kill those who tormented him those who smoke pot in the corn field those who dig graves boyfriends of daughters of <UNK> pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie set br br the bonus feature on the dvd should be mentioned the director a frenchman does an <UNK> version of rap music admits he enjoys not having executives around on set so he can screw his wife while working and gives a quote to live by and i'm <UNK> life <UNK> a bitch but et has a great ass br br number of beers i <UNK> while watching this movie 5 did it help no number of beers needed to enjoy this movie whatever it takes to get to <UNK> drunk level
<START> with various <UNK> and <UNK> scattered throughout cast and crew they all laughed is very much a family affair if you add the fact that b <UNK> and miss a hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an <UNK> consideration if this all <UNK> of smug in joke self <UNK> you will be pleased to hear that mr bogdanovich <UNK> well clear of that particular <UNK> and delivers a sweet and rather innocent i love n y <UNK> that is also an <UNK> at which we can worship the <UNK> beauty of the late miss hepburn make no mistake this is her picture mr <UNK> <UNK> it to her most self <UNK> in all their scenes together the plot a detective agency gets involved too personally in its <UNK> affairs is of minimal importance it is the performance of the two leads that <UNK> the movie mr <UNK> triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors from targets <UNK> there is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can <UNK> from an <UNK> piece of <UNK> equipment miss hepburn in particular benefits from this love extra insights into his work can be <UNK> from reading the published <UNK> of his <UNK> on stars and directors <UNK> who the <UNK> in it recently <UNK> in uk <UNK> the soundtrack to they all laughed <UNK> from louis <UNK> <UNK> new york town hall concert to sinatra to country to latin as <UNK> as the city it portrays mr b s golden boy image was sure to <UNK> for such is the nature of the movie business but it is equally sure one day to be restored and when that day comes they all laughed will be <UNK> for the fine work that it is
<START> this has to be by far the absolute worst movie i have seen in the last 20 years when i saw that michael madsen was in it i figured it couldn't be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films and he was a pretty fair actor wrong no one should waste their time on this film i fast <UNK> through 80 percent of it and i don't feel that i missed a thing
<START> considering 'a star is <UNK> had been made twice already by the time the 1976 film came into production the latest remake has a <UNK> about it that can be attributed to the fantastic chemistry between the entire acting ensemble a viewer could be forgiven for believing that kris kristofferson barbara streisand were a couple off screen as well as on with their incredible displays of pure affection towards one another br br the film has been described in the past as a <UNK> streisand concert on film set to a soap opera <UNK> however for anyone that enjoys watching a film that takes you beyond the living room into a world where the characters seem truly alive a star is born is well worth the hiring price br br with its incredible soundtrack flawless acting and touching reality in regards to human emotions and the true <UNK> of life a star is born is a film that draws you into the world of esther hoffman the love of her life john norman howard br br a film for anyone that sees the beauty in real love the kind that keeps you devoted to a person even as they break your heart
<START> <UNK> <UNK> was one of the best friday <UNK> drama shown in a long time i am asking the writer to please write a long series and air it on lifetime soon each person was very interesting and did a wonderful job with their lines to make the plot come true however the movie needs to continue for a long time i would love to see <UNK> and <UNK> child grow up and get a major role in the movie along with the new grandparents planning for her educational future also bring kathy back to see her niece and help foster her life it was great seeing the grandparents work out their problems but the family business needed to be restored to working status and let us see how jake and <UNK> survive through the marriage years
<START> i saw that movie and i was shocked robert <UNK> isn't hitler he is a man who sadly tries to be hitler the movie lies it doesn't reflect the truth in the scene were hitler hit the guy with his gun hitler never had hit anybody he wouldn't hit people with his fist but with the <UNK> of soldiers understand another thing is it is too obvious that hitler is that evil he was more clever than shown in this movie no german would have accepted him as the leader because the can see that he is evil so the real hitler haven't shown his evil side to the people br br have any of you <UNK> watched the movie der <UNK> or the <UNK> this is a great movie with amazing actors and its a german movie i think this theme of nazi germany should not be realized as a movie by people who don't know anything of germany people watch der <UNK> br br http www imdb com title <UNK> br br its a great movie about a very sad period of time for human beings around the world
<START> i hate plane crash movies all of them in fact i hate them all with a passion first of all they are cheap looking and have no <UNK> secondly they insult the <UNK> industry and say to the audience that all planes do is fall out of the sky and crash br br why i <UNK> at such a film this could happen to any of us and with <UNK> consequences than those suffered by the characters in said movie which is the only chilling aspect of an <UNK> disaster yarn such as this i hate this movie because it's like all the 50 000 000 stupid ass airplane chaos movies before it <UNK> is like all the others nothing more than boredom before the clichéd <UNK> dramatic scenes take place br br first off we have same cast of <UNK> on this flying death trap the <UNK> esquire family of three the <UNK> <UNK> and the bitch of a flight attendant complete with a big blond <UNK> from 1987 <UNK> anyone who is the least bit frightened br br my second <UNK> is this shouldn't be a full length movie but a documentary explaining everything about the air canada <UNK> <UNK> incident a k a <UNK> right down to the safety <UNK> br br my third and final <UNK> is with all <UNK> films of this caliber with the exception of <UNK> why the hell did the male <UNK> <UNK> the passengers to remove there shoes i could understand high heels and sharp loose objects but c'mon like that's <UNK> make them any more f king <UNK> than they are now this plane if they the passengers didn't know any better knew they were going to crash land why would you force 100 injured people down a rubber slide that can cause skin to <UNK> and bleed on impact only to walk in their <UNK> feet on a <UNK> field does this make any sense to anyone br br <UNK> and the hit abc series lost had more depth and realism to air disaster than just plane <UNK> people panic <UNK> become <UNK> plane lands without <UNK> in a field people wander without shoes and <UNK> etc the same old crap from airport 1975 <UNK> was so typical of a air crash movie that i almost expect to see either charlton heston or peter graves burst into the damn passenger cabin at any moment could we at least see how these poorly acted characters go back to <UNK> instead of people <UNK> amidst the impending tragedy that is staring in front of them typical moronic lifetime movie cheap and stupid br br the director of <UNK> should stick to cheap made for tv movies with white middle aged women with stupid teenage kids who do drugs and have marital problems as for suspense leave it to the professionals you hack why should we the audience sit through over an hour and a half of this airport wannabe rehash i hope to god they don't make plane crash movies like this anymore if this were like the abc series lost then it would be something to watch but this is utter crap and then some stop turning every plane disaster movie into airport 1975 this is not airport this is cheap pathetic waste of my time i would not recommend this movie or any made for tv air disaster movie to anyone not even my worst enemies
<START> the original title means the birth of the <UNK> i must confess that i do not quite understand this title the english title is water <UNK> but after having written this i read the comment by another user the title in french is also suggestive <UNK> or <UNK> suggest an individual having to <UNK> many <UNK> simultaneously thanks for your explanation br br the basic theme is the first sexual emotions of girls when it is not clear if they are directed toward the same or the other sex it is no different for boys i think that both floriane and marie will eventually have <UNK> feelings without any <UNK> br br much of the movie is water ballet sometimes the girls will have their heads <UNK> and nothing above the water except their feet and <UNK> legs with which they will wave and kick in the air to people like me who had never seen such things before it was fascinating floriane is the leader of one team of water <UNK> br br marie tells her that she would like to see when floriane is training this seems to be their first contact that is not just ordinary soon they will walk together floriane takes marie to a garage where a boy is waiting for her and then goes away with him for an hour while marie is waiting for her to return i took for granted that the couple slept with each other but we will later learn from the movie that they do less than that br br i can supply some information which few users will find elsewhere there is a scene in which marie secretly steals <UNK> garbage bag in it she finds an apple mostly eaten and marie proceeds to eat the rest  there is a parallel scene in another movie <UNK> no <UNK> afternoon <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> japan 1980 this is about adult young females and a clearly lesbian woman is <UNK> in love with a <UNK> woman she also steals a garbage bag of the beloved and also finds a more or less eaten apple and eats the rest br br later floriane tells marie that she would like to have her first <UNK> from her marie says she cannot do this br br but still later marie says that she is indeed willing to do it and she <UNK> on floriane there is no nudity in this scene br br probably only a female director could have made such a fine psychological show or study of  i would like to quote <UNK> les <UNK> <UNK> br br floriane is played by <UNK> <UNK> who made the excellent performance as the <UNK> girl in the little <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> 2002  a very underrated movie
<START> i will admit that i did not give this movie much of a chance i decided pretty early on that this just wasn't my kind of movie br br for the most part it has an excellent look in terms of its cinematography the scenes of early 70's manhattan look very good as does the lead actress it is a very crisp black and white which could almost make the movie feel <UNK> and fresh however some of the other techniques the filmmakers employ shoot that <UNK> all to hell the disjointed editing is very late 60's somewhere between <UNK> and new wave the story also feels like it came from a very specific time somewhere between free love <UNK> and artsy <UNK> br br the film follows a young girl around the city as she looks for a man who she had anonymous phone sex with as she meets other odd characters she reveals her quirks and they reveal theirs the movie seems to be meant as an off the wall <UNK> comedy but adds an avant garde feel i would expect that if you like andy <UNK> movies you would be very excited to discover the <UNK> book br br some problems i had near the end of the movie one character tells a rambling <UNK> that lasts over twelve <UNK> brutal to sit through also there is a very explicit animation sequence that i found gross and juvenile that serves as the film's climax i did laugh out loud four or five times and i liked the ending minus the flat out disgusting animation and when the film switched to color for the final phone booth at night sequence i actually liked the way it looked even better it ended up being one of those experiences where i felt like i could have really liked it if it been a little different but this is what the filmmakers gave us it is obscure artsy and way left of the <UNK> but none of those are reasons to recommend it on their own i didn't find it to be unique or creative so much as forced and pretentious
<START> the movie sucked it wasn't funny it wasn't exciting they tried to make it so bad that it would be good but failed and thinking it's cool to like this movie next to the hype are the only reasons that this movie is a success br br the fact that at this moment 50 voted a 10 out of 10 for this movie seems pretty concerning to me either the movie going public is going insane or this vote is unrealistic which can have numerous causes and should be dealt with anyway it is a less than average movie which <UNK> through mouth to mouth advertising it's success can only be described as a marketing marvel
<START> i rented this movie thinking it looked like a wonderfully delightful historical piece what i got was a piece of pure garbage this movie was confusing in most spots choppy in almost every spot and dreadful in all spots mira <UNK> portrayal of a queen playing a young male <UNK> was depressing at best ben kingsley should have been stripped of his <UNK> for even considering this film as one of his projects <UNK> shaw should definitely stick to playing <UNK> <UNK> at least the harry potter movies are more entertaining than this thing they call a play within a movie br br the cinematography looks like some college kid took a class in cinematography 101 and failed miserably almost every scene in the movie is chopped up for some sort of effect the end result of course being the <UNK> bit of editing i've ever seen jay <UNK> was almost good as <UNK> too bad he had such a bad script to work with <UNK> <UNK> gives her best effort as the almost <UNK> lady in waiting in the end i really wish blockbuster video gave <UNK> i'm so glad i didn't spend 10 bucks watching this fiasco in the theater if they've been performing this <UNK> play since the 18th century it makes me wonder how many people over the ages have had their best <UNK> during this work if i had been there they wouldn't have hear the play over the <UNK> thank goodness for the modern <UNK> of dvd players you can skip past the boring or awful scenes guess that means i only watched the beginning and the end
<START> i'm biased towards any movie that paints a <UNK> picture of italy in my opinion the most romantic country in the world unfortunately the movie was rather short unusually so for a period piece and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect however the excellent story makes up for it the four ladies <UNK> on a much needed relaxing vacation with problems on their minds over the course of the movie they realize their problems and begin <UNK> them they believe san <UNK> the castle they stay in has an enchanting effect on people it's a <UNK> of love says <UNK> <UNK> you can watch their <UNK> change from <UNK> to <UNK> as the italian <UNK> works its magic on them br br all their problems and their <UNK> are plausible the actresses were great the background music seemed very appropriate for an romantic italian locale all in all a 10 10 movie for me
<START> now i've seen a lot of bad movies i like bad movies especially bad action movies i've seen and enjoyed all of jean claude van <UNK> movies including the one where he's his own clone both of the ones where he plays twins and all three where he's a cyborg i actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of <UNK> hey if nothing else he's got a great ass and you almost always get to see it with dvd you can even pause and zoom in that's why you can trust me when i say that this movie is so bad it makes plan 9 look like citizen kane br br everything about snake eater is bad the plot is bad the script is bad the sets are bad the fights are bad the stunts are bad the fx are bad the acting is spectacularly earth time <UNK> bad very probably <UNK> the worst performance of every so called actor in the cast including <UNK> lamas and that's really saying something and i'd be willing to bet everyone involved with this movie is lousy in bed to boot especially <UNK> lamas br br it does manage to be unintentionally funny so it's not a total loss however i recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either a <UNK> idiot or very very stoned i was able to sit through it myself because i needed to watch something to distract me from <UNK> cat <UNK> out of my <UNK> br br it didn't help much but it was better than nothing one point for ron <UNK> cameo as a gay <UNK>
<START> it's interesting at first a naive park ranger colin <UNK> marries a pretty mysterious woman lisa zane he's only known for a short time they seem to be happy then she disappears without warning he <UNK> for her and after a few dead ends stumbles upon some of her abused childhood and sleazy recent past which may include criminal activity and then it seems the filmmakers didn't know what to do with the story the beginning while not as suspenseful as it sounds is at least watchable then it <UNK> to be interesting or even make much sense and the ending is so lame so dull and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence you'll think the screenwriters didn't know what to do with it and got bored trying what a sorry waste of a good idea
<START> ed wood is <UNK> and becomes orson welles this film is fantastic vampire witches who fight in terribly choreographed scenes and dialog that could have breaking <UNK> with laughter plan 9 from <UNK> <UNK> stand a chance against this described by the writer and psychic stephen <UNK> on the vampire forum as a masterpiece he's from england and thoroughly sarcastic br br it has stephanie <UNK> and the producers know whats going to save them from <UNK> by repeatedly using her though she leaves me cold as she looks more like the undead than all the devil <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is just a lower rate elvira the whole thing is badly done br br watch it for the script though
<START> i've no idea what <UNK> from san francisco came up with this stupid plot but apparently they need to get off whatever drugs they are taking and put their <UNK> on danger money now br br yeah this is a plausible story if you regard the alien <UNK> sequence in life of brian as plausible br br this film is little more than a <UNK> <UNK> had the us and <UNK> give up nuclear weapons the result would've been to eliminate the only real <UNK> that kept the two from engaging in a war bad as korea vietnam and other wars of the era were they were <UNK> wars fought to keep the <UNK> from a direct engagement br br this film makes me think about how realistic it was when some group of high school kids would go on a <UNK> strike against nuclear <UNK> as if someone would say mr president some kids at <UNK> high are not eating and ronald reagan would <UNK> my god i'd better <UNK> my defense policy right br br like this film wouldn't it be better if the soviet union would've <UNK> because they could not support their massive arms build wait that happened
<START> piece of subtle art maybe a masterpiece <UNK> a special story about the ambiguity of existence tale in <UNK> style about <UNK> of victory or surviving in a <UNK> strange world the life is in this film only exercise of adaptation lesson about limits and original sin about the <UNK> of innocence and error of his ways br br leopold <UNK> is another joseph k images of trial and same ambiguous woman and europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like <UNK> wars or <UNK> search of truth essence golden age br br <UNK> or <UNK> the movie is history of <UNK> evolution war peace business or lie are only details of <UNK> time <UNK> is a mask love a convention the sacrifice only method to hope understanding a painful reality
<START> a trio of treasure hunters is searching the west <UNK> for a hidden fortune the lure of gold makes for a rise in tension as the men come closer to the <UNK> location the deep sea <UNK> hope to track down the gold but find that greed and hatred leads to murder according to the dvd <UNK> synopsis <UNK> is the name of their boat not a monster the <UNK> who gives muscular captain john <UNK> as <UNK> his half of the treasure map is very good old salt victor <UNK> as professor provides the other half of the map first mate <UNK> <UNK> jr as <UNK> plays dumb and sexy <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> guards the <UNK> not very well obviously serious editing and continuity problems <UNK> the picture which otherwise might have <UNK> to something br br <UNK> 2 <UNK> w lee wilder john <UNK> victor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jr
<START> with part <UNK> and part direct shooting the directors made a <UNK> <UNK> documentary on a coup <UNK> against president chavez in <UNK> organized by a foreign secret service and fully supported by the wealthy <UNK> minority the political opposition the church a cynical laughing <UNK> and the us government it was another chapter in the history of us foreign policy which steven <UNK> calls <UNK> or <UNK> democracy american <UNK> in fact this foreign backed <UNK> was not only a coup <UNK> against president chavez but also against the <UNK> majority which elected him br br that this is a brilliant documentary is <UNK> confirmed by the violent reactions for and against it on internet as saint <UNK> said <UNK> love truth when it <UNK> them in its light they hate it when it proves them wrong ' br br this movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in
<START> i hate to be the one to rain on a parade even a small one like this but from the very first scene you could tell this film was going to be absolute <UNK> its a shame really as i quite like martin freeman and danny <UNK> i was intrigued as to how they would mix in a film together but to my <UNK> they did not even have a scene together i think i need to repeat this the two lead actors who stand side by side on the <UNK> posters and dvd covers did not have one scene together they did not speak to each other and never appeared on screen at the same time just about sums up this poor excuse for a movie false <UNK> br br the dialogue was painful every single character in the movie was unrealistic and un human like the scenarios were far fetched the plot was crap the jokes were thin freeman tried too hard to be funny and played a poor mans tim from the office nobody was likable and worst of all some of the characters were so annoying that it almost drove me to switch off as i couldn't bear to watch or listen to them any longer br br this low budget stinker was an epic fail even danny <UNK> couldn't <UNK> some humour and charm into this but bless he tried what a waste of time br br how anybody could rate this movie as <UNK> <UNK> is beyond me ten stars seriously come on i won't even give some of the <UNK> ten stars as ten stars implies that a movie was perfect this film was far from perfect almost the opposite meaning that it was almost completely dire throughout br br watch it if you like but if you've seen a lot of movies and watched a lot of great movies your review will probably similar to mine br br 1 10
<START> for a film that got little publicity and few people have heard about this was pretty good it's another one of these modern day british crime films that are quirky snatch sexy beast etc it's not wild like snatch but it's interesting and it has some rough characters br br it also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show not late has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first time viewer basically it's about a low key british male who sends away for a russian mail order bride who winds up with the aid of two russian male friends providing a couple of big surprises br br ben <UNK> and nicole kidman co star and are very good as are vincent <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> russian <UNK> this is a different kind of film and well acted kidman once again proves she's far more than just a beautiful face
<START> this <UNK> turgid melodrama represents douglas sirk at his most high strung it <UNK> the soft <UNK> of all that heaven allows and the <UNK> sentimentality of imitation of life and instead goes for <UNK> angst and <UNK> tension and of course it's all captured in vibrant technicolor br br the <UNK> story has something to do with a friendship between rock hudson and robert stack that becomes a rivalry when hudson <UNK> the affections of lauren bacall but who's really paying attention to the story dorothy malone won a best supporting actress academy award for her <UNK> over the top performance as <UNK> sister who takes the family business into her own hands when no one else will a highlight of the film comes when this high spirited wild child breaks into a frantic dance in her bedroom unable to bear the <UNK> placed upon her by middle class <UNK> as so frequently happens in sirk movies the scene is both unintentionally hilarious in its absurdity and yet strangely moving in its <UNK> br br sirk came closer than anyone else to turning pure camp into high art satisfying the <UNK> and the high <UNK> at the same time within the same films his was a unique talent and i don't know that there's ever been another film maker quite like him since br br grade a
<START> my grandmother bought me this film when i was 5 i've always love scary movies and even then i enjoyed it the atmosphere is awesome and the story original and entertaining i especially love the scenes where the <UNK> is under attack in the desert the rocks are actually convincing for such a low budget flick the acting is above average for these kinds of films and the music is eerie this is definitely an <UNK> rated gem i recommend it to anyone who likes these strange films from the late seventies early eighties such as alice sweet alice poor pretty eddie nightmare hospital massacre and return of the aliens the deadly <UNK> definitely a classic
<START> the <UNK> oscars was a very good one <UNK> work as <UNK> was very funny and light i personally loved her last <UNK> which garnered some <UNK> reviews due to coarse language and <UNK> jokes but that's fine the audience seemed to like it <UNK> <UNK> denzel washington ron howard woody allen and sidney <UNK> made this an oscar <UNK> to remember br br
<START> after seeing midnight offerings i am still convinced that the first decent movie about teenage witches yet has to be made i didn't think much of the craft and i'm not into <UNK> either the only film i more or less enjoyed about teenage witches was little witches 1996 and even that one wasn't very good but changes are that if you liked all the aforementioned movies you will also enjoy midnight offerings br br i was expecting a silly and cheesy early 80's movie about teenage witches in high school but i was rather surprised that this whole movie plays it rather serious the acting is decent and serious all the time no jokes are being played by teenagers or something and the musical score at first i thought was pretty good it added some <UNK> and also something <UNK> with the use of threatening <UNK> and all but as the movie progressed i came to the conclusion that the score was just too ambitious they didn't have to add those threatening <UNK> when you simply see someone back up a car and then drive away at normal speed br br then there's melissa sue anderson who was the main reason for me to see this movie a few weeks ago i saw her in happy birthday to me a rather enjoyable thick plotted and goofy on some occasions slasher movie which she had done in the same year as midnight offerings and i must say she was very good as the icy cold bad witch vivian but the main problem with the movie is almost nothing happens vivian causes a death and an accident yes but that's it then there's robin the good witch who is just learning about her powers and we expect the two of them using their powers more than once but at only one occasion they use their powers to make some pieces of wood and other stuff fly through the air as <UNK> that was supposed to be a fight between two powerful witches and what's worse i was hoping to see a spectacular show down between the witches at the end of the movie with at least some special effects <UNK> eyes or whatever but nothing happens there is sort of a confrontation in the end but it's a big disappointment br br so the acting of the two witches was good the musical score was decent even though overly ambitious and the cinematography was rather dark and moody at times but that doesn't make a good movie yet does it
<START> i've loved this movie ever since it first came out i was about nine years old and now i'm 27 i remember playing the video game on <UNK> <UNK> i had so much fun i would love to show my son this movie he likes michael jackson as well and i know he will love this movie just as i did when i was a kid even though he's much younger than i was when i first saw it i can't wait for it to come out on dvd i hope it comes out on dvd please let it come out on dvd i'm dying to see it again well that is my comment i hope that one day soon i'll get to view this movie again i love all of the videos in this movie my favorite mini video is <UNK>
<START> i won't claim to be a fan of ralph bakshi because i am not i have only watched 5 of his animated films so far <UNK> <UNK> fritz the cat and lord of the rings and finally fire and ice what i can claim is that i found fire and ice to be the most enjoyable of the lot it is a straightforward fantasy tale of swords and <UNK> along the lines of conan the barbarian but the beautiful artwork realistic animation and lively film score effectively lends a very classic charm to this movie br br deserving first mention is the animation itself i do not care what people say about <UNK> but in my opinion ralph bakshi used that technique very effectively here i was amazed at how realistic the movements of the characters were the style of directing and the photo realistic character designs made fire and ice feel more like a big budget fantasy blockbuster than a cartoon sadly the level of art detail tends to get a little inconsistent especially near the end of the movie some scenes just look really flat with little to no body <UNK> details or fabric <UNK> and shadows on the characters br br with realistic moving characters realistic action would naturally follow not only was the action well choreographed but it was really brutal i would be so bold as to compare the brutality of the action to live action movies like <UNK> <UNK> 300 i did notice however that though there was blood shed the blood <UNK> were kept to a minimum again a great choice by the creative team that only <UNK> the viewing experience by not taking things too over the top br br though i do not recognize any big names in the cast the voice actors manage to deliver a satisfying performance keeping the delivery of every line realistically subdued and only <UNK> it up in the case of the bad guys br br did i say bad guys yes i did because that is exactly what the story is about a standard good vs evil tale nothing really original about the story which seems to merely be a mix of pre existing fantasy film clichés that involve <UNK> clad warriors and <UNK> anyone looking for depth would be sorely disappointed the characters are not given much development and some of them like <UNK> and <UNK> are one dimensional at best i did however hear <UNK> of some deleted scenes that explains <UNK> obsession with killing <UNK> and his mother scenes like that deserved full <UNK> and should have been included in the final cut to add a level of depth to the show in fact i would not be surprised to find out that the whole movie was just a tech <UNK> of sorts to showcase the awesome animation and art with the story <UNK> together and thrown in as an <UNK> in order to pass it off as a proper movie br br a true classic of a <UNK> era fire and ice really captures the blazing spirit of adventure and <UNK> with its beautiful <UNK> of fantastic creatures and charming characters it is a unique vision of a world created by ralph bakshi and artist frank <UNK> with a good measure of action and suspense br br would it hold up to animated film standards of today definitely not but i urge animation fans in general to get off your high horse and give this simple but beautiful film a chance to grow on you it is truly a gem of the 80s worth checking out
<START> the movie has one nude scene a man sitting on the edge of the bed with his exposed <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the middle of the screen it is quite a long scene what was the point i almost think it was meant to be funny but we were watching it with my mother and it wasn't funny to have that staring at us for what seemed like a full minute br br the movie is cold none of the characters are even likeable audrey <UNK> is cute of course but her character is an unhappy girl br br i really would not recommend this movie i had expected it to be charming and fresh but it was depressing i wondered if the director was from a very upper <UNK> educated french family and he looks down on these characters br br
<START> stephen king was raised on flicks like this flicks not films br br movies like this and <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> to the good <UNK> day drive in horror flicks they are meant to be fun cheaply made and hopefully a few good scares br br anyone looking for a theory on the human condition should pass on this creature feature because that's all this is all it ever will be br br stop <UNK> what has already deemed itself as trash good fun trash br br if you enjoyed this i recommend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> days of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> iii season of the <UNK>
<START> i love jamie foxx br br and i enjoy 99 of all movies i see br br and i walked out of this one br br now i admit it may have had something to do with the two middle aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing oh no <UNK> knocking on a door <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but this was just so incredibly annoying there could be no <UNK> camera shot and no camera shot from a conventional angle everything had to be in your face loud and annoying br br the bad guy tried to be smooth and <UNK> like but at this point it's just old and tired he brought nothing new or interesting from all the characters too many lines you saw coming too many you've heard before and too many tough guy lines and i don't mind that sort of thing really as long as there's a bit of originality to it in fact pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked br br i love jamie foxx and i think he's really funny and i thought he was funny in this movie but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else br br this movie needed less shoot em up less annoying camera shots more emotion more feeling and more jamie foxx i gave it a 2
<START> this amusing bugs bunny cartoon sees the return of the still <UNK> marvin the martian and his sidekick k 9 the green dog br br this time instead of trying to destroy the earth marvin is on a mission to land capture an earth creature and take it back to mars of course the creature he picks is bugs bunny at first bugs thinks marvin and k 9 are trick or treating but realises this can't be right when marvin drastically <UNK> bug's rabbit hole with a ray gun bugs tries to trick his way out of the situation in a couple of ways including <UNK> marvin that k 9 is planning a <UNK> eventually he is captured using an <UNK> <UNK> jacket <UNK> <UNK> amazingly for an <UNK> product it works as advertised and bug's is forced to use his wits to get k 9 to release him the tables are soon turned and the two disgruntled martians are <UNK> up and bugs is trying to fly their <UNK> back to earth br br i really enjoyed this although the ending is a little weak compared to the rest of the story <UNK> voice has changed slightly here and he gets visible emotional when he is angry but this didn't make me like him or the cartoon any less
<START> not really spoilers in my opinion but i wanted to cover myself nevertheless as the executive producer morgan freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous <UNK> of his character in 10 items or less a movie with an intentional indie feel and just be absorbed in the mentor be all that you can be theme he plays a alternate universe semi washed up version of the real morgan freeman who is <UNK> in an old <UNK> by a kid all the way into carson <UNK> from <UNK> to research his next movie role why carson is a mystery to so cal residents he could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the san <UNK> valley and found the same elements paz vega is pretty to watch a cross between <UNK> <UNK> and penelope <UNK> playing a disgruntled <UNK> <UNK> at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for <UNK> <UNK> research his character is only known as him to <UNK> to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average people <UNK> that's <UNK> ' etc unfortunately i was too distracted that him had all kinds of <UNK> wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in <UNK> carried no cash or <UNK> card or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him if one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like him does then i gotta see cash and a <UNK> which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to <UNK> that big ego which him definitely has nothing really happens in this movie i don't believe that either of the main character's were <UNK> changed by their encounter with each other it <UNK> with the idea of adultery but then that thought <UNK> this to me was similar to steve <UNK> <UNK> without the sexual affair it was self indulgent for freeman and unconvincing to the audience
<START> the real story took place in kansas in 1959 of a murder perry and dick two ex <UNK> who broke into a remote house on a rainy night to steal and kill everyone they met richard brooks directed the chilling and disturbing <UNK> book about the reasons that drove these kids to the crime are they natural born killers the crime scenes are very brutal and haunting because of the lack of senses and reasons for what we witnessed stunning black white cinematography from <UNK> hall excellent country road music score from <UNK> jones amazing performances in two principal roles from robert blake and scott wilson and first time in a movie a sad comment about capital punishment at the last moments before their deaths jones hall and brooks as director and as writer for adapted screenplay are academy award <UNK> gripping superbly directed and frightening one of the best films of this decade
<START> like the characters in this show i too was a teen during the 70s the producers really nailed the whole <UNK> of being a suburban teenager in the 70s the 70s fashions cars home <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are all very authentic in this show br br the show boasts a very talented ensemble cast who all <UNK> together very well on camera i really like the unique psychedelic style film sequences no other show does camera tricks like this these cutting edge film sequences really help to convey the campy <UNK> that <UNK> the 70s era br br overall this is a very funny sitcom the one thing that bothers me about this show is it's over <UNK> on cruel humor to generate laughs in this way i think that this show tries to be too much like married with children while married with children is a great sitcom in its own right it's tacky that the creators of that 70s show keep trying to imitate it br br i do recommend that 70s show mainly due to it's nostalgia factor it could be an even better show though if the writers relied more on witty dialog rather than <UNK> tasteless jokes and pranks
<START> i love sabrina its one of my <UNK> shows my favourite episodes are the one where she turns <UNK> into a geek the first episode the true love episode and most of the rest from the first series i do think the college episodes were not as good as the high school ones but they were better than the last series which was awful valerie was a good character as she was more rounded than jenny but jenny was in some brilliant episodes <UNK> and <UNK> were amazing and there seemed to be no explanation for where they went <UNK> was a good character too i never liked morgan or <UNK> they just weren't as good as her other friends
<START> i happened to see this movie twice or more and found it well made wwii had <UNK> ended and the so called cold war was about to begin this movie could therefore be defined as one of the best propaganda patriotic movies preparing americans and secondly people from the still to be formed western <UNK> block of countries to face the next coming menace the movie <UNK> the might of the us through the centuries while <UNK> itself <UNK> to the then present war which had just ended nice and funny is the way of describing the discovering of the american continent by <UNK> and pretty the <UNK> of new <UNK> and the <UNK> of manhattan from a drunk local indian must see it at least once for curiosity of fashion of propaganda through time
<START> worth watching twice because of the rapid paced <UNK> shifts among several compelling stories bug emerges as a wholly satisfying work of art that plays ever optimistic love against <UNK> examples of frustrating reality br br my favorite characters are wallace john <UNK> lynch whose <UNK> concern for life from that of a <UNK> to the <UNK> passengers for whom he is partially responsible frames the film <UNK> christina kirk who spends considerable time creating surreal but tasty <UNK> for her impossible husband ernie chris bauer and mitchell a cable tv <UNK> with <UNK> trust in fortune cookie messages you will meet the girl of your dreams br br against such optimism are the forces of quirky reality all generated by actions of the characters parking tickets a <UNK> drain in a chinese food <UNK> shop tv <UNK> a crushed auto <UNK> an <UNK> dinner <UNK> that eventually results in <UNK> of a <UNK> vacation br br the film is funny <UNK> getting drunk at a <UNK> performance <UNK> michael hitchcock as a <UNK> service <UNK> attempting to deal with an <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> obsessive <UNK> brian cox facing a restaurant inspector dwight jamie kennedy <UNK> to his <UNK> <UNK> to have children by writing hostile chinese cookie <UNK> your girlfriend is lying to you and the guy who falls asleep while <UNK> a <UNK> because he spent the night looking for his <UNK> missing cat br br a minor story with public cable access host <UNK> <UNK> and a local acting teacher reading from the boy in the bubble expresses the major theme love comes from the heart br br bug entertains on much the same level as trains planes and <UNK> but on a lower budget and with a <UNK> eye
<START> when i first read the plot of this drama i assumed it was going to be like sex and the city however this drama is nothing like it the stories the characters seem more real and you <UNK> with the situations more the concept of the drama is similar four 30 something women guide us through there friendships and relationships with problems and <UNK> along the way katie the <UNK> is a dark and brooding character who you find difficult to relate too and is best friends with <UNK> a widow <UNK> character is heart warming as you can relate to difficulties she is having along with the fact she is the only mother of the four jessica is the party girl very single minded and knows what she wants and how to get it she is a likable character and is closest to <UNK> the newly <UNK> who whilst loving her husband completely can't help her eyes wandering to her work colleague over all the drama is surprisingly <UNK> and if the bbc continue to produce the series it could do well it is unlike other female cast dramas such as sex and the city or desperate <UNK> this if played right could be the next cold feet plus the male cast are not bad on the eyes too
<START> problem with these type of movies is that literally dozens of them are being made each year luckily for use only a handful are given a theatrical release while the others are being pushed straight to video or tv such as this movie br br the foremost problem of this movie is really its originality it's one of those movies which uses the die hard formula of a tough but troubled guy being at the wrong place at the wrong time in this case it's a character played by casper van <UNK> who works for a security agency that thoroughly test safety <UNK> for companies and individuals in this case he's being send to a cruise ship which of course gets <UNK> you can see this movie as a sort of mix of die hard and air force one and the movie doesn't even try to <UNK> that those two movies were probably its biggest source of <UNK> so really you can't regard this movie as an original one at all it uses all of the clichés out of the book and this movie really doesn't offer any surprises or anything that remotely resembles anything original br br like you can expect from a movie such as this it has a very weak script or rather said it features some very lazy writing like i said before the movie features nothing original but also the actual story itself features some elements which are far from likely and are just plain <UNK> <UNK> i mean <UNK> an huge cruise ship with only about 8 guys of which <UNK> only carry some small guns and then ask for a <UNK> of <UNK> 10 million dollars for a ship that is about worth 10 times that amount is itself already quite <UNK> how do they even intend to split that money afterward every person gets just over a million or something that's hardly <UNK> for such a big and <UNK> <UNK> and then there is the case of taking the passengers hostage somehow they manage to take all passengers on the huge ship hostage and they manage to put them inside one room with only one guy with his pistol which he can't even seem to be able to hold right watching them you never see more than like 30 <UNK> however as if they were all the people who were aboard at the time also when the van <UNK> character goes looking for his son and vice versa no matter which room they walk in through on the huge cruise ship they always <UNK> into each other instantly just some examples of the lazy writing within the movie br br but it of course is an action flick so the story of course becomes secondary but then again it's not as if this movie features any good action at all <UNK> of the actors look as if they had never hold a weapon before and the movie is filled with some <UNK> slow motion it really becomes laughable at points br br of course the movie also doesn't feature the best actors though i must say that casper van <UNK> really isn't a bad <UNK> <UNK> and actor as far as the genre and b movie circuit is concerned he just however also suffers from the same problem as tom cruise no matter how old he is he just never looks convincing enough to play the father of a teenager van <UNK> once started out as a promising new young actor but starring in movies like this really doesn't help his career much he's probably capable of something better though he is never really given the right opportunity to show it all of the other actors also do a fair enough job but their characters are just so formulaic that they never truly become interesting br br oh well it's not the worst genre movie i have ever seen but it also ain't exactly the most original or memorable one either br br 4 10
<START> the scottish artist andy goldsworthy fashions natural <UNK> into <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rocks into egg shaped <UNK> filling <UNK> rock <UNK> with fiery flowers and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> into intricate web <UNK> an original work and a few photographs of his other creations are <UNK> away in a corner of <UNK> art gallery near where i live but although i found these pieces intriguing i only realised the wonder of <UNK> work when i was lucky enough to catch a re screening of rivers and <UNK> br br thomas <UNK> film accompanied by a beautiful <UNK> soundtrack by fred <UNK> brings goldsworthy and his art to life by showing the artist at work the opening scene captures him <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> into a snake like thread set <UNK> a tree <UNK> working with his teeth and bare hands goldsworthy <UNK> a beautiful <UNK> work before long this delicate <UNK> <UNK> away to nothing in the brilliant <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this scene is among the most beautiful in the film but the <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> work is remarkable <UNK> shows both the <UNK> and the failures capturing the frustration of pieces that collapse before they are completed as well as the glory of those that shine even if for just a few hours minutes or seconds br br goldsworthy himself provides the narration speaking slowly but <UNK> about the themes in his work he makes plain his need to work with nature to be alone in it and to further his understanding of it through trying to work with natural <UNK> even when they seem to be working against him at times he is down to earth and humorous at other times he struggles for the words to express his purpose  something which is quite understandable when witnessing his astonishing work first hand the <UNK> and <UNK> of the title become increasingly <UNK> as we see the natural <UNK> pass through the <UNK> hands flowing from one form to the next the capture of the creation and <UNK> of <UNK> work is in itself a striking piece of art br br although goldsworthy works with widely varying <UNK> and covers territory across north america and europe the presentation of <UNK> one after the other in this film is <UNK> it gave me the same feeling of <UNK> that i get when i spend too long in an art gallery and struggle to take in anything new a brief <UNK> in which we are introduced to <UNK> family and hometown is all that breaks the long succession of his <UNK> nevertheless <UNK> does a superb job in <UNK> goldsworthy and his creations <UNK> them in their wider <UNK> from meandering canadian rivers to rainy scottish <UNK> <UNK> the film ends with goldsworthy casting <UNK> of earth and snow into the sky fleeting <UNK> emerge from the dust <UNK> even as they <UNK> into the air this is the <UNK> expression of the beauty to be found in the work of this remarkable artist
<START> and i am a nicole kidman fanatic i would pay to see and hear her read the <UNK> phone book which for all i know she may have been doing when she was speaking russian in this movie br br all four of the principals are excellent but the movie itself is a number of good images and better scenes held together by nothing br br while one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie this one asks too much of the viewer br br it could have been very funny which it is in parts or quite frightening which it is in one scene but the director didn't seem to know which way to go
<START> just finished this movie saw it on the video shelf and being a nick <UNK> fan i just had to rent it in all honesty it probably should have stayed on the shelf the concept was an interesting one and there were several fairly smart twists and turns but somehow i guessed almost all of them before they came along and the movie just went a little too far in the end in my opinion if you have to suffer through a viewing of it you'll see what i mean br br on a positive note nick <UNK> acting was great especially considering what he had to work with eddie <UNK> thomas was also good but he always plays the same type of character too much paul <UNK> from american pie coming through for my liking br br and finally the worst part of this movie has to be january jones' <UNK> performance i guess a pretty face really is all that matters in hollywood
<START> a masterpiece br br thus it is possibly not for everyone br br the camera work acting directing and everything else is unique original superb in every way and very different from the trash we are sadly used to getting br br summer phoenix creates a deep believable and intriguing esther <UNK> as everything else in this film her acting is unique it is completely her own neither british nor american nor anything else i have ever seen there is something mesmerizing about it br br the lengthy <UNK> natural shots are wonderful reminding us that we have become too <UNK> to a few <UNK> ways of shooting and editing
<START> of all the films i have seen this one the rage has got to be one of the worst yet the direction logic continuity changes in plot script and dialog made me cry out in pain how could anyone come up with something so crappy gary busey is know for his b movies but this is a sure w movie w waste br br take for example about two dozen fbi local law officers surround a trailer house with a <UNK> <UNK> inside the <UNK> is ma and is confused as to why all the cops are about within seconds a huge gun battle ensues ma being killed straight off the cops blast away at the <UNK> with gary and company <UNK> away at them the cops fall like <UNK> and the <UNK> with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet <UNK> ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed damn that guy is tough truly a miracle not since the six <UNK> held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle
<START> the return is one of those movies for that <UNK> group of people who like movies that bore and confuse them at the same time sarah michelle <UNK> plays a lame <UNK> who does not kill vampires or get naked at all throughout the movie i was willing to put up with this however i was not willing to put up with the worst editing ever combined with pointless flashbacks at the end it turns out she crashes her car into herself when she was young or maybe i'm wrong and that was just a flashback with this movie it's impossible to tell can you believe the same dude who made army of darkness produced this crap a much better idea is to stay at home and watch army of darkness on sci fi channel that movie had it all <UNK> zombies and a dude with a chainsaw for an arm the forgotten didn't even have one of these things
<START> i was hoping for some sort of in depth background information on the apollo 11 mission and what i got was some decent interview material with buzz <UNK> gene <UNK> and other people involved in the mission linked by over hyped disaster <UNK> <UNK> voice over in the worst tradition of tv production br br if you could cut out the voice over and change the spin of the program to a positive testament of how people can overcome <UNK> to achieve a goal out of the ordinary then this could've been great but i feel i've wasted about 45 minutes of my life whilst watching a 60 minute programme i want those minutes back
<START> the original is a relaxing watch with some truly memorable animated sequences unfortunately the sequel while not the worst of the <UNK> sequels completely lacks the <UNK> br br the biggest letdown is a lack of a story like <UNK> magical world the characters are told through a series of vignettes magical world while <UNK> better still manages to make a mess of the story in between the vignettes we see the mice at work and i personally think the antics of <UNK> and gus are the redeeming merits of this movie br br the first <UNK> is the best about cinderella getting used to being to being a princess this is the best because the mice were at their funniest here the worst of the vignettes when <UNK> turns into a human is cute at times but has a lack of imagination the last <UNK> when <UNK> falls in love was also cute the problem was i couldn't imagine <UNK> being friendly with cinderella as i considered her the <UNK> out of the <UNK> this was also marred by a rather ridiculous subplot about <UNK> falling in love with <UNK> br br the incidental music was very pleasant to listen to however i hated the songs they were really uninspired and nothing like the beautiful <UNK> inspired <UNK> of the original br br the characters were the strongest development here cinderella while still caring had lost her sincerity and a lot of her charm from the original though she does wear some very pretty clothes the duke had some truly funny moments but they weren't enough to save the film likewise with <UNK> and the king as i mentioned the mice were the redeeming merits of the movie as they alone contributed to the film's <UNK> i have to say also the animation is colourful and above average and the voice acting was surprisingly good br br all in all a cute if unoriginal sequel that was marred by the songs and a lack of a story 4 10 for the mice the voice acting the animation and some pretty dresses <UNK> cox
<START> this movie is simply awesome it was a very sensitive issue and movie was superb this movie did not create any controversy in india as far as i know and its publicity was also kept low initially i thought that this movie would simply be a waste of time since most of the indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though its very sensitive and adds a love story in original story and <UNK> the whole thing most of the indian viewers would agree on this topic if they remember <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc br br there have been so many movies in india which would have become <UNK> or mega hits if the love story part would not be unnecessarily added br br but its treatment is pretty similar to <UNK> movie also a must watch br br if it counts then i would like to thank anil kapoor producer and <UNK> <UNK> khan the director for making such a great movie
<START> when i saw this movie a few days ago my eyes were completely fixed to the screen its greatness held my attention to such an extent that i focused all of my attention on it for its entire duration i would recommend seeing it not just to fans of anime but to anyone who likes great movies period or who likes really weird stuff the style of art is beautiful the sound is perfect and the symbolism within it is breathtaking i've heard complaints about the weird <UNK> of english text in the movie but i think the way its done is <UNK> to the strange style of the movie the self attributed description of hello kitty on acid doesn't do justice to this film of absolutely epic proportions i'd like to find more works by whoever made this and see them
<START> you know jason you know freddy and you know <UNK> now get ready for the safety pin killer that's right in killer <UNK> a dumb slasher movie if i've ever seen one the unseen murderer <UNK> his or her victims with an <UNK> novelty safety pin it is an odd choice to be sure the kind of thing that deserves an explanation naturally the movie never even attempts to <UNK> where the killer acquired such a thing br br as the title suggests an <UNK> gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect in fact the movie gives so few clues as to the identity of the killer just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they get killed and since just about everyone but the killer winds up dead it's really just process of <UNK> br br oddly while the entire name cast is killed off the <UNK> classes continue in earnest in fact nothing is capable of stopping the dancing while three men are murdered in the next room the <UNK> goes on death isn't even a factor one character dies but is still seen <UNK> in the later <UNK> sessions director david prior knew what he was doing when named the movie killer <UNK> and not logical <UNK> br br cop chases explosive <UNK> <UNK> and hundreds of shots of women's exposed flesh are thrown in for good measure much like the woman caught in the <UNK> bed i felt very uncomfortable by the end of killer <UNK> finally thankfully the end <UNK> on the screen what happened next you got it shots of the women working out not even the end of the movie can stop them br br
<START> is this the future that <UNK> us an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> existence this film brings to mind a problem that still <UNK> us <UNK> so since the film was released in back in 1973 let's hope that the world isn't going to end up like this br br soylent green is a wild movie that i enjoyed very much it had likable characters a semi apocalyptic setting a compelling and thought provoking storyline and the macho <UNK> macho man out there <UNK> heston richard <UNK> gave the movie a very unpleasant dirty feel you're almost <UNK> by the <UNK> from the city and its filthy inhabitants br br the characters are wonderful <UNK> heston who has become one of my favorite actors is thorn the man created this role of <UNK> yet likable tough guy i could definitely put myself in <UNK> shoes he sees that something isn't right but everyone around him either doesn't listen more like paid not to listen or wants him dead edward g robinson in his last film r i p plays the lovable old <UNK> who has had enough of this nasty place everyone else is great especially leigh taylor young as <UNK> a piece of furniture that comes with the apartment in which she <UNK> br br the special effects are fantastic even for 1973 the soylent green factory the futuristic apartments and especially the <UNK> <UNK> that get rid of people were excellent the <UNK> air outside looks disgusting and very nasty the empty city streets filled with the vile and <UNK> people are very unsettling br br one final note is the ending which even now still shocked me it is gruesome but if you think about it it's a pretty good idea br br the bottom line br br an excellent 70's science fiction flick that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uneasy
<START> run do not walk away from this movie aimed at the very young kids this movie will bore you to tears if the gamera trilogy of the 90's raised the bar this film just <UNK> it it's slow paced and the monster fighting is good but seldom seen this movie had me dry <UNK> in the cat box just a very poor offering after a phenomenal 90's series br br spoilers beyond this point here are the top 10 reasons gamera fans of the 90's series will hate this film br br 10 this movie is a drama that follows a kid trying to cope with the death of his mother and fears losing baby gamera to a fight after knowing his father saw the adult gamera die br br 9 you see the adult gamera for maybe a minute at the beginning of the film he gets his butt kicked by a few <UNK> and self <UNK> he looks old and <UNK> plus he looks nothing like any gamera you've ever seen his suit looked cheap and rushed br br 8 the young gamera you see through the rest of the film looks like a pokemon big eyed and cute it will remind you of the baby godzilla from godzilla vs <UNK> 2 gamera is now too cute br br 7 this movie has the pace of watching a <UNK> race during a 3 hour rain <UNK> i watched this movie with 2 other gamera fans and nobody was happy with how slowly this film moved along i've seen an <UNK> full of fat people going up a mountain road move faster br br 6 like godzilla final wars this movie had very little <UNK> time on screen final wars had much more actually and better fights although short br br 5 kids take the title role the friend of all children theme and poor writing killed the original gamera series in the 1970's and history repeats itself in the <UNK> the most successful gamera films abandoned the <UNK> street feel and went to a darker place why go back to a failed formula this was to be a new trilogy and poor ticket sales killed any hope for this story to continue thank god br br 4 gamera lost his iconic <UNK> he now sounds like an elephant with <UNK> throat br br 3 this movie may produce a new olympic event imagine a <UNK> race that involves sending very young children into <UNK> way you have to see the ending to understand this point where were the parents oh <UNK> right there sending their kids into a <UNK> battle zone br br 2 the special effects were good but sub par for a gamera movie legion and <UNK> had better effects the best effect was showing the apple sized baby gamera fly not too impressive br br 1 this movie is just not what adult <UNK> fans come to expect the director was involved in power rangers and it shows it comes off like a cross between et always sunset on third street and <UNK> kudos if you know all 3 references br br rental at best or watch once if you buy it to complete the dvd series
<START> the tooth fairy is set in a small town somewhere in northern california where peter campbell <UNK> <UNK> has brought a <UNK> property which he is <UNK> planning to turn into a holiday <UNK> he is joined by his girlfriend <UNK> wagner <UNK> west her young 12 year old daughter pamela nicole <UNK> who arrive to help for the weekend while exploring the property pamela meets another young girl named emma <UNK> <UNK> who warns her that evil <UNK> within her new home she tells a tale of an evil old witch known as the tooth fairy who takes baby teeth from children then kills them pamela is worried becomes even more so when she falls off her bike her last baby tooth falls out it's not long before the evil ghost of the tooth fairy has her eyes on <UNK> tooth just for kicks she also decides to kill anyone she comes across br br directed by chuck <UNK> i thought the tooth fairy was just another poor straight to video low budget horror film that fails to <UNK> itself from the countless other's which <UNK> video shop shelves fill late night obscure cable tv <UNK> basically it's not very good the script by producer stephen j <UNK> corey <UNK> cookie <UNK> brown is a complete <UNK> fest for the first 40 odd minutes nothing of any great interest happen during this period at all is basically dull exposition as if this stuff was going to surprise anyone it introduces the character's sets the tooth fairy legend up that's it the second half of the film <UNK> slightly but even then it's hardly spectacular stuff there are a few decent set piece gore scenes but apart from that it's all very predictable forgettable stuff the character's aren't great most of them are there purely to be killed off the story has inconsistencies like the story of the tooth fairy herself it says she kills children after they give her their baby teeth so why does she go on an <UNK> killing spree that has nothing to do with teeth what happened to her after the prologue set during 1949 why has she come back as a ghost despite being a ghost of some sort she seems very human having to open doors herself using weapons to kill people there is no attempt to make any use of the supernatural elements except the ghostly children who are played for maximum sentiment br br director <UNK> does ok it's reasonably well made there are a couple of half decent scenes but nothing to get that excited about there's nothing i would describe as scary or atmospheric in here don't take any notice of the comparisons between this darkness falls 2003 as besides the teeth thing they're quite different the gore is ok someone is shoved into a wood <UNK> machine there's a <UNK> someone has their penis chopped off the best scene when someone is nailed to a door then has their stomach <UNK> open with an axe their guts slide out br br with a supposed budget of about 1 500 000 the tooth fairy is generally well made but there's nothing special on show here the acting isn't anything great but it's not too bad unusually i didn't find the child actors that annoying so that's something i suppose br br the tooth fairy is the usual just below average low budget modern straight to video horror fare that seems everywhere these days if you can find a cheap copy then it might pass 90 odd minutes if your not too demanding otherwise it's pretty poor forgettable stuff
<START> i viewed this movie in dvd format my copy may have been affected but i was disappointed with the lack of menu screen for the dvd i will say that my initial reason for viewing this movie was claire <UNK> while fun to watch i feel she didn't live up to my expectations that i have so far found from her other films i actually was equally pleased to see arkin turn in a humorous performance the other two actors i wasn't very familiar with so i can't compare their performance however they were fairly enjoyable also the acting is the only endearing quality of this movie in my opinion the story line while some could say slightly compelling lacked direction i feel that the main problem <UNK> from the script and not the direction of this film if you enjoy any of these actors to a fair extent then i recommend this film but otherwise leave it alone
<START> remember a film you seemed to enjoy in the past that doesn't quite meet those same feelings as an adult that occurred to me when i went back to school the national <UNK> class reunion the film has a perfect opportunity for laughs but surprisingly wanders <UNK> as we see a bizarre collection of characters such a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can shoot out flames of fire from her mouth a man who appears to be a vampire and a lunatic killer dressed as a woman and wears <UNK> over his head you have the class president who believes he's the best thing since <UNK> bread but as we see in the film he's a coward and joke a couple of pot <UNK> who don't even know they are at their own class reunion and a man named gary for whom know one even knew existed and no one can seem to remember his name this is the one running joke i enjoyed there is a <UNK> <UNK> who likes to grab women in inappropriate places a deaf and blind woman who has a <UNK> <UNK> when calling for her dog and the cook you know her from <UNK> and throw mama from the train who loves to place food on people's <UNK> with her hands the film is essentially about a <UNK> who is or at least attempting to taking revenge on his classmates for a gag they pulled on him they arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister the film follows the characters as they search for the killer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the old high school they were told of the killer by his psychologist who seems a bit odd himself the film has a few good gags that work pretty much early on but the film slowly gets worse each passing minute the film's true problem is that it really doesn't know where to go the film is pretty much a one joke premise for it has <UNK> direction if it really has any direction at all the cast is enthusiastic enough but the material they are to make funny just doesn't have the quality to hold any interest it's a <UNK> for fans of early 80's comedy <UNK> that are forgotten this one rightfully so
<START> <UNK> is another one of those <UNK> films that errol flynn was making in the last decade of his life trying to support his family and stay out of trouble with the irs it's a remake of the fred macmurray <UNK> <UNK> film <UNK> from a decade ago br br unlike that studio product <UNK> has the advantage of that great location cinematography right at the sight of the golden horn but errol flynn who was aging <UNK> before the camera in every film was way too old to be playing these action adventure types any longer his scenes with <UNK> <UNK> really do lack conviction br br as for <UNK> she plays <UNK> former sweetheart who through the trauma of being saved from a fire now has <UNK> she both doesn't remember errol and is now married to <UNK> <UNK> br br but <UNK> got some nasty people led by martin benson and <UNK> <UNK> who are after some <UNK> which have come into his possession got to deal with them too br br best reason to see <UNK> is to hear <UNK> king cole sing and play the piano most people today don't realize that cole was an accomplished jazz <UNK> they only think of him as a singer actually he was a <UNK> first the singing was an <UNK> br br <UNK> is a routine action adventure film for those who are fans of that type of movie
<START> typical de palma movie made with <UNK> of style and some <UNK> that will bring you to the edge of your seat br br most certainly the thing that makes this movie better as the average thriller is the style it has some brilliantly edited <UNK> and some <UNK> that are truly nerve <UNK> that will bring you to the edge of your seat the best <UNK> from the movie the museum scene and the elevator murder there are some mild erotic <UNK> and the movies pace might not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this movie so this movie might not be suitable for everybody br br the story itself is also quite good but it really is the style that makes the movie work it might be for the fans only but also casual viewers should appreciate the well build up tension in the movie br br there are some nice character portrayed by a good cast michael caine is an interesting casting choice and angie dickinson acts just as well as she is good looking not bad for a <UNK> year old br br the musical score by <UNK> <UNK> is also typically de palma like and suits the movie very well just like his score for the other de palma movie body double br br brilliant nerve <UNK> thriller i love de palma br br 10 10

<START> there is no director i like more than <UNK> <UNK> but sadly even though he directed quite a few films that gained huge international attention there are still a fair few of his films that have slipped through the cracks <UNK> is one of them and even though i loved it to bits it's not hard to see why <UNK> in the west are somewhat reluctant to release it br br in between his big and serious films <UNK> is known to do some smaller and <UNK> projects while <UNK> definitely falls into this category <UNK> has really <UNK> himself with this one creating something that is very hard to <UNK> even as a freaky japanese flick go figure br br at its very core lies a documentary not quite unlike <UNK> no video but rather than make a fool of an existing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his own and <UNK> into the lives of <UNK> heroes <UNK> away food for free and <UNK> the japanese <UNK> level <UNK> approach on the subject has close ties with <UNK> <UNK> as the subject is handled with a deadly sense of gravity while the images on screen look as ridiculous as can be deadpan humor taken to the extreme br br but that is not all rather than simply shooting his <UNK> <UNK> decided to make it using a new visual technique <UNK> <UNK> a weird mix of live action photography digital animation and puppets on a stick performed and acted out or <UNK> if you want by the <UNK> of the japanese animation industry no less as the project was supposed to be as low budget as possible br br and if you think that just about covers it know that the film is extremely dialogue heavy making it a good companion piece for innocence the influence of the <UNK> is <UNK> from all kinds of cultural political and even philosophical angles fired at the audience through a continuous stream of monologues and dialogues and to make it even worse the whole film is completely grounded in actual japanese history and customs making it even harder for a <UNK> to get a good grip on the material needless to say multiple viewings are advised to make the best of all the details <UNK> away inside the film br br that said on a <UNK> level the film is easy to follow and already pretty hilarious various <UNK> are introduced as were they the most influential historical figures of post war japan the film plays like you'd expect a serious documentary of any other important figure to unfold but somehow the big and <UNK> animated cut out photography limbs of which figures are assembled don't quite make it all that serious the range of characters introduced is sublime <UNK> <UNK> taking the cake as cow creature wearing a nose ring while taking on the fast food chains with his gang of bull people br br <UNK> regular <UNK> <UNK> provides besides a pretty comical performance a score ranging from atmospheric and dark to wacky strange and comical a lot of fun is to be had from the exaggerated noises and effects <UNK> the animation and totally <UNK> the tone of the rest of the film br br visually the film is very atmospheric though it must be said that the animation is pretty <UNK> and while effective remains toned down only to burst out in <UNK> weirdness from time to time which is not exactly a bad thing seeing how <UNK> is so dialogue heavy despite that the film is still a visual masterpiece as each frame looks absolutely lush and is <UNK> to match and improve the general atmosphere of the film br br beware though because <UNK> does demand a lot from the viewer if you don't speak japanese there is a lot of reading to be done and there are many cultural references that demand some attention on top of that the monologues in the film area quite extended and can be hard to follow the film still lacks english subtitles and even though my french was largely sufficient to get what it was all about i'm sure i missed many of the <UNK> points of the film br br <UNK> is not an easy film to get into but around halfway through it reaches full steam and it doesn't let off from there on i still hope to see this one again with english or dutch <UNK> a dub would actually be best for a film like this much like <UNK> though i guess a quality anime dub is a bit too much to ask for br br with all of that said i can only <UNK> <UNK> on another marvelous film it's rare to find a film that <UNK> and mixes so many styles and influences to create something that is so unique and still works the film is smart looks and sounds great and is filled to the <UNK> with creativity it is immensely funny even if you can't catch all the details on the first viewing but be sure to at least get this with decent <UNK> as the <UNK> english translation that is floating out there is completely worthless and does the film no justice at all br br <UNK> <UNK> to a very specific audience and i'm not surprised the french got their release while the rest of europe and the rest of the western world is still waiting for a sign of this film but for those that like <UNK> appreciate dry and deadpan humor and <UNK> creative spirits it is a film that cannot be missed even though it could just as well misfire 4 5 5 0
<START> first off there is nothing wrong with studying daniel revelation matthew 24 <UNK> and other <UNK> <UNK> there is also nothing wrong with making a film such as this to attempt to present the <UNK> message so my <UNK> with this movie are not in either its sincerity or aspirations as a christian though an <UNK> i believe there will be a great <UNK> and i believe christ will return as he said as much so even though i have <UNK> with this film about the rapture that is not why i rate this movie so low br br no what makes me rate this movie so low is not its sincerity or its message but rather its lack of production values awful script mediocre acting and pitiful fx this movie ranks down there with some of the <UNK> scifi fodder of the 1950s no this movie ranks down there with plan 9 from <UNK> this movie failed to age well and was probably dated by the time they made a sequel br br the apocalypse genre film producers could have learned how not to make an end times film from this but they failed the left behind series the apocalypse series and the <UNK> code series all failed to learn from this because they addressed the fx problems and the dated look problem but their scripts are still poor and their acting is wooden br br there are great christian films with extremely low budgets but this film is not one of them i'm surprised the mst3k crew never <UNK> this one
<START> the earlier part of the film was rather enjoyable but towards the end it became trite although <UNK> is an actor i generally like his luzhin often <UNK> a bad rain man impression and the portrayal of the genius as a semi <UNK> man was annoying overall it seems as if this film is trying to hard and ends up looking pompous in spite of mostly fine performances
<START> the potential movie <UNK> set during the 19th century failed to produce with big name actors like maggie smith albert finney and many others there was no reason for the movie to fail however the movie lacked an ending had a sorry excuse for a plot line and fell to pieces with its continuity a typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy brought together by love and destroyed by beauty or lack thereof and <UNK> has a touching side of a mother's early death and an <UNK> father the father played by finney is a disturbed man <UNK> his daughter in life as well as death he believes his daughter's lack of good looks would ruin his fortune by marrying beneath their social status the actors <UNK> attempted to salvage what was left of the storyline washington square is a black hole of ruin and destruction wasting precious time of those who <UNK> watch i give this movie a 1 instead of a 0 purely for the actors' attempts save yourself stay clear of washington square
<START> the bad news is it's still really dreadful i gave it a 2 because occasionally some of this <UNK> slapstick parody actually seems funny br br it's supposed to be better than <UNK> zombie ass <UNK> and progress should be rewarded or maybe i was drinking heavily when i watched it and felt generous whatever 2 it is br br maybe the best thing about this movie is that it's over pretty quick it takes elements from most of kill bill i <UNK> key themes and fight scenes <UNK> them up <UNK> them way down <UNK> up the dialog and <UNK> the whole mess into about an hour of truly awful amateur video br br you'd best smoke a lot of something powerful if you want to enjoy this one and get this dvd back to the video store on time you'll really hate yourself if you have to pay a late <UNK>
<START> there is this girl and she's running in the woods but she ends up at this woman's clinic and she wants an abortion her daddy is outside in a van and he is all angry about it the whole episode takes place in and outside of this abortion clinic i'm not really pro choice but i wanted the choice to kill this episode i was laughing when i saw the baby come out and it went into the corner the part where they were doing the ultra sound was pretty funny too i was really feeling sorry for the poor dad in this episode he just wanted to protect his daughter and i couldn't really blame him for what he did i don't know what happened to him at the end or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room i was just laughing too hard and i would suggest watching pick me up instead of this episode it wasn't the worst episode but it wasn't that great
<START> like a lot of series pilots dark <UNK> opener shows a mixture of great potential and a slight problem finding its own feet not that this is unusual in any way but there is a feeling that it could have worked better if the story was <UNK> and focused a little more in today's world where something has to catch on instantly or face <UNK> the series did itself a bit of a <UNK> by not coming out at least halfway focused with all guns blazing br br the ninety minute pilot really feels like two episodes glued together and both episodes have a problem with focus in the first half we are introduced to max and filled in on what drives her we also get a few interesting routines with max using her abilities to win <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> or <UNK> out co <UNK> domestic problems the problem here is that this is nothing out of the ordinary for any human being with a normal set of <UNK> on television or otherwise br br it's when we hit the second half that we get a story with a purpose and focus throughout the two <UNK> max finds herself the focus of attention from a pirate journalist who feels it is mission in life to save the world by exposing one dirty dealer at a time in the second half the <UNK> catch up with him and max reluctantly <UNK> up the resulting mess this sets up the premise for the entire rest of the series and it works but it doesn't quite click if you get my meaning it's like most of the pieces are there but a couple that make a complete image have been left out perhaps they get filled in with later episodes but that's beside the point the fact is that the <UNK> of this episode could easily have been told with twenty eight less minutes br br the last of the <UNK> is that a lot of the support cast are totally <UNK> original cindy in particular is an annoyance and i doubt that changed during the next twenty episodes while the acting isn't as bad as daytime soap it isn't of such quality that i'd <UNK> it jessica alba is not the worst actor in the world but she does come up short in terms of being convincing when the story needs it least br br the good news is that the premise and the production values are all top notch in fact this series was considered quite expensive to produce and it is quite unfortunate that it was cancelled in order to be replaced by another show that didn't last a whole season especially when there was ample time for both shows they could have simply cancelled one of the pieces of <UNK> garbage they <UNK> under the <UNK> of reality tv the fact is that we need more shows like dark angel where imagination rather than <UNK> are used to draw the attention br br in all i gave the dark angel pilot a seven out of ten it never rises above the level of throwaway television and it never got a chance to live up to the potential it shows within its own running time but the potential is there and that's often all that matters where pilots are concerned
<START> this is short and to the point the story writing used for star trek hidden frontier is surprisingly good acting is all over the map but the main characters over the years seem to have worked at <UNK> their skills it is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will be coming to end mid may 2007 br br i will not rehash what has already been said about the sets and graphics considering this is all <UNK> for no profit it is pretty amazing br br if this was being <UNK> as a professional production i would have to give it a 5 for a good story but terrible sets however as a fan based production i have to give it an excellent rating as with the exception with a few other efforts this is in a league of its own for sheer volume i don't think this has been matched <UNK> to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire
<START> <UNK> remake was a superior movie remake in every way most remakes end up being total garbage but under the very talented direction of alexandre <UNK> became one of the best ever made in terms of remakes and also as far as the mutant <UNK> human sub genre of horror is concerned in steps part 2 directed by another individual martin <UNK> and written by the father and son <UNK> of jonathan and wes i cannot make a good horror movie to save my life anymore craven and if this is any indication of <UNK> directing skills and young craven's writing skills we are all in for a painful future as <UNK> 2 not only fails to be as good as the first but also fails to entertain on any level br br we start off with a fairly graphic mutant baby birth which though is rather cool will not prepare you for the utter garbage that is to come only hint to what could have been in this film we then get to see a crew of scientists who all to briefly are introduced and <UNK> by our <UNK> rejects in steps our main cast of army <UNK> to save the day this is where the major problems begin br br from very sub par acting yes even for this kind of movie to the horrible characters to the lack of true carnage for most of its running time <UNK> 2 becomes a labor to watch as a lot of nothing happens as idiotic soldiers make mistake after mistake only to meet there demise not by the mutants but themselves think the marines in aliens only the exact opposite and you have the idea of how well these soldiers are trained this is the true shame of the film as most of the hills <UNK> do not get the kills you would like to see like in the first film in fact if this did not have <UNK> 2 <UNK> in the beginning and the brief <UNK> in the beginning <UNK> this loosely to the first this could have nearly been a sci fi channel original br br the mutant <UNK> as well are not as amusing this time around in fact in a lot of way they are far inferior to our prior <UNK> as they all come off as being rather under designed and uninteresting also the one that took the cake was the <UNK> like mutant you know <UNK> from the <UNK> who helps them out in the 3rd act i was waiting for him to ask for a baby ruth or start going on about rocky road ice cream truly disappointing and shameful is the only way to describe most of the goings on here br br the gore is in the film but not nearly as visceral as the original in fact it seemed toned down for the most part as other than the mutant baby birth scene there really isn't anything that stood out like in the first another major strike against this movie so what did work here the answer is nothing at all this felt like a sequel designed specifically to make money off the success of the first and not to make an actually good film br br i can go on about the crappy <UNK> sgt the radio man that has a speech <UNK> that's right he is the kind of guy i want <UNK> in for help in a real crisis or the <UNK> fighter that resembles the exact same character mold as our hero in the first film but i believe you get the point this movie is not even in the same league or even the same planet as the first it should have been given another title and been added to the saturday night line up on the sci fi channel a true shame as a solid sequel could have been made but alas it looks like another horror movie that drops the ball on nearly every level and will get one of my lowest scores as i give <UNK> 2 the same score as its part 2 10 dreadful words cannot describe how bad this movie is a total polar opposite of its predecessor in every way uninspired and down right unnecessary next time guys if your going to make a sequel this bad don't even bother please don't go support this garbage at the theaters save your money and thank me later
<START> i saw mystery men on my birthday in 1999 while i was away on vacation when i came back home i went to see it again keep in mind i was twelve but at that time it was the coolest movie ever i even <UNK> the ultra rare action figures i have them all except for the <UNK> which is the hardest to find they made mr furious the <UNK> the blue <UNK> the <UNK> and captain amazing in case your wondering there is a william h macy action figure in existence i've watched it many times over the years and it still remains a favorite of mine due mostly to fond childhood memories it's not a perfect movie but it definitely deserves another look and perhaps a cult following br br the story a bunch of low level <UNK> save the day this was executed again in the mediocre direct to video the <UNK> as well but this is the other end of the spectrum big budget huge budget almost 100 million i think studio comedy yes the effects are overblown and the huge sets and wonderful production design are a bit much considering the plot but don't think this as a stupid special effects y superhero movie it's a parody they fight a villain named <UNK> frankenstein people he has a <UNK> whatever that is it's a <UNK> device he'll take over the world <UNK> <UNK> and resident superhero captain amazing a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> greg kinnear with commercial product <UNK> on his costume nice touch is kidnapped time for the mystery men mr furious ben stiller gets mad the <UNK> william h macy beats people with <UNK> the blue <UNK> hank <UNK> british throws <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> invisible boy <UNK> mitchell guess what he does the <UNK> the great paul <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> wes <UNK> cuts guns in half with his mind i am not kidding the rest of the fantastic cast of character actors includes geoffrey rush as <UNK> lena <UNK> heavily edited out as <UNK> bride and the one and only tom waits as a crazy weapons dealer so with macy kinnear <UNK> and rush there are four oscar <UNK> and one winner and tom <UNK> waits it's not perfect though it's overlong and there are some <UNK> of <UNK> here and there the <UNK> full of them br br the dialogue definitely <UNK> the physical comedy which is sometimes lacking there's a guy who <UNK> for his power case closed the dialogue is definitely a highlight the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> the mixed <UNK> of mr furious etc it's downright a funny movie it will almost make you forget that this was the film that let all star by <UNK> out into the world br br unfortunately the film did not do as well with critics and audiences as it should have a sequel was originally planned the film is in fact based on a comic book and characters from the <UNK> <UNK> comics the <UNK> <UNK> was planned for the sequel i believe but this did not do well at the box office it could have been a hard sell a superhero comedy with the guy from there's something about mary it also could have been the fact that it was released on the same day as the sixth sense which ended up being the biggest hit for the month of august as well as the thomas crown affair two other misunderstood classics were released on the same crowded weekend oddly enough dick and the iron giant critics gave <UNK> passable reviews but it was quickly forgotten sadly enough on comedy <UNK> <UNK> of jerry stiller comedian jeffrey ross commented to ben stiller that i saw <UNK> <UNK> and i fired my agent ben is then seen to mouth the words i should have to don't listen to him give mystery men a chance
<START> br br burning paradise is a combination of neo shaw brothers action and <UNK> <UNK> urban cynicism when one watches the film they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesn't matter it's attitude and atmosphere that counts this great film has both always trying to be different than his <UNK> <UNK> gives us to traditional heroes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and hung <UNK> <UNK> and puts them in a <UNK> of the lost <UNK> setting however these are not the light hearted comedic <UNK> that you might see in a jet li movie instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results what makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime there is no holding back too bad they don't make films like this more often
<START> i have looked into the eye of this island and what i saw was beautiful <UNK> one of the main characters in <UNK> award winning television show lost the series could be <UNK> as a drama story about a group of plane crash survivors stranded on an unknown island but that would be doing the show a <UNK> lost follows a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island each other and ultimately themselves as they struggle with their new way of life and their <UNK> on each other the situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear this isn't an ordinary island either and that they may not be alone br br my initial fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories they could tell us after a certain period but this proved to be <UNK> the narrative flows naturally the dialogue is witty the characters are memorable and the execution is superb the island is a character all on its own and to understand this comment you'd have to see the series for yourself which only goes to show its originality and greatness br br at the time of writing this review only the first two seasons have aired and they're filled with strong episodes my only mild criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit halfway but then fortunately comes back in admirable shape for the final episodes br br if i can recommend one television series you should be following right now it would certainly be this one if you like excitement adventure character driven stories an extremely strong cast and crew beautiful locations and an island that seems more spiritual than natural lost is for you just be sure you start at the beginning
<START> this film is a great example of fine storytelling the acting is superb the story is inspiring without being overly manipulative or fake there were a couple points where they probably made people a tad more good or bad than they really were but considering it is a hollywood movie they showed amazing restraint there wasn't a single explosion shown in the movie even though they had one opportunity to the film while having suspenseful parts was not made into an action movie the story is thus made to focus on an extraordinary man in unfortunately ordinary times well done
<START> the only reason i am bothering to comment on this movie is to save you all <UNK> minutes of your life and maybe your money br br i bought it ex rental for <UNK> 00 it looked interesting so i took a chance br br within minutes of turning it on i realised i'd made a mistake the entire cast should be <UNK> away until winter and then thrown on the nearest <UNK> fire where they could meet more of their kind br br as for the <UNK> hamilton writer and director he should just be shot sadly this should have been done before he made this rubbish br br avoid this film if you see it in the <UNK> run away br br 1 10
<START> the sopranos was probably the last best show to air in the 90's its sad that its over its was the best show on hbo if not on tv not everything was spelled out for you throughout you had to think it was brilliant the cast was excellent tony james <UNK> is a great actor and played his character excellent as well as the others each character had flaws thats what made them so real and allowed the viewers to connect with them and thats one reason it lasted so long the last episode was good i'm not sure how to take it many different things can be <UNK> by the ending id like to think that tony didn't die but <UNK> walked in and sat down with them and that the <UNK> was just for suspense tony will have to go to trial and deal with that hopefully is not dead thats how i feel long live the sopranos and tony soprano
<START> there have been very few films i have not been able to sit through i made it through battle field earth no problem but this this is one of the single worst films ever to be made i understand whoopi goldberg tried to get of acting in it i do not blame her i would feel ashamed to have this on a resume i <UNK> it is a rare occasion when almost every gag in a film falls flat on it's face well it happens here not to mention the <UNK> look for the <UNK> with the control <UNK> hanging out of it rear end halfway through the film i was still looking for a plot i never found one save yourself the trouble of renting this and save 90 minutes of your life
<START> i might not be a huge admirer of the original <UNK> but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look like perfection and to think i was going into this expecting to like this one more five years after its predecessor george romero gets back on board the <UNK> comic style trail and on this outing <UNK> the screenplay for steve king's three stories though the direction is handed off to michael <UNK> the film mostly <UNK> in that aspect with uneven <UNK> by <UNK> but most of the blame would have to go to romero's dreadfully static and <UNK> cringe like script especially in those dialogues <UNK> through the first and final story <UNK> messages that came from mostly a sour bunch of characters simply took over the black humour oh it was painful and the same can be said about the lively rotten music score accompanying the picture loosely <UNK> the three tales old chief <UNK> the raft and the <UNK> together is a mildly curious and effective <UNK> story done in nostalgia 80s animation form i rather liked this segment and the <UNK> creep character was a glowing light br br the first story old chief <UNK> sees two elderly <UNK> george kennedy dorothy <UNK> of a general store in a dying native community dead river get robbed and eventually killed by a couple of <UNK> dying to live it up in hollywood in front of the store is a wooden statue of an indian chief that comes to live to avenge their deaths br br listen to george kennedy <UNK> and <UNK> on for 10 minutes about how he's committed to his <UNK> community what a nice <UNK> <UNK> time well just like <UNK> speeches this is one <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> item that never makes good of a fine premise the overbearing script is plain inane and the performances are suitably so these two factors really added to my headache when the indian comes alive and turns <UNK> the <UNK> meet a very quick though grisly death in the proper fashion the effects were <UNK> done but what about that free flowing hair how could hollywood knock that lock of hair back ugh br br second story the raft follows a group of <UNK> smoking and <UNK> teens heading up to a secluded lake after swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake they get trapped on the platform because of an ominous looking creature lurking in the water br br now this is much better much better what starts of as your basic teens run <UNK> turns into a mysteriously creepy set up that's full of tight and claustrophobic tension and it doesn't even cop out on the flashes of nudity or <UNK> splatter quite morbid it is and that goes for its sense of humour too the surprisingly ironic ending has a beautiful touch to it the performances from the <UNK> are acceptable without making a huge mark <UNK> direction sticks to the nasty and rather <UNK> side while the <UNK> music score on this occasion pressed the right <UNK> the <UNK> like creature in the lake like many have mentioned looks like an <UNK> black <UNK> yeah you're reading that right floating on the water br br finally number three concludes with the <UNK> a wealthy but sexually lacking woman is on her way back home after being with her male <UNK> but she's is running late thinking of some ideas to explain for her <UNK> if needed she <UNK> off the road and accidentally <UNK> a <UNK> instead of checking or getting help she drives off in the hope getting home before her husband soon enough she's being <UNK> by the <UNK> corpse of the dead <UNK> br br not awful but i really didn't get into this laughably ludicrous exercise at all compared to the first two this one was so different in tone and tried to <UNK> the funny bone instead lois <UNK> was okay in the lead role but that constant <UNK> and the little conversations she has with herself became <UNK> <UNK> and downright tired the vivid make up effects are well displayed and dripping with vision when she <UNK> the <UNK> that's when it becomes <UNK> cheesy and over the top in its execution from there <UNK> we endlessly hear our supposedly dead <UNK> repeat and <UNK> and repeat the line thanks for the ride lady this happens every time she decides to run over him have a little courtesy for the dead darling br br in all the second short story the raft and the <UNK> well conceived effects is what lifts this extremely inferior sequel
<START> i found the arab conspiracy in a bargain bin and thought i'd <UNK> a lost treasure folks there's a reason why you don't hear much about this film the plot is <UNK> the pacing is slow <UNK> <UNK> is about as <UNK> as plain cold <UNK> and the ending leaves you flat not even sean connery can save this one
<START> in this movie joe <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a basketball joe <UNK> br br and being consistent the rest of the script is equally not believable br br <UNK> is a funny guy which saves this film from sinking <UNK> the absolute back of the <UNK> but the other roles were pretty bad the father was a greedy businessman who <UNK> money more than people which wasn't even well played instead of the man being an <UNK> villain he seemed more like an amoral <UNK> <UNK> to make money at all costs then there's the token piece that is assigned to <UNK> as a girlfriend or something i don't even remember she was that forgettable br br anyone who rates this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the reputation of this <UNK> film or at least one of those millions of media <UNK> who can't critique <UNK> you know the people who feel bad if they give anything a mark below 6 br br stay away far away and shame on comedy central where i saw this film they usually pick better
<START> parker <UNK> <UNK> is an aspiring writer who is still looking for his big break in the meantime he works as a <UNK> <UNK> for a manhattan psychic <UNK> one day most unfortunately his apartment building burns down parker and his cat make it out alive but are now stuck with the <UNK> task of finding <UNK> <UNK> in the big apple word comes to parker that a lady samantha alison eastwood is searching for a roommate but will only accept a gay male since parker is straight but the price is right he decides to pretend that he is gay samantha likes him from the start and <UNK> him as her new <UNK> but poor parker sam is lovely intelligent and very <UNK> how will he be able to keep his true nature under control besides doesn't sam have a successful businessman boyfriend anyway this is a sweet likable and humorous film with two very attractive stars in eastwood and <UNK> naturally the plot is a string of how can i keep up this <UNK> scenes with sam asking parker for <UNK> while she is <UNK> or <UNK> with him to hold her in bed when she receives bad news also it is necessary for parker to produce his own fake gay mate boris when sam insists upon <UNK> him up with a man she knows hopefully the gay community will not find this too offensive as this viewer thought most issues were treated with sensitivity and subtlety for a small scale movie the costumes sets and camera work were quite nice also therefore if you love those funny tales of love get this one soon you will like what you see i know it
<START> let me start by saying at the young age of <UNK> i was suddenly widowed i was <UNK> as he was not sick he died unexpectedly basically of a <UNK> his <UNK> blew out he died behind our house there was a lot of <UNK> from police cause he fell on something and it <UNK> his head in i was a suspect for murder until the <UNK> came back br br my children were as traumatized as i was so in love with a good father figure as he i had three small children no education no financial support i took it very very hard br br within two years my in laws attacked me <UNK> physically emotionally and <UNK> demanding i <UNK> not in front of the children and put on masks and showed people what they wanted to see not show them my pain during holidays nobody stood up for me and my choice to sit out one holiday except of course the grief <UNK> i was seeing that had advised me to follow my heart and soul my in laws didn't get it it changed forever my relationship with them and i have never been back for a holiday this is only one example of how my grief was <UNK> my own new husband has seen me fall apart talking about the trauma when i shared from my soul i collapse can not breathe <UNK> and generally am <UNK> for a few days if i even try to convey the hidden pain br br now about this movie br br today my soul was <UNK> my heart broken my fears and pain re <UNK> from the real demons this movie presents how one <UNK> compared to how others expect us too and the demons within adam sandler portrayed perfectly the horrendous agony you face overcome and most of all work through on your own time this movie <UNK> up all the pain that i have tried over the years to deal with you see when something <UNK> your soul so profoundly so deep that <UNK> are all that come from your mouth in moments of thinking you can not deal with it without wishing you were dead and walking through life in a dead state br br the bible has a <UNK> <UNK> 8 26 that i have <UNK> to that when my mouth and soul know not what to pray for that god's holy spirit carries that agony to the feet of god i need not speak sandler portrayed that to perfection br br there is a scene where he has been <UNK> into a court hearing for mental health commitment purposes and he goes back in to face his in laws familiar to me and he tells them the stunning truths that he has been possessed by per se that he can't get over it's a profoundly strong and mighty performance i started <UNK> and had a hard time after <UNK> getting up to walk out from the theater feeling my legs too weak to do so my son was with me and saw it first hand my precise motions while trying to hold it all together a lesson for him my youngest who barely remembers his daddy it's been 13 years for me but this movie brought me back to the moment of losing my in laws forever when they <UNK> a mask on my emotions and my <UNK> to their desires instead of respect to my own br br i write this so that if you are a <UNK> you are prepared for this movie but recommend it highly in the 1000 star performance sandler gave br br if you are not yet a <UNK> please take a lesson from his movie and just listen and accept people's choices in their grief letting them find peace in their own time sometimes the soul can not utter the words to convey our pain br br go see this movie with <UNK> and not without preparing to take it in to your soul
<START> it's refreshing to see a movie that you think will end happily just like almost every other american movie and then be surprised when that doesn't happen i like a happy ending as much as the next guy but sometimes it's better to portray things in a more realistic manner and i thought <UNK> palace did this very well br br the ending with one friend basically <UNK> herself for the other thus redeeming her earlier poor behavior which got them into the situation in the first place was very moving i almost rather would have done without the last line which proved that she didn't actually do the deed she <UNK> to because that would have made the movie more about the friendship between the two girls and less about the crime whether she did it or not wasn't that important br br the story itself <UNK> on the cliché but the actresses kept my attention with their excellent performances very realistic very captivating br br 7 out of 10
<START> what a terrible film br br it starts well with the title sequence but that's about as good as it gets br br the movie is something about rats turning into monsters and going on a killing spree the acting isn't so much poor but the script is pointless and the film isn't even scary despite the atmospheric music br br it really is amazing that some group <UNK> together this bag of rubbish and thought it would make a good film br br it isn't a good film it's trash and i urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it one out of ten
<START> yeah it's low budget yeah it's one of <UNK> earliest films but it is maybe his funniest john candy was not so far removed from his <UNK> days in going <UNK> and it shows if you don't crack up when candy tries to help a guy with his <UNK> while being hand <UNK> to an escaped <UNK> in the process of having sex with his girlfriend with only the apartment door <UNK> them huh see the movie or the way <UNK> levy the creator of kong fu <UNK> is talking to his mom on the phone or just the countless number of facial expressions that only candy could deliver you better check your pulse if you like the john candy of only the lonely this is may not be a movie i would advise you to see but if you enjoy the <UNK> days of john candy this movie is a must see
<START> definitely one of my favourite movies the story is good acting is great all <UNK> especially cinematography are sharp and the script is clever br br heath ledger is terrific as edward <UNK> kelly he is gripping as the legendary outlaw and is supported well by geoffrey rush <UNK> <UNK> and orlando bloom all action sequences are on point br br the film is edge of your seat stuff right up to to the end one of my favourite films from the late legend heath ledger who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in and makes no mistake here br br an excellent film all round
<START> when i saw that this film was only 80 minutes long i thought we were in trouble <UNK> the gigantic w <UNK> <UNK> novel down to a movie that <UNK> in at under an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen but you know the movie's not half bad and it even manages to retain much of what makes the book <UNK> so much with its readers br br i've heard many film buffs complain that leslie howard was a wet <UNK> of an actor and he was but i can't think of anyone more suited to play the role of philip carey than a wet <UNK> for that's certainly what carey is howard plays him well which means you want to shake him and slap him upside the head repeatedly then finally take him out and buy him a spine br br ah and then there's bette as the girl with whom carey is obsessed and who brings his world crashing down around him i didn't know what on earth the appeal of mildred was in the book and the movie stays true to that detail but as played by davis she does become the most fascinating character in the story and if she's nasty and unlikable she's at least the most dynamic person on screen at any given time <UNK> performance here is credited with changing the course of screen acting much as <UNK> would do nearly 20 years later when he screamed out stella in that little known <UNK> williams play and it's not hard to see why davis is intense to the point of scary she makes no effort to <UNK> any sympathy from the audience and she allows herself to look ugly and most <UNK> her appearance when carey walks in on her late in the film to find her dead or nearly dead of an <UNK> disease though not much care is taken to hide the fact that it's an <UNK> is shocking of course it helps that this movie <UNK> out just before the production code went into effect if it had been made a year later you can bet things would have been a bit different br br yes much of the novel and many of its most interesting parts are left on the cutting room floor and the story really does become about carey and mildred and not much else i found that to be the least interesting and most tedious part of <UNK> novel but it is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the part that readers are still drawn to now so it strikes me as a wise decision on the part of the film makers that they chose to adapt the novel the way they did br br grade b
<START> i'm a big fan of horror flicks and zombie films are a particular favorite of mine that said zombi 3 is one of the absolute worst films i have ever seen so needless to say i really enjoyed it it's the best bad movie i've seen in a long while the story has some similarities with dan <UNK> return of the living dead but whereas that film was intentionally funny this one is the opposite it has some of the most laughable acting i've ever witnessed especially from the main scientist character his scenes with the general were just hysterical also the effects are <UNK> and in many cases sloppy and the death scenes are often just downright stupid this of course makes it all the more fun possible spoiler the worst is the scene where the guy opens the <UNK> door and sees the severed zombie head which then opens its eyes and somehow flies out of the <UNK> obviously pulled out <UNK> with a bit of string <UNK> onto the guys neck killing him zombie heads have the ability to <UNK> in the air now it defies every law of physics known to man and it's one of the most absurd things ever filmed that's just one of many really goofy moments in the idiotic mess i can't believe it's gotten so high a rating here if you are a fan of bad movies do yourself a favor and rent this sucker
<START> it's like this you put in the dvd and the most professional looking thing you see over the next ninety minutes is the <UNK> of the distribution company and at this point you know you've just been <UNK> around br br people are generally <UNK> enough to assume that if something has been put on dvd it's going to be of a certain level at least <UNK> if not <UNK> but sadly this isn't the case distribution companies are perfectly happy to throw together dvds of amateur movies and ship them right out into the stores to <UNK> the unsuspecting <UNK> who is drawn in by the well designed dvd cover the weight behind this particular project is most likely independent horror movie <UNK> kevin j <UNK> whose name may be known amongst genre fans since he's responsible for various other low budget werewolf movies rage of the werewolf werewolf tales and so on br br blood of the werewolf is made up of three short independent werewolf stories with no real connection other than the fact that they deal with <UNK> <UNK> the first segment blood reunion pretty much sets the tone for the whole thing a man returns to his home town to look up a girl who had a crush on only to find that her <UNK> grandmother refuses to let her have relationships with men and for reasons which are somehow related to a dark family secret this <UNK> is poorly directed poorly directed and basically nothing superior to what you could throw together yourself with a few friends and a home video camera br br the second story old blood is probably the strongest out of the three and is directed by <UNK> himself it tells the story of a lesbian couple one of whom is a <UNK> and the other wishes to be given this power her wish is granted but she doesn't become the creature that she <UNK> this short movie shows that <UNK> has more talent and experience than the other filmmakers who worked on this project but still not enough to raise it above the level of an amateur movie br br and finally we have <UNK> in which some army guy runs through the woods while being chased by two other <UNK> they wish to kill him as he has been bitten by the beast and is believed to be dangerous but all might not be as it seems this one has an interesting concept but it's stretched out to be far too long and if you don't guess what the twist is in the first ten minutes then you probably ain't too bright this pretty much sums up the problem with this whole dvd a few good ideas just aren't enough to justify spending money on something like this after all would you pay for a picture you could have painted yourself
<START> for this movie <UNK> a new low in bollywood and has set the standard against which all c p must now be compared br br first off the beginning did have elements of style and if handled well could have become a cult classic a la pulp fiction or a <UNK> <UNK> but the plot was there one begins to <UNK> and at one point completely loses it br br throw in a deranged don with an obsession for english a call center smart alec a femme <UNK> tale who can don a bikini and a <UNK> with the same <UNK> a <UNK> gravity <UNK> hit man and a cop with a hundred or was it a thousand black cat <UNK> on their trail good ingredients in competent hands but this is where i would like to ask the director sir what were you smoking br br im sure this movie would be remembered in the <UNK> of bollywood film making for what must never be done insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers br br possibly the only redeeming feature in this <UNK> matrix plus <UNK> plus <UNK> caper is the music watch the videos hear the <UNK> and you wont be disappointed <UNK> <UNK> come up with some <UNK> <UNK> tunes br br how i wish the director had spent the money in creating some more eye candy br br as i sign off i want to really badly know how does <UNK> bullet wound <UNK> in a <UNK> what were you <UNK> doing tashan maybe
<START> if you've read mother night and enjoyed it so much as i did that you just have to see the movie understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of <UNK> writing that beyond his story lies <UNK> himself and that you can't put a human mind on the screen his <UNK> and humor just cannot be <UNK> by a screenplay or even the best acting performance i believe that this movie <UNK> in asking the key questions that <UNK> poses in his book but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen does this mean that the movie misses the mark of course not in my opinion the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page it succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of america's true artistic <UNK> and presents it in a a <UNK> without <UNK> i've seen other movie versions of <UNK> books where the director obviously tries to channel <UNK> genius and loses grip on his own craft i would not place this movie as one of the best i've seen but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching by taking <UNK> voice out of the movie's narration or trying to insert it however it can mother night tells his story brilliantly and <UNK> the story's fundamental lessons without confusion distraction or disappointment
<START> contains spoilers the movie plot can be <UNK> in a few sentences three guys go hunting in the forest two of them along other people get shot in the head without explanation the last guy can stand in the clear shout and do anything without getting shot he gets to walk through an old factory and has the evil people walk right into his scope without a struggle the villains are conveniently dressed in black and look like villains br br that is the whole story not <UNK> but in detail everything is drawn out with a guy standing <UNK> a door bell we wait with him long shot of guys being bored in the woods and sleeping we can take a <UNK> with them the one drawn out shot of following a female <UNK> could have been redeeming if we could see her butt or boobs <UNK> br br there dialog is less then terminator and it is not because there is so much action the characters just don't talk and then they don't even have something corny to say like <UNK> be back ' if my buddy shot this on the weekend i'd cheer for him because it is quite a feat to figure out the camera controls to pay money to rent this as a dvd is totally inappropriate br br the one thing that is a little funny is the extra with the director telling how they local police didn't realize that they were shooting and treated them like a random guy walking around with a gun if they'd have filmed that i'd be sure it would be more fun to watch then the movie
<START> i loved the movie but like everyone said there were some bits that weren't developed enough i thought personally that the girls were very vapid before they landed in prison sure they were supposed to be innocent american girls but still i felt like they lacked that bond that best friends are supposed to have for example in the montage where they're sight seeing the way they held each other for the photograph was very awkward looking br br then there are some parts that were very ambiguous i think it's pretty much understood that <UNK> character didn't do it but i can see how that could be confusing also why did the camera <UNK> on <UNK> bearing a very grim expression after he put the <UNK> in their taxi <UNK> i thought it was suggesting something but it turned out to be nothing br br apart from that the movie was great i cried when claire danes took the blame she's a great actress br br also i wanted to see that bitchy <UNK> <UNK> get her ass kicked talk about lack of closure
<START> this is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen unfortunately i am a horror movie buff and will rent any horror movie unless it's not made for t v when looking at the box it says it is rated r for gore and some language where was the gore was their one good death scene where you actually saw gore i could have overlooked that if there had been some brief nudity or some good dialogue there wasn't even one remotely witty or amusing line in this lame movie sometimes horror movies are awesome because they are so stupid but this was just sad
<START> i saw this movie sunday afternoon i absolutely loved this movie i loved everything about it from the sappy moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes where <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is crying because of her poor decision in marrying a man for her parents and not because she is truly in love i loved these moments because they were just so real at first i was seriously scared because i was hoping that it would not end up like bobby which was a great cast but a poorly written movie with no real meat to it but during the middle of the movie i felt completely different you will laugh and you will cry but in the end you will want to see evening one more time trust me when i say go see it
<START> get ready for it this is one of my favourite films of all time i am relatively unaware of david <UNK> writer and director other works but after having watched this film half a dozen times it's always a joy to watch i can say without <UNK> that he is a genius this film is extremely well written and quickly draws you in to its <UNK> of <UNK> con artistry and back room <UNK> the feel of the film is very similar to the <UNK> 1973 and it also pays homage to film noir br br it's quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters it is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch br br generally the acting is superb especially joe <UNK> but someone who i watched the film with <UNK> to me that it's not a good idea to have a heroine lindsay <UNK> who is not only a <UNK> a <UNK> and a thief but also sports a bad 80's <UNK> i agree but i think she is nevertheless outstanding in the role br br the less you know about the plot of this film the better just like <UNK> most recent film the spanish prisoner because the ending will be even more impressive just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance
<START> hi folks br br forget about that movie john c should be ashamed that he appears as executive producer in the credits bon <UNK> has never been and will never be an actor and the fx are a joke br br the first vampires was good and it was the only vampires this thing here just wears the same name br br just a waste of time thinks br br jake <UNK>
<START> this movie is mostly crap and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because jean <UNK> <UNK> damme stars in this movie there are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie br br the acting in this movie is so bad and its the worst acting i have ever seen and the 2 actors bill goldberg and michael <UNK> white can not act at all and this movie by far has to be one of jean <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> worst movies he has done and if u what to watch him in one of his great movies u should watch blood sport <UNK> or sudden death br br over all this movie is crap ok and my rating is 4 out of 10
<START> <UNK> was in production about the same time as michael <UNK> <UNK> gate <UNK> cost a <UNK> to make but is 10 times the piece of film br br <UNK> gate was the biggest and most expensive 40 <UNK> in 1980 hollywood <UNK> of all time its failure resulted in the sale of the united artists studio to mgm imdb entry br br <UNK> cost a few hundred thousand dollars and benefits from great writing direction photography and acting it easily draws you into the beauty <UNK> <UNK> and sorrow of <UNK> life br br it's sad that hollywood sometimes would pour millions into <UNK> based on a director's single big hit and neglect such a wonderful story
<START> the movie wasn't all that great the book is better but the movie wasn't all that bad either it was interesting to say the least the plot had enough suspense to keep me watching although i wouldn't say i was actually interested in the movie itself <UNK> turner and antonio <UNK> jr are both gorgeous enough to keep you watching they have a few cute <UNK> that should appeal to the <UNK> overall i'd give the movie a 7 or 8 it wasn't bad just a little lacking plot wise
<START> it seems that it is becoming <UNK> to rip basic instinct 2 to the point that a significant part of the audience including critics found it terrible even before it was released it seems even more <UNK> to trash sharon stone <UNK> all of <UNK> now <UNK> years older <UNK> most of <UNK> looks wonderful first comments on this movie were so vicious that i had to see for myself in my opinion this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film but is not as bad as most comments pretend michael <UNK> jones is not paul verhoeven neither henry bean and <UNK> <UNK> are joe <UNK> basic instinct 2 is just an entertaining average thriller and besides the addition of jerry <UNK> original score keeps little resemblance to its predecessor even stone gives her character a different dimension creating a <UNK> <UNK> catherine <UNK> who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like <UNK> <UNK> she is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her <UNK> unfortunately she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy <UNK> this flick she became too successful too much of a main icon and like all those actors who have reached that level her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by hollywood audiences br br the rest of the cast is outstanding giving performances that are far better than the material deserves david <UNK> is a much better actor and by far more interesting than michael douglas his acting is flawless giving a dense complex dimension to an otherwise one dimensional character since he has more screen time and is the <UNK> of the movie he can keep your attention from beginning to end br br i am not <UNK> basic instinct 2 as a great movie i am just expressing my <UNK> with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that <UNK> other than the movie itself are <UNK> the opinion of most <UNK>
<START> <UNK> interesting western from a director who had few peers in the genre much like other anthony mann pictures the far country <UNK> a potent pot <UNK> story with an <UNK> knowing of <UNK> scenery both of which play out amongst some of <UNK> <UNK> like honour integrity betrayal and of course death the story sees fortune hunting partners jeff <UNK> james stewart and ben <UNK> walter brennan travel to <UNK> territory with a herd of cattle aware of the <UNK> gold boom they plan to make a <UNK> profit selling the cattle in a <UNK> town arriving in <UNK> they find self <UNK> judge mr gannon john mcintire ready to meet out justice to <UNK> on account of <UNK> having <UNK> the law all be it with honest cause along the way in punishment gannon takes the partners herd from them but they steal them back and head across the canadian border to dawson with gannon and his men in hot pursuit here beautiful women and a meek and <UNK> town will fill out the <UNK> of all involved br br interesting from start to finish the far country benefits greatly from james stewart's <UNK> anti hero in waiting portrayal and <UNK> slick direction of the tight <UNK> chase script the cinematography from william h daniels is <UNK> tho not done any <UNK> by current dvd <UNK> and the film has a few surprises and a will he wont he core <UNK> the viewers in paying <UNK> on re watches for hardened genre fans it still remains something of an essential viewing for first <UNK> <UNK> into the wonderful yet dark western world of anthony mann and james stewart 8 10
<START> <UNK> the biography of actor william haines offers a <UNK> <UNK> about the former star when he was past 70 and long retired from making movies the old <UNK> was not sentimental and rarely watched his own films but in 1972 he was <UNK> to attend a los angeles museum screening of show people the late silent feature in which he co starred with marion davies beforehand haines was worried that this comedy would <UNK> the wrong kind of laughter but he was pleasantly surprised and no doubt <UNK> at how well it held up and how much the young audience enjoyed it watch the film today and you can see why show people is a delightful hollywood satire that <UNK> its charm because it <UNK> its targets with wit and flair yet without <UNK> it's still funny and its satirical points still <UNK> needless to say the technology of movie making has changed vastly since the silent days but the <UNK> and <UNK> of the filmmakers themselves haven't changed all that much br br show people also stands as the best surviving work of marion davies a first rate comic performer who deserves a prominent place in the <UNK> of great <UNK> where her career was concerned davies was both blessed and cursed by the <UNK> of her <UNK> the newspaper <UNK> william randolph <UNK> it's well known that <UNK> <UNK> enormous influence over <UNK> choice of roles and well known too that despite her gift for comedy he preferred to see her play <UNK> <UNK> in period costume dramas by the late <UNK> for whatever reason marion was <UNK> to <UNK> her stuff in several <UNK> light comedies including the red mill and the <UNK> but show people directed by the great king <UNK> stands as her most enjoyable showcase william haines gives an engaging likable performance as her boyfriend and co star billy <UNK> but this is the leading <UNK> show all the way br br marion plays southern belle peggy pepper an aspiring actress who <UNK> hollywood accompanied by her father determined to become a movie star her dad colonel pepper is played by actor director <UNK> henderson a veteran of <UNK> <UNK> dramas <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> one of <UNK> funniest bits often <UNK> elsewhere is her audition at the <UNK> studio casting office while dad <UNK> suggests emotions to portray sorrow joy and drops a <UNK> across her face peggy assumes the appropriate expression and <UNK> she's hired only to discover that <UNK> makes low brow comedies the kind of comedies where people <UNK> each other with <UNK> and inept cops <UNK> over each other racing to the rescue of course <UNK> is intended as a take off of mack <UNK> <UNK> but the true nature of the satire becomes clear as the story unfolds as peggy pepper rises in the movie star <UNK> she leaves <UNK> for the more <UNK> high art studio assuming the name patricia <UNK> as more <UNK> her new station in life as a serious actress at some point it may occur to us as it surely did to viewers in <UNK> that <UNK> rival gloria <UNK> started out in <UNK> comedies before rising to <UNK> in serious dramas for cecil b demille and as miss <UNK> takes herself more and more seriously giving the high hat treatment to former colleagues such as <UNK> comic billy <UNK> <UNK> performance takes on an element of wicked parody seemingly aimed <UNK> at <UNK> herself this is especially notable during an interview sequence when miss <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pretentious nonsense while the star delivers a spot on <UNK> of <UNK> i suppose this was intended as a friendly spoof but i have to wonder how friendly relations were between gloria and marion after this movie was released br br in any event show people is a delicious treat for buffs who will <UNK> the parade of star cameos throughout charlie chaplin contributes a nice bit sans makeup and looking quite distinguished eagerly seeking patricia <UNK> <UNK> and in a show of good <UNK> marion davies herself puts in a self mocking cameo appearance evening the score for <UNK> fun at <UNK> by <UNK> fun at herself this is a silent film that viewers not especially <UNK> to <UNK> might appreciate at least those viewers with a taste for movies about the movie business show people surely belongs in the company of such classics as sunset <UNK> and <UNK> in the rain among hollywood's most expertly produced enjoyable <UNK> in amused self examination

<START> this is one of the greatest films ever made it's an all time classic the character played by ned beatty <UNK> one of the greatest on screen <UNK> ever portrayed he is a shallow almost useless overweight insurance salesman he is proud of his ignorance and yet judges the backwards <UNK> to be the ignorant ones when he <UNK> the old man on his hat and the old man responds you don't know <UNK> the tone is set it's true he really doesn't know <UNK> but one backwoods <UNK> rape later the man is practically a warrior his shallow fake bravery is toned down into serious resolve the old self is forever dead left in some far off woods soon to be under hundreds of feet of water and what of lewis our <UNK> guide lewis is a <UNK> hunter warrior and he's just about nuts burt reynolds proved himself as an actor way back in 1972 in this film completely giving himself in to this wonderful role who wouldn't want to have a friend like lewis if one was to venture into the dangers of a forgotten soon to be left behind world like the one our hapless <UNK> find themselves in this film speaks to us on so many levels the story feels real it works as a complete action adventure with wonderful cinematography and deliberate <UNK> pacing it works as a bit of a horror film with the danger and almost <UNK> of the encounter with the vile <UNK> who <UNK> their <UNK> ned beatty but it also works as an art film using incredible amounts of symbolism to convey truths that go to our very core i have seen this film at least fifty times and every time it comes on i find i have to watch it you have to watch it quite a few times to even begin to comprehend it this is one deep movie this is one well acted movie and this is one hell of a story i gave it a 10 out of 10 and put it in my 10 all time greatest films ever made along with <UNK> list casablanca taxi driver and <UNK> blade among others movies that make you think movies that take you beyond having to think movies that use a story to make their point without trying to <UNK> to you if you think you know deliverance you might but again you might not it really is that good

<START> this complicated western was a <UNK> in the career of james stewart after his return from war service wanting to change his image by doing a western which is largely regarded as the reason for the <UNK> of westerns in the <UNK> since it's very impressive too bad it wasn't photographed in technicolor br br stewart wins first prize for the gun that won the west but then has to spend the rest of the film trying to recover it when it's stolen shelley winters is a shady gal with an <UNK> reputation and stephen <UNK> is the local bad boy <UNK> in dodge city will <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> and dan duryea is <UNK> bad boyfriend and wouldn't you know that it being a universal international film tony curtis and rock hudson both quite unknown at the time have bit roles br br an interesting sequence features the first indian attack <UNK> charles drake reveals himself to be a coward who rides off leaving shelley alone in the horse drawn <UNK> he later <UNK> himself but it's just one of the twists and turns that has the gun passing from one <UNK> hand to another but finally ending up with the <UNK> owner br br stephen <UNK> and james stewart have quite a final shootout that is almost as melodramatic but not quite as duel in the <UNK> blazing guns finale <UNK> makes the perfect villain and dan duryea is equally <UNK> in the kind of villainous role he played throughout the <UNK> as a low life <UNK> br br tightly constructed story is extremely well directed by anthony mann and it's fun to see rock hudson credited as young bull wearing indian war paint and tony curtis as a young soldier who casts longing <UNK> at the then slim and attractive shelley winters br br well worth viewing and definitely an above average story
<START> the ship may have sunk but the movie didn't director james cameron from 'the <UNK> did it again with this amazing picture one of my favorite scenes is 'the dinner <UNK> scene in which <UNK> family and friends meet jack after he saves her rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet 'the <UNK> i hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband br br jack and rose have a connection that is <UNK> <UNK> but it's good movie stuff we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert <UNK> star <UNK> her i really liked the hanging over the boat scene it was a good risk br br the movie is long but it's fantastic good story good flow good actors go see it twice if you want its worth it
<START> from the very beginning i was so excited to see this movie the poster is possibly the funniest i've ever seen for a movie i immediately bought one for my <UNK> this september br br every element came together in this movie so beautifully it's not often you see a movie with so many penis gay and racial jokes so praised by critics carell and the rest of the cast deliver each raunchy joke <UNK> carell remains sweet throughout the entire movie where by the end of the movie you're rooting for him to succeed in his relationship more than you are for him to get laid the supporting cast is brutal each of them having some problems with the ladies themselves br br one of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes we're given this is what makes a movie easy to remember <UNK> this movie will often be brought up when the words chest <UNK> and <UNK> are mentioned in conversation br br watching it in the theater i was surprised how many older people were there to watch it i saw a group of four mid 60s women come in despite an older audience this movie still filled the entire theater with laughter br br i think the type of people who will like this are the fans of the office and steve carell a lot of the jokes remind me of the type of jokes you'd see on family guy too the movie is shallow enough for adolescent boys and still sweet and clever enough for middle aged women br br i don't recommend going to this movie if you aren't a fan of profanity or if you are easily offended however when you are at the movie just remember this movie is all in good humor the jokes aren't gay jokes they're just jokes and they're funny
<START> at one end of the eighties warren beatty created and starred in the <UNK> epic <UNK> about the <UNK> of the soviet union as seen through the eyes of <UNK> radical john reed it was a profound film both entertaining and with a message presented by an all star cast at the end of the decade warren beatty created another kind of epic in dick tracy that makes no <UNK> to being anything other than entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actors around just having a great old time <UNK> it up under tons of makeup br br that both <UNK> and dick tracy could come from the same individual speaks volumes about the range this man has as a player in this film beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them in one original screenplay br br the city's top mobster big boy <UNK> is making a move to really eliminate competition the film opens with him <UNK> out lips <UNK> henchmen in a valentine massacre style shooting and then lips himself being <UNK> for a <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> moves are making him a target for tracy br br in the meantime a third mysterious and <UNK> individual is looking to <UNK> <UNK> himself will our hero sort out this <UNK> of crime br br the spirit of fun this film has is truly <UNK> when people like al pacino dustin hoffman paul sorvino william forsythe r g armstrong get themselves outrageously made up to look like the cartoon creations of strip author <UNK> <UNK> and then <UNK> in an exercise of <UNK> the biggest slice of ham you've got to love this film br br al pacino got a nomination for best supporting actor but any of these guys could have it's only that pacino as big boy <UNK> gets the most screen time only beatty plays it completely straight the others all seem to play off of him dick tracy won oscars for best art set design best song written by stephen <UNK> and introduced by madonna sooner or later the fact he was even able to get somebody like <UNK> to write a score for this film only shows <UNK> wanted to get in on the fun as for madonna the material girl does more than hold her own with all these acting <UNK> as club torch singer breathless <UNK> br br before this film dick tracy movies were <UNK> to the b pictures and worse as saturday afternoon serials the only thing that rivals this all star <UNK> is a radio broadcast done for armed forces radio during world war ii that got to <UNK> can you believe a cast like bing crosby bob hope frank sinatra <UNK> shore jimmy <UNK> judy garland frank morgan and the andrews sisters try and find a recording of that gem br br until then warren <UNK> classic comic strip for the big screen will do nicely
<START> i saw the big bad swim at the 2006 <UNK> film festival and was totally caught off guard by how much i was drawn into it br br the film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class for various reasons a humorous idea in its own right the class serves as a <UNK> for greater changes in the <UNK> lives br br what surprised me about the film was how real it felt rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so well i enjoyed the scenes in the class immensely and the drama that took place outside was very poignant nothing seemed out of place or out of character and ultimately it left a very strong feeling much like attending school or summer camp where you find fast friends form strong bonds and make <UNK> about yourself yet have to <UNK> all too soon br br my only complaint was that the character of paula had a very strong and unusual introduction which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed i suppose you don't get to meet everyone in class though br br aside from this i found the film very well rounded and quite enjoyable see it if you get the opportunity
<START> <UNK> ned kelly been born later he probably would have won a victoria cross at <UNK> such was <UNK> bravery br br in australia and especially country victoria the name ned kelly can be said and immediately <UNK> in greta he is still a hero the life blood of the town of <UNK> depends on the <UNK> he created but in <UNK> they still haven't forgotten that the three policeman that he <UNK> were from there br br many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing from the old melbourne <UNK> where he was <UNK> to the post office he held up in <UNK> a cell he was once held in in greta is on display in <UNK> and the site of ann jones' hotel the station and even the <UNK> where he was captured in <UNK> can be visited br br evidence of all the events in the movie except for his love interest can be found all over victoria in police records and even in the <UNK> that ned was awarded with for <UNK> dick <UNK> from drowning none of this is wrong and whats left out would further justify <UNK> actions the horse that ned <UNK> was actually stolen by wild wright the man who ned boxes with after getting out of jail ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he couldn't have stolen it br br the <UNK> letter is more than what has been stated before it is not self justification it is <UNK> biography an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting so go ahead and read it watch the movie and then make up your mind about what ned stood for
<START> original <UNK> <UNK> pretty good original <UNK> cartoon needs a little work but could be worse but <UNK> and <UNK> together on the fourth of july c'mon give me a break this was one movie that shouldn't have been made it was bad it didn't really go for any holiday in particular except july 4 that made it especially bad since <UNK> and <UNK> are usually associated with the christmas season and any movie can be ruined by too much singing the frequent songs made this movie seem a lot longer than it really was the movie tried mixing two familiar <UNK> characters with an american traditional holiday which almost seems to limit it to america too many pointless songs and a lousy <UNK> the result a bad movie that can't really be watched at any time of year i would suggest you <UNK> this movie even if you like <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> with all the european studios involved in this one you would think you'd at least get some pretty photography but the local color is kept to a minimum br br <UNK> 1 is mira sorvino using a russian accent in order to play a spanish cop wtf the story is hopelessly confused there's a supposed romantic back story that is intentionally confused is she or isn't she a lesbian serving no purpose whatsoever the cops in the movie are the most stupid to have <UNK> a serial killer film in a long time there seems to be some message about the mid <UNK> spanish civil war but since pretty much everybody involved in that is dead one doesn't see the point in it br br despite the bull fighting backdrop of part of the narrative which part who can tell you never even get a good look at a bull fight earnest <UNK> would have <UNK> the director in the nose with my <UNK>
<START> this film tries to be immensely clever and tarantino like br br before you try that though you need solid <UNK> <UNK> these include good sound editing set design etc br br lets talk about the sound in this movie absolutely atrocious i have never been more distracted by a sound track ever br br and before we talk about low budget film made in <UNK> etc lets bear in mind that <UNK> sound these days is far more <UNK> than it ever has been anywhere and more info on technique is available then ever before br br the sound in this movie is plain bad the <UNK> in particular is out of place and inappropriate throughout the <UNK> is equally terrible i heard at least four loud <UNK> during the movie which are the result of poor sound editing the sound inside cars is awful the sound of car doors closing is awful the sound of the lady singing is wrong <UNK> is either overboard or simply not there like the sound person just got bored and gave up the spaces are wrong everything about it is wrong br br and yet not letting limitations of creativity get in the way at the same time the movie tries <UNK> to be clever for example the sound of the <UNK> is used in the following street scene we hear sound when we're not supposed to sound edits <UNK> visual cuts every trick in the book is used and yet the <UNK> are just not there br br editing wise we have scenes using heavy jump cuts we have <UNK> around with the time line etc etc etc yawn all of these techniques are <UNK> to a <UNK> low standard br br overall the mix is crap the sound is crap and so the film is crap how can a movie with so many fundamental flaws be considered for awards and high praise <UNK> cinematic new wave the best creative <UNK> that <UNK> has to offer i hope not and i think not br br my theory is that <UNK> more <UNK> and better talent avoided this film like the plague maybe due to its <UNK> content equally the film has likely received so much <UNK> critical acclaim from so called <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for the same <UNK> reasons they likely <UNK> in it's <UNK> of course film critics rarely pay attention to technical details and quality br br this film is rubbish it's all mouth and no <UNK> and is never deserving of a 6 8 rating the film has all the production quality of a cheap tarantino new wave inspired porno
<START> this movie was laughably bad a friend rented it from netflix and made me watch it there are so many <UNK> and goofs that it's impossible to even bother getting to know the characters and the plot how about these for example br br the <UNK> airport surrounded by palm trees br br ben's miraculously appearing shirt during a phone conversation br br the <UNK> <UNK> office complete with a <UNK> card table desk br br there is a decent story hidden behind a very bad movie but even if you look past the technical flaws you'll find horrid acting and casting i was most <UNK> by the casting of a <UNK> gay actor to play the right wing religious <UNK> brother his opening scene sitting in his <UNK> apartment <UNK> his kitty cat was hilarious br br i applaud the writer director producer editor star <UNK> cast dentist composer and whatever else he did on this move for actually getting a movie like this distributed if you have nothing better to do it could be a fun group movie or even the basis of a drinking game but don't rent it for a powerful story about <UNK> and gay marriage
<START> what an appalling piece of rubbish who are all these people who <UNK> on about how good this is yes it's arty and yes it's foreign but that's not enough the plot is boring and disjointed like a reality show but not so <UNK> made br br the people are <UNK> uninteresting but as characters they don't have enough depth to feel empathy for them if they are based on real people then i feel very very sorry for them br br the violence and some of it is very violent seems quite <UNK> and gratuitous it's like the producer has visions of being <UNK> tarantino not that i think very much of him either br br and oh yes if i had <UNK> like these i'd move
<START> it's interesting how the train of research can flow i started out looking at an article about <UNK> the gates in central park the article stated that the <UNK> had been <UNK> <UNK> for years hmmm then i got to looking at their body of work i believe one of them has passed on but the other is still filming <UNK> and jean claude in their stages of creation grey gardens sounded very interesting video station in <UNK> co is the place to look for the obscure or offbeat and of course they had it in stock dvd and vhs edith and edie are women living in the past and oh what a glorious past it was edith had been well off born a <UNK> married well had several wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was in her forties her daughter edie had been a <UNK> a fashion model and had many <UNK> she never married and at some point in her thirties had come home to <UNK> she seems to have a nervous disorder of some kind worrying too much about things it is only a shadow of the world they live in though because jackie o came and <UNK> up the place so her aunt and cousin would not be <UNK> it is a 28 room mansion that is worn down and worn out but in the film you will notice fresh paint on the walls if you look carefully at the newspaper <UNK> you see it was very much a dirty mess the outfits edie comes up with a very clever and creative the viewer gets the impression that edith likes to go nude but she doesn't in the movie edith was really quite beautiful and you can see the shadow of her beauty still as she sings tea for two edie too was a beauty in her day and quite attractive at <UNK> it was a good movie though not for everyone when the cat is <UNK> behind <UNK> <UNK> she states at least someone is doing what they want
<START> the final pairing of nelson eddy and <UNK> macdonald is basically a complete misfire the script is weak and has been presented badly the film just has no life in it eddy and macdonald would have been better off just making a filmed concert for their final pairing there's nothing wrong with their singing its just everything else in this turkey thats <UNK>
<START> first of all for this movie i just have one word <UNK> this is probably one of the best movies that touched me from it's story to it's performances so wonderfully played by sophia loren and <UNK> mastroianni i was very impressed with this last one because he really brought depth to the character as it was a very hard role still the two of them formed a pair that surprised me from the beginning until the end showing in the way a friendship filled with love that develops during the entire day settled in the movie the story takes some time to roll as the introduction of the characters is long but finally we are <UNK> with a wonderful tale about love and humanity if you have the chance see it because it's a movie that will stay in your mind for many time simply amazing 9 10
<START> has anyone been able to buy this movie my uncle <UNK> was a real not reel pilot who is seen <UNK> his wings in the air and then <UNK> them with his fist as he was awarded his <UNK> wings br br he's only on screen a few seconds but my family would love to have the movie he was killed in a <UNK> over italy he was only 24 at the time do we know the film studio that made it br br or has anyone seen it at a video store like blockbuster i wish they would make entire <UNK> of these old movies available as it is so cheap to make dvd's these days br br please email me at <UNK> <UNK> com if you know where i can buy a copy thank you
<START> i never met a single person out of hundreds who hated this movie bet that anyone who votes it down is a petty <UNK> or a victim of one this film has everything ask yourself are you a fan of then go see laputa br br it's not my favorite movie but my favorite is directed by the same person <UNK> miyazaki in any case this one ranks among my top five and i've seen a lot of movies
<START> i guess i am coming late to the party i just saw this 1995 version of bye bye <UNK> on sky tv i didn't know it existed and was fully prepared to see the 1963 film version when i turned it on br br i played albert a long time ago and i am thinking of putting on an amateur production of the show because i remembered it as being so much fun to do i was not impressed with this newer version it just wasn't enough fun it was not colorful it lacked the <UNK> of youth the lighting was bad no one seemed to mention this fact this is not a moody musical it is bright and up beat the lighting decision was a poor creative choice br br bye bye <UNK> is a farce a comedy of errors i got no sense of that in this version the lighting was awful and it <UNK> the overall performances the dance numbers seemed <UNK> as well we do have music videos these day at least the dance numbers should have <UNK> up to some of the best of those or how about some of the best of broadway the choreographer was asleep at the wheel it seemed br br although all the actors were <UNK> talented there were some really bad casting choices vanessa williams is not latin and with so many talented latin performers out there wouldn't it have been more correct to cast one of them in the role of <UNK> vanessa is african american lovely and talented but bad casting jason <UNK> effort was astounding he always does intelligent work but he just wasn't albert he was miscast and i think that is obvious to most people who see this version br br the medium of film is not the medium of stage there needs to be translation from one medium to another the <UNK> and the flash of stage musical must be translated to film there is no merit being faithful to a stage script when it is being filmed the spirit the essence of the production must be brought forth to me the 1963 film production of bye bye <UNK> was bright and lively while the 1995 production was as gloomy as the lighting and as lackluster as the dance numbers it turned out to be an unfortunate waste of effort by many really talented people
<START> what makes midnight cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which joe buck becomes <UNK> to ratso rizzo through a series of <UNK> that affect them both there really aren't many glimpses of hope in this film for either character but the hard realities that <UNK> them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other br br this film features jon <UNK> finest performance and probably dustin <UNK> as well the rest of the cast is made up of <UNK> though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors including the <UNK> on the bus at the start of the film also for those interested andy <UNK> apprentice paul <UNK> shows up briefly during the party scene br br if you haven't seen this movie it is essential check it out
<START> the good thing about this movie the concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes it also makes you think of those little things in life that could greatly affect the life of someone else without you ever knowing its a small world and this little movie shows us br br the bad thing there are too many characters and its hard to tell who the main character is but its still a great movie br br its a great movie and many people compare it to <UNK> which i haven't seen br br 8 10 br br not rated i would rate it pg 13 for brief violence some language and sexual situations
<START> i saw not so fabulous rating on imdb but i went to see it anyway because i am a big fan of bible related material first thing that bothered me was a little too much indiana jones wannabe movie but it also looked like casper van <UNK> didn't see those jones movies through but he should i believe he tried his best but script just <UNK> music tried to be kinda jones style too great work but for such movie it seemed like too much work like the video part <UNK> deserve all that great music robert wagner gave his best acting skills he did a good job but somehow the script was bringing everything down jokes are old school somewhere 20 years old they brought only <UNK> smile to my face there are some really bad camera angels <UNK> looks like <UNK> and unrealistic kevin <UNK> had probably a good idea on the story in my opinion but i love such stories but things just didn't work out in the end maybe he should put it on a paper when it was still fresh in his head when i in first minutes saw that movie was going to be one of those <UNK> budget <UNK> i hoped that i will at least <UNK> a good story but sometimes movies just disappoint
<START> i see a lot of movies saw the original <UNK> years ago and loved it computers where still a big mystery for the most of us and the movie was convincing in it's own way br br this one however looks like a low budget <UNK> night special total crap from start to finish br br the plot is so weak you won't believe it until you see the movie which i would not recommend in the first place i can not point out one actor that actually did a good job in this movie but hey with that script i would've been surprised if anyone could do a good job acting lots of cliché scenes cgi looks like it's taken out of the <UNK> version br br <UNK> no i'm getting in a bad mood just writing about this do not watch this movie br br life's to short to waste it on watching crappy movies
<START> one of the best comedians ever i've seen this show about 10 times and will probably watch it at least 100 more my friends and family quote from this dvd so often you'd think we did nothing other than watch it the beginning part about <UNK> is a little bit slow but either <UNK> through it or <UNK> on through to the part where eddie is on stage watch for the cake or death part joking about the church of england and the hitler <UNK> pot part hard to explain just watch it the best part of the show may be <UNK> facial expressions he can really say a lot with his eyes <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> probably help huh fair warning eddie does have a tendency to throw a lot of four letter words in
<START> an excellent performance by <UNK> <UNK> highlights an otherwise <UNK> directed and confused pile of dreck i have seen this movie perhaps 12 times and with each run through i find less and less pleasure why are <UNK> so <UNK> is that ever explained are they a reflection of our <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ' if they are why not make it more obvious why not <UNK> back just a touch of the subtlety that <UNK> this movie and make that connection explicit another part of this movie that bothers me to no end <UNK> the jacket the little monster wears on the front cover seems to suggest <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the sun glasses say <UNK> cool dude ' with all this i'm ready for easy rider meets the muppets all i get is <UNK> 1987 what gives stick to the <UNK> series if you're a fan of <UNK> wise cracking <UNK> puppets it'll give you the treatment you deserve
<START> i was one of quite a few extras in this big bomb i just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at a i r as it was know as back then thank goodness my scene in in the first few minutes of the movie and i don't have to sit through the whole thing it was more of a big party than a movie set but hey the pay was good attention to detail was not a strong point for this one but who was going to know the funny thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie <UNK> up to the what was close to normal speed a lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed i suppose to <UNK> cost and time but every one was having such a good time who cared
<START> a compelling honest daring and unforgettable psychological horror film that touches on the painful experiences of pain caused by rape descent is a film that went under the radar due to its lack of distribution because frankly the film is so brutal in its depictions that if it had been released <UNK> it may have met itself to some strong biased hate br br the film deserves to be discovered for not only its dark themes and not only for its amazing direction and authentic style but most of all for its performances <UNK> <UNK> is absolutely stunning bringing enough sickness and enough vulnerability to make one not relate to but understand this <UNK> man with a twisted perspective on his sexuality with not only the women he rapes but also the fragile <UNK> deep within his own self it's a supporting performance that is so complex brave and emotional on <UNK> part and hard to forget br br however the standout is rosario dawson whose performance here is an absolute revelation a tour de force of realistic dramatic <UNK> and one of the most subtle yet loud as can be performances in quite some time while dawson is seen in some good supporting performances in some great to bad films she proves here she has what it takes to deliver some emotionally sweeping and moving performances <UNK> and <UNK> br br one of the best films of its year and 2007 was a strong one had this underrated and intelligent film hit theatrical release i would be screaming <UNK> for it as well as dawson and <UNK> too bad it was way too blunt for a <UNK> appeal films like this deserve better
<START> an angry boy who has <UNK> lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather together they find common ground in the <UNK> folk tales which have been passed down <UNK> from generation to generation of <UNK> although tragic episodes such as the <UNK> <UNK> feature in the stories there is a surprising amount of humour and <UNK> in them it's all filmed in <UNK> so there is a double dose of beauty the mountain scenery is breathtaking and it's a rare chance to hear scottish <UNK> spoken i'm english so i had to read the subtitles but the sound of spoken <UNK> is nonetheless wonderful the performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen non actors in other words you are watching the real thing people who care deeply about <UNK> <UNK> and history the <UNK> community especially on <UNK> worked <UNK> minor <UNK> to make this film anyone who has the slightest interest in <UNK> folk history folk music <UNK> culture scotland british history multi <UNK> or social justice should go and see this film
<START> this movie was seriously awful the acting was the worst it was worse than a student film super cheesy and i think the worst actor was the old lady at first i thought to myself well it's an old movie then i remembered that that is no excuse i've seen older movies with way better acting and such br br the music was terrible to it was really choppy the editing was poor most of the dialog was out of sync br br overall this movie doesn't even deserve a 1 i only watched it because i was so bored and the movie hardly entertained me it was just laughable my dead <UNK> left <UNK> toe could make a better movie than this
<START> when this film plays on television you might want to save about 90 minutes of your time and change the channel there's nothing special here that you need to see story is about two married couples from <UNK> who go on a trip together to reno couple number one is <UNK> earl <UNK> billy bob <UNK> who is a car dealer and having problems with his marriage his wife is <UNK> natasha richardson and she has a low self opinion of herself and they haven't been intimate in a long time <UNK> has been sleeping with candy <UNK> <UNK> who is the wife of his best friend roy <UNK> patrick <UNK> they all drive to reno and the four of them stay in one <UNK> <UNK> roy and candy have been trying to have a baby and finally candy discovers that she is pregnant but roy phones his doctor in <UNK> and finds out that he's <UNK> candy and <UNK> admit their affair and now the whole trip is in chaos this film is directed by jordan brady and he's made a few other low budget films but this is his first with a cast this impressive unfortunately brady doesn't show much comedic flair but you can't lay all the blame on him this script is just not funny and one of the glaring problems is that the characters are all written down to a sitcom level just because they're all from the south doesn't mean that they have to be naive and idiotic <UNK> character doesn't have the sophistication to tip the <UNK> more than a dollar and <UNK> character is called stupid and dumb by everyone throughout the film and one of the rare good moments comes when he asks everyone to lay off of him for at least one day penelope <UNK> pops up as a prostitute and it's a totally worthless and pointless cameo she barely speaks more than 3 or 4 lines i think she was fulfilling an <UNK> to harvey and bob <UNK> who are executive producers for this film the only person who actually isn't to bad is richardson we watch her become more confident in herself but this <UNK> in the film is very obvious and cliche all of these actors should know better and it's hard to figure that they all read the script and liked it it's a complete waste of time for these actors but at least they got paid as for the viewers your not getting paid so skip this one
<START> i can't say this is the worst movie ever made but personally i think of it that way because when it was originally released in theaters 1 the initial buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted we go see it and we actually stood in line to get tickets and 2 it's still the only serious film i recall where the audience started <UNK> at a certain point and basically laughed at the movie the rest of the way through once we reached the infamous and interminable snake fight scene i think everyone gave up br br the only positive i can <UNK> is the lush location shooting oh and there's also <UNK> breasts although her acting is so wooden that the nudity is <UNK> and doesn't rate much more than a playboy <UNK> br br the dramatic tension in this film is between <UNK> terrible acting and her husband's horrible direction the snake fight has to be one of the most incompetent action sequences ever filmed however this is one of those films that's bad enough it may be worth watching on the level of unintentional humor definitely the worst film i ever paid to see
<START> i have rarely been subjected to such outright nonsense in a film that is supposed to be based on a historical figure a horrible joke of a film i <UNK> throughout terrible trite distorted and <UNK> with outright lies and half truths br br the famous hitler <UNK> ian <UNK> was to originally be a <UNK> for this film however he found the script to be so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused and also <UNK> they stop using his name as a source it embarrassed him to think people would think he was involved br br one scene shows hitler beating his dog there is not one source for this hitler loved animals above people he brought in the <UNK> animal <UNK> laws in europe banned <UNK> and animal <UNK> he was also a <UNK> br br the film turns his gaining of the iron cross into a farce involving <UNK> utter lies he was awarded it for repeated acts of bravery over a long period of time br br there are no historical documents showing that hitler ever had a sexual relationship with his niece not one br br apart from these hitler is portrayed as a <UNK> <UNK> in this garbage flick br br if he was even half as ignorant demented and thick as he is in this nonsense film as in real life you would not even know he had ever existed never mind become the leader of germany br br honestly this film was utterly terrible br br go watch downfall and give this a very wide <UNK>
<START> i just went to a screening of the film during <UNK> en <UNK> a short film festival in <UNK> mexico one of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction the film rolled and from the first shot i was amazed one long continuous shot of a futuristic paris in glorious black and white br br i shouldn't go on with the details 'cause i think it is a film worth seeing the sci fi story might be found average for many to me was really good the action is great the camera is free to fly everywhere and i mean everywhere things you would not be able to do or see is accomplished beautifully the cast performance is good in my opinion no one hits the wrong note br br now the thing that i found awesome is the animation 3d <UNK> look <UNK> a <UNK> comic book brought to life the details on the backgrounds gives more <UNK> as if it had been done by hand i'm sure it was but when the angles change you see the depth br br the producer at the screening talked about the hard work behind the film 7 years the director she said is brilliant but perhaps he was quite <UNK> since he only had one short film in his <UNK> so many people had true faith in them they started their own studio from scratch and ever since they faced the challenge they brought upon them br br don't miss it i think you won't regret it maybe richard <UNK> for the final look of this film is superior to his i think
<START> without kirsten miller this project <UNK> have been completed however with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is miss miller i would definitely recommend it it looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance <UNK> dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing but his few scenes didn't detract from being entertained mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of <UNK> what should have been a disaster the charismatic miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable she plays that fine line between <UNK> and <UNK> but never offensive she is in fact the <UNK> engineer she claims to be i wish i had seen this on the big screen but alas i was fortunate to rent it before it was lost
<START> may 1938 hitler in italy <UNK> for historical <UNK> with <UNK> emotions tensions and forms of self <UNK> a empty town a housewife and a journalist the meeting of two different worlds <UNK> for a mother with a sad life short filling for a classical victim a story about <UNK> and silence about the form of of life's <UNK> and desire like <UNK> form the great character a book gifted in a <UNK> afternoon this movie is a poem remarkable for the art to describe the shades of common loneliness a <UNK> for a <UNK> relation with reality and with your interior world the pictures of <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> the patience and the <UNK> tension of <UNK> the art of director to give the sense of script grace two great actors makes this film sublime <UNK> of subtle <UNK> a wonderful film about <UNK> and <UNK> verdict about essence of life and <UNK> of any <UNK> loren and mastroianni are the masters of a magnificent intelligent acting a clear masterpiece
<START> at first i didn't think that ben affleck could really pull off a funny christmas movie boy was i wrong my daughter invited me to watch this with her and i was not disappointed at all james gandolfini was funny i really liked christina <UNK> and catherine <UNK> <UNK> was good too the storyline is what really sold me i mean too put up with family at the table for people you only hardly see but once or twice a year and probably don't get along with anyway you really do need as much alcohol as you're system can stand to deal with christmas so i thought that the premise was good there buying the family with <UNK> dollars was a little on the far fetched side but it turned out to work pretty good for me cause it was a riot all the way through it shows the class struggle of the different families it has <UNK> of funny moments including embarrassing stuff on the computer for a teenage boy all in all i loved this movie and will watch it again next christmas or sooner if my daughter wants too
<START> yep you read that right kids michael bay should've studied this film before making either of his over hyped overlong overly pointless transformers movies robot <UNK> is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the transformers crew spent on <UNK> <UNK> personal <UNK> br br thankfully this little robotic gem initially known mainly for being the film that <UNK> charles and albert <UNK> empire pictures studio seems to have developed a cult following over the years i <UNK> remember watching it on vhs during its initial video release in the early 90s and though some of the cold war era politics stereotypes were already out of date by that time just the <UNK> luck that communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be released eh it's still a pretty damn cool little b movie they really don't <UNK> like this anymore or if they do they go the bay route and cgi things to unbearable proportions br br for those who are unfamiliar here's the <UNK> scoop we're somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust large scale wars have been <UNK> <UNK> between nations are now settled <UNK> a <UNK> or perhaps that should be machine o machine o by one representative from each side battling each other in giant sized <UNK> warrior style robots <UNK> <UNK> walks away from the fight wins for his side gary graham who would later go on to play detective sykes in the alien nation tv series plays <UNK> the greatest robot jock in <UNK> a k a the good guys history <UNK> has been <UNK> in his previous nine robot <UNK> ten being the maximum number of battles before a jock is retired and at the beginning of the film he faces off against his counterpart from the <UNK> i e the <UNK> the psychotic alexander who is the most over the top evil russian stereotype bad guy since dolph <UNK> infamous turn as <UNK> <UNK> in rocky iv the match is called a draw when alexander <UNK> the rules with an illegal robot move at the last minute and ends up not only embarrassing <UNK> but killing a whole bunch of <UNK> in the bargain a <UNK> is <UNK> to complete the bout but <UNK> simply wants to bow out hang up his helmet and move on with his life rather than <UNK> the spoiler rules by revealing much more i will simply say that there are a great deal of twists and turns behind the scenes <UNK> and other difficulties for <UNK> and his fellow <UNK> before the two robotic <UNK> clash finally once again in the finale br br i hope i'm not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction because it isn't robot <UNK> is just plain fun i'll grant that it is a bit higher concept than your average b grade sci fi movie and though the <UNK> constraints do occasionally make themselves known especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious green screen <UNK> it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the empire full moon pictures factory the robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motion model techniques and the sets and costumes don't look half <UNK> in the slightest empire pictures and director stuart re animator gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture unfortunately it didn't quite pan out for them or the studio but at least we got one <UNK> cool little movie out of the deal bottom line if you want to be <UNK> and visually <UNK> for 2 hours feel free to rent a transformers movie by the end you're likely to feel like you've spent all that time watching someone else play a video game if you want to have a <UNK> <UNK> robot good time pick up robot <UNK> instead
<START> kalifornia is disturbing i believe there is no reason for this story to be told it is neither entertaining nor does it have social value technically the movie is very well make the performances are top rate and first class the story develops in an intriguing way that holds interest but at the end this movie <UNK> and is <UNK> to decency i recommend kalifornia to no one
<START> of course the average sci fi battle star <UNK> fan will hate this that kind of makes me happy i don't like those cheesy sci fi shows especially battle star <UNK> and that is why i like this show br br the creators of the show got a lot of heat for making this the unconventional sci fi way and it was worth it i read on <UNK> that they wanted to appeal to everybody including women and not just sci fi <UNK> br br this is probably the most promising show since lost it has the most interesting clever and deepest script of any show in some time and it is truly unique br br what i love most about the show is that it kind of plays out like a great anime from young teens running around shooting guns to and extremely well balanced and complex script to robots it reminds me of something that came from japan except a little bit better most anime is too confusing
<START> the <UNK> professor types thought they had it all figured out today's peoples who inhabit <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> moving from the far east island to island <UNK> into <UNK> and all the other exotic <UNK> <UNK> of the south pacific over thousands of years but the established thinking just didn't sit well with young norwegian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> if that explanation were true how come some folks born and <UNK> in those islands have traditions artwork and physical features resembling not those from asia but south america how can the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> look so much like what you'd find on the island several thousand miles away is it just a coincidence that the <UNK> point out to sea in the direction of south america and say that is where their <UNK> came from led by <UNK> their equivalent of adam meanwhile how is it <UNK> speak of <UNK> <UNK> who were chased from the south american continent they had <UNK> and together with some of the native peoples they <UNK> set off over the sea heading west it's all too much to be a coincidence to <UNK> with an amazing amount of <UNK> a handful of <UNK> and the local know how for traditional raft building an expedition begins it's as much a trip into the human imagination as it is a pseudo scientific <UNK> that such a journey is possible with only the very <UNK> of tools and <UNK> the oscar winning documentary may be dated in its tone and <UNK> <UNK> approach but it <UNK> with a spirit of adventure <UNK> even the space program that launched a decade later as men are willing to risk it all to test a theory they think is true wonderful do yourself a favor and read the book first it is an amazing page turner and the perfect setup for the <UNK> style movie
<START> a small time hood tricks the local mob boss out of a lot of money of course the mob boss wants his money back and doesn't care who he has to kill to get it the punk <UNK> his friend and an old mobster to help him save his life br br if this sounds ridiculous it is the whole idea that this <UNK> wearing <UNK> <UNK> driving punk could hold off one of the most powerful <UNK> in rome is just plain silly his friend may be good with a gun but he's up against a group of trained killers the old mobster is little more than comic relief and no real help when it comes to the face off with the mob there's also a sub plot about how the friend's father was killed years ago by the mob boss but there's little made of it and it doesn't help the movie any at all br br the mob boss mister scarface is played by jack palance i suppose he got the name because he has what looks like a <UNK> nick on his cheek palance is as <UNK> as the rest of the cast doing what he must to get a paycheck br br i've seen some pretty good italian crime cop flicks recently but mister scarface isn't one of them check out <UNK> <UNK> or revolver instead
<START> terry gilliam gives a stunning movie which i thoroughly enjoyed bruce willis <UNK> <UNK> brad pitt and even the small appearance of <UNK> plummer makes the movie absolutely brilliant this is the only terry gilliam film i've seen and twelve monkeys is definitely in my top 10 i think this is one of the four best bruce willis movies and brad <UNK> best brad pitt delivers a perfect performance possibly one of the ten best actor's performance that i've ever seen he played his role geoffrey very convincingly bruce <UNK> role james cole was also quite convincing both bruce willis and brad pitt acted extraordinarily well with the brilliant story to back the great performances and to back that up terry <UNK> superb directing
<START> not one of the better pokemon movies br br two legendary pokemon come into the story you do get to see how strong <UNK> can be though he turns evil first br br <UNK> also makes an appearance he didn't seem that powerful br br the <UNK> didn't have many strong pokemon at all except for that <UNK> some fight scenes with his pokemon may have made it better br br ash and <UNK> meet the much younger professor <UNK> though they don't realise it misty i was thinking had it at the end but she didn't get close i saw this in the credits br br don't expect much here the worst of the series so far
<START> practically the only other actor who would be less likely to play <UNK> <UNK> than hamilton is anthony <UNK> yet somehow hamilton manages to turn in a reasonably effective portrayal and as producer of the film he wasn't likely to be fired or told he wasn't right for the part the early life of the <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> here in multiple flashbacks the film opens with a rather silly prologue with hamilton in his white leather star <UNK> gear <UNK> the world according to <UNK> as if to say don't worry this film is about my youth but i'll be back in my familiar costume by the end of the picture hamilton is preparing for a huge jump yet is still <UNK> his wounds from the previous one as devoted wife <UNK> both supports and <UNK> him he recalls various vignettes of his childhood and <UNK> teenage years along with his early days as a stunt rider and <UNK> celebrity this flip flop approach is pretty abrupt and sometimes disjointed but it does prevent the movie from sticking to one of its <UNK> sets for too long a time or from getting into a <UNK> with the fairly pedestrian characters hamilton usually a suave and <UNK> persona does a very fine job of <UNK> the tiny details of his <UNK> mannerisms and demeanor including his walk his hair is a <UNK> lighter and longer and he works hard to give the right <UNK> in his speaking he even pays minor tribute to <UNK> many <UNK> by appearing in a skimpy <UNK> while his shoulders are covered in <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he looks nothing like the real <UNK> but he does suggest him in his physical performance <UNK> is excellent at playing the young girl he loves and then the more <UNK> wife though her 3 pack a day voice does <UNK> to give her away at any given moment she and hamilton strike up an easy chemistry which goes a long way in putting the film over other nice supporting turns are given by freed as his jaded doctor cameron as an early influence and taylor as a flea bitten <UNK> barker the film was made on a low budget but the story is a rather low rent one anyway so that doesn't affect it too badly the makers wisely used actual <UNK> montana locations to give the film a proper small town ambiance several of <UNK> antics are amusing though the character is certainly reckless and <UNK> of other people's property some of the real <UNK> completed and failed stunts are included in some <UNK> footage one of which features a mind <UNK> splatter in which the man is rolled up and <UNK> around like a <UNK> doll <UNK> then wife stewart appears briefly as a nurse
<START> <UNK> it's fake the whole thing is a fake there is no ghosts or zombies alan is a lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like that wants the castle and his title for himself so he <UNK> this overly complicated and needless pointless plan ala scooby doo to drive alan to commit suicide most of the movie is him picking up <UNK> and attacking them he's not even killing them he drops off to sleep and the girl <UNK> and he thinks he buried them <UNK> if he looked at the so called ghost of evelyn he could tell she was wearing <UNK> my god what a waste of time don't bother watching it renting and if you bought it and haven't watched it yet sell it quickly do yourself a favor and stay away from the night evelyn came out of the grave i give this stinker the crap o <UNK>
<START> when i looked at this years <UNK> match card i was so <UNK> and unable to control myself because i was full of excitement br br it starts and it ends br br i'm sitting there angry to hell because of how much i wanted my money back i mean you watch <UNK> 22 one of my favorites which will go down as a classic and then you expect the same and get the average garbage they have every now and then the one moment in the entire show that ruined it for me was when <UNK> <UNK> out that very moment of <UNK> losing to john cena john cena is such a loser <UNK> it almost ruined <UNK> 22 for me when he beat triple h i couldn't watch wwe after seeing <UNK> 23 i'm starting to watch it again luckily i again have faith in wwe after <UNK> 24 the greatest i have ever seen which was a pure classic <UNK> it definitely made up for <UNK> 23 and gave us lots of memorable moments as well br br if you have watched any of the <UNK> before this one like the ones that turn you into fans <UNK> 20 turned me into a fan please don't watch this and make the same mistake i made and leave wwe behind and if you do watch it and are angry start watching it again and watch <UNK> 24 it is absolutely classic
<START> paul grace <UNK> are my husbands grandparents they were both deceased when we met so watching old movies is a good way to see them and their work i have always enjoyed old movies and was very happy to discover that this was also a very good one
<START> in today's world of digital <UNK> there is no computer than can replace the actor and writer alas this type of character driven film is far too rare these days <UNK> performance as well as james earl jones are faithful to their audience's high expectations i wonder if this movie was made for tv it has a close up personal quality to the narrative it is an understatement to say that the performances are all outstanding the only thing that keeps it from being a cinema masterpiece is the lack of a great cinematographer but pretty pictures are not everything how can talent the likes of jones and duvall continue to produce such fine work in an age where actors pose for the <UNK>
<START> this movie may be the worst movie i have ever seen basically it is right above <UNK> 5 the only difference is that it missing ice t the scene where he does the chick with the <UNK> priceless oh yeah they made a second one genius
<START> i would not have known about this film if not for its surprise oscar nomination for best animated feature film thankfully it came to pass that i was able to watch this animated little treasure br br the story is about the child brendan who was the nephew of the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> of kells the main pre <UNK> of the <UNK> is to build a wall to protect kells from the attacking <UNK> one day <UNK> the renowned <UNK> from <UNK> sought <UNK> with them <UNK> opens <UNK> eyes to the art of <UNK> and the lure of the outside world along the way brendan <UNK> the white forest <UNK> <UNK> as he sought to recover an ancient crystal <UNK> to the <UNK> art of book <UNK> br br the secret of kells is unlike most of the animation released these days it is a <UNK> of sorts as the <UNK> are done in stark <UNK> lines and design without much care for realism as much as symbolism the movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplistic yet fluid animation style used at the beginning sequence of kung fu <UNK> however it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of <UNK> for the audience the <UNK> used in the <UNK> invasion sequence is <UNK> haunting br br try to catch this quiet gem of a film it is a welcome <UNK> from all the senseless <UNK> of current animated fare such as monsters vs aliens and the like the sparse <UNK> musical score is effective in <UNK> the sense of fantasy that <UNK> the film ok the story might be a little shallow and the ending a bit wanting i would have liked to know more about the book that brendan and <UNK> was working on but the clear star of this film is clearly its amazing stylized artwork said to be based on the artwork in the real book of kells
<START> nice character development in a pretty cool <UNK> being a male i'm probably not <UNK> to totally understand it but they do a nice job of establishing the <UNK> victorian environment from the start it isn't as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even <UNK> what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters each has their own thing that they <UNK> with once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider <UNK> they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion what i enjoyed about this movie is that it didn't go for cheap comedy when it could have it didn't try to pound a lesson into us the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light i did have a little trouble with the alfred <UNK> character having such an <UNK> so quickly but within this world it needed to happen good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people
<START> how she moves springs to life only when its high energy talented cast members are kicking up their heels and <UNK> their stuff for the camera otherwise this stale <UNK> suffer and succeed story is low on energy low on originality and low on anything that might make the movie stand out from the dozens of other <UNK> films that have come before it br br <UNK> wesley has modest appeal as the <UNK> gifted inner city <UNK> who finds that the best way to raise her private school <UNK> money is by entering step dance <UNK> but both she and her fellow actors are poorly served by uninspired screen writing and <UNK> direction as noted earlier the movie achieves some spark when the performers are up on stage dancing but such moments are far too few and sadly fleeting
<START> may contain spoilers br br the titular topless heroine <UNK> another beautiful babe and her father an eccentric professor whose stock <UNK> helmet is broken in one shot and whole in the next from a <UNK> eaten dime store mummy and nasty nazis out to what else build a fourth <UNK> <UNK> costume like those of some other <UNK> gets <UNK> as the movie rolls on the last portion of the movie is devoted to <UNK> lesbian action this footage actually gets real boring real fast which says more about the <UNK> behind the camera than the <UNK> creatures in front of it misty gets its <UNK> plot out of the way first and fast then gives <UNK> attention to nudity and soft core sex this makes mummy <UNK> a <UNK> to movies made in the 1960s by guys like stan <UNK> david f <UNK> and harry novak just think if this wonder work had been <UNK> out four decades ago it would have played for years on <UNK> street along with <UNK> <UNK> thank you <UNK> and kiss me quick as it is misty <UNK> mummy <UNK> went straight to home video grab yours quick before it goes out of print
<START> as a big fan of david <UNK> films and plays especially his first film house of games that also starred joe <UNK> i was expecting great things from this film instead i found myself annoyed by the film's <UNK> and lack of credibility racial <UNK> are thrown about without any feeling or meaning behind them in the hopes of setting up a racial tension that for me never <UNK> identity is totally <UNK> and men become heroes for no apparent reason because of his <UNK> taken as a cop the lead character <UNK> refuses to perform one relatively small action that would harm no one and could possibly save lives and yet performs another action which is very violent and very illegal but then still refuses the minor action in addition a highly unbelievable subplot involving a man who has killed his family is introduced just for the sake of a plot point that was all but advertised with <UNK> and the <UNK> reaction to that <UNK> stretch <UNK> way beyond all reasonable limits needless to say after expecting another exciting thriller from david mamet i was extremely disappointed to say the least 3 out of 10
<START> this ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of hamlet to ever reach the screen branagh's approach to the material can only be described as vulgar going to such <UNK> as depicting <UNK> in a straight jacket having <UNK> army appear suddenly on the horizon looking very much like the climax of monty python and the holy grail when the palace is apparently <UNK> only by francisco who shouts the very un shakespearean cry of <UNK> before being <UNK> down and <UNK> of star cameos that <UNK> back to the days of jimmy <UNK> bottom and mary <UNK> kate br br branagh chose to set his film in an <UNK> setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly <UNK> in <UNK> mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed and branagh does not concern himself with such <UNK> subtleties as the ambiguous nature of hamlet and <UNK> relationship treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that <UNK> any ambiguity right out the <UNK> glass window br br the uncut text does allow branagh to <UNK> in his favorite cinematic <UNK> more footage of kenneth branagh this is never so apparent as in the how all occasions inform against me speech that ends the first half of the <UNK> hour film at least that's how it feels which attempts to play to a dramatic <UNK> along the lines of gone with the <UNK> i'll never be hungry again this may serve branagh's ego but it does not serve shakespeare or the speech when i saw the film in the theater i <UNK> over to my companion and <UNK> great moments with mr hamlet branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last when he attempts to out do the olivier film and its <UNK> celebrated death of <UNK> by having hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the <UNK> <UNK> him with a sword branagh's <UNK> does in the king by <UNK> throwing an apparently magic <UNK> from across the palace to run through <UNK> heart with a super hero's <UNK> eye the only thing that saved the moment from being <UNK> <UNK> was that it was so off the wall funny br br while this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy it is in fact nothing but a star <UNK> display of a once talented filmmaker being <UNK> by his own <UNK> the emperor has no clothes and this hamlet has nothing to offer but a few <UNK> laughs and the appalling sight of one man's ego out of control
<START> what the <UNK> is it with this movie couldn't they fiend a better script all in all a <UNK> movie but it has been done more than once up till the end i thought it was okay but the going back to the past part <UNK> so corny was waiting for the fairy god mother to appear but wow that didn't happen which is good br br i loved big with tom hanks but to see such a movie in a new form with another kid who wished that he she is older bigger that just is so <UNK> br br just watch till it comes out on tv don't get me wrong but it ain't all that
<START> if another hitler ever <UNK> it will be thanks in part to nonsense like this film which <UNK> the absurd notion that he was a <UNK> deranged lunatic from the start far from following such a person and <UNK> him to the highest office in the land sane people would cross the street to avoid him and he would have died in a <UNK> <UNK> and unknown br br anyone who reads the accounts of hitler's close companions the autobiography of his secretary <UNK> <UNK> for instance will be struck by the fact that people found him a kindly intelligent generous man he was also a brilliant <UNK> and the fact that his speeches seem overblown and <UNK> to modern ears ignores the times in which they were made when <UNK> <UNK> was common in political speeches <UNK> the <UNK> anti <UNK> which was neither a central <UNK> of the early nazis who were primarily anti communist nor <UNK> or unusual for the times the film makes it look as though hitler's sole ambition from the start was the holocaust br br if you want to identify the next person who will cause the death of <UNK> of millions you can ignore <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> life the one portrayed here look instead for a charming charismatic man whose compelling speeches inspire the entire nation and whose political work <UNK> and <UNK> benefits the country i'm afraid his personality will be much more like <UNK> <UNK> than fred <UNK> br br i hoped for much here and got nothing but caricature the fools who made this thing <UNK> a crime against reality this is the historical equivalent of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this film surprised me a little i watch a lot of horror sci fi films and this is a straight to video release that caught me off guard a little i believe this is full <UNK> best movie thus far and one of jeffrey combs best performances good movie
<START> director star clint eastwood's sudden impact is an intriguing addition to the dirty harry series a combination of crude film making and genius it's mediocre and silly in parts brilliant and classic in others with compelling gripping pacing there are numerous echoes of the first film here the shoot 'em up make my day scene recalls the do you feel lucky one one of the villains is as <UNK> <UNK> as the first film's <UNK> an actor who played a minor baddie in the first one returns here as harry's partner just to name a few br br harry callahan is still at odds with the higher ups in the department still mean still tough but now he's older and <UNK> his constant conflicts with his superiors are a metaphor for his inner conflict a respect and <UNK> for the law versus a desire to serve the pure spirit of justice the two things not always being <UNK> this <UNK> is the underlying theme of the series the first film <UNK> a simple question what about the <UNK> rights do they <UNK> those of the criminal vice versa depends that film's answer was controversial <UNK> a sequel the highly enjoyable <UNK> force which set out to draw the line between harry's brand of justice and pure heartless <UNK> dirty harry like many of <UNK> other roles is the <UNK> of vengeance the <UNK> of the the <UNK> this movie however brings it back to the victim in this case jennifer portrayed by sondra locke who decides to avenge the rape of herself and her now <UNK> sister by <UNK> hunting down and <UNK> <UNK> the men and one woman who committed the crime br br without going into a play by play of the whole movie i will say this i mentioned earlier that sudden impact echoes the first film it actually also <UNK> in little references and in jokes from the whole series the confusion concerning the <UNK> last name is an example an intentional prank i believe the relationship between callahan and jennifer is neat has our rogue cop hero found a soul mate in this lady vigilante and is she a vigilante or a victim <UNK> standing up for her and her sister's <UNK> rights the exchange between these two at the very end of the film is a poetic denouement of the series one which i personally as a fan found quite moving that last scene alone makes sudden impact the legitimate climax to the dirty harry collection the perfect answer to the conflict <UNK> in the first film not to knock the dead pool that excellent movie was a relatively light hearted suspenseful yet comic thriller featuring harry callahan rather than a character defining film like this one br br this movie did well in the theaters audiences in the reagan era found harry and his <UNK> quite appealing and the president himself frequently <UNK> go ahead make my day
<START> freddy's dead the final nightmare 1991 was the last film to feature freddy krueger as a solo act not as an <UNK> or a co star the years of killing have taken a <UNK> upon the town of <UNK> it has gotten to the point that the little city has become a virtual ghost town the parents who killed freddy krueger so many years ago have all paid the ultimate price only the mad inhabit the town and the survivors are scattered everywhere but that doesn't stop freddy from seeking out his final revenge no matter how they try to stop him he always comes back for more but this time he finds out a little more about his old life can the kids finally stop freddy for good what is this secret that is buried in freddy's twisted mind to find out you'll have to watch freddy's dead the end was originally filmed in 3 d br br a fitting way to end the franchise freddy learns something about himself and his perverted life and he gets to go out in a bang lisa zane <UNK> <UNK> and freddy krueger star in this final installment <UNK> tom arnold and johnny <UNK> make special appearances a whole lot better than the last one but it's filled with a few dated jokes if you enjoy the series then you don't want to miss out on this one br br i have to recommend this movie for freddy fans
<START> guys and dolls is a unique play based on the characters sky masterson br br marlon brando is a high class <UNK> who takes up a bet with nathan detroit frank sinatra for one thousand dollars nathan needs the money so he can br br run his usual crap game and make a fortune the bet was that sky wouldn't be able to take just any girl to <UNK> cuba and the doll he chose was sarah br br brown jean simmons who was in charge of a <UNK> sky finally <UNK> br br sarah enough to go to <UNK> with him they end up falling in love with each other but later she <UNK> him of something he had no part in nathan ran a crap game in the <UNK> the night they were gone <UNK> 14 year fiancé <UNK> vivian <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> gambling and tries to stop him from doing it however when the movie ends it all ends happy with a double br br wedding br br the songs in this movie are just wonderful no matter who sings it marlon br br brando has no singing voice at all and true they could have dubbed him but it didn't really matter he did a wonderful acting job obviously seeing as it's brando and played his character very well i have seen a few movies with jean simmons and thought that this movie was her weakest one she also couldn't br br sing at all however the singing is made up by frank sinatra <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> was also in the original br br broadway production of guys and dolls <UNK> <UNK> had a terrific voice and was the perfect <UNK> if you like musical and even if you don't i advise you to watch this
<START> we know that <UNK> and rescue workers are heroes an <UNK> <UNK> few would challenge friends and family of these and others who <UNK> in the attacks on the world trade center might well be moved by this vapid play turned film a sweet earnest though tongue tied <UNK> recalls what he can of lost colleagues to a <UNK> journalist who <UNK> his <UNK> into a <UNK> they <UNK> the results he <UNK> some more she <UNK> another <UNK> etc etc br br the dreadful events that <UNK> the need for several thousand <UNK> is <UNK> sad but this plodding insipid <UNK> is <UNK> boring
<START> matthau and lemmon are at their very best in this one everyone else in the movie are also great the dialogue is excellent and very very witty and the scene where <UNK> character attempts to clear out his <UNK> in a restaurant have me rolling on the floor with laughter every time i see it anyone who happened to see the not so great sequel should not be turned away from the original i recommend this wonderful movie to everyone i just love it and the fact the jack lemmon plays his character so straight forward with tragic overtones only adds to the <UNK> in my opinion these two great guys made a string of movies together but this one is the best no doubt
<START> coming immediately on the heels of match point 2005 a fine if somewhat self repetitive piece of serious woody scoop gives new hope to allen's small but die hard band of followers among whom i number myself that the master has once again found his form a string of disappointing efforts culminating in the dreary melinda and melinda 2004 and the embarrassing anything else 2003 raised serious doubts that another first rate woody comedy with or without his own participation as an actor was in the cards happily the cards turn out to be a <UNK> deck that serves as <UNK> clever <UNK> and <UNK> an optimistic reading for the future of woody allen comedy br br even more <UNK> <UNK> self casting sadly one of the weakest elements of his films in recent years is here an inspired bit of self parody as well as a humble recognition at last that he can no longer play romantic leads with women young enough to be his daughters or <UNK> in scoop allen <UNK> <UNK> himself the role of sid <UNK> an aging magician with cheap tricks and tired stage <UNK> who much like woody himself has brought his act to london where audiences if not more <UNK> are at least more polite like <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> sid <UNK> <UNK> allen the opportunity to don the slightly distorted mask of an artist whose art has <UNK> and whose audience is no longer large or <UNK> moreover because they seem in character allen's <UNK> and prolonged <UNK> are less distracting here than they have been in some time br br <UNK> character also functions neatly in the plot his fake magic body <UNK> box becomes the ironically plausible location for <UNK> from joe <UNK> ian <UNK> a notorious <UNK> <UNK> and recent <UNK> arrest victim introduced on a river <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> repeatedly jumps ship because he just can't rest in eternity without <UNK> one last scoop about the identity of the notorious <UNK> killer unfortunately his initial return from the dead leads him to <UNK> magic show and the only <UNK> for his hot lead turns out to be a <UNK> <UNK> sondra <UNK> scarlett johansson who has been called up from the audience as a comic butt for the <UNK> climactic trick sondra <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> opportunity and drags the reluctant <UNK> into the investigation to play the role of her millionaire father as demonstrated in lost in translation johansson has a talent for comedy and the <UNK> by play between her and allen is very amusing and all the more so for never threatening to become a <UNK> to romance br br <UNK> serial killer plot involving grisly murders of prostitutes and an <UNK> chief suspect peter <UNK> hugh jackman is the no doubt predictable result of allen's lengthy <UNK> exposure to <UNK> <UNK> jack the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> yet other <UNK> of scoop as of match point also <UNK> from <UNK> late life encounter with english culture its class structure manners <UNK> dress architecture and yes peculiar driving <UNK> give woody fresh new material for <UNK> observation of human behavior as well as sharp social satire when for instance sondra is trying to <UNK> herself with peter <UNK> at a <UNK> private club <UNK> <UNK> from his point of view we're <UNK> a good deal of humor is also generated by the <UNK> of <UNK> reserved british social manners <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> belt jewish <UNK> and then of course there is <UNK> hilarious exit in a smart car he can't remember to drive on the left side of the road br br as usual allen's humor in scoop includes heavy doses of in jokes taking the form of sly <UNK> to film and literary sources as well as increasingly references to his own filmography in addition to the <UNK> jack the <UNK> references for instance the film's soundtrack is dominated by an <UNK> of <UNK> the hall of the mountain king <UNK> <UNK> by hans <UNK> in m the first masterpiece of the serial killer genre the post funeral gathering of <UNK> who discuss the exploits of newly <UNK> joe <UNK> clearly <UNK> the opening of broadway danny rose 1984 references to <UNK> harry 1997 include the use of death as a character along with his peculiar voice and costume the use of <UNK> as a character name and the mention of <UNK> university harry's <UNK> <UNK> and where sondra is now a student moreover the <UNK> use of greek mythology in the underworld river cruise to <UNK> recalls the use of greek gods and a chorus in mighty <UNK> 1995 br br as to <UNK> gags allen's scripts rely less on one liners than they did earlier in his career but scoop does provides at least a couple of memorable ones to a question about his religion <UNK> answers i was born in the <UNK> <UNK> but later i converted to <UNK> and sondra <UNK> off this put down of <UNK> wannabe crime <UNK> if we put our heads together you'll hear a hollow noise all in all scoop is by far woody allen's most satisfying comedy in a decade
<START> i had to walk out of the theater after an hour all i was seeing was people cheating on wives <UNK> like dogs in a <UNK> and using the f word like a <UNK> using equal br br no thanks br br it was especially frustrating because the movie could have done a lot any one of the characters could have been quite interesting if they were given more to do than <UNK> talk about it and swear at each other br br the few times that it looked as if there were about to be some sort of character development all that happened was another sex scene plot development in the 1st hour can be <UNK> as 1 several murders occur 2 <UNK> sees murder scene 3 <UNK> stares <UNK> across atlantic east hudson river 4 <UNK> <UNK> on wife and 5 joey most sympathetic character in the show gets kicked out of his parents' house more than that i didn't wait to see br br the photography and the interplay between the characters were superb but there was nothing for them to do the <UNK> of sex and <UNK> was hardly worth waiting another hour for something to happen br br sorry spike take some lessons from <UNK> hill or <UNK> redemption either one is a better study in community and <UNK> relationships
<START> i am surprised than many viewers hold more respect for the sequel to this brilliant movie i have seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the best br br even though <UNK> seen the making of i still have doubts when watching those <UNK> of pure torture its that powerful br br a 10 out of 10 because this movie achieved perfectly what it set out to do be the best fake snuff film ever made
<START> when it comes to creating a universe george lucas is the <UNK> master and his final star wars film is very very good and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga having recently seen revenge of the <UNK> really puts this movie in perspective the final battle seems even more climactic knowing what <UNK> skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the emperor it also makes the final battle between luke and vader more bitter considering the love he felt for <UNK> and the love she felt for her children actually while the new films especially episode ii are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only they make the old films seem even better br br mark <UNK> does an exceptional job in this movie he really brings the changes luke has gone through seem real in all fairness i believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job harrison ford is still good however you can feel that he has done <UNK> and blade runner in between the two final chapters of star wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit he adds more comedy obviously inspired from <UNK> to the character which works brilliantly in short han solo is better than ever carrie fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable ian <UNK> appears in this film and having seen episode iii i can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever james earl jones still provides the voice for vader and he is still very very good br br in terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the star wars universe looks better than in either of the previous two movies but this was always <UNK> <UNK> so that is really to be expected the final battle over <UNK> is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise it was also a nice touch that lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax br br the only thing i feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the ewoks these little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in besides i find it to be a little to <UNK> when a group of teddy bears with <UNK> and <UNK> can defeat a <UNK> of storm troopers with laser guns and mighty <UNK> br br all in all return of the jedi is a very good movie but the fact that richard <UNK> is a less accomplished director than <UNK> <UNK> does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant also george <UNK> stupid decision to add the ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance br br 8 10
<START> oh man what was sam <UNK> thinking what was anyone who was involved in this film thinking <UNK> is the head of nearly everything of ben and arthur director writer producer also executive producer <UNK> lead star you name it he did it and he <UNK> sucks more than anyone has ever sucked in every department of film making br br so what is wrong with this film everything the film is about two gay lovers ben jamie brett <UNK> and arthur <UNK> <UNK> ben and arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gay people to make things worse ben's crazy ex wife they don't exactly divorce <UNK> julie <UNK> is steaming mad that ben's left her for another man and demands ben that they get back together saying that she can be gay too and <UNK> christian devoted <UNK> <UNK> equally <UNK> as <UNK> brother victor is hell bent on making arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after he gets kicked out of his church br br the film is absolutely chock a block with so many goofs ie ben and arthur fly to <UNK> to get married they go there on <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> has palm trees they fly back on a <UNK> <UNK> plane hope they were <UNK> in a wooden <UNK> plus many many more and plot holes to boot victor calls killing arthur the final plan which later changes to the final deed arthur and the private <UNK> detective drive the same car blah blah blah the actors are all very bad and are way way over the top the script is laughably horrible one such example is i don't make sense you don't make sense i make sense that's who makes sense and there so much more wrong with the movie that i can't write them all down br br however the most laughable yet unbelievable thing about ben and arthur is that sam <UNK> thinks that he has created something that is truly fantastic see his fake reviews for ben arthur and obvious comments by him on youtube <UNK> is <UNK> and his arrogance <UNK> him from seeing how awful anything with his name on it really is br br so to conclude forget every bad film that you claim is the worst movie ever ben and arthur will knock them right off that title even paris hilton movies look like the dark knight compared to the monstrosity known as ben and arthur
<START> the first time my best friend and i sat down to watch this movie we were watching it for alex winter of bill ted's fame we didn't know what to expect other than who and what it was about br br by the time the movie was over we knew that it was love at first sight this movie while not completely historically accurate was and is the best one of its genre i have seen other movies depicting the history of this famous summer and in my opinion none of the others can compare it <UNK> a little at certain details but those parts did not take away from the sheer <UNK> and romance of the story i have seen the other movies about this summer and i find most of them to be good but none as captivating as this one br br haunted summer has the qualities of a painting the colors and settings seem to be something one would find on a <UNK> framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an <UNK> home the costumes were gorgeous and despite not being the most comfortable clothes in the world made me want to find a <UNK> to create such <UNK> for myself the whole movie was set on the <UNK> lake <UNK> where i hope to one day go because of seeing this movie and the <UNK> that these historical figures found there br br this movie shows besides the <UNK> found by all the <UNK> of <UNK> harsh <UNK> the <UNK> that surrounded this adventure as well yes there were drugs it was a fairly common practice during that time a time when drugs were not illegal and the taking of <UNK> the <UNK> form of <UNK> was <UNK> as well as <UNK> shelley suffered from <UNK> lord byron suffered the pains of a <UNK> foot it was not surprising that there would be <UNK> of the strong drugs that were in their possession during that summer and they were <UNK> during a time when experience was the key there was no time for <UNK> caution passion and experience were a big part of the romantic era and out of the thoughts and discussions of science religion and philosophy came the creation of a legend frankenstein br br yes in this movie we see the beautiful and <UNK> mary <UNK> not married to shelley at that time played by beautiful and talented alice <UNK> she is the control factor to all that goes on until she too gives in to experience but she stands her ground and experiences things on her own terms as was the strength that she inherited from her mother and father br br the actors and actresses in this were perfect for the parts they played the music fitting the direction captured the essence of the summer as i've read about it this movie was based on a wonderful book haunted summer by anne <UNK> if you like this movie read the book the author takes the story from what she was able to put together from the actual <UNK> of mary <UNK> shelley and the other participants of this story br br if you are a person who loves history even the little inaccuracies from time to time and romance and the gothic then this is a movie for you it shows the birth of the birth of the monster which even today teaches us about the morals of playing god br br a definite must see movie
<START> don't get me wrong i love action and revenge flicks i've seen many of them since i was a kid including dolph <UNK> latest the <UNK> which is quite good and tony scott certainly know how to use a camera and even might be a genius shooting and editing films br br but with man on fire and even more then with domino scott shows that rather than using his film making genius skills intelligently he uses it <UNK> to show off and compensate a lack of substance that his material doesn't offer him man of fire is close to 2 hours and half when it really should have been at least an hour less br br the way scott shot and edited this film also makes you wonder if he really wants you the audience to sit through his film because his constant camera moves and flashes really are a torture for the eye and makes you wanna leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes into it br br at times where the mpaa and studios have questionable attitudes regarding ratings violence and making pg 13 movies i find also suspicious that a 70 million movie is made of a b movie script with a character who cuts fingers puts a bomb in a man's ass and blows a guy's hand with a shotgun all this to avenge the death of a little girl who isn't even dead go figure then why a studio will pass a better script because of the language or violence thus said
<START> this is my favorite show i think it is utterly brilliant thanks to david chase for bringing this into my life br br season 1 br br 1 the sopranos 5 5 br br 2 <UNK> long 4 5 5 br br 3 denial anger acceptance 5 5 br br 4 <UNK> 4 5 br br 5 college br br 6 <UNK> <UNK> 5 5 br br 7 down neck 4 5 5 br br 8 the legend of <UNK> <UNK> 5 5 br br 9 <UNK> 4 5 5 br br 10 a hit is a hit 3 5 5 br br 11 nobody knows anything 5 5 br br 12 <UNK> 5 5 br br 13 i dream of <UNK> <UNK> 5 5
<START> the triumph of love doesn't triumph over anything it is a plodding <UNK> 4 hours of torture actually it's a little less than 2 hours long it just seemed much longer it pains me to even think about the amateurish performances of such fine actors as ben kingsley and <UNK> shaw the supporting players are not quite as awful maybe they were trying to be so over the top so as to be <UNK> but if so i didn't see it that way mira sorvino doesn't make an impression one way or the other she he 's just there my guess is the play of the same name written by <UNK> some <UNK> or so years ago is much better it couldn't be any worse <UNK> <UNK> the writer and director of this movie was inspired by a recent production of the play i don't know what she was thinking when she created this bomb br br maybe it all got lost in the translation
<START> understand i'm reviewing the film i have seen i realize virtually all the nudity and gore was cut from this film thus <UNK> it completely when seeing names like ginger <UNK> and jenna jameson attached i knew i wasn't going to get a horror classic but at the very least i expected gratuitous <UNK> and bloodshed but no this has got to be the most butchered modern horror film i mean it's easy to tell there is much more to certain <UNK> but they suddenly cut away or the scene just totally ends right as it begins how does one screw up <UNK> and porn stars i mean thats a winning formula it makes me wonder if the director slept with some <UNK> wife or something because it is literally amazing how much got cut from this reading about it a few years back in <UNK> i was excited it looked like a fun film but unfortunately the true film is locked in a vault somewhere and we must endure this piece of <UNK> <UNK> evil breed hopefully an <UNK> cut will be released someday as i think a good movie exists in this mess but until then best grab a twelve pack of bud cause thats the only way you'll make it through this movie
<START> this a casper the friendly ghost short from my childhood and i re watch it on youtube thank god for you tube after that i love this short and it is one of my favorite casper shorts br br i love how the short starts off spooky with frank <UNK> haunting narration until we get to see casper sitting by his <UNK> in the cemetery reading while every ghost rose from the graves to boo people casper decides to leave in search for a friend but in trying to make a friend anyone who sees casper runs away poor casper sat on a <UNK> and <UNK> until a little fox <UNK> comes up an <UNK> him casper and the little fox quickly bond and he quickly names the <UNK> <UNK> and considers him to be his very best friend br br casper and <UNK> relationship is put in tremendous <UNK> however when casper is not keeping a close eye on <UNK> while they are playing a game of hide and seek while <UNK> is hiding a hunter and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill little <UNK> and <UNK> is running as fast as possible until he is out of breath and starts <UNK> while the hunter is firing <UNK> towards <UNK> casper notices they are trying to kill him and flies in the <UNK> direction and <UNK> that the hunter leaves <UNK> alone and the hunter and dogs are terrified of casper casper yells to <UNK> that the hunter and the dogs are gone and that everything is fine but casper sees <UNK> body is not moving and asks if he is ok when casper sees <UNK> has died he starts mourning in pain because he lost the only friend he ever had in his whole life casper returns back to the cemetery where he has buried <UNK> and has made a <UNK> for him next to <UNK> <UNK> casper continues mourning in pain until he sees that <UNK> has <UNK> as a ghost himself <UNK> starts <UNK> casper on his cheek casper screams for joy because he has been reunited with <UNK> br br overall it is a really good short though surprisingly disturbing showing death in a family oriented cartoon
<START> some funny bits but come bill a film <UNK> <UNK> keep the tv show and the interviews but a film i'm probably <UNK> but what a unnecessary provoking film i don't know i laughed <UNK> agreed this film is very confusing and inconsistent br br <UNK> a funny guy but also very cocky <UNK> <UNK> is similar to bill <UNK> a brilliant comedian but like many comedians the borderline between comedy and preaching can be annoying i think that the major problem in this film is his lack of sensibility this might be just a personal taste but comedy that constantly <UNK> somebody cannot be taken as truth bill is obviously emotionally <UNK> to religious <UNK> i agree with bill that religious <UNK> is not sensible but the response to it cannot be sensible it will create unnecessary turmoil we can do better than just react to <UNK> his conclusion is that we don't know and he <UNK> tries to convince the <UNK> that nobody knows anything to the point that the <UNK> community has been concerned with his lack of serious research in <UNK> religion his <UNK> that he only knows that he doesn't is a <UNK> as he tries to insist that all religious thought is non sense br br i had great trouble seeing bits of <UNK> the movie in <UNK> film all the <UNK> influenced non sense that <UNK> all <UNK> as the same is simply disappointing <UNK> has <UNK> a lot of controversy and has messed up the <UNK> of so much of the valuable religion studies <UNK> it is very sad how wrong facts have been tossed around with no reliable <UNK> sources <UNK> <UNK> sources that <UNK> everything to the stars say it all seem to be from the middle ages this film is a confusing statement from a confused <UNK> <UNK> is far more complex and <UNK> academic than defending every single issue as we don't know br br this film is an obvious proof of how <UNK> has been able to <UNK> and <UNK> major issues in human history br br watch the film it has hilarious interviews and bits but please do not behave like bill you cannot expect anybody to have a mature conversation if you are making <UNK> comments in every other line his arguing techniques are <UNK> and insulting provoking emotional reactions rather than rational and logical <UNK> there needs to be a more mature way of dealing with these issues
<START> where to begin this movie started out as something that seemed like a rip off of darkness falls an old <UNK> woman living in the woods giving kids presents for their teeth sound familiar then it changes in darkness falls the tooth fairy only killed you if you saw her the tooth fairy in this movie killed you no matter what why did they need the rocker his hippie girlfriend or the <UNK> and their sister i think the movie would've been fine without them it seems like the producers sat around and decided that they needed to put extra people in the movie just so the tooth fairy would have people to kill although it's nice to see a pretty blonde girl not being portrayed as a bubble head for a change okay to rent but i wouldn't suggest buying it
<START> this was a disappointing film the people seem to have no substance the lead protagonist martin <UNK> has zero <UNK> values in fact everyone in it including jon voight <UNK> <UNK> i would not recommend this film to anyone the violence is <UNK> though <UNK> done the filming is to black at least the print i saw fit this category a disappointment
<START> after hearing the word of mouth of just how bad this film is i took the <UNK> and bought the dvd that said everything previously mentioned about this film is true for a film that claimed to have a budget in the millions it just does not show on the screen at all the list of problems with the film could drag on forever chief amongst them is the film is simply too long it dragged on for a few minutes short of 3 hours nearly an hour probably could have been cut off the run time had the editor simply removed the <UNK> of scenes dealing with nothing more then the main character wandering around <UNK> br br secondly as many had pointed out from the trailers the special effects are anything but special the <UNK> looked ok in a few shots here and there but beyond that everything was grade z 1970's or 1980's quality probably the worst effects of all were the horses which <UNK> <UNK> back and forth as they moved the heat ray effects were laughable as people were reduced to bones that somehow were still able to <UNK> about without any <UNK> also pitiful was the <UNK> sequence in which the <UNK> described in the book as an <UNK> ram looked nothing of the sort instead it <UNK> a world war 1 era <UNK> complete with deck guns which fired but had no visible crew and <UNK> <UNK> br br the colors and backgrounds were just as bad as the effects most laughable of all was a scene early on in which the main character and his wife go for a <UNK> <UNK> and he points out mars to her in the sky well the sky is black but the views of the characters and the landscape around them is broad daylight there is also a very sharp <UNK> between the real landscape <UNK> in full <UNK> and the fake black night sky with overly large fuzzy stars to detract even further the color of the scenes made no sense in some they are <UNK> in orange light in others green light in still others it's blue light in some instances the <UNK> are orange lit but the interiors of houses are green or blue the frame rate and camera is very shaky giving everything a <UNK> look br br finally the acting is overall sub par one man portrays two characters who's sole difference was one lacked a mustache this led to some confusion at times as to who was who and where they all were the english accents even to american ears are outrageous br br in summary this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times i have not seen <UNK> or some of the other recent <UNK> but this one because of it's poor quality in every respect must easily be worse then anything that mainstream hollywood has put out i would not be surprised if the movie makes it to the bottom 10 or 20 in the imdb <UNK> it's a pity that mystery science theater is not still around
<START> <UNK> is a film from mexico that is rarely talked about the film only exists in a low quality vhs format it's a shame this film hasn't been given a dvd release <UNK> is stunning and gorgeous with its magic <UNK> images <UNK> is based on a short story from the novel 100 years of <UNK> <UNK> is constantly <UNK> and accidentally burns down her <UNK> house her evil grandma played by irene <UNK> forces her into prostitution to pay for the <UNK> the whole town gets a piece of <UNK> so to speak although the subject matter sounds harsh the film doesn't exploit sexuality it's done in a mature artistic manner the film also has some amazing costumes some of the more surreal aspects of the film that stand out the most are the <UNK> birds that <UNK> into real birds and a golden orange with a diamond in the center <UNK> is an amazing film that even manages to throw in humor this is definitely a film that deserves a special dvd release as they'd say in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the plot was dull the girls were sickening and the supposed italian male lead had clearly never heard an italian accent someone said the boys were cute in this film but it just seemed to be filled with mediocre people there were literally no redeeming features about this film br br i think this is a graveyard for actors that will never work again with the unfortunate exception of the olsen twins who seem to <UNK> people for no discernible reason br br i hope the olsen twins find something out of the <UNK> to keep them away from the entertainment business they have no place in it
<START> chris and andre are two average ordinary teens misunderstood by some and picked on by others but together they stand and all will pay together they form the army of two they scheme and plan zero day that day is when they decide to storm their high school and inevitably murder 14 people in cold blood told through the tapes that they made zero day it is barely a <UNK> telling of the <UNK> tragedy br br zero day is one of those movies that will mess with your head afterwards the two main actors <UNK> robertson and andre <UNK> do such a good job that their characters seem like almost any <UNK> teen walking the street their performances were very believable you kinda liked these guys and that was scary shot on video almost totally from the <UNK> perspectives zero day feels very real and authentic like you are right there these kids try to <UNK> their actions to the viewer and the actors sell it to you but be warned it does follow the tragedy from beginning to end and the ending makes be shocking and uneasy for some
<START> first off i'm not here to dog this movie i find it totally enjoyable in spite of the poor production quality the acting <UNK> is about as <UNK> as the monster stalking them although the monster itself is quite well done <UNK> well done at that he actually looks kind of other <UNK> like an alien family on vacation landed in the <UNK> and while dad was out taking a attending to <UNK> call spot got loose and they just didn't have time to hunt him down that or he's the <UNK> brother of the <UNK> i haven't decided which br br actually this seems to have been filmed somewhere in snow country yes but more likely canada somewhere than china anywhere the trees and <UNK> say canada to me and it's okay that the set area never takes on the look or feel of uber <UNK> one might expect to find in the <UNK> of china it's a sci fi channel movie so we can forgive the lack of location br br further apparently as we have just established sci fi directors do not travel often as they are not aware that commercial planes fly above weather like what is featured <UNK> and the subsequent crash actually would not have happened but as i said it's a sci fi channel movie so we must forgive a few things br br the movie is pretty graphic at times and <UNK> between alive about the <UNK> party predator about the alien in the woods and any bad <UNK> movie where they fly about on <UNK> the yeti apparently can leap about like <UNK> or super mario remember run faster jump higher live longer br br also the yeti has missed his teddy bear he's searched high and low for it but cannot seem to make a <UNK> work poor yeti you can't help but feel sorry for it it has survived and evolved thousands of years only to <UNK> to severe teddy bear loss he's missed his bear or maybe it wants to mate but that thought is <UNK> do ya hear me well it does seem to be an <UNK> male <UNK> br br and it's <UNK> well it's not human it's super yeti but then again what's normal yeti i don't know but he has a definite michael meyers quality that is completely unsettling and he's got this fabulous way of cleaning his fur fabulous <UNK> it's <UNK> white at times when it so shouldn't be he's <UNK> <UNK> super yeti br br all in all this was a lot of fun to watch has some great kills and a few honest plot elements in spite of the horribly <UNK> like production style this is actually quite entertaining i can't help wondering if they're planning on another one br br it rates a 6 0 10 on the <UNK> scale br br it rates a 4 4 10 on the movie scale from br br the fiend
<START> the ultimate goal of big brother that we know what to think before we think it has been realized is it some kind of miracle or sinister joke that people don mental straight <UNK> of their own <UNK> twist themselves into <UNK> <UNK> and grin like apes movies art no longer risk the unknown but are <UNK> conclusions <UNK> of life br br the notorious bettie page is a bland case history fit for a <UNK> college <UNK> course its lesson is <UNK> right <UNK> and linear see how women are <UNK> exploited abused then tossed on the trash heap by a male dominated society br br bettie page supposedly was the pin up queen of the 1950's the ass millions of men <UNK> to all reviewers repeat that phrase pin up queen of the 1950's like a choir of monkeys her history as an american sex bomb is familiar southern abused by her father raped etc in this movie she is a <UNK> an innocent unaware of the <UNK> interests she serves and shamelessly <UNK> from although she believes in jesus she enjoys <UNK> nude before a camera lens just the wholesome girl next door sex slave american males supposedly <UNK> br br from the mouth of writer director mary harron herself <UNK> educated and ex <UNK> do you smell the combined <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> as i do i feel that without <UNK> i wouldn't be doing this i don't make feminist films in the sense that i don't make anything <UNK> but i do find that women get my films better what a <UNK> <UNK> br br the movie merely goes through the motions of telling the story of a human life it's subject and purpose having been <UNK> and <UNK> well before the movie began ms page has a boyfriend but we are shown next to nothing about their relationship in fact there are no intimate or detailed relationships in the film br br one can't ignore its smug simplicity in new york where ms page tries her best to fit into and <UNK> a man's world letting herself be tied up in the <UNK> of bondage and tightly laced into the black leather boots and <UNK> of s m the movie is black and white but down in miami where she goes to get away from it all <UNK> takes off her clothes and is photographed by a <UNK> female the movie turns into color br br like hell harron doesn't make feminist films doesn't make anything <UNK> ideology has become so <UNK> so assumed so <UNK> that it's almost invisible big brother must be smiling

<START> or maybe that's what it feels like anyway the bat people is about as flat as a <UNK> bland as a sack of <UNK> and as exciting as a rock and as intelligent as all three combined br br okay plot in a nutshell fitting <UNK> that a doctor moss gets bitten by a bat while checking out a cave with his wife <UNK> and subsequently turns into a bat well not exactly a bat but a bat like creature that looks more like a werewolf who kills his victims in a first person camera viewpoint br br but then there's the business of the sheriff <UNK> who is about the worst kind of sheriff the <UNK> kind he <UNK> people he <UNK> at married women he steals <UNK> from <UNK> the fiend he <UNK> with one of those cigarette <UNK> in his mouth and talks at the same time making him look and sound like <UNK> t justice in <UNK> and the <UNK> and this is the worst part he's the most likeable character in the whole film br br the whole film though is just tv movie of the week like <UNK> <UNK> in this case it's an <UNK> for crying out loud what did you expect oscar caliber stuff br br and what else can you say about a film that not even mst3k can save br br how about no stars for the bat people full version or mst3k version br br by the way if there's ever a sequel for this movie i'm <UNK> my tv
<START> holy sh t this was god awful i sat in the theater for for an hour and ten minutes and i thought i was going to <UNK> out my eyes much in the <UNK> <UNK> rex dear god this movie deserves no more credit than anything done by a middle school film buff please save your money this movie can offer you nothing unless you enjoy <UNK> and sleeping in movie theaters you know <UNK> bring your girlfriend and make things interesting you will be the only ones there anyway f <UNK> this slide show br br <UNK> be warned br br i recommend not watching this br br hello br br how are you br br i'm pretty good br br enjoying this day br br i am br br this comment was one hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this <UNK> movie this is sad
<START> there was a genie played by <UNK> his name was <UNK> and he was <UNK> his <UNK> were corny this lines were bad some stupid kid <UNK> over his stupid dad bad <UNK> bad casting bad special effects whats next this movie sucks <UNK> didn't make 20 bucks he lives in a <UNK> not a <UNK> hurts like a <UNK> like a wet food <UNK> br br yeah you get it a stupid <UNK> genie who can't act in a stupid movie with horrible special effects oh and its confusing as hell i'm not even gonna go on let's just say it belongs in the its so bad its funny category watch it once with your buddies and get a good laugh but don't expect anything spectacular
<START> european vacation aka national <UNK> european vacation is the weakest of the vacation films the first and third one the most superior of the films while chevy chase and beverly <UNK> return as clark and ellen <UNK> with new actors in the roles of russ and audrey <UNK> this time they are given a weaker script with very bad dialogue this causes the pacing to suffer with the jokes not very funny at all to be more specific what really causes this film to suffer is the fact that the jokes as they are are just <UNK> together into a <UNK> together script rather than serving a central plot as the other 3 vacation films have oh well they can't win them all 4 out of 10
<START> this is one of those movies that you and a bunch of friends sit around drinking beers eating pizza and laugh at unfortunately for me i found myself watching this one alone my friends and i rented a big block of movies and never got around to seeing this one it was due back and i figured that it was a waste not to watch it so i did and i was impressed at how absolutely terrible this movie is br br now i love bad movies quite a bit and i probably would have liked this one if the hero wasn't so utterly <UNK> the entire movie i was hoping that he'd put that stupid sword down and let someone kill him he does very little heroic things in the movie he's a <UNK> disgusting stupid thing he has less redeeming qualities than the villains do and what was it with all the naked chicks i mean i love naked chicks just as much as the next guy but this movie went a tad overboard in that department br br well anyway if you love bad movies and can stand a disgusting hero then i'm sure you'll like this schlock of a film
<START> i caught the last half of this movie on cable one night and was struck by just how morbid it was even when one of the two victims is at his most <UNK> the camera keeps going the lingering shots of his corpse being <UNK> and his concentration camp figure being <UNK> into a body bag are both moving and depressing don't watch this movie if your already depressed then again don't watch it if your feeling really good
<START> this show had a lot of hype but i didn't know about it until the <UNK> season 1 someone even recommended the show to me but i decided that if i was going to watch it i was going to wait until the end of the season so i could watch it in bulk due to the show's format i'm happy i waited i imagine it would have been fairly annoying have nearly every episode end in the middle of some cliff <UNK> then have to wait another week to find out what happens in the next second of the story br br somehow this show has managed to throw in too much sex jason will have sex with pretty much anything that moves right after he finds out that one woman he had sex with was killed he's in bed with another woman the next night then tara and sam get it on despite each of them knowing that sam is in love with <UNK> and for some reason <UNK> gets mad when she later finds out about it even though she's sleeping with a vampire one of the problems with the show is that it doesn't do a good job of making you care about the characters i really didn't care for jason at all along with his endless pursuit of tale he was rude to the people who actually were concerned for him after a few episodes i wouldn't have minded if he got killed somehow for that reason i was for the most part <UNK> in the murders until <UNK> grandmother became a victim since the first two were more closely involved with jason br br then once <UNK> and bill have sex the story gets a few more subplots <UNK> mother wants an <UNK> then the exorcist lady tries to convince tara that she should have one to remove her own demon i wasn't so much bothered by the whole <UNK> thing as i know there are some people who really believe in that stuff however they waste little time in showing that is it a farce right after tara spends about <UNK> on <UNK> for her and her mother at other points some of the developments happen too fast jason continues being a jerk trying to sell his <UNK> stuff to buy vampire blood which apparently is the new crack or something in his search he finds this girl who will do v vampire blood with him they get high and within three days fall in love with each other and kidnap a vampire for a constant source of v another example is when bill has to go to a vampire <UNK> he's only gone for two days before <UNK> starts to feel abandoned and start to wonder if he thinks vampire politics are more important than her br br subtlety is not this show's strong suit it doesn't take a genius to figure out something is going on with the local dog although my <UNK> wasn't dead on it wasn't that much of a surprise but the finale two episodes was where it really got annoying as it just shoved all the developments in your face as if you couldn't possibly figure the out for yourself when tara gets into the car accident the naked <UNK> face with the pig is clearly shown and was easily recognizable when she shows up at the jail for the <UNK> as if that wasn't enough they later show the lady again with the pig at her house then it's time to wrap up the murder story at the end of the <UNK> episode it's revealed that <UNK> is not who he says he is and most likely is the killer in the final episode they <UNK> <UNK> being the killer in your face <UNK> remarks that it's odd that <UNK> thoughts don't have an accent i thought that was fine as it adds to <UNK> being a fraud but the next scene is full of <UNK> evidence against <UNK> they show that <UNK> has the tape of <UNK> with the vampire and his fiancée finds a tape in one of <UNK> boxes about how to fake a <UNK> accent at this point it was just ridiculous i mean we get it so blah blah blah stuff happens bill almost kills himself while failing to save <UNK> who still manages to kill <UNK> they start to set up season 2 by leaving unfinished issues the naked pig lady and sam have a history <UNK> has gone missing and might have been killed jason is in the process of being <UNK> into being a religious nut by some anti vampire church which makes me care about him even less br br it's almost surprising to see how many people absolutely love this show i think i just expected this show to be better i'm interested in seeing what happens in season 2 but if i watch it i'll most likely wait for the season <UNK>
<START> an occasionally <UNK> thriller that will push most people's buttons the 4th man is sure to offend anyone with a taste for the politically correct the story's protagonist is a <UNK> alcoholic catholic writer gerard <UNK> with a seriously twisted sense of imagination verhoeven offers up br br gerard has an example of everything wrong with the modern man he's <UNK> <UNK> unable to control his <UNK> afraid to commit to br br meaningful relationships and utterly <UNK> about life in general as the character himself states at one point he is a professional liar unable to recall the truth br br the movie opens with gerard dreaming of <UNK> <UNK> christ and then waking to begin the long march to his own destruction he chases off br br one man a boyfriend presumably then chases another at a train station later at a lecture he meets a woman who seems to want to help him or br br perhaps she has more <UNK> plans she quickly captures gerard in her web <UNK> him with sex and money having plenty of both she's also got br br secrets like three dead husbands is she lonely and genuinely looking for someone to <UNK> or is she a deadly black widow <UNK> gerard to his br br death will <UNK> be the 4th man she kills the woman is christine <UNK> and verhoeven does his best to keep you guessing what she's up to br br this is an interesting movie with a lot of sex and intrigue it's similar to verhoeven's em basic instinct em but has a lot more depth and is certainly more shocking there's a lot of very strong gay content which may make some viewers <UNK> highly recommended for fans of intelligent br br psychological thrillers or anyone looking for something entirely new
<START> i read nothing but good things about this movie and finally had a chance to watch it late last night and it was everything i expected it to be and more this is the way a proper horror movie should be i think the reason it was so scary was because it was so realistic the spooky sounding score was perfect for setting a dark mood i liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed how the rest of the movie played out it was very easy to follow and understand unlike some movies which are way too complicated the special effects were very good i would love to see more horror movies like this one this is easily one of my <UNK> a realistic thunder and lightning storm would have set a nice atmosphere for this movie other then that it had all the elements a good horror movie needs i highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scary movie that pulls no punches i will be adding it to my collection the dvd has some interesting special features
<START> the vigilante has long held a fascination for audiences <UNK> as it evokes a sense of swift sure justice good <UNK> over evil and the bad guy gets his <UNK> it is in fact one of the things that has made the character of dirty harry callahan as played by clint eastwood so popular he carries a <UNK> and works within the law but at heart harry is a vigilante <UNK> out justice <UNK> way which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors as well as the criminals he's pursuing but it's what draws the audience anyone who's ever been <UNK> down in <UNK> nonsense of one kind or another <UNK> in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it even if it's only on the screen and that satisfaction derived from seeing justice done and quickly is one of the elements that makes sudden impact ' directed by and starring eastwood so successful in this one the fourth of the series while working a homicide harry encounters a <UNK> <UNK> vigilante at work an individual whose brand of justice parallels his own with one exception whoever it is he's definitely not carrying a <UNK> br br in his own <UNK> way inspector callahan has once again ended up on the bad side of the department and is ordered to take some vacation time so he does as only dirty <UNK> can in a small town north of san francisco harry finds himself <UNK> <UNK> in the middle of a homicide case which he quickly <UNK> to a recent murder in san francisco because of the unique m o employed by the <UNK> <UNK> harry encounters resistance from the local police chief <UNK> pat <UNK> who <UNK> him to take his big city tactics and methods elsewhere not one to be <UNK> however harry continues his investigation which ultimately involves a beautiful and talented young artist jennifer spencer sondra locke gradually harry discovers a link between the victims the burning question though is where does jennifer spencer fit into the picture br br eastwood is in top form here both in front of and behind the camera and it is arguably the second best of the five film series right behind the original dirty harry ' it had been seven years since the last <UNK> offering the <UNK> ' 1976 but eastwood steps right back into the character with facility and <UNK> <UNK> and this one definitely benefits from having him in the director's chair as he is able to <UNK> the essence of not only his own character but that <UNK> that made these films so successful and he does it by knowing the territory and establishing a continuity that all but <UNK> that seven year gap between s 3 and 4 as with all the films he directs eastwood sets a deliberate pace that works perfectly for this material and creates just enough tension to keep it interesting and involving from beginning to end br br the screenplay by joseph <UNK> is well written and <UNK> to that distinctive dirty <UNK> style the dialogue is snappy and the story itself conceived by charles b pierce and earl e smith is the most engaging since the original dirty harry ' as it successfully <UNK> to play upon the very personal aspects of the drama rather than entirely upon the action the characters are well drawn and convincing and of course this is the film that gave us one of harry's best catch phrases go ahead make my day ' br br as harry clint eastwood perfectly <UNK> all of the elements that make this character so popular he lives by a personal moral code a true individual made of the kind of stuff we <UNK> as that of the <UNK> who settled this country and made america what it is today harry <UNK> that sense of freedom and justice we all <UNK> for and hold so dear possibly more so today than ever before no matter who we are or where we come from there's undeniably a part of us that wants to be harry or at least have him around dirty <UNK> is an icon of the cinema and it's impossible to <UNK> anyone but eastwood portraying him for better or worse eastwood <UNK> dirty harry without question just as sean connery is james bond and basil <UNK> sherlock holmes br br sondra locke is entirely effective here in the role of jennifer spencer a young woman <UNK> and out for vengeance or as she sees it justice ' she manages to bring a hard edged determination laced with vulnerability to her character with a convincing <UNK> approach that is far beyond what is typical of the <UNK> genre even amid the violence locke keeps her focus on jennifer and the traumatic events that have brought her to this stage of her life her portrayal makes a perfect <UNK> to eastwood's harry and becomes in philosophy and deed something of his counterpart br br in supporting roles two performances stand out paul drake as mick creates the best <UNK> since andy <UNK> dynamic portrayal of the serial killer in the original dirty harry ' with actually very limited screen time drake <UNK> a genuinely <UNK> presence that is believable and convincing which adds much to the purely visceral response of the audience this is the guy you can't wait to see harry take care of in the end also effective is <UNK> j <UNK> who makes her character ray <UNK> the epitome of the proverbial low life ' who can be found in any bar in any city it's a performance that evokes a gut level response and it adds greatly to the credibility of the film in that it helps provide that necessary sense of realism br br the supporting cast includes albert <UNK> <UNK> mark <UNK> bennett and nancy parsons mrs <UNK> with a perfect blend of drama and action sudden <UNK> <UNK> justice that is a fulfilling <UNK> from reality the perfect justice of a not so perfect world that makes for a satisfying cinematic experience 9 10

<START> i love alec guinness and that's saying a lot after this film actually he is not bad in it he just seems to stand aside be <UNK> and his usual delightful self but <UNK> <UNK> it is obvious the girl he is matched with is a <UNK> even as an inexperienced young french girl sir alec wouldn't have chosen her when he was young and very obviously isn't too happy about it now br br the interesting character is the brooding brother of the odd suzanne another <UNK> donald <UNK> to be a french <UNK> and i waited in vain for the source of his mystery what deep dark secret was he hiding behind that <UNK> was he in love with the father's mistress why did he jerk <UNK> hair when she plotted to bring the <UNK> parts of this turkey together on the country estate or perhaps he had simply had enough of her obnoxious acting br br the film would have been charming with <UNK> and the older woman <UNK> and seeing paris together that would have been a great story two lovely experienced people in a beautiful city after the destruction of world war ii why didn't somebody come up with that i suggest watching alec <UNK> in the card a little known but worthwhile film
<START> a great ensemble cast a fond <UNK> of younger <UNK> days this movie takes me back to when i went to summer camp indian summer while full of practical jokes and pranks is about growing up and coming to terms with life with middle age life my family i thoroughly enjoyed this movie
<START> the title got my attention and then i wondered what will come out in the plot as we have seen so many super people movies these years and in fact i really liked it as there were a number of unusual funny scenes that i didn't expect uma thurman performed as average in g girl's role surprisingly i was again able to watch her <UNK> in wide screen like in the beginning of kill bill luke wilson however played very well the idiot everyday guy who meets the big woman i could really get into his situation if you want a light touch of fun you should definitely watch g girl's and average <UNK> adventures especially to cheer up your partner 7 10 in my collection
<START> poor basil <UNK> an <UNK> composer who's lost his <UNK> he's been <UNK> it for some time buying his lyrics and his music from various sources trouble is that two of the sources bing crosby music and mary martin words happen to meet and fall in love and then they discover what they've been doing complications ensue but all is <UNK> at the end br br crosby and martin sing <UNK> mary had signed a paramount contract and also at the same time <UNK> as a regular on <UNK> <UNK> music hall radio show for reasons i don't understand movie audiences didn't take to her so she went back to broadway and did one touch of <UNK> in 1944 and stayed there br br basil <UNK> in one of the few times he played comedy does it very well his ego is constantly being <UNK> by sidekick oscar <UNK> and again i'm surprised they didn't do more films together br br as in most of <UNK> paramount vehicles no big production numbers but i agree with the previous reviewer about the title tune being done as an <UNK> jam session in a <UNK> shop good job by all br br a surprisingly original plot and great entertainment
<START> the movie never becomes <UNK> to watch and to tell it straight it has nothing to show either except maybe part sexy alicia <UNK> in a nerdy non sexy character in revealing quite sexy dresses the story is very easy to follow or there's nothing to follow you can see in either way there is no suspense little action unimpressive dialogs <UNK> <UNK> same boring locations and very bland acting kevin dillon is totally worthless <UNK> well i didn't concentrate too much on her acting i confess yet as i said earlier if one has nothing to do except watching a movie this won't look so bad 4 10
<START> after seeing driven on a plane flight to america 3 years ago i truly believed i had seen the worst film ever created and i could relax safe in the knowledge i would never have to suffer that much in front of a screen ever again unfortunately as i found out last night this was not the case revolver is so <UNK> bad i am actually thinking about <UNK> friends to go and see it just so i don't feel like i'm the only one stupid enough for being <UNK> into watching this its really quite amazing how much this film falls completely on its face with the constant and i mean constant voice overs of the main characters with totally inane pretentious nonsense i was actually getting angry in the cinema listening to andre <UNK> utterly relentless <UNK> for what seemed like half the film whilst all the time thinking what would turkish have done to this complete joke of gangster con man whatever he's supposed to be when he made his offer i'll tell you what he would have told him to f k off blown his head away and watch with utter disdain as his equally inept partner <UNK> away as fast as his <UNK> little legs would carry him i mean what are we supposed to believe is going through <UNK> head when they offer him their solution to his problem they're con men therefore they must obviously also have the skill to cure <UNK> blood <UNK> i mean <UNK> doesn't he start to wonder why his <UNK> aren't getting worse doesn't the penny drop on the third day what is happening instead of <UNK> <UNK> the audience to a painfully <UNK> phone call from <UNK> to jake to let him know he's been <UNK> br br anyway i can add a small positive note to the film by moving on to the dry humour if provides thankfully of a similar standard to his previous <UNK> <UNK> t this film doesn't try anything as smart as redeeming itself through some well timed amusing lines oh no it somehow managed to be so <UNK> unfunny i genuinely didn't hear so much as a <UNK> from a completely packed cinema  and anyone who knows the <UNK> in <UNK> knows how full a main screen can get and not 1 person so much as <UNK> maybe he never wanted the film to be funny and fair enough you can still make good gangster films without comedy but what was he planning on hanging this film on may i ask the unnecessarily <UNK> plot i sincerely hope not br br by far the most satisfying moment i went through last night was hearing the very loud <UNK> coming from all directions of the audience as everyone desperately <UNK> for the film to end it was also really quite amusing watching just how fast <UNK> were fighting and dashing for the <UNK> after they realised it was over and they were free from their torment br br i'll round this off i've got to finish writing this is making me angry again by <UNK> on the end i mean sh t the <UNK> no sorry i can't your just going to have to go and see it it can't be put in words it just can't and after you've seen it you'll know why <UNK>  <UNK> 
<START> sugar spice is one of the worst movies of 2001 the film tries to cross <UNK> and bring it on and fails when i saw last january i was so disgusted by the film that i walked and talked on my cell phone to my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie i've heard that the dvd has a director's cut maybe i'll check it out but this pg 13 trash movie is s and the worst kind of s maybe if the film had some t a that would've have made it okay but the gags are lame and the acting is horrible worse than a troma film
<START> please be warned this movie though a pretty bad storyline was one of the most gruesome movies i have seen ever just remember that before you settle on your <UNK> to enjoy the movie br br so it officially begins with a party just your average party but there's some guy there he's pretty into kate if you know what i'm saying <UNK> his face it'll help later br br so anyway kate goes of to find george clooney didn't i say the plot was bad and so takes the tube that's london underground at the middle of the night but she's just stupid like that so the <UNK> says the next and last train will come in 7 minutes now kate dumb party girl that she is decides that she can have a <UNK> in the spare 7 minutes typically she misses the train and finds herself locked in the london underground alone well almost br br so the movie just carries on from there blood guts limbs even certain parts of the body i shall not mention are <UNK> and <UNK> and eventually <UNK> from the body br br in short it's a typical horror pretty but thick damsel in distress type women and sick weird psycho or as the case may have it creep br br i'd say give it a go if you're into saw hostel or the texas chainsaw massacre but for the rest of us scream with satisfy out horror needs <UNK> very much
<START> i really think i should make my case and have every horror and or cult movie buff go and see this movie br br i did br br it is excellent very atmospheric and unsettling and scary br br <UNK> how they could make such a gem of a film with the very low read no budget they had br br synopsis taken from website one morning an old man wanders out into the woods in search of his runaway cat he finds instead a child without parents and a murder with no corpse br br on this website imdb there is no trailer but i will leave a link here to the site of the movie itself where there is a trailer which is quite unsettling so please go and check it out br br www <UNK> com
<START> <UNK> <UNK> represented the commercial cinema in france from 1960 1980 always strong at the box office and usually telling dramatic and suspenseful tales of casino <UNK> mafia score <UNK> and world war ii battles <UNK> could be counted on to give us two solid hours of entertainment on saturday night he worked with the cream of the male actors of his day <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> anthony quinn i <UNK> <UNK> is the only time he directed <UNK> <UNK> it's an oddly static film taking place mainly in <UNK> and <UNK> rooms containing not one chase scene and hardly any violence br br <UNK> gives a good performance if somewhat dry and he is well supported by the other actors i couldn't help wondering what <UNK> <UNK> could have done with this story on the basis of z the <UNK> assassination and <UNK> the torture of <UNK> london in <UNK> by <UNK>
<START> this is one of the worse movies that i have ever seen in my entire life i wish i could travel back in time and do the following br br 1 find out where the movie war games the dead code was filmed 2 watch the original war games with my current computer knowledge and the eyes of a 1983 <UNK> 3 break into the <UNK> computer in the 80's with the knowledge and perspective learned and remembered 4 <UNK> the <UNK> to <UNK> the location of the dead code minutes prior to its first day of filming 5 come back to the present have a beer and get will smith and tommy lee jones to flash my memory blank of the whole event especially my original viewing of the dead code 6 have another beer and watch wars games 7 be happy until the next bad remake of a good 80's movie br br 8 did i forget the have jar jar killed i am not sure if i would have to travel into the future for that maybe i need access to a <UNK>
<START> george <UNK> directs a brooding and cynical classic the distinctive ronald coleman is at his best in this piece of noir about an actor who loses himself in his roles the acclaimed anthony john colman has driven his wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> away with his highly <UNK> temper and <UNK> behavior but the two manage to continue working together to please their audiences things begin to change as john is becoming bored with his career he reluctantly agrees to play othello he gets deep into character as a jealous and murderous man he begins walking a thin line between illusion and reality and ends up confusing his role with his own life and eventually kills his mistress shelley winters but has no memory of the <UNK> deed br br colman seems <UNK> in this role winters is very impressive as the young woman determined to get away from her <UNK> life also in the cast <UNK> o'brien ray collins joe <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this truly funny movie has a zany cast of characters just about every <UNK> middle aged female in hollywood and a touching funny love story the <UNK> and the <UNK> are rival <UNK> in an italian neighborhood in new york they are also at opposite extreme ends of the taste scale their children are cast in the lead roles of a church production of romeo and juliet naturally they fall in love on stage the mayhem and confusion that this causes as the parents <UNK> with each other and their kids is played out for us against the backdrop of the <UNK> <UNK> tasteless home and their <UNK> tasteless <UNK> <UNK> br br besides the four over the top parents and the charming young lovers the characters include a vaguely wise priest a plain speaking grandma a lady who waves a <UNK> and passes on spiritual advice she receives from a medium called the blessed <UNK> a motel with <UNK> shaped like the back seat of a car and two <UNK> there is not a sight gag or a punch line that doesn't click in this fast paced movie br br even the family names of the two families are part of the fun <UNK> could be interpreted as low <UNK> and <UNK> could mean stuck up <UNK> br br if you are sensitive about italian stereotypes you may not like this movie if bette midler <UNK> you you may not like it because all of the women in this movie make bette midler look like martha stewart the rest of us should love it
<START> it's kind of fascinating to me that so many reviewers consider this a masterpiece i am not a <UNK> as far as quality films go and i will agree that from a technical filming standpoint as well as for several of the characters portrayed the film is in an award worthy class but there is no sense for me of this film actually going anywhere i mean taking the viewer anywhere it is a series of mood scenes perhaps remarkable as such but i want more from a film i look for story and movement and a <UNK> of arrival none of which did i find in this film yes it might be considered poetry on film but there is much poetry that i cannot live with for the same reason that it paints pictures without going anywhere br br one thing further to be said is that it documents a mid century english childhood which is necessarily limited in its <UNK> i was personally appalled at what a young british boy had to live through in that time and place having grown up in america just a decade earlier i can <UNK> say that the contrast is immense i cannot help wondering if this contrast has had some effect on those reviewing the film so <UNK> in other words could there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on its <UNK> <UNK> which i acknowledge is there and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of one's actual <UNK> experience
<START> excellent br br good br br fair br br poor br br go ahead make my day ' br br the fourth picture in the series is directed by eastwood himself who was <UNK> of directing most of <UNK> force and he brings back the violent society from the first two films however the film still lacks impact and believability this film was released in the early 80s the time of <UNK> and the young <UNK> the premise of a raped woman taking vengeance on her rapist doesn't appeal to this time frame this plot would have been better for the <UNK> which actually would have made it a good movie what sudden impact needed was a plot like in wall street but with dirty harry in the middle br br rating 3 stars
<START> <UNK> was awful but it may have given <UNK> the idea to it better more like spinal tap than anything else the film is clever from the start surprising anyone who saw it back in the mid nineties the performances are played for laughs but not so much so that they are cartoon characters more like marx brothers these guys are real and slightly diverse they react to situations like any of us might well we may not throw a <UNK> when our performance hats are late to the gig or pull guns and beat down a record company <UNK> but you get the picture n n as w with h hats takes itself seriously enough to reel you in then you're hooked rent or get this at all costs even if you're not really into rap music this will still leave you <UNK> out loud comparing this to <UNK> is like comparing george <UNK> star wars to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i think you see my point
<START> joseph l <UNK> is not remembered by most today as one of the finest directors in hollywood history but this film proves that he is already a success by doing sophisticated american dramas such as a letter to three wives and all about eve as well as successfully adapting shakespeare to life in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> does a marvelous job of bringing this hit broadway play to film and does it with style marlon brando is perfect as sky masterson even if he can't sing too well he is the only actor who could pull it off perfectly wit his sheer <UNK> and clarity frank sinatra is a wonderful singer as expected and does a good job of acting as nathan detroit jean simmons is also very good as sarah brown and her scenes with brando <UNK> with great chemistry all supporting actors do their part especially <UNK> leonard as harry the horse in a very funny bit still <UNK> should be given most of the credit for bringing a fine musical in its own right to the screen in such a way that it feels authentic in many scenes but is still a story in its own world all in all guys and dolls is a great musical and works on many levels it normally should not have
<START> uma thurman plays sissy a young woman with a gypsy spirit and <UNK> large thumbs who <UNK> cross country eventually finding her true place amongst a group of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on a ranch devoted to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> rain bow phoenix is their lesbian leader bonanza <UNK> who falls in love with sissy thumbs or not gus van <UNK> directed and adapted tom <UNK> book but his satire has no primary target and just <UNK> all over the map like sissy maybe that was his goal but it's not involving for an audience notorious box office flop wasn't so much <UNK> as it was ignored and one can see why it's a series of sketches in search of a plot and the performances directorial touches and cinematography are all <UNK> thurman is a <UNK> posing alongside the highway trying to get a ride but this pretty much put the <UNK> on <UNK> career writer buck henry who didn't write this but perhaps should have gives the most assured performance as the doctor who works on one of those thumbs br br two thumbs down
<START> there's the danger with the critic <UNK> <UNK> zizek with his film directed by sophie <UNK> which takes together a wonderful <UNK> of silent horror sci fi surreal and other contemporary thrillers together to make his points <UNK> <UNK> comparisons to <UNK> but in the <UNK> guide to cinema he also makes even the more far reaching points a point of departure from any other analysis i've seen on a collective section of films while it doesn't cover the <UNK> territory <UNK> movie documentaries cover the same <UNK> are there and zizek has a definite love for all of these perverse examples and films primarily the work of hitchcock lynch chaplin and <UNK> yet one shouldn't go into seeing this if you can find it that is i got to see it almost by luck thinking zizek will just try and <UNK> all of the psycho sexual parts or parts referring it in an <UNK> deranged manner if anything he opens up one to points that might never be considered otherwise would one think of three of the marx brothers as <UNK> of the id super ego and ego <UNK> example is most dead on for me br br he's not just one to take on the classics though he also considers the food for thought in the matrix and fight club in <UNK> of the split between fantasy and reality and if the matrix needs the energy as much as the energy needs the matrix for the former and in the <UNK> of violence in dealing with one's own self as well as ones double in the latter he even throws in a piece from the pivotal moment in revenge of the <UNK> when <UNK> becomes darth vader and the <UNK> of <UNK> away <UNK> under that back mask at the very moment his children's <UNK> happens elsewhere the ideals of <UNK> male sexuality the male point of view in turning fantasy into reality at which point zizek rightfully points to as the moment of a <UNK> creation and female <UNK> are explored perhaps most dead on with vertigo this too goes for a scene that zizek <UNK> as if it's the <UNK> film where he <UNK> the three <UNK> points of psycho sexual stance in the <UNK> you look at <UNK> scene in blue <UNK> br br now it would be one thing if zizek himself went about making these sincere excited and somehow plausible points just face on to the camera or mostly in voice over as scorsese does but he goes a step further to <UNK> his points of fantasy and reality and how they <UNK> <UNK> become one and the same or spread off more <UNK> into some <UNK> or <UNK> feeling for some characters i e lost highway by putting himself in the locations the films take place in funniest is first seeing him in the boat heading towards the same <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> boat heads to at the beginning of the birds equally funny is as he waters the blue <UNK> lawn he goes on to explain the multi <UNK> points of frank booth only one when he's in <UNK> like territory does it seem a little cheesy but zizek seems to be having a lot of fun with this set up and after a while one <UNK> the potential <UNK> of this gimmick and <UNK> words come through br br there were some films i of course would've expected <UNK> from hitchcock and lynch but a treat for movie buffs come from seeing two things the movies that one would never think of seeing in a film about films titled the <UNK> guide of cinema top two for me would be the disney <UNK> cartoon and the exposition on <UNK> films albeit with a great note about the power and distinction of <UNK> and the ones that one hasn't seen yet i e the <UNK> horror film dr <UNK> stalker among a few others that inspire immediate feelings of <UNK> i have to see that immediately no questions asked ' zizek is a powerful writer with his work and puts it forward with a clarity that reminds one why we watch movies in the first place to be entertained sure but also to have that actual experience of sitting down and having something up there as he put it looking into a toilet it's probably one of the greatest films about cinema and in such a <UNK> narrow analysis of how <UNK> works its way into films regarding desire the id super ego ego and of the supernatural in fantasy that you may never see unless distribution finally kicks in if only on the smallest levels
<START> this movie is by far the worst movie ever made if you have to create a film <UNK> the guy who plays lars in <UNK> than don't make the damn film i have to say that i could watch <UNK> in space 6 times before i could watch the trailer for this <UNK> of a movie adam sandler should be <UNK> from any movie after this disgrace watching this movie is like a mix of listening to cher and willingly putting your dick in a <UNK> anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime if i had an extra dollar and had to spend it i'd give it to the support <UNK> <UNK> foundation before buying this movie
<START> i say <UNK> <UNK> in that line because frankly i've not seen a hal hartley movie until now it's not that i haven't heard of him though as he was seen as one of those small ny filmmakers when i say small i mean even smaller than jim <UNK> who made ultra personal projects on limited budgets in an ironic way much as with <UNK> <UNK> though in a slightly different context fay grim interests me to see some of hartley's more acclaimed features because there seems to be at least present some semblance of talent behind it as if hartley could be a very good filmmaker who may be so good he's just taken a big experimental <UNK> or on the other hand he could just be someone far too impressed with his own <UNK> and would be godard like cinematic <UNK> br br i can't quite explain the story which may or may not be a problem i suppose however it's not really in due to not having seen the film that <UNK> fay grim henry fool i think even if i had that experience it wouldn't make too much of a difference based on the final results there's a lot of international espionage a double plot wrapped inside of another that's fallen through the fake <UNK> of the title character played in an <UNK> way by parker posey not sure if that's good or bad either maybe both and also involving a cia <UNK> jeff goldblum as usual a solid presence amid the <UNK> even <UNK> some laughs not to mention an orgy laden picture box and author henry fool it's not that the script is totally <UNK> however much it goes into over extended <UNK> just for the sake of it because there are some touches of witty or <UNK> strange dialog br br quite simply the direction just sucks <UNK> is in love with the third man which is fine but he <UNK> a consistently headache inducing style of everything being <UNK> in angle with characters having to get into frame equally oddly not since battlefield earth in fact has a director come off so annoyingly in trying to make the unnecessary choice of titled angles for some bizarre dramatic effect only this time hartley isn't amid a <UNK> f he's mostly responsible for it this along with the crazy wannabe godard title cards that pop in here and there some a little amusing and some just totally stupid and the montage segments all in still shots and a couple of moments involving action that almost call to mind ed wood <UNK> any of the potential that is in the script which is already fairly hard to <UNK> in a way it's fascinating to watch how bad this all goes but a kind of fascination that comes in seeing the flip side to total creative control on a sort of small scale story br br but let it be known you'll likely not come across a more <UNK> pretentious example of american independent film making this year
<START> the cars in this movie are awesome the acting in this movie is awful the plot and driving scenes don't make much sense and are equally bad if you get really bothered by movies where someone shifts and suddenly goes ridiculously faster save yourself the trouble and money good movie for racing fans well there is a part where they make the mistake of referring to a <UNK> driver as a <UNK> car driver if you can't tell the difference go watch it you'll have a blast it really comes down to this there are really really really nice cars in this movie they are driven horribly and are completely unrealistic the acting is horrible mainly because of the extremely bad plot if you want to see hot girls turn on mtv or <UNK> instead i am disappointed that such nice cars would be represented in such a bad movie if the class of the cars were to match that of the movie they should be racing with <UNK> <UNK>
<START> seriously i mean very seriously when i first started watching the show i thought it was good but the plots just got worse the storyline were either too boring or predictable george isn't always funny he sometimes acts stupid his jokes are overdone his mom is the <UNK> character of the show how can a mother treat her own son that way okay if it was the daughter in law but this was her own son i give this show a 4 10 just because the first few shows were a little funny the actors <UNK> marie and <UNK> <UNK> do a great job don't know how these shows get to play for so long br br if you're really bored like i was and have nothing else to watch i'd suggest you watch this
<START> first off i must say that i made the mistake of watching the election films out of sequence i say unfortunately because after seeing election 2 first election seems a bit of a disappointment both films are gangster epics that are similar in form and while election is an enjoyable piece of cinema it's just not nearly as good as it's sequel br br in the first election installment we are shown the two <UNK> for <UNK> big d and <UNK> after a few scenes of discussion amongst the <UNK> as to who should have the <UNK> title they almost <UNK> decide that <UNK> simon <UNK> will <UNK> the <UNK> suffice to say this doesn't go over very well with <UNK> big d tony <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and in a <UNK> to influence the <UNK> big d kidnaps two of the <UNK> in order to <UNK> the election board to his side this has disastrous results and heads the <UNK> into an all out war <UNK> is determined to become <UNK> but won't become official until he can recover the dragon head <UNK> a material representation of the <UNK> power the current <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wang has hidden the <UNK> somewhere in <UNK> china and the race is on to see who can recover it first br br much of the film is devoted to the <UNK> of the <UNK> as both aspiring leaders search for it they must dodge cops and opposite sides which leads into one of the stand out scenes in election which involves an <UNK> named jet nick cheung a <UNK> and lots of bad guys nick <UNK> presence is attention grabbing to say the least i wonder if this influenced director <UNK> to in any way while making the second election as he does deliver more of <UNK> character in the sequel br br while nick cheung gives a scene stealing performance i must not fail to give due to the rest of the film's actors election has a great ensemble cast with well thought out performances that are both subtle and <UNK> simon <UNK> is his usually glorious self and the film also benefits from <UNK> hk actors like louis <UNK> tony <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the under appreciated <UNK> <UNK> there really aren't any weak <UNK> in the acting and one could easily believe that they're watching real gangsters br br although the performances are great one of the most impressive things about election is <UNK> <UNK> eye for the camera there are some truly striking shots in the film and it goes without saying that to definitely knows how to frame his shots as the viewer is treated to a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera <UNK> and angles all of which makes election above all a great looking film br br my issues with the film <UNK> mostly out of the <UNK> amount of characters involved in election it gets a bit hard to follow because the film is so full of characters that aren't integral to the plot while the sequel <UNK> to focus more on the two candidates the first election offers the election process as a whole with tons of <UNK> <UNK> and police officers <UNK> the storyline maybe the film would have worked better if it would have been a bit longer with more time dedicated to the inner <UNK> of the <UNK> or if director <UNK> to would have <UNK> down the necessary elements and <UNK> on them more br br bottom line all in all this is a wonderfully brutal film with a great cast excellent direction and <UNK> pacing that packs a punch it's just a little more complicated than it needed to be
<START> i like the good and evil battle i liked eddie in this movie better than any movie he has ever done he wasn't the smart cocky know it all he usually plays he shows heart and a more humble humor the fact that it shows there are stranger things in heaven and on earth than we can think of gives me hope
<START> released two years before i was born this oscar winning movie has it all lavish technicolor sets and costumes breathtaking cinematography superb wall to wall gershwin music superior choreography a lighter than air screenplay and great performances by kelly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and caron hollywood doesn't make 'em like this anymore definitely this is my favorite movie of all time a standard by which i judge all other films enjoy enjoy enjoy
<START> is it a coincidence that <UNK> was made two years after jaws <UNK> isn't exactly a jaws rip off but it is obvious that it tried to profit from <UNK> success first of all <UNK> in my opinion was a bad movie not terrible but definitely not good average at best br br the plot is basically a male killer whale <UNK> after seeing its mate and its unborn <UNK> killed by a <UNK> seeks revenge i couldn't stand to watch this movie again the direction of this film is poor and when compared to jaws it looks like the director producers and writers were almost talentless br br as for the acting it was very average and believable however the actual characters aren't the least bit likable the effects were alright for its time and the footage of the killer whale looked pretty good br br the violence is confusing bloody and not recommended for more sensitive people the music is overdone and very loud drowning out the sound effects and irritating at times i hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale killer <UNK> don't mate with only one mate as depicted in <UNK> br br overall this movie was bad poor in my opinion because of the reasons listed above some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of vengeance amongst animals and humans so i'm not going to bash this movie and i can understand why some people may like it br br my rating 3 5 10 but for its concept possibly a 5 10
<START> i was looking on <UNK> bottom 100 because i thought id never seen anything as bad as plan 9 from <UNK> or roller ball remake i was wrong ben and arthur has beaten both br br this out of the many countless amount of movies i've seen is the number one worst film on the i ever saw bad directing bad characters horrible acting horrible story there's a reason nobody but sam ever says anything positive about this film sam was a horrible annoying actor but his directing was so bad he may just <UNK> ed wood br br the director should be ashamed of his work unfortunately i have to give it at least 1 star but it deserves to be continued stars
<START> i have lately got into the habit of <UNK> any interesting dvd that the <UNK> company releases i figure that even if i dislike the movie <UNK> usually supplies enough extra material to compensate for any shortcomings in the actual film i read up on them and i buy the ones which are the most interesting to me br br le million is my latest purchase and i must say that i was not disappointed in the film it is <UNK> funny and romantic everything about it is quite excellent the songs are wonderful if i understood french i would probably hum them and sing them all day long the acting is very good for this kind of movie american musicals of the classic hollywood era relied more on song and dance than the actual characters and story but in le million the characters are rather well developed and the story while not being anything extremely impressive is not at all lacking i loved the developments of the relationships especially the relationship between the once best friends michel and <UNK> the romantic moments are also very well developed the direction is nearly perfect with several very memorable moments probably the single most perfect scene of the film occurs right after the lead couple has an argument they hide on the stage of an opera performance and the opera singers sing lines which the couple michel and <UNK> interpret to their own situation this is definitely one of the high points in cinema history the scene managed to make me laugh to win me over with a very sweet romance and make me <UNK> at just how clever the director was i give this film a 9 10 br br p s some information for anyone who has the same faith in <UNK> that i do and is planning to buy it amongst the <UNK> <UNK> i now own le million contains the <UNK> features all it has is a photo gallery not all that useful one might flip through it once and a rare television interview with <UNK> <UNK> the director this piece is of some interest he was one of the many directors who had started out in silent film and when <UNK> were first appearing he said that they represented the death of film i think most film <UNK> people understand what these directors meant when they said that but it is interesting to hear him explain it also if you have read the description of this movie on amazon com please note that they were wrong in one important respect not every line in the film is sung in fact it contains no more songs than a regular musical it is actually a lot more like a chaplin or buster keaton or marx brothers film my criticisms of the disc are not that important heck <UNK> has the right to <UNK> me around for making those complaints the fact is their people probably spent hundreds of hours <UNK> up a film which only 20 now 21 people have voted for on imdb and only about a hundred people if that will ever see the film heck if you look at the <UNK> web site le million is nowhere to be found i have no clue why not it's something they should really be proud of of course their web site is surprisingly horrible they did a fine job on this film bravo they deserve all the money i can stand to give them
<START> br br i really liked this film one of those rare films that hollywood really does not make anymore william h macy is just great as the hit man with a soul and <UNK> campbell is just flat out fantastic as the woman who puts his life on the track of redemption br br if you have a chance see this film it earns it's praise
<START> when i first found out that brian <UNK> was going to be in this movie i wanted to watch it took me weeks to realize that i've seen the original of this and loved it so i had even more reason to watch well i watched it was actually better than most sequels for tv movies i hate what happens to <UNK> character you can find out for yourself and i didn't like most of the characters <UNK> one included but the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerk like characters to make stanley <UNK> judd nelson shine once more at the end i was cheering for stanley and his own happy ending if you liked the original cabin by the lake or if you like horror movies without the blood i'd suggest you watch this
<START> pushing daisies is just a lovely fairy tale with shades of <UNK> 's aesthetic and romance it's got a beautiful palette its shots well thought out and detailed its names and dialogue whimsical and too <UNK> to be real its imagination great and its romance deep br br watch the blue in the sky pop out at you as blue can't be found in the rest of the sets or shots with few exceptions br br watch a <UNK> natural and totally satisfying song break out of a scene br br its score is gorgeous its cast is <UNK> likable there's great music and the two leading romantic stars can't touch each other or she'll die how much more sexual tension do you need actually i had wished they found a way around this one but <UNK> la <UNK> br br it is simply a show that it is a pleasure to spend an hour with and i recommend it highly there hasn't been other television quite like it and i would like to see more it got me through a <UNK> one crappy week as it makes for good company br br bring it back
<START> eddie izzard is nothing short of a comedic genius and this is eddie at his very best his material is extremely witty and hilarious and his delivery is some of the best ever witnessed on stage instead of insulting the audience's intelligence he relies on it to draw humor from his wardrobe <UNK> hitler the moon landing and the british with so many memorable laughs one can't help but repeat some of his lines forever more do you have a flag should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a <UNK> routine every fan of top notch <UNK> comedy needs to see dress to kill by far the best british <UNK> comedian i've ever witnessed eddie izzard has <UNK> for success off of the live stage however his lack of commercial success in film should not be <UNK> of how extremely talented he genuinely is dress to kill is a treasure one that luckily has found its way to home video and can and should be enjoyed again and again
<START> the past few months i have <UNK> voyager seasons 4 to 7 on dvd i only had 1 to 3 on video before that because <UNK> is my favourite character and have just reached the end i saw them when they were originally shown on tv here in the uk but had forgotten most of it am i satisfied with the ending i think i am naturally as i fan i would have liked to have seen more about what happened to the characters when they got home but that's left to our imagination in many ways <UNK> is similar to next <UNK> all good <UNK> the involvement of the crew in the future but mainly the captain a new romance starting in the finale <UNK> and <UNK> in next gen and seven of nine and <UNK> here which results in death in the future i truly loved <UNK> fair to all characters <UNK> appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier <UNK> gives birth to her daughter with loving husband tom <UNK> is ill but returning home means he can be <UNK> harry has always been the most anxious and determined but admits the journey is important the doctor in the future is well respected by all and finally chooses the name joe but of course the captain has the largest role meeting her future self who wants to get the crew home earlier to prevent <UNK> the <UNK> are involved as they have played a massive part in this period of voyager alice <UNK> plays the <UNK> queen again fantastically just her voice and acting method are magnificent i feel sorry for <UNK> thompson though the tv <UNK> queen replaced by the movie <UNK> queen maybe she wasn't available though the special effects are fantastic the <UNK> sub space <UNK> and the <UNK> queen falling apart it's very tense especially when they come out of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and say their location is right where they thought they'd be after they'd said they'd have to go in a <UNK> that leads back to the <UNK> <UNK> and what a wonderful idea to get inside a <UNK> <UNK> for protection on the dvd special features they say it was like the <UNK> horse voyager could have continued if it was more popular they would have stuck with their original idea of the crew <UNK> the ship is their home like in harry's speech and what tom said because his wife and child are there and then they could have got home in a film br br overall voyager was a bit hit and miss the sixth season seemed to be one good one followed by one less than good one the two episodes set in the <UNK> irish village are horrible my perception of seven of nine was that she took over it all <UNK> around her which wasn't true when she first appeared season 4 was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it <UNK> out after that and her character is ingenious at times 20 years as a <UNK> <UNK> gradually <UNK> her humanity i like her especially in someone to watch over me <UNK> and human error when <UNK> <UNK> was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side that was lovely <UNK> became my least favourite character gone was the chemistry with <UNK> will they won't they and you'd never think he was first officer he's completely pushed aside most of the time i loved seeing tom and <UNK> relationship <UNK> against the odds i always liked <UNK> a lot <UNK> was good at times especially when he lost his logic gained emotion and was friends with <UNK> harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times the doctor is probably my favourite seeing how far he comes and comedy situations he creates <UNK> <UNK> doctor spy is fantastic <UNK> is my favourite captain of any series and you can tell kate <UNK> is really enjoying it br br i wish there was more i love voyager
<START> hey if you have a little over an hour to kill and find paint to be too exciting i'd suggest it if <UNK> you happen to like cheap b movies like me it's good for a giggle other than that i wouldn't suggest that you rent it i'd wait till it comes on the tube say round 4 am on the free access channel of your cable satellite <UNK> the band that did this sound track by the way was on the road after for about two years after this flick and no they sounded just as bad live according to the two small town reviews i could find on them so once again good if you find grass growing to much fun but good to watch if you like to see how not to shoot a low budget movie
<START> a young woman comes to the home town of his husband after he passed away in an accident she barely <UNK> down in this small town but shortly after loses her little son in a kidnapping and all her hopes this could lead to all kinds following plots in a normal movie find a new partner and being happy finally or depressed enough to struggle and finally kill herself she does try to kill herself but not after a series of severe fights with god she <UNK> in god only to find that god seems to forgive everyone even the killer well i should be careful here about god the movie doesn't mean a thing against god the way the movie deals the issue is quite interesting not in the woman's point of view or from god's perspective in this way there would be lots of grass growing clouds flying views i suppose rather it's from a third <UNK> eye the movie let us to perceive and doesn't explain a thing br br the movie wouldn't be so interesting were there only the woman there's this man who's everywhere around the woman and obviously in love with her but in his own way he's a funny guy like a clown i should say who shamelessly hangs around our heroine the combination of these two the woman full of tension crying and throwing up always and the man smiling and talking <UNK> ends up in a good balance of emotions nothing <UNK> wrong or too tedious br br highly recommend
<START> <UNK> wasted minutes of my life i fell asleep the first time i attempted watching it and i must say i'm not one to ever fall asleep in the cinema br br i have never seen such a pointless plot acted in such a stilted and forced manner and can only <UNK> that the actors were as hard up as the protagonist writer allegedly was in the film itself br br everything in this dire adaptation is <UNK> and if it isn't the wooden acting almost as though you can see the <UNK> then the set itself which is <UNK> and <UNK> in utterly unnecessary ways and <UNK> to an <UNK> extent is enough to put you off the entire farce br br as to the supposed shock of a detective under disguise any person who does not see that as well as the entire rest of this ludicrous plot <UNK> light years in advance should check their <UNK> immediately br br bad acting and from two very decent actors coupled with the hyper <UNK> branagh trademark <UNK> is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than <UNK> yourself br br on top of it all there is a completely <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> in this <UNK> towards the end of it all i can hope for is that this was such a flop that people <UNK> try to <UNK> this level of cinema ever again
<START> my personal opinion is that this movie had no real story line to the first john carpenter's vampires but i don't care i loved it jon bon <UNK> derek was great in this movie he really mad me believe that he was the person you would never think he was a famous <UNK> there were some bad things about this movie like the story line there should have been more to the movie there should have been a sequel to the movie that followed the movies story line and they should have kept the same main characters in all three vampires movies i really liked the clothes that the people wore and the setting they pick in mexico i liked how it was old mexico and not new mexico with the clay houses and the old fashion <UNK> i was a little confused with the vampires and how they were able to walk in <UNK> but it was cool how they didn't follow dracula vampire rules
<START> i've seen some bad things in my time a half dead cow trying to get out of <UNK> high mud a head on <UNK> between two cars a thousand <UNK> <UNK> on a kitchen floor human beings living like animals br br but never in my life have i seen anything as bad as the cat in the hat br br this film is worse than <UNK> worse than hitler worse than <UNK> the <UNK> worse than people who put <UNK> in <UNK> br br it is the most disturbing film of all time easy br br i used to think it was a joke some elaborate joke and that mike myers was maybe a high cocaine <UNK> drug <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who lost a bet or something br br i <UNK>
<START> pretty awful but watchable and entertaining it's the same old story if you've lived through the 80s vietnam vets fight together as buddies against injustice back in the states a team meets death wish my favorite br br time goes on the soldiers go home and years later a friend is in trouble no wait in fact the friend is dead and it is his dad that's in trouble our first hero joey is killed by an exceedingly horrifying super <UNK> meat <UNK> as he tries to defend his father's small store from the local protection gang despite being wheelchair bound from the war desperate for help the father talks to <UNK> the leader of <UNK> old unit from vietnam when <UNK> shows up for the funeral br br well the <UNK> wheel gets the grease and the old gang <UNK> up for the city you can pretty much imagine most of the rest of the movie br br the one thing that drove me crazy is that <UNK> keeps <UNK> his men about planning and about how they're really good at what they do when they plan ahead but joey wouldn't have been put in a wheelchair by a <UNK> in vietnam in the first place if the unit hadn't been messing around then when things are going really well in the city as they battle the gangs they do it again for no reason at all they completely <UNK> their plan and try to nail the gang without everyone being present <UNK> i raise my hands in disgust <UNK> br br there is also a suspicious moment when all present members of the unit make sure to try out the heroin they snatch from the gang to make sure it's real every single one of them hmm br br what are you going to do keep watching i guess the movie isn't too horrible to watch but it is a <UNK> there are all these climactic moments when nothing actually winds up happening the most dramatic things that happen are those at the beginning of the movie the <UNK> in vietnam <UNK> death battle and the gang brutally kicking an innocent teddy bear aside poor teddy br br i guess my main <UNK> with this movie is that i feel let down by it even the confusing subplots with mystery <UNK> and their <UNK> cross purpose motives wasn't enough to save it at the end but someday maybe it'll all come right and they'll make a sequel ha ha ha ha
<START> a failure the movie was just not good it has humor that 5 year olds that will not even giggle at i mean sure some parts were amusing but most of it is not lindsey <UNK> is a great actress and a bad singer and she should be working on better movies the movie should have been aired as a disney channel original movie that is free br br the only thing that was well done about this movie was the music nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to <UNK> up your day these songs are so good especially <UNK> and <UNK> walking on sunshine and <UNK> <UNK> beach boy song fun fun fun br br 4 out of 10 if i gave it a ten 9 of that would be the music and 1 will be the movie not worth your money but the soundtrack is
<START> this movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in hollywood the fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business the idea that audiences paid to see this movie and like an idiot i rented the film is <UNK> also br br obsessed teacher 3 years prior kills <UNK> family because he wants her for no reason he kills the mother father and brother from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction years later obsessed teacher breaks out of prison hmm usual bad writing no one in the town he <UNK> knows until the last minute obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a navy seal and can sneak around <UNK> out people and with a knife is super killer sure now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason <UNK> <UNK> for the fun of it and starts to hunt down the <UNK> friends now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you obsessed teacher <UNK> out of hotel again it is stupid ever cop would know his face but he walks right by them now he kills two cops outside <UNK> house and somehow <UNK> into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend br br there is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage if any other profession put out work of this low quality they would be fired yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash
<START> this collection of eleven short stories in one movie is a great idea and presents some great segments but also some disappointing surprises based on the tragic event of the september <UNK> 2001 in the united states of america eleven directors were invited to give their approach to the american tragedy the result of most of them is not only an individual sympathy to the american people but mainly to the <UNK> in the world with different cultures and people br br ken <UNK> uk presents the best segment about the september <UNK> 1973 in <UNK> when the <UNK> government of <UNK> <UNK> was destroyed by the dictator <UNK> <UNK> with the support of the usa br br the other excellent segments are the one of <UNK> <UNK> egypt showing the <UNK> in the world and the number of victims made by usa <UNK> in different countries along the contemporary history and the one of mira <UNK> india showing a true story of injustice and prejudice against a <UNK> family whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in usa when he was indeed a hero br br some segments are beautiful <UNK> <UNK> iran shows the innocent <UNK> <UNK> children preparing an <UNK> shelter against bombs while their teacher tries to explain to them what happened on the other side of the world the romantic claude <UNK> france shows the life of a couple in new york nearby the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shows the effects of their war in a small location and the lonely protest of <UNK> sean penn is very poetic showing that life goes on and <UNK> <UNK> story is probably the most impressive showing that there is no holy war but sadness and disgrace br br the segment of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is very naive but pictures the terrible poor conditions of this african nation br br the segment of <UNK> <UNK> israel is very boring and manipulative showing more violence and terrorism br br the segment of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is very disappointing horrible without any inspiration and certainly the worst one br br my vote is seven br br title brazil 11 de <UNK> september 11
<START> personally i think that the film was done very <UNK> i loved the choreography and the acting the plot is also gripping and mysterious the film itself is very emotional and what i liked about it most is that it makes you think afterwards antonio <UNK> has absolutely lived his role to the end and i must say that it's one of my favourite pictures and <UNK> is a wonderful director
<START> i make just one <UNK> for this film there are far far too many wide angle close ups and if they <UNK> you beyond <UNK> fair enough they drove me <UNK> for the first ten minutes or so but after that i made a kind of a <UNK> with the terrible cinematography and long before the end of the film i had <UNK> to care this is too rich a comedy to be destroyed so easily it's hilarious it's witty the comic delivery of all of the cast is flawless and however much <UNK> peers at his characters through a cold fish eye lens he may not care for them much he manages to present them with warmth mystery <UNK> is in fact not only funnier not only more clever but also deeper than anyone seems to have given it credit for being the jokes in the austin powers movies for instance as well as being less funny than the jokes here are also much more <UNK> the satire of mystery <UNK> bites when there's something worth biting and <UNK> gently when there isn't it doesn't mock just any old thing which is why contrary to what some i must regard them as <UNK> critics have said it never runs out of ideas br br the <UNK> heroes are an attractive bunch sure they're second rate but they're not merely second rate the blue <UNK> for instance does nothing but throw <UNK> at people and he isn't that good at it on the other hand neither is he <UNK> bad he's better in his limited field than most people and he does <UNK> <UNK> he's not a <UNK> which makes him a much funnier character than if he was if superman is christ in a cape the mystery men are all the minor <UNK> from the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> much funnier also much more endearing
<START> an okay film with a fine leading lady but a terrible leading man <UNK> <UNK> who plays the husband is a truly bad actor <UNK> <UNK> on the other hand is the movie's saving grace she's the best actor of the bunch br br note the first comment by the fellow who <UNK> praise upon the movie and according to his imdb com account has only written one review and guess for what movie is obviously a plant while the movie is nicely shot it's by no means subtle or great or whatever other <UNK> <UNK> the reviewer used br br art of revenge is a fair movie but it's a big <UNK> it offers up all manner of sexual situations but never goes through with it like watching a skin flick on <UNK> but with all the naughty bits edited out br br the film as a whole is a bit <UNK> and the ending and much of the third act is really a big mess there's a twist ending of course since every movie nowadays finds it necessary to have a twist ending br br a 4 out of 10 br br
<START> i liked this movie sort of reminded me of my marriage it is very clean you can see it with family very nicely done songs are ok too i think the writer director is great the movie shows how <UNK> progress thru time they have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their life the film beautifully depicts quite a few stages in parallel in the same story some of the dialogs are quite good the movie depicts complex human emotion very nicely not with over <UNK> also shows perfect is after all not so perfect shows very nicely the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new the movie is very well written and directed
<START> ok the movie is good but i give it a 1 because the idea of a computer virus becoming an <UNK> virus is pure fairy tale this kind of crap just adds to those <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> paranoid <UNK> that a computer virus is exactly like an <UNK> virus first of all strings of code and dozens of <UNK> and <UNK> add up to computer virus an <UNK> virus is much more complex even though it's way <UNK> though it's considered one of the <UNK> forms in the universe <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> into your cells and <UNK> themselves to the <UNK> then change your own <UNK> code explain to me how something like that could be <UNK> from a <UNK> maybe the radiation has some effect on the <UNK> <UNK> that turns your <UNK> into these <UNK> i could see that but obviously the writer didn't think of that
<START> i initially gained interest in this film after reading a review saying this movie reminded the reviewer of silent hill br br being a huge silent hill fan and disappointed with it's movie debut i thought i would give this one a chance mind <UNK> only lists this movie as dark floors not by it's full name so when i saw the name mr <UNK> in the credits i immediately thought of the band i had a few friends in college that like them but didn't think it was important and quickly pushed the thought aside br br the film starts out strong despite the fact creepy little girl has been done to death the good use of audio and sense of isolation really started to piece the the story together the tense atmosphere built rapidly and every indication pointed to the film being excellent as monsters are the true stars of horror i couldn't wait to see what was lurking in the <UNK> of the hospital the main characters had found themselves trapped in br br and then the first monster showed up and i found myself greatly <UNK> by the time the second appeared i <UNK> at the fact it looked like it had just come from a <UNK> concert and the silliness turned me off completely br br over the course of the movie the atmosphere did remain intact and the story left you wondering just what was going on but the scares were pretty much non existent however i held out hope that the end would make it all worthwhile unfortunately that was not to be the case by the time the movie had reached it's climax i was in utter disbelief and i immediately recognized the big bad in his final reveal the lead singer of <UNK> seriously br br was that what the movie all boiled down to a bunch of poor souls being chased around a hospital by <UNK> band members the silly monster design suddenly made sense if you're going to be that corny may as well through the members of marilyn <UNK> or even kiss in there too not to mention the fact that i'm pretty sure i saw the ending in one of <UNK> music videos a few years ago they had to go and make an entire movie off of it br br worst of all when i found out what really had been going on all i could manage was a yawn i'm not going to ruin it for you but i can safely say it's probably a plot device you've seen before most likely more then once br br so unless you're a huge <UNK> fan stay away from this it's not scary it doesn't bring anything new to the table although it does a decent job of <UNK> from other horror movies mainly silent hill and i can't stress this enough <UNK> is the antagonist <UNK> talk about a <UNK> br br really you'd be better off trying to scare yourself watching <UNK> music videos in other words it's just not possible
<START> i bought this on dvd for my brother who is a big michelle pfeiffer fan i decided to watch it myself earlier this week br br it is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines the section with michelle pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two she plays a rising hollywood actress who has had many short <UNK> relationships she literally <UNK> into brian <UNK> a regular married guy with kids after driving her car into the back of his after being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out what happens at the end i was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine tv direction takes any drama out of the plot br br the other section involves an old studio boss played by darren <UNK> this section actually has the better cast with kenneth <UNK> lois <UNK> steven bauer stella stevens they all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to <UNK> they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere br br it passes the time but is not all that interesting and i am glad this was not bought for me i am not a michelle <UNK> fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress overall though unless you are a fan of hers avoid this as it is very routine
<START> the novel is easily superior and the best parts of the film are direct <UNK> from what greene wrote for instance the quiet but grim humour that breaks into the scenes with boyer and lorre or the murdered child obsession that takes over some of the plot where the film <UNK> from the novel it tends to the ludicrous br br however i don't want to suggest that the film is bad in any way it always looks the part and the story stays in the mind like a good <UNK> some of the minor characters were stock actors who could turn their hand to anything br br it's a dreadful shame that the film's not available on dvd
<START> pretty bad movie offers nothing new the usual <UNK> and <UNK> attempt to make up for a muddled but thin story acting is barely above pathetic why liam neeson signed on for this is anyone's guess owen wilson truly turns in one of the worst performances in recent horror movie history catherine zeta jones is fun to look at and not much else although <UNK> <UNK> did an above average job the special effects were fairly memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and <UNK> gorgeous however they can't makeup for the poor acting and the storyline which appears to have been thrown together at the last minute don't bother
<START> four teenage girlfriends drive to <UNK> <UNK> for spring break unfortunately they get a flat tire in <UNK> georgia and one of the girls witnesses a brutal murder deep in the woods the local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins shallow grave is a pleasant low budget surprise the cast is likable enough the direction is steady and the violence is particularly nasty and misogynistic especially the second murder is pretty grim the murderous sheriff isn't one dimensional character in a couple of scenes it seems that he feels <UNK> for what he's done the subplot involving the two boys they meet in the diner goes nowhere but the stalking scenes in the woods are tense and exciting 7 out of 10
<START> wonderland is the fascinating film <UNK> the x rated film star john c holmes involvement in the brutal wonderland murders br br the movie's promotion <UNK> one into thinking this a <UNK> portrayal of the porn industry in the vein of boogie nights and that is not the case here in fact except for a few references made by <UNK> that john holmes is a porn star and a brief montage of real life footage of john holmes this film is strictly drama about a fallen <UNK> involvement with murder and how it happened br br despite being <UNK> the film is actually engaging the acting from all the cast is excellent and i'd like to say that val kilmer is amazing in his ability to get down all the mannerisms of john holmes i was completely convinced that i was watching what john c holmes probably looked and acted like in real life br br if you are a john c holmes fan or like stories about hollywood then i think you will enjoy watching wonderland
<START> this was stupid funny movie cheech and chong are the <UNK> wasted guys ever i rate this film a 7 but if you like this one then go see jay and <UNK> there funnier and <UNK> now cheech is a <UNK> working on kids movies <UNK> chong
<START> from the critical acclaim i expected more from this movie and from <UNK> <UNK> the story just <UNK> along and didn't seem to have a point or a plot and i find it hard to believe that a 14 year old girl mature for her age or no would be so <UNK> about getting the loss of her virginity over with maybe i am too young to relate i was four years old in 1976 but i didn't have any problems connecting with the stories of shakespeare in love or life is beautiful and i wasn't alive for either of those settings the cast is very good but unfortunately for them the script did not <UNK> them to engage the audience overall <UNK> had its moments but unless you are yearning to <UNK> over <UNK> tops and tube <UNK> i would say skip this one
<START> flat ordinary thriller about a conniving woman who <UNK> all those she supposedly loves in order to boost her bank account nicole kidman plays the <UNK> <UNK> married to the <UNK> andy bill <UNK> when an old school friend of <UNK> named jed hill alec baldwin turns up as the resident surgeon trouble is not far behind him br br script fails in that it does not carefully develop the promising premise into an effective <UNK> thriller and the severe lack of character motivation background and development leaves the whole show reaching none of the cast are able to generate interest in their shallow characters especially bill <UNK> whose own inexplicably curious andy is impossible to believe br br poor director harold <UNK> is left trying to <UNK> an <UNK> dead project and is unable to make entertainment from any of it by the time the <UNK> of the plot is revealed you just won't care br br at least the cinematography has <UNK> looking good also stars george c scott peter <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br sunday <UNK> 25 1996 t v
<START> this movie is awesome for three main reasons it is <UNK> beautiful i absolutely loved that there is a bold color theme throughout the movie with extraordinary costumes and <UNK> sets a photography which looks very <UNK> and probably was not <UNK> the look i always enjoy those stories about groups of <UNK> <UNK> coming together and becoming a family sometimes they fall into clichés but this one does not this group of actors really portrays well flawed yet extremely likable characters alan <UNK> is the best between him the van and the road movie theme i could not help but remember my favorite movie of last year little miss <UNK> i discovered <UNK> <UNK> very interesting actor and just got annoyed a tiny little bit by <UNK> <UNK> performance at times the opening scene all the scenes where they mess up their tricks are very funny there is a mix of humor and emotion throughout the film i like the end a lot and of course it is all about the magician theme a good magician is making the audience look where he wants them to to create an illusion which happens to be exactly what a movie director does and that's why they call it movie magic
<START> the fact that i watched this entire movie says something about it or me it is not a good movie terrible in fact but terrible in the way that kept my attention in that perverse manner that is akin to watching a tragedy and not being able to look away it would have made a great mst3k subject br br most of the things that make a terrible movie enjoyable are here bad dialogue inappropriate music contrived plot sequences ridiculous <UNK> you'll thrill to <UNK> mo death sequences the poor victims with mouths <UNK> and <UNK> too much time to contemplate their impending doom facing the outrageously contrived <UNK> of their deaths your heart will be <UNK> by old action scene cliches like when two women struggle for a gun and it goes off but who's shot both look at themselves then the other then themselves then seemingly 15 minutes later one finally goes down you'll sing along in latin of course with the street <UNK> that turn into a ghastly <UNK> choir that for a moment threatened to turn the movie into a twisted musical br br so if you believe like i do that as movies get worse they get better then this might be a decent choice for you it's not as funny as my current sci fi schlock favorite they live featuring <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but it's more fun to watch than luke warm movies like omen ii or iii br br i give it 4 out of 10
<START> written by the excellent <UNK> and directed by <UNK> this film was a slight disappointment it seemed too short it spent far too long creating the <UNK> atmosphere and laughing at the catholic demands then very quickly you have the fascist and <UNK> <UNK> for the family's attention and the terrible conclusion br br still my wife thought liam was cute
<START> hitler the rise of evil is clearly produced by people emotionally <UNK> by the horrors of world war 2 which makes watching a refreshing experience br br i think its greatest value lies in its crystal clear revealing of the nazi <UNK> of the utterly corrupt ways hitler used to make it to the top having arrived there this film ends br br when on top the <UNK> german for <UNK> led his germany to the biggest most devastating war in history of mankind ending six years later in <UNK> utter defeat as a result germany lost its eastern <UNK> about 35 of its <UNK> <UNK> and was forced to accept a <UNK> year split of its remaining territory both west and east germany had to be <UNK> from <UNK> their <UNK> severely damaged by the many nazi atrocities inspired by racism br br as i said hitler the rise of evil makes an good watch set in an acceptable thirties environment with more than competent acting in particular peter <UNK> role as the aged president von <UNK> stands out even adds an extra dimension br br my copy of hitler the rise of evil also provides a second dvd with two good documentary films one is about hitler's personality the second deals with the <UNK> of the hitler <UNK> in 1983 this <UNK> caused a hilarious scandal in england and germany <UNK> the <UNK> of several historians and <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> plot of dr fu <UNK> 1980 this is hands down the worst film i've ever seen what a sad way for a great comedian to go out
<START> the significance of french title of this film la <UNK> des <UNK> which literally means the birth of the <UNK> is rather obscure so it is perhaps not surprising that it has been <UNK> in english speaking countries as water <UNK> the <UNK> of the english title are three teenage girls marie anne and floriane who are members of a <UNK> swimming team based in the paris <UNK> and the film is a coming of age drama about the development of their first sexual feelings br br one feature of the film perhaps unusual for a film of this type is that it concentrates exclusively on relationships between the young people themselves we see nothing of their parents or their teachers and very little of the adult world at all the three girls are very different in appearance and are portrayed as being very different in character the shy <UNK> marie is slim and <UNK> and appears to be the youngest of the three anne is something of a plain jane floriane a glamorous blonde who is very popular with the boys the three together with a handsome male <UNK> named <UNK> are involved in what might be described as a love <UNK> br br anne has fallen in love with <UNK> but he is smitten with floriane who seems to return his affections although he is by no means her only male admirer indeed not all of <UNK> <UNK> are male because marie has a crush on her attractive friend the film <UNK> the way in which their friendship develops at first it seems that floriane is simply using marie as a convenient excuse when she is in fact going out to meet boys her parents presumably object to her dating boys but have no <UNK> to her going out with female friends later however we realise that despite <UNK> image as the sexy popular girl who is always the centre of male attention she actually <UNK> <UNK> feelings the film <UNK> some conventional stereotypes about sexuality anne with her short hair and rather <UNK> figure looks typically butch yet she is the only one of the three main characters who is <UNK> <UNK> whereas the more <UNK> feminine marie and the glamorous floriane are lesbian or at least <UNK> br br coming of age films are common enough although most of them tend to avoid the controversial topic of teenage <UNK> water <UNK> however deals with its subject matter in a sensitive way with three very good performances from its three leading actresses pauline <UNK> adele <UNK> and louise <UNK> the relationships between the characters especially that between marie and floriane are complex and capable of a number of interpretations is floriane for example simply using marie for sex or does she genuinely have romantic feelings for her could <UNK> <UNK> behaviour with <UNK> and the other boys be just a device to hide her lesbian feelings from the outside world or even to hide them from herself this was the first film made by its young director celine <UNK> only 27 at the time on this basis she must be regarded as a highly promising newcomer 7 10
<START> i saw this movie a few months ago in the town which appeared as <UNK> in the movie which is the only reason i went to see it another local who was there just <UNK> to me an email <UNK> of a repeat showing because the first had sold out and people were turned away his <UNK> comment in his forward is a good summary br br <UNK> br br unless you're a neil young fan or live in near <UNK> if the latter you know the real name skip this movie it's mostly an ego trip for the filmmaker it has no discernible plot the music is merely ok and too much of the lyrics are <UNK> making it impossible to follow what little <UNK> of plot there may be br br i don't need to put in a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give away br br i'd give this a 1 5 10 but that's just for the amusement value of seeing the locales made into a movie it wasn't worth the 6 i could rent a video camera and drive around <UNK> and make a better movie myself br br if you want to see a good <UNK> message movie with no plot go rent <UNK>
<START> it's very funny it has a great cast who each give great performances especially sally field and kevin kline it's a well written screenplay by andrew bergman honeymoon in vegas i don't like soap operas even though i never watch them but i do love this film because it's so crazy and off the wall that it beats the hell out of any stupid soap that they have on daytime television in my opinion it's the best film of 1991
<START> such a pretentious and lame attempt to <UNK> diabolical script and dialogue and truly embarrassing acting really the worse movie i have ever seen at the cinema nothing in my opinion saves this movie from being a total disaster i saw it when it came out in a cinema in <UNK> people were walking out and there were more people <UNK> outside the <UNK> than in the <UNK> at the end there were <UNK> and <UNK> from the <UNK> crowd left which was quite sad as relatives of one of the main actors were present and looked really <UNK> however the movie was that bad that i really could not feel like that sympathetic with them everybody has to start from somewhere and their son started off his acting career with this truly awful attempt at <UNK> made in the <UNK> 5 years have gone bye but sometimes i still cringe at the memory of that sad night at the movies this is a movie with no redeeming features whatsoever i gave it a 1 as 0 was not available they should <UNK> a <UNK> for everybody involved in this sorry mess of a movie i know some of them have moved on to better things the positive thing is that none of them could have <UNK> any lower than this
<START> this film wasn't <UNK> in italian cinemas i have seen it at a <UNK> called <UNK> i find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark the use of <UNK> colors is <UNK> and there's no <UNK> in the film music is completely out of the story and i don't have words to describe the visual effects if you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting but a few minutes later it becomes busy the story is interesting but the development needs a complete review
<START> the <UNK> yellow is a <UNK> psychological thriller with interesting characterizations barry jones and kenneth more are both terrific in supporting roles in characters that both have more to them than what meets the eye jean simmons is quite good and <UNK> howard makes a <UNK> offbeat suspense hero
<START> i recently started watching this show and i have to say that it really made me laugh you have to appreciate the unrealistic aspects of it along with everything else some other people said this show should have more realistic reactions of the dead among other things if you are going accept that ned can bring the dead back to life you have to accept that the other completely crazy bits of the show i couldn't help smiling after every episode i watched i really think it's great there is a show out there that can take a very strange subject and really make it great to watch i absolutely love the narration i think it adds that extra bit of wonder to the whole show you can't always compare old shows by a writer to his new ones you have to take everything as it's own <UNK> definitely give it a chance and just enjoy the ridiculous parts as they are
<START> 1936 was the most prolific year for astaire and rogers their second film for rko that year is the third film in this collection  mark <UNK> <UNK> the fleet ' this time out astaire is painfully uncomfortable as <UNK> baker a <UNK> on leave who just happens to stumble into the seedy <UNK> <UNK> where <UNK> martin rogers is <UNK> romantic sweet <UNK> in everyone's ear yep you guessed it  they're hot for each other once again only this time <UNK> <UNK> sister connie harriet <UNK> threatens the whole fine romance by falling for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> buddy <UNK> smith randolph scott a sort of use 'em up and toss 'em out kind of guy thus forcing <UNK> to <UNK> her opinion of all sailors in general irving berlin lends <UNK> class to the proceedings with his classic classy score including standards <UNK> yourself <UNK> <UNK> putting all my eggs in one <UNK> and <UNK> face the music and dance ' the latter a <UNK> inspired skit about suicide that turns into another immediately recognizable and thoroughly sublime <UNK> <UNK> for fred and ginger br br the transfer on <UNK> the <UNK> is a tad weaker the gray scale remains nicely balanced but now it's a tad thick looking with not nearly as much <UNK> variation as the previous titles grain is still present so are age related <UNK> once you've settled into to the slightly dense and sometimes more <UNK> focused image quality the overall impression is more than acceptable for a film of this vintage the audio is <UNK> but very nicely balanced extras include a <UNK> theatrical trailer and short subject but oddly  no audio commentary considering the importance of this film in the overall <UNK> of astaire rogers this is an <UNK> <UNK> from warner home video
<START> it's a strange yet somehow impressive story about love <UNK> i never run over such a twist off story in real life but i can image there is br br it's a story that promises to be sick from the title but after i watch it i didn't get this feeling of sickness which i would surely have regarding society rules it's something beautiful in this movie something impressive which i cannot <UNK> using any moral or society rules br br the movie focuses mostly on relation between <UNK> and alex you can see how this relation starts <UNK> and finally ends you feel the moment when this love <UNK> the first <UNK> <UNK> you feel the connection and no moment i though this is <UNK> you even hope it will not break in the end it cannot break it's not right you feel the pain of being hart broken in the end br br but i need also to add a negative spin to this comment i don't know if the story is not somehow showed to give the feeling that these relations are sick only in form but not in content you don't have the total story but only <UNK> when movie has started the relation between <UNK> and <UNK> was already in place so no clue about the nature of the relation you feel only a tension between them a fight between the need for love and desire to break this relation i think this line of <UNK> to <UNK> says all i want to stop and if you love me you will do as i ask you br br this movie will probably stir some questions about what is love and what is to be moral and where's the limit between them i don't know if the idea of this movie is love <UNK> all even social and moral standards or love is beautiful no matter how or where but in my opinion this movie is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think
<START> this film is a <UNK> little piece of film making from sam fuller which gives richard widmark the chance to show of some of his best most edgy acting in the role of skip mccoy a small time thief who stumbles onto a military secret while picking beautiful <UNK> jean peters pocket on a crowded bus it turns out candy was doing a favor for her ex boyfriend who's working for the <UNK> br br <UNK> there's a mystery here regarding <UNK> motives and skip spends much of the film <UNK> her <UNK> actually he seems to just initially assume that she's a <UNK> going so far as to pour beer in her face in a <UNK> gesture but the real question is  what's going on with skip what are his motives and why does candy like him so much why do we the audience want to like him so much basically what the film makers have done here is create a very striking male fatale in <UNK> character and his performance just as the male audience tends to <UNK> through the length of a film like the big sleep or the glass key along with the main characters whether the female character is <UNK> or just a pretty face the film makers have here created a similar <UNK> for female viewers widmark is handsome and there's also a charm in his <UNK> <UNK>  but the first two times he meets our leading lady he <UNK> her and then punches her in the face eventually the question becomes  would skip sink so low as to sell out his country for a buck his comments to the police like you're waving a flag at me make us suspect he would or is he simply out for revenge for the murder of his friend moe thelma ritter i'm not sure that the film gives us a <UNK> answer either way br br thelma <UNK> character work deserves special mention  she has created a truly <UNK> character here fuller isn't afraid to give her plenty of business  in the form of physical objects that she uses to draw the audience into her world particularly her used ties another example of <UNK> business would be the scene with victor perry an actor i've seen elsewhere used to less effect using the <UNK> to <UNK> candy br br the emphasis on <UNK> relationship with skip provides one of <UNK> most revealing honor among thieves themes in fact skip has the same kind of ease and the same kind of casual relationship with the police with the notable exception of capt tiger <UNK> <UNK> who has a grudge against him i loved the scene where he invited the cops in by name and offered them a beer when they came to pick him up at his shack those are the kind of details that make this film feel real  whether or not it really is realistic or whether that would matter are entirely separate questions br br all told i would say this is an essential crime film which displays a lot of the best and most <UNK> attributes of the film noir school of film making a predictable plot is off set by a host of colorful characters uniformly well performed cheap sets are disguised by the film's <UNK> pace and the final product feels a lot more substantial than it probably is this is the best film i've seen so far by sam fuller and helps me to see better why he's regarded as a master director  here he accomplished some things that i think he tried but ultimately failed to do in other films like the <UNK> <UNK> and shock <UNK> as far as very <UNK> acting styles and really gripping suspense this is one of my favorite performances from widmark that i've seen so far  and widmark was a talent that i'm tempted to say based on the few extraordinary films i've seen with him was comparable to that of alan <UNK> or <UNK> bogart although arguably he didn't make as many classic films
<START> given how corny these movies are you gotta figure that they must have had fun making them the movie focuses on a house that strangely <UNK> <UNK> lives there the inhabitants were author charles <UNK> <UNK> elliott with hair who gets haunted by one of his own creations philip grayson peter cushing who gets a little too close to a wax statue john reid christopher lee whose daughter's <UNK> is apparently a <UNK> and actor paul henderson jon pertwee on the verge of getting a little too much into character br br the house that <UNK> blood is actually worth seeing well duh it stars peter cushing and christopher lee aside from just being neat there might be some undertones it might be calling into question the issue of real horror vs assumed horror like in the shining we might ask whether the house hotel itself holds some memory of past events and if absolutely nothing else ingrid pitt as paul's co star is hot hot hot around the time that this came out she also starred in <UNK> dracula and the vampire lovers also with peter cushing maybe she like barbara steele will remain known only as a scream queen but mark my words she is a hot scream queen i'd like to see ingrid pitt and barbara steele co star in something br br i guess that the only weird scene so to speak is where <UNK> elliott is wearing a pink shirt and <UNK> jacket you read that right what kind of a name is <UNK> anyway oh well a very cool movie
<START> in <UNK> 101 <UNK> cruella de <UNK> was arrested by the london <UNK> police god bless them for attempting to steal and murder 101 <UNK> <UNK> all covered in mud and <UNK> she spent the next 4 years in the tin can now 4 years later she unfortunately was released from the jail i say that's about 28 years in dog years br br so in 2000 disney decided to release a sequel to the successful live action version of the classic film and it is <UNK> dubbed <UNK> <UNK> in it there is a <UNK> <UNK> added to the family oddball is the name i think i should know this since this was just shown on tv recently and the puppy had no spots also while cruella again played by glenn close has escaped again she wanted a bigger better coat made once again out of the <UNK> br br i especially liked the theme song i'm sure everybody loves the atomic dog song from the 70s or so and now we hear a bit of it in this movie br br <UNK> <UNK> is such a great film that i keep on wondering when will there be a <UNK> <UNK> lol br br 10 stars
<START> okay so i get it we're supposed to be horrified the idea has been planted a girl is doing her dad and taking photos of it call me over the shock rock genre but i call for the explicit <UNK> of an act before i can fall for this but don't expect me to watch a soft porn and become horrified that she is <UNK> her <UNK> i mean hasn't that convention become a bit abused in the adult film industry already <UNK> with <UNK> and <UNK> porn horror isn't what your mind can fool you into believing it is what actually exists in film this is where miike fails in visitor q <UNK> becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure
<START> peter falk is a diverse and accomplished actor the movie is well written and the acting seems like real life for all lovers of columbo this is a superior piece of work because it shows what a talent peter falk is he doesn't play a detective he plays a retired carpet salesman by the time the credits begin to role you already want to watch it again the interesting part of the movie is that the message will apply to every person that watches it the depth of its' <UNK> will be the only thing that <UNK> it is a shame that the <UNK> in hollywood only promote <UNK> and skin because this is the type of movie that the people in the business should be proud of this would be a great movie to turn into a live stage play
<START> it's telling that as of the entry of this comment no females have <UNK> a vote of any kind for this movie not surprisingly cheesy science fiction doesn't appeal to them quite as much if you like a good b movie and especially if you like to <UNK> them as you watch you will like this if you don't have fun watching bad movies this one's not for you
<START> going into a movie like i this i was expecting absolutely nothing entertaining except for a <UNK> of kills what i got was even less br br christmas eve <UNK> a kid witnesses his parents doing it while daddy is in a santa suit horrified he runs up the stairs and cuts himself the story begins 33 years later and harry <UNK> is your normal everyday joe <UNK> for the fact he's obsessed with santa after his boss makes fun of him he goes insane dressing up like santa and starts killing non santa believing <UNK> and his boss an <UNK> neighborhood catches up to him and just as they're about to torch him he drives his van off a cliff into the moon not the best ending i've seen but it was original br br it was a slow paced boring movie that really had no redeeming quality except when harry went <UNK> on the church goers there was hardly any gore and even the sex scenes were toned down br br too boring 4 out of 10
<START> <UNK> which was the lowest of the low actually struck gold with this moody little thriller they did the same thing a year earlier with <UNK> which is probably one of the finest low budget films ever made br br <UNK> is basically a one set film filled with <UNK> and shadows a technique used by most poverty row studios to hide the sets or lack thereof but here it works well the ghost of charles <UNK> better known as <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> around the swamp killing those involved in his <UNK> execution for murder and <UNK> some sympathy from the viewer his final victim is to be the daughter of the <UNK> he concentrates his wrath not only on those directly involved in his fate but their relatives as well br br <UNK> <UNK> does her usual imitation of someone in a coma that passes for her acting style she offers herself up to the <UNK> in order to put a stop to the killing but as a <UNK> to the audience the <UNK> sees the goodness of her gesture as a sign that his mission is complete and he returns to the <UNK> somewhat <UNK> if <UNK> who directed <UNK> has directed <UNK> she would be hanging from the nearest tree and the <UNK> job would be done but who's complaining it's not the story that is the major attraction but the <UNK> sets lighting and the general <UNK> of the piece it stands right behind <UNK> as <UNK> finest hour
<START> this seemed to be a good movie i thought it would be a good movie and throughout the movie i was hoping it would be a meaningful use of my time and yes i have to admit that the acting talent of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> naval where truly commendable but despite the best effort this movie falls short of effectively conveying a meaningful message which it seems is it seemed was what <UNK> <UNK> is trying to do the final point comes short and the ending seemed kind of <UNK> after all that happens a bit like real life in that respect but movies unlike real life ends in about <UNK> and the ending should leave the audience satisfied if indeed that was the director's intention this falls short in that respect and that is what disappoints me the most br br another aspect that concerned me was the national <UNK> <UNK> of the american characters they all seem to be <UNK> out of the same block seems to me that most american characters in indian english movies are based upon how common indians themselves perceive americans to be like and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring any sense of depth or complexity to any american in the movie br br these two aspects put together they make for a disappointing story
<START> dan the widowed father of three girls has his own advice <UNK> that will probably go into <UNK> after his wife's death he has taken time to raise his daughters having known no romance in quite some time nothing <UNK> him for the encounter with the <UNK> marie at a local book store in a <UNK> island small town on the ocean where he has gone to celebrate <UNK> with the rest of his big family after liking marie at first sight little <UNK> him when the gorgeous woman appears at the family compound after all she is the date of <UNK> brother mitch br br it is clear from the outset that dan and marie are made for one another and although we sense what the outcome will be we go for the fun ride that peter <UNK> the director wants to give us mr <UNK> an author and screenplay writer on his own has given us two excellent novels what's eating <UNK> <UNK> and an ocean in <UNK> and the delightful indie pieces of april which he also directed it's just a coincidence that both movies deal with families during <UNK> <UNK> br br the best thing in the film was the natural chemistry between the two stars steve carell and juliette <UNK> mr carell in fact keeps getting better all the time in many ways he remind us of jack lemmon in his take of comedy and serious material what can one say about ms <UNK> an intelligent actress and a bright presence in any film she proves she is right up to doing comedy convincing us about her marie br br the only sad note is the waste of talent in the picture john <UNK> diane <UNK> <UNK> leo <UNK> jessica <UNK> emily blunt allison <UNK> amy ryan have nothing to do they just serve as incidental music for decoration <UNK> cook who is seen as brother mitch <UNK> better because he gets to <UNK> more lines than the others br br dan in real life is a delightful film that will please everyone
<START> the neil simon's sunshine boys starring walter matthau and george burns is a funny comedy on the strange bond to the life and its <UNK> but the laughter always bitter taste seeing willy clark matthau and al lewis burns two big theatrical comedy actors now reduced on the <UNK> from the hard and <UNK> old age you can feel only anger and blue willy not ever surrender and continue to look work while al is tired for players and he is retired to the country in the house to his daughter the couple in his old time was truly funny and harmony but out the scene was a continue <UNK> and to <UNK> and for eleven years after their broken they not talk between now if they would work they must return together another time for do one of his best old sketch for a comedy story tv show the meets is explosive and <UNK> for the old <UNK> the neil simon's screenplay give a certain <UNK> spirit to the story and the melancholy and blue overwhelming the many gags and laughter succeeded to generate a good mix also thanks to a great couple walter <UNK> nomination academy award as best actor and george burns won the academy award as best support actor the two actors are very believable and real and the their harmony seems almost as they real work together for all that time and that <UNK> they not bear between them the movie is very touching also for its all <UNK> reality as the story is <UNK> and how the report love heat that <UNK> the two actors is totally real part to the strange but at the same time <UNK> <UNK> things to the life my rate is 7
<START> what a fun b movie <UNK> is absolutely beautiful and the scarecrow is a distinct and original he really brought me back to the monsters of the 80's the budget is obviously low and not everybody is pacino behind the lens but it doesn't matter because it never once takes itself seriously from the trailer trash redneck to the high flying martial arts moves of the scarecrow this is truly a b movie gem grab some <UNK> <UNK> and a couple friends and kick back and relax i enjoyed this film so much i went out a purchased all 3 scarecrow films sure they're not for everybody but to each his own sometimes you just have to set the thinking cap down and smile
<START> irene dunne finished her <UNK> career with this so so movie she should have gone out with a bang being the classy actress she was not in this <UNK> almost unknown film br br this lightweight comedy is okay but nothing special the first half of it is far better as it gets pretty stupid in the second half maybe irene could see the <UNK> on the wall and quit even her high pitched voice got a bit annoying in here <UNK> has it she was not happy with this film one can see why br br the story reminded me of a 1950s television sitcom speaking of that i thought david nelson from the <UNK> harriet tv show was in this movie but it turned out to be a very young richard crenna he looked and sounded just like nelson br br overall so so at best and a sub par ending for a great actress
<START> it was released in france on dvd several years ago i wish it would be re released with english subtitles do not confuse this with a remake with penelope <UNK> which gets poor reviews gerard <UNK> is a <UNK> who is told by a fortune <UNK> that he will marry the daughter of the king he sets off to join the army and goes to war his love however is gina <UNK> in an early movie for her i won't spoil the end gerard <UNK> died a few years later at a young age a great loss to <UNK>
<START> i don't see what everyone liked about this movie the set up was too long and talky and when it was done the main character remained as flat and <UNK> as he had been in the first scene after the film finally got cusack into the eponymous hotel room i had to wonder well what's going to happen here for the next hour or so to keep me engaged the answer not much just john cusack having a long drawn out mental breakdown br br maybe if the cusack character had more depth maybe if his freak out were a more <UNK> <UNK> of his everyday life maybe if the film had either better developed its half baked themes about loss and faith or had not tacked them on in the first place maybe if the film had made a choice to be either psychological horror or thrill ride horror and had fully <UNK> one of these styles i <UNK> all i do know is that i saw this movie with two other horror buffs and none of us much liked it br br except for the <UNK> episode on the hotel <UNK> the <UNK> crazy lady with the hammer and the so stupid it was fun crypt keeper in the air <UNK> all three of which account for no more than five minutes of screen time this film was a bore br br by the way this story seems to steal ideas from the shining and use them here to much less powerful effect is stephen king now reduced to stealing ideas from himself
<START> was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama this film starts with a light hearted banter between three women fine it moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man fine there are a few antics between them fine but when the plot <UNK> and finally becomes black i started to wonder whether i had <UNK> the first part of the movie it continues in this vein for a while until in the end it tries to go back to the original light hearted banter but by now it's too late it's hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing truly a lesson for british filmmakers anyway of how not to make films difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work and the box office proved it to be a real flop because i'd never heard of this film until this weekend four years after its release
<START> <UNK> focuses on the lives of one american family the father a violent and obscene person who loves to fart and use profanity and who has no redeeming qualities the mother who appears to be a paranoid psychotic never really says much the son an obscure annoying repetitive little fellow the animation is simple and crude but does <UNK> the stories and the characters the episodes were originally only available from the <UNK> com website but have now been released on dvd there are 8 episodes on the dvd and a brief synopsis follows br br 1 the neighbor we meet the next door neighbor and find out three things about him he has a really nice shed he only has one arm and he likes to do naughty things with <UNK> br br 2 the <UNK> we find out that the wife has an <UNK> for exercise but the husband doesn't really think it's a good idea in the end the exercise <UNK> is <UNK> br br 3 the doctor the father has an unfortunate accident with an exposed live wire the doctor's examination is quite <UNK> if not unconventional but the <UNK> is you are perfectly normal but we knew that br br 4 a friend visits after an <UNK> with the new clothes <UNK> a friend comes to visit believe it or not he has one but after we meet him we can understand why no surprises when he tells us what his <UNK> are br br 5 get the stick we meet another neighbor he has a stick stuck in his mouth although we never find out how it got there unfortunately <UNK> the stick from his <UNK> mouth ends up being harder and more violent than expected but he is <UNK> in the end jesus some people can be <UNK> br br 6 my teeth are bleeding this was my favorite episode and was also the most mind numbingly repetitive and annoying hmm what does that say about me not sure why the son's teeth started bleeding but believe me when i say it was minimal to the plot of the story which is an <UNK> as the story had no plot but did have a funny ending involving a fly br br 7 uncle bob after meeting uncle bob and uncle <UNK> wife we get a distinct feeling that the <UNK> gene pool is very shallow uncle bob is a <UNK> fellow i <UNK> elaborate <UNK> i spoil it for you uncle <UNK> wife definitely wears the pants in his family and the father definitely ends up on the wrong side of her ample fist and spends the rest of their visit <UNK> in a tree in the back yard br br 8 ants after the home gets <UNK> with ants and a <UNK> attempt to bug <UNK> them goes awry he ends up <UNK> himself in the face with the bug <UNK> and starts <UNK> the ants put on a fabulous song and dance show he goes <UNK> trying to kill them winds up in a full body <UNK> and lets just say the ants get their vengeance in the end br br as bad as these stories are there is something that kept compelling me to watch them they do give another insight into the mind of one of my favorite directors david lynch maybe they were an <UNK> for him to get rid of some of his violent thoughts i did actually laugh out loud at many points within the episodes many aspects are <UNK> funny
<START> the <UNK> 1993 didn't do much theatrical business but here's the direct to video rip off you didn't want anyway ellen <UNK> mel harris is the new woman at millennium <UNK> a high scale <UNK> firm who starts getting helpful hints from wide eyed secretary <UNK> sheila <UNK> <UNK> turns out to be an ambitious <UNK> girl who will stop at nothing to move up the corporate ladder including <UNK> a top <UNK> she can't stand and murdering anyone who gets on her bad side she <UNK> up <UNK> in <UNK> closet tries to cause problems with her husband barry <UNK> kills while making it look like she is responsible kidnaps her daughter and tries to get her to <UNK> money from the company br br harris and <UNK> deliver competent performances the supporting cast is alright and it's reasonably well put together but that doesn't fully compensate for a script that travels down a well worn path and offers few surprises
<START> is this film a joke is it a comedy surely it isn't a serious thriller there is no suggestion that there is any intended humor but on quite a few occasions the poor acting poor directing and appalling script had the audience laughing out loud in the cinema the plot is acceptable a promising young artist just reaching his peak shot dead by an assassin he walks in on by mistake the killer sees the young artists work <UNK> he is carrying and decides to attend an <UNK> of his work at the <UNK> the assassin meets the dead artists sister and they end up falling in love it is all very predictable stuff and the end will not have anyone guessing as it is so poorly scripted the film takes place mainly in and around vienna <UNK> and shows what a beautiful city it is do not waste your time on this film though unless you are studying how not to act direct or script a film
<START> <UNK> is a very difficult movie to <UNK> it's <UNK> to think of it as several <UNK> of the lives of the two central characters the fact that these characters are members of a street gang set in an <UNK> city of the near future and that one of them is a vampire does not <UNK> them from having moments like any other people and this is one of the places where this movie is different to anything else i've ever heard of it doesn't get wrapped up in the fact that one of the main characters is a vampire it's just something that has to be dealt with like any other problem the way the characters interact is surprisingly realistic there are embarrassing relatives and tricks that are meant to look cool that just don't work which leaves the film with a lovely sense of not taking itself too seriously for the most part br br the other area that really stood out to me is the languages the fictional city of <UNK> contains various cultural groups and characters speak the language that they would be expected to speak japanese gang members speak japanese to each other but chinese when talking to characters of chinese descent possibly the most amusing exchange involves an australian and is <UNK> in english the actors of the four arguably main characters have three separate mother <UNK> between them and speak varying levels of each <UNK> languages so it's quite a feat that the movie was made at all which i suppose brings me to the lead actors br br much has been made of the fact that the movie stars two of <UNK> biggest <UNK> gackt and hyde as well as <UNK> superstar lee <UNK> wang whether it is to praise them for their acting or <UNK> it or simply <UNK> about them in my opinion lee <UNK> is the best at playing a straight and realistic character however any lack of acting ability on <UNK> part is mostly masked by the fact that the character he plays is prone to being over dramatic i wasn't sure if <UNK> character was supposed to be as <UNK> and sarcastic as he came across but it doesn't really detract from the movie either way br br there are several scenes which take rather melodramatic turns which made it difficult for them to affect me much emotionally although this doesn't seem to stop a lot of people i found it's best to just enjoy the movie for what it is and not take it too seriously it's perfect for getting out and watching with a group of friends it does have its flaws but overall it was very enjoyable and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a few subtitles
<START> it's hard to tell if <UNK> and marshall are trying to ape <UNK> <UNK> martin lewis <UNK> larry or some other comedy team but whoever it was they were trying to imitate they failed miserably there's barely one weak laugh in this whole incredibly stupid picture <UNK> who helped write the alleged script and marshall have no chemistry whatsoever marshall seems to be trying for a dean martin type of devil may care <UNK> but he doesn't come even remotely close god knows what <UNK> thought he was doing but being funny sure wasn't it he seems to think that <UNK> his arms and legs a lot and staring <UNK> at everyone and everything is the height of screen comedy maybe for him it is but not for the audience i remember seeing this in the theaters when it came out it was on the bottom of a double bill with a three year old jeff chandler western <UNK> of the sky which was pretty good and a three stooges short sappy <UNK> which wasn't and about 20 minutes into this thing all the kids in the audience were throwing stuff at the screen it was so <UNK> unfunny that it didn't even measure up to the worst of the three stooges shorts i stayed around for the end of it not that i wanted to but my folks weren't due to pick me up until after the movie ended and by the time this mess was over i was the only one in the theater i saw it again about 15 or so years ago on cable one night and stuck around to watch it to see if it was as bad as i remembered it was worse the only thing it had going for it was julie <UNK> who was as <UNK> hot as ever other than her this thing has absolutely nothing to recommend it the two of them also play japanese soldiers and the way they do it makes jerry <UNK> infamous playing of japanese characters as thick <UNK> buck <UNK> <UNK> mental <UNK> look <UNK> by comparison marshall went on to host hollywood <UNK> and <UNK> kept trying his hand at making movies but most of them were almost as bad as this not quite though as i don't think anything could be quite as bad as this a truly pathetic waste of film don't waste your time on it
<START> this is a very real and funny movie about a japanese man having a mid life crisis in japan ballroom dancing is not <UNK> of but when <UNK> <UNK> becomes obsessed with meeting the beautiful young girl he sees in the window of a dance studio he suddenly finds himself <UNK> in dance classes no one is more surprised when he begins to like it than he but he must keep his secret pleasure from his <UNK> and family when the truth comes out it is quite funny
<START> it seemed as though the year 1984 was anything but the <UNK> nightmare it was <UNK> to be with george <UNK> science fiction novel 1984 turned out to be one of the <UNK> times in american history the <UNK> in the economy and a <UNK> in basic american values <UNK> an idealistic aura of <UNK> innocence which was viewed by the american people with a very <UNK> <UNK> there have been many <UNK> <UNK> of classic movies in the past but the originals are almost always considered superior purple rain is such a movie in this category made in 1984 purple rain provided a <UNK> of eighties happy go lucky quality music which they <UNK> into the making of this excellent film certain <UNK> <UNK> of the eighties are indeed classics screwball comedies <UNK> <UNK> clothing and of course the music eighties music is considered by experts to be the best decade for music in american history set in <UNK> purple rain <UNK> the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city when i was a little kid i lived in <UNK> for about eight months back then the non white population was under 3 by 1984 african americans had made some in roads into <UNK> and thus they established a firmly <UNK> culture of their own as well the movie purple rain evokes an eighties style clothing and music ensemble which effortlessly captivated the movie audience i loved the music to purple rain and the innovative approach this film takes to <UNK> success is indeed brilliant see this movie if you have not seen it already prince became an eighties icon with this masterpiece for a short time he dated kim <UNK> he must be doing something right purple rain put prince on the map this film gets my <UNK> <UNK> verdict of thumbs up
<START> this was a really funny movie br br every 1 in the movie was trying to be serious that is what made this movie so funny i mean come on a <UNK> head on a human body can it get any funnier good job sci fi keep the comedy movies coming i never thought movies could get anymore retarded if they keep it up they will have to <UNK> the sci <UNK> channel the comedy sci fi channel or something like that br br i cant wait 4 the next blockbuster movie from sci fi br br ill be ready with a bowl of popcorn and a case of beer or a bottle of <UNK> and ill be ready to laugh it up again
<START> alone in the dark is uwe <UNK> kick in the nuts to hollywood after house of the <UNK> punch in the face br br if anything it proves just how much of a master <UNK> boll is after forcing <UNK> out of business over the flop that was house of the dead one can only assume the normally credible <UNK> gate films only released <UNK> under <UNK> <UNK> after <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> because <UNK> is an even bigger example of complete lack of coherent film making ability plot exposition and just plain stealing poorly from other movies because it was supposed to look cool instead of because it <UNK> within the movie's <UNK> br br but then that's the point isn't it boll isn't trying to make a coherent film because he isn't trying to direct alone in the dark he's just trying to manipulate hollywood br br alone in the dark like house of the dead <UNK> siege far cry <UNK> and the other 3 or 4 projects that are announced or in pre production br br these aren't movies to be directed but investment <UNK> every single one of them rushed into production under the <UNK> that the tax law boll and his <UNK> are <UNK> may be closed within the next 2 to 3 years the more bomb projects he can release within that time frame the more money he and his <UNK> can gain why bother making a good movie when a bad movie's making you a <UNK> anyway the result is movies like the awfulness of alone in the dark br br alone in the dark like all his other movies are just a cynical exploitation of hollywood's current trend for lazy film making br br and to those who support boll by calling him misunderstood or the next ed wood <UNK> by making a cult figure out of the man you're just making it easier for him to get <UNK> but giving him <UNK> br br for more information read here http www <UNK> com feature <UNK> id <UNK> http www <UNK> com forum <UNK> <UNK> s <UNK> <UNK> as an aside just don't ask me how he's getting his cast lists together unless the actors are in on the investment <UNK> somehow that mystery has still to be <UNK>
<START> japanese animators have a unique freedom with animation which is why they tend to be able to come out with movies like these movies that ultimately end up on anime fans hard drives and college <UNK> floors but get completely ignored by pretty much anybody outside of its country of origin cat soup is one of those films that from western eyes is supposed to be experienced on drugs or deeply <UNK> really it's just a beautifully detailed <UNK> journey br br there's no real dialog which makes it easy to pass on to other interested parties <UNK> in things like subtitles a cat and his half dead brain dead sister travel through various landscapes of imagination and association there's a general theme of water or lack thereof possibly because of the cat drowning at the beginning possibly because of the title there's an interesting sort of <UNK> take there's a pig that gets to eat itself an elephant made of water and it's gorgeous compelling exciting and fun provided you don't watch it around <UNK> who cannot experience anything visually unique without comparing it to an acid trip eventually the movie turns itself off adding another compelling self <UNK> level to the proceedings br br <UNK>
<START> the luzhin <UNK> is in the <UNK> a story of an <UNK> chess <UNK> <UNK> who becomes consumed by the game and in the background via flashbacks his <UNK> life and the forces which created the man he has become factor in good and evil in the forms of his his love interest watson and former mentor wilson respectively and you have a <UNK> drama laced with poignant and <UNK> humorous moments <UNK> with the rich <UNK> beauty of <UNK> lake <UNK> and the intensity of high chess play an excellent film for those into period dramas the <UNK> <UNK> chess play metaphor for <UNK> delight is an indication of the subtle wit behind the film
<START> in 1942 a film tales of manhattan told a set of stories that were basically unrelated but tied together with a suit of men's evening wear each story began when the <UNK> were passed from one owner charles boyer for instance to another <UNK> romero winchester '73 a superior film and a great western has a similar plot twist initially it is about how jimmy stewart is seeking stephen <UNK> <UNK> for some deadly grudge but in the course of the film the two men get into a shooting contest the prize given by marshall <UNK> <UNK> will <UNK> being one of the new winchester <UNK> stewart barely beats out <UNK> but the gun is stolen from stewart and the chase is on br br the gun passes from hand to hand including john <UNK> as an arrogant <UNK> who <UNK> does not know when to stop being arrogant to rock hudson in a surprising role and a brief one at that to charles drake to dan duryea as the delightfully deadly and psychotic <UNK> johnny dean to <UNK> eventually it does return to stewart br br the film is expertly directed by anthony mann every character has a wide variety of experiences duryea gets the rifle literally over <UNK> dead body duryea forces the issue but he loses it to <UNK> who is faster on the draw not that duryea is stupid enough to fight for the rifle as he and shelley winter look at <UNK> in the distance winter who watched duryea kill her former boy friend drake drops her <UNK> for the <UNK> <UNK> to ask why he put up with <UNK> bullying for the gun <UNK> duryea explains he can wait some opportunity will come up later on i e when he can safely kill <UNK> and get back the rifle br br the characters are remarkably human winters first appears as the future bride of drake but she sees a really big negative side to him an unforgivable side drake is aware of this <UNK> and it helps lead to his destruction other characters have realistic touches such as j c <UNK> as an army sergeant who fights an indian attack with <UNK> and <UNK> friend <UNK> mitchell oh yes and with <UNK> fellow soldier tony curtis <UNK> makes one believe this soldier has been on a hundred <UNK> before since <UNK> probably <UNK> had showed emotions in other films in it's a wonderful life he showed a degree of anger at times and also a near nervous breakdown when he thinks everything is wrong with his life but here he showed a demonic anger at the expense of a surprised duryea who normally would show such anger himself br br the parts of this film fit very neatly together under <UNK> competent hands this is one western that never wears out as the audience watches the travels of a winchester rifle
<START> the interesting aspect of the apprentice is it demonstrates that the traditional job interview and resume do not necessarily predict <UNK> skills task dedication and job performance and they certainly don't reveal any hidden <UNK> in other words a good <UNK> of potential may be to see a job <UNK> in action which is the point of the apprentice people <UNK> for a corporate position may hand over a sugar <UNK> resume and put on their best personality <UNK> for the interview but these are not necessarily the best <UNK> of strengths weaknesses and performance br br briefly the apprentice involves 16 job candidates competing for the ultimate career opportunity a position in real estate <UNK> donald <UNK> investment company the apprentice refers to the winner who will win a <UNK> position learn the art of high stakes deal making from the master himself and presumably gain prime corporate connections the position is a dream come true for those wanting to make more money than the <UNK> of some foreign countries to <UNK> the candidates <UNK> shows off his private jet his private luxury apartments <UNK> with <UNK> and artwork his <UNK> his connections to celebrities and other aspects of the life of a <UNK> <UNK> br br the road to success is not easy the group is divided into two teams that compete against each other each has a corporate sounding name such as <UNK> and <UNK> corporation the teams are assigned tasks that <UNK> an <UNK> venture such as creating advertising selling <UNK> or <UNK> teams <UNK> a project manager who provides the <UNK> and <UNK> skills to complete the task if they win the manager receives a lot of credit particularly in the eyes of the final <UNK> if they lose the manager may also become the <UNK> goat some of the tasks are <UNK> difficult with only a day or two to complete tasks may involve creating a tv commercial or print ad others may involve selling at a <UNK> <UNK> or on the street br br the tasks bring out the best and worst in the participants they often show immediately who is the most reliable who is the most <UNK> and who is hard working and the tasks also expose who is not a good team player who is <UNK> and who seems only out for themselves the tasks <UNK> reveal in unexpected ways the strengths and weaknesses of the participants and in particular the project manager how well the manager <UNK> with the team <UNK> work <UNK> time and sets specific goals will largely determine the outcome but it does not necessarily predict the winner br br the single most telling aspect of someone's potential is when he or she is assigned as a project manager their real abilities as opposed to their self <UNK> abilities immediately show through the <UNK> that cannot be hidden by a 100 <UNK> tie or a beautiful <UNK> <UNK> qualities and or weaknesses often become <UNK> obvious after only a few minutes those promoting themselves as top notch leaders are not always as strong when put into a real life <UNK> situation it is always easier to <UNK> your own horn than to actually engage in <UNK> project <UNK> even those on the winning teams often do not <UNK> a cohesive <UNK> they often believe that by diving off the deep end to complete the task at the first minute rather than taking a little time to <UNK> and discuss how the task will be completed is more efficient more often than not members of an ill <UNK> team are running around like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it out as they go along and in the long run they end up wasting far more time br br the winning team gets a taste of the high life such as eating dinner at an <UNK> restaurant flying in a private jet and or meeting a celebrity the losing team comes to the <UNK> board room where <UNK> hears the lame excuses of the members and knocks off one or more of the contestants like pieces off a chess board with the now infamous you're fired often the project manager is held partially responsible for the <UNK> loss and may be the target of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> every week at least one person becomes a <UNK> from the losing team br br my least favorite aspect of the apprentice is the board room while the tasks themselves bring out the strengths and weaknesses in the candidates the board room often brings out the worst unfortunately the rules of the game insist there is one winning team and one losing team even if the competition was close members of the losing team start <UNK> each other often <UNK> about who was at fault and sometimes more than one person gets fired i seldom see an under performing candidate take responsibility for their actions in the board room <UNK> frank and <UNK> jackson were possibly the only candidates who took full responsibility for her <UNK> <UNK> and received no recognition for this <UNK> act for me <UNK> frank and <UNK> jackson had the most integrity of all the candidates however <UNK> saw <UNK> as weak and fired her claiming she wasn't standing up for herself which may mean he values ego more than integrity no one should sacrifice their integrity for this <UNK> frank may not have become the apprentice but she can live with herself knowing she did not blame others <UNK> isn't that worth as much as winning br br the strength of the apprentice is also its weakness because team performance is <UNK> strictly by winners and losers other <UNK> opportunities are overlooked <UNK> huge gaps between the winning and losing teams sometimes a losing team <UNK> a high standard of <UNK> and <UNK> i have seen losing teams sometimes appearing better organized than the winning team we americans are so often obsessed with winning and losing that we often overlook excellence
<START> there is a story but more essentially the world of this film begins in chaos and comes to order over the course of ten minutes br br it is a celebration of life and an optimistic <UNK> of objective truth and good representing along an <UNK> <UNK> in previous cinema this film should be taught in every high school br br <UNK>
<START> when i bought my toy story tape when it came out to video after being released in theaters i saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of toy story as soon as i saw that i knew this was gonna be a good feature i was right a bug's life like toy story is great story great characters and great animation my favorite characters are dim the <UNK> beetle voiced by brad <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> voiced by the late pixar <UNK> joe <UNK> my favorite scene is when slim the walking stick david hyde pierce lifts up <UNK> trying to distract the bird and <UNK> like you <UNK> mr early bird how about a nice <UNK> worm on a stick and <UNK> like i'm going to snap i'm going to snap i just died laughing at that scene being a big fan of insects i think a bug's life is my favorite pixar even though i know a lot of people consider it the worst pixar film ever i don't know how you could hate a pixar film i think they're all pretty good films good job pixar
<START> so i had low expectations for this movie to start with but it failed to meet even those while there were some funny parts even one or two laugh out loud parts this movie fell terribly short of what i would call good the funniest jokes were unexpected and over very quickly leaving us sitting there going wtf just happened in addition there were a few jokes that just dragged on and on and on the part where he falls down the mountain had me <UNK> also the editing was really lacking there were some poor scene transitions but that seems to be the style nowadays it made me laugh but i wouldn't watch it again and i'm very glad i waited for it to rent give it a chance you might enjoy it but don't think you are in for anything along the lines of the 40 year old virgin or <UNK>
<START> i entered the theater to sky captain in 2004 expecting a good film nearly every review of this movie had been positive the effects looked <UNK> the previews convincing br br needless to say disappointment actually doesn't describe the feeling i got from this film it was rage br br beyond being boring and poorly written the reason this film gets a 2 out of 10 stars is because everything in the film was stolen from another source i understand the difference between an homage and stealing this was stealing more importantly it seems that the filmmakers didn't steal to progress a point or move the plot along they stole just to show that they could there is literally no point to showing a clip of the wizard of oz in a theater at the beginning of the movie except to set up another scene that i won't elaborate on which steals from the same film needless to say every concept in the film was neither original nor even a spin on an old concept it was literally just a rehash of something i had already seen from pulp era robots reminiscent of the old superman cartoons and the recent film the iron giant to the silent martial artist <UNK> of the villain that has been used in countless films most recognizable in recent years as darth <UNK> in star wars the phantom menace br br on the subject of the actual film most of the performances were completely wooden perhaps this is because the entire movie was done on a blue screen with computer imagery filling in everything save the actors frankly this is no excuse for poor acting if a person was ever a child they understand that a lack of visual reference is no excuse for not trying br br finally there is no humanity in this film the protagonists are the only real human beings here nearly all the <UNK> are robots and the number of friendly characters that are shown during the film can be counted on one hand if robots are attacking the entire planet shouldn't we expect to see masses of humanity running from them the sub par performance of the main characters <UNK> us from connecting to really anything here br br the film wasn't the worst movie out there which is why i didn't give it a 1 rather the film was an example of all that is wrong with modern action films the filmmakers tried to justify the movie with special effects but without artistic vision or originality of any kind it falls flat
<START> when tradition <UNK> that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir the aging and very proud street performer known to all as the king of masks becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and <UNK> br br his warmth and humanity tho find him paying a few dollars for a little person <UNK> by <UNK> devastating natural disasters in this case massive <UNK> in the 1930's br br he takes his new 7 year old companion onto his straw <UNK> to live with his <UNK> and beautiful monkey general only to discover that the he child is a she child br br his life is instantly transformed as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes <UNK> in the <UNK> tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man br br there are many stories inside this one many people are touched and the culture of china opens itself for our western eye to observe thousands of years of <UNK> <UNK> down into a <UNK> of drama and few will leave this dvd behind with a dry eye br br the technical transfer itself is not that great as i found the sound levels all over the <UNK> and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie highly recommended 9 10 stars
<START> waste of my life the director should be embarrassed why people feel they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me when she died at the end it made me laugh i had to change the channel many times throughout the film because i was getting embarrassed watching such poor acting hopefully the guy who played heath never gets work again on top of that i hope the director never gets to make another film and has his paycheck taken back for this crap <UNK> out of 10
<START> movies have put me to sleep before but no movie has ever done that twice so it took me three <UNK> actually to finish it the dialog was bad women spoke <UNK> and the men were caricatures and two of the supposedly japanese women looked chinese had chinese names and spoke with clearly chinese accents i'm still trying to figure out why the <UNK> men were sexually wrapped up with each other 10 minus 8 1 2 equals a tough choice do i give this movie a rating of one or two br br movies have put me to sleep before but no movie has ever done that twice so it took me three <UNK> actually to finish it the dialog was bad women spoke <UNK> and the men were caricatures and two of the supposedly japanese women looked chinese had chinese names and spoke with clearly chinese accents i'm still trying to figure out why the <UNK> men were sexually wrapped up with each other 10 minus 8 1 2 equals a tough choice do i give this movie a rating of one or two
<START> we really enjoyed grey owl a simple tale well told in classic attenborough fashion a little over <UNK> with <UNK> humor and a stress of dignity and values br br beautifully shot and told at a nice pace this is the true story of <UNK> an <UNK> who turned native indian and went to live and trap in canada br br solid performances from all makes this film with a message easy viewing br br two of the stars of the film are without a doubt the <UNK> we have ever seen and the message is a good one with its <UNK> it must have been great to meet or read grey owl in the 1930s a unique character and this is a fitting film tribute
<START> it was almost <UNK> to me that this film would be a bust but i was indeed disappointed having been a <UNK> of <UNK> cinema for years i found this dvd drastically reduced for sale and thought it was worth a shot the opening few credits iconic to <UNK> fans has the inter cutting between man and animal but here we have non <UNK> <UNK> noise of children playing in a <UNK> while a bomb is being planted fantastic suspense then when the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> travel to their next mission <UNK> drops the bomb on <UNK> that his date last night had an <UNK> found only by <UNK> through her purse while <UNK> was being intimate with her the ensuing laughter is fantastic and is clearly paid homage to in brian <UNK> dressed to kill at the short lived expense of angle <UNK> the problem with the killer elite is that after the opening credits the film falls flat even bring me the head of <UNK> garcia has stronger production value a bold call for anyone who knows what i'm talking about i use <UNK> credits as <UNK> lecture material but once they are finished turn the killer elite off
<START> for anthony mann the western was <UNK> and <UNK> makes the very best cinema <UNK> work was full of <UNK> and passions visually dramatic and the action always <UNK> photographed br br stewart a <UNK> actor with the ability of displaying anger <UNK> and cruelty made with anthony mann five remarkable westerns winchester '73 bend of the river the naked <UNK> the far country and the man from <UNK> br br in winchester '73 stewart reveals his darker side he offers all the <UNK> of anger inner <UNK> and emotional complexity in his nature that his audiences had up till this time failed to catch br br a carefully chosen cast <UNK> the proceedings in fine style shelley winters is at her <UNK> best dan duryea perfect as the vicious <UNK> <UNK> villain john mcintire great as the <UNK> character charles drake so good as the man who attempts to face his <UNK> and a very young rock hudson attempts the role of an indian chief br br winchester '73 is the story of a perfectly crafted and highly <UNK> rifle in the dodge city kansas of <UNK> stewart and his estranged brother who bears another name stephen <UNK> compete <UNK> for possession of it and though stewart wins <UNK> steals it and sets off cross country with stewart in pursuit what gives the pursuit an element of the demonic is stewart's determination to revenge his father's death at the hands of that same <UNK> <UNK> revenge fed by long standing <UNK> hatred br br photographed in gorgeous black white the film comes on as powerful and <UNK> acted with deep feeling and intense concentration not only by stewart but by all the supporting characters br br look fast for a promising newcomer tony curtis the soldier who finds the rifle after the indian attack
<START> this movie is a touching story about an adventure taken by 15 year old darius <UNK> darius has <UNK> muscular <UNK> a still un <UNK> disease that took the life of his brother at age <UNK> and is the number one killer of babies in the united states him and a few close friends travel across the country to los angeles with the goal of getting his wheelchair <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> my ride one of his favorite shows the journey begins in georgia where darius grew up and has never left the gang head west for a trip that all its participants will never forget darius gets to ride in a boat for the first time ride in a hot air balloon swim in the ocean and visit sights he's always wanted to see like the grand canyon and new orleans the filmmakers here clearly have an emotional connection to the material they make no money from sales of the 20 dvds 17 goes toward <UNK> the disease and 3 goes toward making more copies the film has won over 25 awards at festivals and i agree with the quote given to the film by variety certain to stir hearts
<START> i can hardly believe i watched this again last night after more than 25 years br br some time back i watched 6 fu films in a row boris karloff and all 5 chris <UNK> the last 2 <UNK> both directed and i use that word loosely by jess franco were <UNK> at the time i <UNK> this one remembering that in some ways it was even worse br br well i watched it never again you know what's worse that an <UNK> film a really well made piece of s and that's what <UNK> plot is it is a very good looking movie great production design sets costumes music photography editing mostly good cast some decent acting br br and absolutely positively one of the worst scripts in movie history <UNK> the first minute of the film is so <UNK> one might mistake this for a decent movie and then they start singing happy birthday to fu and it goes downhill having burt <UNK> of whom his master says your face is familiar accidentally pour out <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to put out a fire resulting in his being condemned to torture burial and having one of his ears cut off was the closest thing to funny they had it was like someone decided they wanted to do a campy film so ridiculous it would be funny ridiculous it is funny it ain't at all br br it's sad because it's clear in the first few minutes that someone did a lot of research into the fu <UNK> series in order to get so much of it right with a different script either a really funny one or a dead serious one they might have could have should have had a classic on their hands a film that could have made one forget the horror of those jess franco atrocities instead of making one want to dig them out as masterpieces by comparison br br there was a period in the late 70's when a whole slew of classic 30's characters were <UNK> in movies that were universally awful buck rogers flash gordon tarzan the lone ranger charlie chan even doc savage i'm not sure this one may be the worst of the lot it took great self control not to fast forward over whole sections of it especially any scenes containing sid <UNK> fbi chief who was also al <UNK> cousin you see what i mean it isn't just that the ideas in the film aren't funny they often make no sense whatsoever like when they audition police officers to <UNK> the king and queen and we wind up seeing people audition dance hall routines like singing dancing and riding a <UNK> how many drugs did the writers of this thing have to take for any of this to make sense to them br br as i said a shame and a real waste of all that talent including that of peter sellers who played both fu and <UNK> smith burt <UNK> who'd been in a chris lee fu film in his time helen <UNK> the police woman who shockingly falls in love with the villain and damn near steals the last half hour of the film i begin to wonder if anyone will ever make a proper fu <UNK> film or if fans will have to settle for <UNK> being almost the only one
<START> der <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> second full length feature film the first one was notorious <UNK> has no central character or characters but instead <UNK> continuity in the act of suicide divided into days of the week it <UNK> of a series of set pieces each of which featuring the self destruction of a complete stranger yes the production values are low and it's disturbing but in many ways der <UNK> is extremely effective it makes you think which is sometimes more important than pure entertainment unlike the other <UNK> works it isn't very gory but there are some unpleasant images like <UNK> scene in the <UNK> episode a <UNK> corpse and various acts of suicide the last sunday episode is so depressing and full of pain just amazing if you want my opinion 10 out of 10 check out this post <UNK> shocker disturbing art in the <UNK> form
<START> considering its popularity i found this movie a huge disappointment maybe i was expecting too much from this film after all it is one of the most well known martial arts films of the 1970s but i could never figure out why the story is uninteresting it is also a very talky movie with <UNK> action sequences my biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character that i could root for since the intended hero is an idiot director chang has no sense of style and he is unable to hide the glaring <UNK> found in the narrative i know this is not supposed to be high art but i found the movie boring definitely not the best example of this much beloved genre its cult status escapes me i recommend you to skip it
<START> i usually enjoy films like this it's shot documentary style but the acting and writing are just awful the acting is wooden and stiff and the writing is just so cliché but not at all in a good way as of <UNK> this i'm surprised it's at a 5 2 10 on imdb i'm certain that most of these votes must have come from relatives of people in the movie i suppose if that's the case you might manage a couple of laughs as it's always funny seeing your relatives friends make a movie well in a way i guess this gives hope to all up and coming writers directors actors etc 'cause if they can do it you can do it although maybe you shouldn't
<START> jason lee's <UNK> are back if that's what you are looking for look no further if not better move on br br but about the movie clichés <UNK> some poorly shot but kinda exotic fight scenes used <UNK> and lots of bad acting cheap effects poor lee looks like he's in pain throughout the movie and no wonder not a pleasant comeback br br the movie doesn't even cut it as a b movie sure there was a <UNK> <UNK> blonde <UNK> wannabe bad guy but no gratuitous sex scene or even a single <UNK> shots none <UNK> <UNK> even in starship troopers 2 they had the common sense to include the mandatory <UNK> scenes as for rest of my comments on that excellent piece of classic cinema excellence please refer to our upcoming review on that mind blowing sequel i did get the feeling that the writer was taking his revenge on somebody with this thus i won't get into the plot of the movie or pretty much anything else related except that it did have some non <UNK> overtones so <UNK> said br br however this movie has one thing going for it no jean claude
<START> raising victor vargas fails terribly in what it tries most to be being real unfortunately there is no reality to this film the characters and situations feel completely artificial and fake br br the reason bad directing peter <UNK> uses all the wrong tools in his <UNK> it seems mr <UNK> read somewhere that not lighting his film would give it an authentic feel wrong it just gives it a badly made feel similarly shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film it just gives the audience a headache and <UNK> from what's on screen instead of enhance it br br of course what's on screen is so painfully fake as if mr <UNK> wrote his script with the only goal of trying to look hip to his sundance buddies and show how edgy a filmmaker he is br br overall the only lasting impression this film leaves you with is what a bad director mr <UNK> is next time how about taking a few writing and directing classes
<START> i knew this film was supposed to be so bad it was funny so i went into it with that expectation i just found it to be so bad it was <UNK> boring the whiny theme song is funny for about 10 seconds until you realize there is nothing clever about it except its intentionally irritating quality seeing things get <UNK> with tomatoes gets old in about 30 seconds there is just nothing clever or funny about the film except for the premise it could sustain a 3 4 minute comedy sketch maybe but this is just not a feature film by any stretch of the imagination
<START> with a cast of <UNK> british character actors and pleasing photography of 1950s britain i had hoped and expected to be more entertained by this film unfortunately i found myself glued to it for the wrong reasons i couldn't quite believe how awful it was i must have watched thousands of old films and am always ready to make <UNK> for them being products of their time but this was really hard going br br as others have noted a major problem is that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be a gentle romantic comedy a slapstick comedy or a musical i was a bit <UNK> when <UNK> carson suddenly broke into song about 15 minutes in it's not believable on any level either the storyline itself or the fact that daisy never appears to have an ounce of menace in her at any time other aspects which <UNK> credibility included the casting of suave donald <UNK> as a <UNK> a <UNK> for god's sake the fact he has diana <UNK> for a fiancée and doesn't appear to have the slightest interest in her i mean diana <UNK> come on and a ludicrous scene in a song <UNK> office the whole <UNK> silly in the worst possible way br br if i had to pick a favourite scene it would be the one at the very beginning with that wonderful actor <UNK> <UNK> after that everything went downhill in a big way
<START> jeffrey combs is an insane scientist whose <UNK> cell research has <UNK> into a diabolical scheme to create a hybrid hammerhead shark <UNK> life form hoping to breed a brand new species using hunter <UNK> <UNK> it won't be easy for <UNK> is a tough broad and her boyfriend william forsythe isn't about to give her up without a fight br br you see <UNK> and forsythe are two of business executive arthur <UNK> employees brilliant minds who meet combs a scientist who once worked for roberts and whose <UNK> position went to <UNK> at his island <UNK> where he <UNK> his research and experiments this island <UNK> him the opportunity to <UNK> fresh victims for his work and son they think it's a professional affair in regards to a breakthrough in <UNK> cell research which could lead to <UNK> for a variety of <UNK> <UNK> son was dying of <UNK> cancer when he decided to perform his mad science on him creating this blood <UNK> flesh eating creature which can both swim and walk on dry land although at first the hammerhead could only remain outside for short time periods <UNK> was dating <UNK> son hence the connection besides the two having worked for roberts who brings along his <UNK> wife <UNK> <UNK> also accompanying <UNK> and forsythe roberts and <UNK> are their colleagues <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> johnson combs traps them in a <UNK> room but they are able to escape onto the island as he sends after them his well paid <UNK> and hammerhead shark son br br like similar sci fi channel creature features of it's type hammerhead shark frenzy has some rather unappealing computer generated effects and the attacks where the shark rips apart limbs are shot in a quick edit <UNK> camera format where you have a hard time ever seeing any of the ensuing gory carnage you have this vague notion that a person is being eaten ripped to <UNK> but the attacks themselves are shot in a very <UNK> fashion which truth be told is rather <UNK> the monster itself is never seen in it's entirety just <UNK> glimpses of an eye or a body part being <UNK> on as the victim screams out in horror one <UNK> for certain you do see teeth we do get cgi shots of the hammerhead shark swimming toward the screen all menacing ready to feast on flesh a constant is while and after victims are attacked we see a great deal of blood and bits of flesh <UNK> to the <UNK> surface this is really director michael <UNK> main cue as to inform the viewer that those being torn apart are <UNK> br br combs doesn't break new ground as the scientist but he's always had an ability to convey a quiet madness under this cold blooded resolve it's fun seeing forsythe in a rare clean cut hero role very against type as an <UNK> <UNK> to his credit he actually pulls it off who must assume a <UNK> position when the group faces <UNK> peril <UNK> is also in a very different kind of role a scientist who can defend herself quite well roberts can play the millionaire businessman roles in his sleep and it's kind of neat seeing him firing off a machine gun at <UNK> soldiers although his fate is not pleasant mentioning that it was also really entertaining watching <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hired <UNK> with <UNK> automatic machine guns as expected the screenplay allows those who created the murderous fiend to put themselves in unnecessary danger just so that they can pay for their sins i mean seriously would these people <UNK> leave themselves so vulnerable to attack after seeing just what damage to the human <UNK> it could do beautiful exotic setting is quite a nice backdrop
<START> once in a while a film comes along that raises the bar for every other film in its genre a film of this caliber will influence many films following its release for years to come a chinese ghost <UNK> falls in this category it is arguably one of the best horror films made during the 1980's possibly one of the best ever made br br the filmmakers have crafted a movie that appeals to every horror fan the story is engrossing and original the villains are appropriately menacing and frightening the sets are creepy and atmospheric there is even a little blood and gore to satisfy the splatter fan of the house but don't let the <UNK> label scare you off if you're not a fan of the genre this film easily fits into many different categories br br the screenwriter has <UNK> <UNK> the drama comedy horror kung fu and romance genres into a delicious <UNK> cinematic pizza a chinese ghost <UNK> is a beautiful epic love story told thankfully without the gratuitous nudity and or explicit sex scenes that have ruined many hollywood love <UNK> those put off by the romantic elements of the story can sit back and <UNK> in the fast paced <UNK> and wire <UNK> if that's not enough actors leslie cheung and wu ma provide enough humorous situations to <UNK> your <UNK> for comedy this film offers something for every film fan br br director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and producer tsui <UNK> assembled a truly amazing cast for this film leslie cheung proves that he is not only a gifted actor but also a talented singer and a charming physical comedian i cannot possibly think of a performer other than cheung who could have portrayed <UNK> <UNK> sin better except maybe <UNK> <UNK> fat joey wang is enchanting as lit <UNK> seen the <UNK> spirit who steals the heart of <UNK> character her portrayal of the title character is truly haunting and memorable wu ma is hilarious as the <UNK> <UNK> who aids the young lovers br br on technical level this film is very impressive even by today's standards the direction is superb i wish that today's hollywood executives would seek out talented artists like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rather falling back on the usual mtv video or <UNK> commercial <UNK> the cinematography is gorgeous you have to <UNK> any cinematographer who can make a film look good when most of its pivotal scenes take place in the dead of night the special effects make up is top notch in fact most of the creature effects in this film blow away the shoddy cgi <UNK> and <UNK> that have become <UNK> in modern horror films br br since its release a chinese ghost story has <UNK> two worthy sequels a full length animated movie and countless <UNK> none of the films that followed it or copied it were able to capture the magic of this classic however this film is required viewing for any horror fan or just anyone looking for great way to spend 95 minutes of your time 10 out 10 br br
<START> <UNK> <UNK> second film written by <UNK> ali maiden directorial effort by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> probably has her first <UNK> role as <UNK> a girl who has run away from home and is waiting at the <UNK> marriage <UNK> office for her boyfriend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to meet her she waits and waits and finally is spotted as a damsel in distress by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they spend many days together as he <UNK> her from one <UNK> situation after another and finally falls in love with her then the boyfriend returns <UNK> <UNK> par <UNK> sound familiar this is yet another adaptation of <UNK> white nights with a tiny bit of <UNK> from le <UNK> <UNK> very tiny though <UNK> keeps the lovers apart by telling the boyfriend she is dead but this is an <UNK> and more realistic duh adaptation than the much hyped and overblown <UNK> i wonder why no one brought this little gem up when we were all discussing <UNK> like crazy a few months ago br br the <UNK> settings are wonderful there is the obligatory run through old <UNK> shots of <UNK> <UNK> from a roof top <UNK> circus streets with <UNK> what how the colorful light <UNK> in the hotel are enough to tell you this is a seedy joint with rooms for hire by the hour br br the more i see of <UNK> the more i like this young man in this second film he is quite good as the for hire witness who is given a purpose in life by a beautiful woman <UNK> looks beautiful and when she smiles she fits the role but i found her unconvincing in the more serious moments i am not quite sure that she has it in her to be a great actress or maybe she will <UNK> late like the brother the music by <UNK> <UNK> is not that great and in fact the movie <UNK> at the songs they kind of <UNK> the narrative and do not sit well with the characters trying to sing them the supporting cast is excellent and i give this white nights adaptation a thumbs up btw the fact that i love <UNK> <UNK> cute <UNK> has nothing to do with my rating
<START> horror <UNK> films were popular in the seventies i'm not very fond of them myself but this one is an undeniably excellent slice of british horror cinema the house that <UNK> blood is a horror <UNK> featuring four stories that surround a creepy old house in the country and are being told to a scotland yard officer by an estate agent br br this film is <UNK> by three well known stars of horror cinema peter cushing christopher lee and ingrid pitt whom horror fans will <UNK> as one of lee's co stars in the greatest british horror film of all time the wicker man br br the first segment of the film titled method for murder tells the story of a horror <UNK> whose creation a <UNK> named dominic is brought to life by his own imagination this story builds suspense very well through his girlfriend he and the audience is lead to believe that what he is seeing is a <UNK> of his imagination this story certainly isn't very original but it makes up for its lack of originality through the atmosphere it creates and it's final twist which works incredibly well and came as a genuine surprise br br the second story titled <UNK> stars peter cushing and is my least favourite of the four this tale follows the story of phillip grayson cushing a man that discovers a wax museum and decides to venture in inside he discovers a woman that is familiar to him and who we later find out is a <UNK> quite what the woman's relationship with phillip <UNK> is never really explained but the tale relies more on the mystery to build the suspense rather than plot details cushing is later joined by his friend <UNK> rogers played by <UNK> <UNK> and that's when the tale really starts to pick up the setting of a <UNK> museum full of murderers for a horror film isn't a new idea the same setting was used to great effect in the excellent 1966 horror film chamber of horrors although the one here isn't as grand as the one in the aforementioned film the power of the setting is used to no lesser a horrifying effect much of which is achieved by a feeling of <UNK> brought about by the limited area of the museum peter cushing is always interesting to watch and seeing him avoid an axe wielding madman is a treat for the horror fan despite being my least favourite this story is still entertaining and interesting enough to not let this anthology down br br the film continues with <UNK> for the sweet which is without doubt the best of the <UNK> this story stars the legendary christopher lee as a seemingly <UNK> father the beauty of this story comes from the way it is played out it leaves the audience guessing we know that there is something wrong with either the father or the daughter but we don't know who or what it is christopher lee as usual portrays his character with a great degree of <UNK> the audience is left to <UNK> over his actions regarding giving his daughter a doll and the fact that she isn't allowed to go to school or have any toys the card of exactly why is held close to the chest until right near the end <UNK> by the truly chilling line in which lee tells his babysitter that he is in fact afraid of his daughter the ending to this section is superbly played out in my opinion it's one of the finest endings to any horror story ever told and will stay with you long after the end credits roll br br the <UNK> finishes with the cloak which is definitely the most comedic of the four this tale is about a hammy horror film star that <UNK> by his latest film's technical side goes out and buys himself a cloak naturally this cloak turns out to be a real vampire cloak unlike the other three tales this one seems to be played out mostly for laughs that is no bad thing however as the majority of the humour is funny and it serves as a nice contrast to the rest of the film the ending to this tale <UNK> nicely with the ending to the <UNK> story of the film which is a very sinister yet humorous ending to a very good film also look out for the little <UNK> regarding christopher lee in dracula a nice touch i think br br overall if you want a horror <UNK> you really cant go wrong with the house that <UNK> blood the third tale alone makes the film worthy of your time and this is a very solid horror film indeed
<START> this series is one of the worst shows i have ever seen terrible acting terrible effects terrible writing you get my drift the stories are so far from the legend of robin hood it's amazing looks like they just wanted to use the name robin hood to attract an audience it might as well have been called new adventures of mr bland acting br br someone commented before me that if you had imagination you'd love this show that is a horrible approach to a tv series a visual media like this should spark your imagination you shouldn't have to force your imagination into something to make it good that would be like the simpsons episode where they try to <UNK> homer with a religious propaganda movie and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever if a movie is boring i just make up my own story br br in conclusion absolute human waste
<START> horror fans i'm speaking to the over <UNK> although if you're under 12 i <UNK> for what you might <UNK> an insult in short if you appreciate having your imagination disturbed by well written original storytelling <UNK> by unpredictable well planted scares and delivered via convincing performances then i can <UNK> recommend avoiding these <UNK> made by directors who have apparently long since past their sell by date it's no accident that almost every episode feels as if it were made in the 1980's not to put blame <UNK> on the shoulders of some of these old boys or indeed the 80's because where would we be without certain movies from the likes of <UNK> carpenter <UNK> <UNK> and barker actually clive wtf are you doing in there glad to see romero had the good sense to give it a miss as i'm sure he was asked to <UNK> more perhaps we should point the finger at creator mick <UNK> whose <UNK> include the logic <UNK> and <UNK> ill advised tv remake of stanley kubrick's masterpiece 'the <UNK> br br perhaps it is an indication of the state of television today are we so <UNK> of good tv horror that we applaud any old sloppy schlock that the networks <UNK> onto our sets sadly maybe so br br normally i wouldn't see the point of adding a comment that doesn't argue the faults and merits of a production i'd just rate it <UNK> however as this series is woefully lacking in any merit with perhaps the sole exception of the theme tune i write this as more of a warning than a review don't waste your time and money if you disagree with me then it's more than likely that you haven't seen enough decent horror perhaps the earlier films of some of these directors would be a much better place to start but if these <UNK> of horror were being <UNK> on these works alone they'd never have been allowed to graduate with even their <UNK> degree unless of course they were studying for a degree from the university of s t
<START> <UNK> du <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of the stolen painting 1979 begins in the <UNK> of an old three story <UNK> apartment building inside we meet the collector an elderly man who has apparently devoted his life to the study of the six known existing paints of an obscure <UNK> era painter <UNK> a narrator <UNK> various <UNK> about art and painting and then <UNK> in a dialogue with the collector who describes the paintings to us shows them to us tells us a little bit about the painter and the scandal that brought him down and then tells us he's going to show us something br br as he walks through a <UNK> we enter another world or worlds or perhaps to stretch to the limits other possible worlds the collector shows us through his apparently <UNK> house including a large yard full of trees with a hill within these confines are the 6 paintings come to life or half way to life as he walks us through various <UNK> and describes to us the possible meanings of each painting of the work as a whole of a whole secret history behind the paintings the scandal the people in the paintings the novel that may have inspired the paintings and so on and so on every room every description leads us deeper into a <UNK> and all the while the collector and the narrator engage in their separate monologues very occasionally <UNK> into dialogue but mostly staying separate and different br br i watched this a second time so bizarre and powerful and <UNK> it was and so challenging to think or write about if i have a guess as to what it all adds up to it would be a sly satire of the whole nature of artistic interpretation an <UNK> might be found in two of the most amusing and inexplicable scenes are those in which the collector poses some <UNK> plastic <UNK> in the second of them he also looks at photos taken of the <UNK> that mirror the poses in the paintings then he <UNK> through his collection which is now partially composed of life size versions of the figures if we think too much about it and don't just enjoy it it all becomes just <UNK> plastic br br whether i've come to any definite conclusions about <UNK> du <UNK> <UNK> or not i can say definitely that outside of the early and <UNK> works of peter <UNK> like a walk through h i've rarely been so enthralled by something so deep so serious so dense and at heart so mischievous and fun
<START> what the f was this i just watched steven stop please this movie is <UNK> bad and silly in a bizarre departure from action and adventure mr seagal is now fighting obviously wish they were vampire <UNK> creatures with super human strength ok oh and their eyes blink <UNK> in an <UNK> way wow even still in this movie however to <UNK> <UNK> have to have the last punch and no one can kick my a ego he is somehow stronger than they are however all of the average humans are getting crushed all around him come on i can understand the big mouth neighborhood bully or drug dealer but these are super human strength people oh and get this seagal goes through a brief <UNK> of identity issues because apparently he and his <UNK> in the film think he is <UNK> oh my go and worst than all of that yes there is a worse than that he has a voice over even changing voice in mid sentence while we are looking at his face they obviously sound nothing like him and i believe it may be one of the other actors in the film it was pure madness although i wanted to turn it off i always watch a movie to he end this is an all time low even for your direct to video movies steven awful awful awful two thumbs down <UNK> qualities well i guess so i will be fair in that aspect at least some of the special effects were ok and i like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses the women all were quite attractive imo still and i said still it does not make up for the blatant x men underworld insert your favorite zombie vampire movie here rip off the director writer producer all should be <UNK> <UNK> from the movie business i think i feel the way that most people feel about blood <UNK> and just about all other uwe boll pictures about this film that's my whole 1 00 on this film view if you dare
<START> this movie and yes it's a movie it was shot as a two <UNK> but the two parts together come down to slightly more than 2 hours is one of the <UNK> masterpieces of world cinema a very well mannered and yet at the same time absolutely savage <UNK> of the soviet regime and the type of person who <UNK> under it the film is a faithful adaptation of the long banned eponymous book by <UNK> <UNK> the sets are flawless and the director made the brilliant decision to film in <UNK> <UNK> adding a feel of authenticity where a late 80s washed out color incarnation would have all but ruined the film i won't say much about the plot which deserves to be discovered by the viewer himself but the performances are true oscar material special mentions go out to e <UNK> who plays the old professor with such presence <UNK> and kind wisdom that with barely a word or a gesture he ends up stealing every scene he's in the second of course is creature <UNK> who played to horrifying perfection by v <UNK> is by far more frightening a character than <UNK> <UNK> because not only does he exist in real life entire countries have been ran by men like him throughout history with all that ensues br br while it's a <UNK> political allegory it is worth mentioning that the movie is also <UNK> with humor albeit dark there are many outright comedies which haven't made me laugh as much as this film what's more when laughing at this movie the feeling is not only one of hilarity but of understanding and <UNK> which is always a plus br br there is hardly a complaint i have with this movie the only slight flaw is the tone of intellectual <UNK> <UNK> i caught at times from the <UNK> characters but that's a minor <UNK> br br sadly this film appears to have been <UNK> by western <UNK> companies it's a crying shame that one of the all round best movies out there is <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> which shouldn't be incredibly hard though all the cultural references and the revolutionary <UNK> will necessarily fade in translation the film's main themes should be accessible to all while we're waiting with our fingers crossed for the <UNK> edition i'm considering creating english subtitles myself will see how that works out
<START> why did i go to see this film honestly because jim carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter so do you really blame me for expecting that again additionally the premise the funny trailer his co star jennifer <UNK> involvement and the fact it was a massive hit <UNK> encouraged me br br however as my one line summary suggests i was disappointed for various reasons br br reason 1 it wasn't funny in a <UNK> movie i laughed for about 5 <UNK> all together the rest of the time i sat thinking i really should have got some ice cream i admit that maybe it is wrong to judge jim carrey on his previous films but what does he really expect when he makes <UNK> such as 'the truman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> myself and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> 'the <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> films then produces in bruce <UNK> own words such a mediocre film br br reason 2 jennifer <UNK> role was criminally <UNK> i mean hello she's been around in the public eye for about ten years now and in this film she gets about four lines to say wrong br br reason 3 one word cliché br br reason 4 a casual <UNK> of specifically american references jimmy <UNK> walter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a clue to the film's specifically home grown appeal a teenager says no to drugs and yes to an education that's a miracle want to see a miracle soon be the miracle god tells bruce a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the us but might face <UNK> resistance in <UNK> that retain an <UNK> for subtlety additionally i still go to school and that statement suggests me and all of my friend's are <UNK> or maybe it just means we have brains br br in this film there are enough funny carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent bruce almighty from being a total <UNK> but you are advised to start <UNK> your expectations <UNK>
<START> there's only one thing i need to say about this movie the scene where <UNK> is in a musical number with francis <UNK> character about wanting to be a genie never see this movie the story is horrible the acting is terrible c'mon it's <UNK> and i'd rather see <UNK> in free willy equally horrible twice before ever seeing this movie
<START> why do i watch movies like this other than i have some weird misguided <UNK> belief that one day i will find a true gem amongst all this <UNK> i can't think one one good reason this movie was <UNK> from start to finish but semi hilarious <UNK> where else but in a bad italian dubbed movie could you find <UNK> <UNK> of surreal <UNK> english like this one between a honest military type and the sinister chief of a secret x files like <UNK> dedicated to hiding the truth br br man in black silence is best for us until we are able to prove that the <UNK> have no <UNK> motives br br military type in any event i find your <UNK> abusive br br man in black whoever has to <UNK> his will is br br i <UNK> the dvd you know what i mean a good half dozen times and i still can't make those lines mean anything sensible my other <UNK> line was br br we can be quite hard on those who <UNK> our interests br br it's english jim but not as we know it br br the other highlights of this dull <UNK> of a movie for me were the totally <UNK> out acting of the photographer character at the start <UNK> with the worst <UNK> ever in the history of everything the man just <UNK> around looking like a stunned fish in a bad wig till kidnapped and forced to look at a piece of <UNK> by some aliens the aliens are most effectively not seen as a <UNK> shot hand held camera with a fish eye lens sort of spooky the first time but used over and over again it lost its power <UNK> if it is a point of view shot it means the aliens always walk out of rooms backwards for some reason br br the film was set in england this meant the spanish italian set <UNK> put some british number <UNK> on a couple of english cars and put a union jack on our hero's press card and that was about it no other attempt to make it look like the uk at all br br favourite moment when the <UNK> artists didn't notice that characters they were <UNK> is there such a word were no longer walking on <UNK> but were now on the lawn so their feet kept on making loud <UNK> <UNK> noises other than that another total waste of 90 minutes of my life i hope they prove those <UNK> have no <UNK> motives soon
<START> a case of being in the right place at the right time what a fascinating film it is easy to see why chavez is so popular with his people he gets things done he is accessible and it is also easy to see why the west hates him so much he has control of the resources of his country and gives the <UNK> back to the people mostly the poor and it easy to see how the tv stations can portray misleading images to put there case just like the iraq war or the war on terror or those missing <UNK> or how about the <UNK> of evil people need to wake up and get different points of view stop the neo cons <UNK> the world go watch this movie with an open mind and make your own mind up then i suggest you see aaron <UNK> america freedom to <UNK> it is not the people of america that are the problem it is the government
<START> the old <UNK> that bored people are boring people is well demonstrated in women in love the script taken from d h <UNK> novel contains an endless flow of concepts that are at best <UNK> br br what a pity so much effort went into so vacuous an exercise what an empty array of characters given such attention in spite of high production values this film comes across as tedious as its <UNK> br br a <UNK> in 2001 merely <UNK> a 1969 impression of <UNK> minds in adult bodies <UNK> nowhere and <UNK> every step of the way
<START> i loved the first little mermaid i know the songs i love the characters and i love the story i can't say anything like that about the little mermaid ii return to the sea it was terrible let's start with the story the plot was a <UNK> copy of the first movie same situations except in reverse ariel wanted to live on land her daughter melody creative name wants to live in the sea ariel was tricked by ursula melody is tricked by <UNK> sister morgana ursula had a sister not sure where that came from besides being a strange copy of the first movie this movies plot seemed tired and was uninteresting compared to the first movie now the characters 1 ariel what happened to her no longer the <UNK> <UNK> teenager we all knew and loved from the first movie she has now grown up and her personality went down the drain her singing voice wasn't as strong either due to either <UNK> benson being a lot older or the songs being so terrible that her talent was wasted 2 prince eric while he didn't have a lot of personality in the first movie like all disney <UNK> somehow his new voice and his very few lines made him even more robotic to top it off he just can't seem to defend himself and ariel becomes the tough one of the two 3 sebastian say goodbye to the lovable <UNK> from the first movie because a whiny <UNK> little <UNK> just took his place he also had no good songs in this movie you can almost forget the glory he earned from singing the incredible under the sea and kiss the girl from the first movie and it is very sad 4 <UNK> they destroyed him he is not cute anymore his voice is terrible and he has kids now who's the mother 5 morgana she appears to be <UNK> sister out for revenge against her mother who always picked ursula over her so she plans to get king <UNK> <UNK> to become the new <UNK> of the sea sound familiar anyway she's a very cliché villain and falls short of <UNK> greatness as a villain she <UNK> fails at witchcraft she's not very tough and not threatening at all 6 melody ariel and <UNK> daughter ironic name because she unlike ariel can't sing her voice is annoying her friends a <UNK> and a penguin really are not funny or likable and she's exactly the same as ariel in reverse and not as likable skip this one don't watch any disney sequel except for lion king 2 this movie butchered the classic that lives in all our pleasant memories i will look back at this movie and just laugh
<START> dressed to kill starts off with kate miller angie dickinson having a sexually explicit nightmare later on that day she visits her psychiatrist dr robert elliott michael caine for a session in which she admits to be sexually frustrated <UNK> in her current marriage kate then visits a museum picks up a stranger they go back to his apartment for casual sex when done kate is set to leave but is attacked killed in the buildings elevator by a razor blade wielding blonde woman prostitute liz blake nancy allen discovers the gruesome scene sees the killer but manages to escape detective <UNK> dennis <UNK> says he suspects liz as being the killer as there are no other witnesses so liz teams up with <UNK> son peter keith gordon to track down the real killer clear <UNK> name see that justice is done br br written directed by brian de palma i thought dressed to kill was a good solid psychological murder mystery the script is <UNK> slow at times but it likes to focus on the character's so you really know them the entire first twenty minutes is just developing kate as a character before she is suddenly killed off then the film switches it's <UNK> to liz no one else gets a look in this way dressed to kill is quite absorbing engaging unfortunately the character's themselves aren't exactly likable i found some of the dialogue quite funny at times especially the dirty talk that liz <UNK> occasionally the killers motives are somewhat plausible but i guess you'd have to be pretty messed up to do anything suggested in dressed to kill it's a good film but it didn't <UNK> me that much i didn't really find any character to root for or like the film <UNK> on a needless unnecessary twist ending that i didn't really see the point of br br director de palma directs with style visual flair from the art museum sequence to a car chase as a whole it's <UNK> filmed throughout i'd imagine that every shot in dressed to kill had a great deal of thought put into it i felt the film was a bit flat uninspired at times though nothing about it really excited me that much there is a fair bit of nudity some sex rape along with a few bits of gore violence <UNK> murder by razor blade in the elevator being the highlight if that's the right word however it's by no means as shocking or controversial when viewed today as many would have you believe br br with a supposed budget of about 6 500 000 dressed to kill has that glossy high production value feel of a hollywood film the new york locations are nice the cinematography is good as a whole it's extremely well made i thought the music was inappropriate was far to loud <UNK> the acting is ok but despite his top billing i didn't think caine had that much screen time allen was married to director de palma at the time dressed to kill was made interestingly out of the four films she appeared in made by de palma in two of them this blow out 1981 he cast her as a prostitute a body double was used for dickinson as she pleasures herself in a shower at the start br br dressed to kill is a good thriller that is well worth watching but i didn't think it quite lived up to it's <UNK> reputation good but not brilliant
<START> german filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible he's <UNK> fellow <UNK> uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made br br <UNK> is truly the ed wood of the new millennium this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best worst of <UNK> i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in <UNK> <UNK> fascinated to see just low the bar could be set the answer is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a pit and buried it br br the fun begins with the cast of international <UNK> only someone who has lived in los angeles where every auto mechanic doctor and <UNK> is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered could easily understand how <UNK> managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to <UNK> his ridiculous dialog with a straight face br br the main character a villainous beat cop is played by a german actor with a thick german accent aside from being a serial killer he is also the oldest beat cop in la despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody then drags them into his home which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners the <UNK> refuses to investigate going so far as to physically attack one of his <UNK> in a ninja style raid on his apartment br br the sets are excruciatingly bad the production <UNK> budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint enough to paint <UNK> <UNK> on a cardboard wall br br since the actors were obviously <UNK> non professionals a sad assortment of european <UNK> possibly <UNK> if they acted in their native lands <UNK> <UNK> and desperate middle aged women and since little if any money was spent on sets special <UNK> locations or other production value it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine looking police uniforms sadly they couldn't afford a police car the <UNK> cops cruise the streets in a shiny new <UNK> rental br br more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german <UNK> officer and the <UNK> efforts of two young <UNK> to stop him one of these young actors is especially <UNK> because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies the other fits right in with a <UNK> <UNK> and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated br br the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie as the victims of our killer are <UNK> after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo <UNK> to have a protective spell put on her don't ask why a girl from romania would resort to <UNK> in anticipation of being murdered just accept <UNK> logic and enjoy the absurd ride br br after much prolonged hand <UNK> out of straw covered <UNK> graves the zombie girls manage to make their appearance they look exactly as they did before death maybe even <UNK> with black <UNK> make up <UNK> <UNK> around their eyes looking nothing like zombies they look more like high fashion models ready for the <UNK> br br at this point in the movie <UNK> borrows a creative note from his <UNK> <UNK> boll and <UNK> large doses of cheesy euro trash <UNK> into the soundtrack we're talking <UNK> electronic <UNK> noise stuff they might have played in an <UNK> disco when <UNK> was still young enough to shake his <UNK> br br unlike other zombies <UNK> girls speak and function as normal er i mean as they did before becoming <UNK> this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog yes a golden shower it is br br i won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending all i can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece the spirit of ed wood lives on or should i say his <UNK>
<START> i've read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this film i can't say that i found much to recommend it the leonard cohen sound track is not only <UNK> heavy handed but dreary beyond measure the film looks authentic enough but <UNK> got to happen for it to work and nothing much does a <UNK> plot not a real problem for me not much character development nothing <UNK> it just <UNK> along flawed as it is <UNK> <UNK> gate has some moments of genuine wonder and is a film i'd sooner watch again for a brilliant <UNK> of the west <UNK> <UNK> is much superior to <UNK>
<START> in his first go as a hollywood director henry <UNK> <UNK> an enthralling yarn that is all of <UNK> <UNK> marital issues with <UNK> authenticity and <UNK> such with an equally absorbing subplot of a father son hit man business the film is directed <UNK> and consists of a wonderfully put together cast as well as a swift family conscious screenplay also by <UNK> that brings life to an otherwise <UNK> genre as a bonus <UNK> delivers subtle <UNK> <UNK> unexpected undeniably charming and very welcome <UNK> its bumbling unsure of himself low key star whose ever cool state is <UNK> especially given his line of work br br the forever great william h macy again captures our hearts as alex a unhappy torn middle aged husband and father who finds <UNK> in the most dubious of persons a young attractive equally messed up 23 year old named sarah <UNK> campbell whom he meets in the waiting room at a <UNK> office where he <UNK> the therapy of dr josh parks john ritter to discuss his growing <UNK> to quit the family business that his father donald sutherland built alex whose lust to lead a new life is <UNK> by the fear of disappointing his <UNK> father strikes an <UNK> fancy for sarah which ultimately leads him to understand the essence and <UNK> responsibility of being a husband to his wife and more importantly to him a good father to his six year old son sammy played <UNK> by the endearing david <UNK> br br henry <UNK> brilliant <UNK> is something of a <UNK> in hollywood seldom seen with the exception of <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> since its conception in <UNK> weaves two <UNK> genres organized crime family drama into a fascinating warm hunk of movie viewing that is <UNK> strong in either <UNK> it's one that will maintain its exceptional <UNK> caliber and <UNK> sincerity for ages to come
<START> fascist principal miss <UNK> mary <UNK> who is <UNK> by expert photographer dean <UNK> as if she were ten feet tall has a plan to turn her high completely square complications ensue which challenge that goal in delightful <UNK> riff <UNK> <UNK> soles who lights up the screen she's got a hot <UNK> too who is an obsessive fan of the punk band the ramones pal kate <UNK> <UNK> young whose big <UNK> glasses and nerdy role can not hide her stunning beauty joins forces with riff to put an end to the supposed crisis of killing <UNK> for good which is <UNK> desired mission br br vincent van <UNK> has a hilarious role as tom roberts a success at everything but getting laid kate is crazy about tom if only he could pull his head out of the sand and see it clint howard steals the film almost honestly who can steal this film away from soles as <UNK> the <UNK> who can get everyone almost anything his office is located in the boy's <UNK> paul <UNK> is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of <UNK> when he enjoys a concert of the ramones br br a <UNK> high school romp that defies all rules of <UNK> and i loved it it's like someone just says let's make life fun for <UNK> hours the film really is <UNK> a plot less chaos lovingly <UNK> the ramones with all it's heart even if they are horrible actors they have an opportunity to gain new audiences with this film br br the ending pretty much sums up the film as a whole riff and her classmates take over the high school and one massive party begins to be honest i didn't want the party to end not conventional in any way whatsoever this film just let's loose a frenzy accompanied by a great rock soundtrack featuring some of the ramones best songs this film allows a viewer to accept a time in life when war didn't dominate <UNK> and people just had a good time those i guess were the days
<START> if i could go back even as an adult and <UNK> the days of my <UNK> spent at camp i would be there so fast the camps i went to weren't even this great they were in texas where the <UNK> actually carry people off but we had horses and fishing the movie cinematography was astounding the characters funny and believable especially <UNK> <UNK> and arkin sam <UNK> character and sub antics were priceless so who ever thought this movie was lame i have deep pity for because they can't suspend their disbelief long enough to imagine camp life again as an adult or they never went as kids the whole point was that these people had an opportunity to <UNK> and become juvenile again and so they did at every opportunity i wish i could it was funny intelligent beautifully scripted brilliantly cast and the artistry takes me back so i want to watch it over and over just for the scenery even sorta like dances with wolves and <UNK> good movies but the wilderness becomes a character as much as the actors rent it see it buy it and watch it over and over and over never gets old 0
<START> the late great robert <UNK> author of psycho for those of you who weren't paying attention scripted this tale of terror and it was absolutely one of the scariest movies i ever saw as a kid i had to walk miles just to see a movie and it was usually dark when i emerged from the theater seeing a horror movie was always unnerving but particularly so when it was as well executed as this one when i had the opportunity to see this one several years ago on <UNK> which should always be a last resort i was surprised at how well it held up take the terror test watch it at night alone and then tell me it's not scary
<START> my 10 year old daughter alexandra writes br br i thought it was very boring and i thought it was just a repeat of stuff from 101 <UNK> i couldn't wait for the movie to end the best part was the credits at the beginning they were cute and well done the rest of the film is not worth watching thank you
<START> there has been a political documentary of recent vintage called why we fight which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation it is considered both <UNK> and <UNK> in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq yet a far more famous series of films with the same name was made during world war two by hollywood director frank <UNK> although considered documentaries and having won oscars in that category this series of seven films is really and truly mere <UNK> more in the vein of <UNK> <UNK> triumph of the will scenes of which <UNK> <UNK> for his own purposes that said that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries such as the <UNK> <UNK> the world at war lacked nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable they are <UNK> made and after recently <UNK> some used dvds at a <UNK> store i found myself with the opportunity to <UNK> a free dvd with my purchase i chose <UNK> dvd's four dvd collection of the series br br rarely has something free been so worth <UNK> while there are no extras on the dvds and the sound quality of the <UNK> <UNK> these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago when racism was overt as in many of the classic warner brothers pro war cartoons of the era and there was nothing wrong with blatant <UNK> of facts the seven films produced between 1942 and 1945 are <UNK> to war the nazis strike <UNK> and <UNK> the battle of britain the battle of russia the battle of china and war comes to america br br overall the film series is well worth watching not only for the obvious reasons but for the subtle things it reveals such as the use of the <UNK> for terms like x millions when referring to dollars rather than the modern <UNK> or the most <UNK> graphic in the whole series a japanese sword <UNK> the center of <UNK> yet it also shows the <UNK> of trying to apply past standards to current wars the lesson of world war one avoid foreign <UNK> was not <UNK> to world war two whose own lesson act early against <UNK> has not been <UNK> in the three major wars america has fought since korea vietnam nor iraq the fact that much of this series <UNK> on the <UNK> of the times it was made in only <UNK> its historic value in today's information <UNK> times it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today but at least you'll realize you are not the first to be in such a <UNK> position nor will you be the last
<START> <UNK> <UNK> daddy what a refreshing story this movie <UNK> the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children how rare is that in these times of heather has two <UNK> or what ever you fill in the <UNK> it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone with the father's roles being prominent i was hoping this would be another <UNK> steel saga how disappointing to have it end every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role i would have loved to see each character develop over the years i loved this movie it is one i will <UNK> watch every time it's on good story good acting and i hope this isn't a spoiler but no <UNK> sex or bad language yes it touched my heart warning get the <UNK> ready what i find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment be it television or movie's <UNK> if your listening you go girl give us more
<START> when i refer to <UNK> as a film noir i am not <UNK> it to such masterpieces as sunset <UNK> double <UNK> or the <UNK> <UNK> nor am i comparing director <UNK> to alfred hitchcock stanley kubrick stanley kramer or luis <UNK> i am merely <UNK> a protest against the darkness that <UNK> this movie from start to finish to the extent that most of the time you simply cannot make out what is going on i can understand darkness in night scenes but this movie was dark even in broad daylight for what reason i am at loss to understand as it is however it wouldn't have made much difference if director <UNK> had filmed it in total darkness
<START> i love cartoons they can show things that films with <UNK> actors and scenery cannot though computer effects are changing that more and more they can push the boundaries of satire 'the <UNK> good taste <UNK> <UNK> spectacle <UNK> or reality <UNK> <UNK> there are some good examples of this in <UNK> <UNK> such as when we see a <UNK> herd of now <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> across countryside <UNK> like old friends such scenes are a pleasure to watch as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time usually in a way that makes us laugh while ice age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time it's a really fun film sit back enjoy the deliberate <UNK> the lovely backgrounds and the belly laughs br br the story follows <UNK> the grumpy <UNK> sid an idiotic <UNK> and diego a <UNK> tiger as they take a human baby back to his tribe for very different reasons on the way naturally they have a whole lot of problems also popping up throughout the journey is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is desperately trying to bury an <UNK> for the winter in <UNK> on top of dead trees in ice <UNK> his opening scene is a classic br br it's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character building moments thrown in but some of the scenes such as the <UNK> changing or the <UNK> are hilarious the animals are likeable and it looks good there is one quite touching moment too when cave paintings of <UNK> come to life in front of <UNK> eyes br br not a must see but good for a fun hour or so br br 7 10
<START> disappointing and undeniably dull true crime movie that has poorly cast character actor jeremy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his way through the title role of jeffrey dahmer who was easily one of the last <UNK> most recognizable <UNK> serial killers released straight to video back in early 2003 dahmer is an overtly talky boring badly acted and virtually <UNK> <UNK> fest of a true crime drama that never truly <UNK> into the monstrous and demented psyche of the late mass murderer like it had the perfectly good potential to do what it does however attempt to do for reasons unknown to me is evoke some sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him out to be what is ultimately a lonely <UNK> and severely socially inept homosexual loser who was simply <UNK> for love in all the wrong places as opposed to the cold <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and madman that he was overall <UNK> dahmer is one that true crime buffs everywhere might as well skip because i'm not kidding when i say that it's one of the worst serial killer <UNK> ever done it's even <UNK> than other pathetic and <UNK> straight to video trash like <UNK> <UNK> ed <UNK> and the night stalker turkey zero stars
<START> a lot of people don't think branagh's hamlet film is all that good but i must admit i think it is splendid like virtually every production of shakespeare it has problems and it has had to make hard choices not all of which work out the thing about the secret doors everywhere for instance simply doesn't work that element never achieves the ominous feeling of metaphor or <UNK> that it attempts to which results in the play being too <UNK> and losing its trademark sense of a thousand mysteries <UNK> this is the biggest problem with this production and while it's a <UNK> i'm also inclined to say that it's the only problem almost everything else works out absolutely beautifully all right so branagh is a <UNK> too old for the title role and the relationship with <UNK> seems a little forced and he gets too hysterical at times but that's it no other complaints even with these faults i think this version is a <UNK> one and if it's not as powerful a drama as it ought to be it's every bit the literary work that it equally ought to be we get the complete text of the longest version of the play <UNK> and <UNK> brought to the screen mostly <UNK> in perfect and modern and highly understandable voices even if they sometimes speak too quickly in order to get the massive text over with but in a staging of shakespeare it simply is not possible to speak slowly enough for the audience to really appreciate the full depths of the language for that one must delve into the print versions of the plays br br all the actors of this version are simply mesmerizing and utterly and instantly classic <UNK> jack lemmon julie christie as <UNK> is surely one of the best ever and even the american actors are astounding <UNK> charlton heston as the player king who would have thought it a story is going around that heston once played hamlet on stage and when a critic in the front row couldn't stand his hammy acting and said out loud this is terrible heston reportedly <UNK> right from the stage well i didn't write this crap of course it may not be true but it's a funny story and if true a bold and ironic choice for branagh to include heston here robin williams as young <UNK> is perhaps not young enough for the part but he makes it a comical one which is <UNK> br br overall it is a very well produced version with most of the key scenes being to my mind <UNK> memorable of course i watched this movie just as i was becoming interested in shakespeare and around the same time as <UNK> <UNK> romeo juliet and it made a great impression on me which must account for some of my <UNK> for it br br all things considered i must <UNK> branagh's hamlet to be my favorite one with derek <UNK> 1980 bbc version a close second i probably like branagh's shakespeare work more than most finding him an expert <UNK> and <UNK> with an <UNK> casual attitude to the words and a deep and appropriately and <UNK> enthusiastic appreciation of the text in the world of shakespeare acting the two <UNK> <UNK> remain olivier and branagh and while olivier is the superior actor branagh brings shakespeare down from the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> and transforms it into <UNK> easy going <UNK> <UNK> while <UNK> none of its dignity branagh i believe brings out a <UNK> shakespeare than the world has yet seen br br and so 10 out of 10 for an absolutely tremendous hamlet
<START> this remarkable film can be summed up very easily first of all while the comparisons to princess bride are inevitable it's almost <UNK> to do so while both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop stardust is so much different than any other fantasy sci fi film i've ever seen it's such a hybrid of those genres but its plot and script are so unique that along with the performances special effects cinematography and score the finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the silver screen secondly the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist <UNK> i did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way in fact the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch wonderfully casted and superbly acted across the board this fantasy adventure with sci fi elements was the best one i've seen since return of the king not that i am comparing the two at all ok so its not that easy to sum up but don't let any crude and or heartless and cynical review nor the film's pathetic <UNK> prevent you from <UNK> in the best time you could have at the movies this summer or even possibly in a long time
<START> this film was really bad whether you take it as a sci fi movie as a horror one or even as a comedy the whole thing is ridiculous br br the film looks and is definitely cheap the actors have no idea of what acting is and the script shows clearly that it was being made along with the shooting it is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not scary at all she was even pretty and they thought they needed something more impressive they failed here too the make up is awful even for the late 50's rather funny br br the film shows clearly why director joseph <UNK> career as such and also as a writer never <UNK> he was really bad at both same goes to the actors leading and supporting br br the brain that wouldn't die 's best achievement is its short running time
<START> within the realm of science fiction two particular themes consistently <UNK> interest were initially explored in the literature of a pre cinematic era and have since been <UNK> <UNK> by filmmakers and writers alike with varying degrees of success the first theme that of time travel has held an <UNK> fascination for fans of film as well as the written word most recently on the screen with yet another version of the h g wells classic the time machine ' the second theme which also manages to hold audiences in <UNK> is that of <UNK> which sparks the imagination with it's seemingly endless and <UNK> possibilities and this theme too has again become the basis for a film adapted from another h g wells classic the invisible man ' the realization of which here is hollow man ' directed by paul verhoeven and starring kevin bacon and <UNK> <UNK> br br sebastian caine bacon and his colleagues have for some time been <UNK> experiments for the u s government exploring the possibility and <UNK> of <UNK> which they have at last achieved in a number of the <UNK> upon which they have tested their method they have in fact progressed to the point that <UNK> the <UNK> is assured their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original <UNK> state of being it's a problem however that caine after <UNK> effort and too many hours in the lab has solved or so he thinks and when the <UNK> of his theory on a live subject is successful he decides to present the results to the board of directors in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the <UNK> of the project br br at the last minute though caine <UNK> <UNK> that control of the project will be <UNK> from him before they can proceed to the next level the testing of a human subject and he takes it upon himself to become that subject <UNK> the assistance of his research team by telling them that they've been given <UNK> by the board to do so but something goes wrong and caine becomes trapped in his cloak of <UNK> and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it's too late it all begins to take a <UNK> on <UNK> mind and suddenly his fear of losing funding and control becomes <UNK> as he finds himself facing the <UNK> danger of losing much more than that now there's a very real chance that he may lose everything including himself br br verhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting even thought provoking film he <UNK> a good pace and uses the f x at his <UNK> to great effect though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to <UNK> the character development anyone familiar with the invisible man ' or actually anyone who can <UNK> follow the progression of the story will know early on that caine is not destined for happier times still verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience but he seems bent on <UNK> toward the climax and along the way he <UNK> any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful <UNK> to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless blood and gore fest that betrays his audience and everything he's worked for earlier in the film rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to <UNK> suffering and using some <UNK> and imagination to take the film to it's inevitable conclusion verhoeven takes the low road and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level any meaning one could <UNK> from the story <UNK> like so many <UNK> in the wind along with anything that would have made this a memorable film and it's a shame because verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower br br kevin bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable if only on the surface which seemingly serves verhoeven's purposes perfectly there's little depth to <UNK> portrayal but it has more to do with his director's agenda than his own acting abilities verhoeven simply does not allow bacon the time to develop caine to any extent the character is mainly a <UNK> around which verhoeven can build his story and toward that end it works the film would have been better served however had verhoeven and bacon <UNK> more closely on at least developing a bond between caine and the audience that would have <UNK> some emotional involvement on the viewers part something that would have drawn them in a bit rather than leaving them at the gate as it were as mere <UNK> of an f x laden <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> herself well in the role of linda <UNK> <UNK> willing <UNK> in the ill <UNK> experiment but it's basically a <UNK> part that offers little challenge especially to an actor of <UNK> caliber the same can be said of kim dickens so magnificent in the 2001 film things behind the <UNK> her character sarah kennedy does little more than support the action and f x both actors are capable of so much more and deserve better than what they are given to work with here br br the supporting cast includes josh <UNK> matthew greg <UNK> carter joey <UNK> frank mary <UNK> <UNK> and william <UNK> dr kramer entertaining to a point and even successful on a certain low level hollow man' is one of those films that leaves you <UNK> what could have been like an <UNK> fireworks display it will give you some <UNK> thrills but after awhile it'll begin to blend in with all the others you've seen without anything special to set it apart and it's too bad because given the talent and abilities of those involved here it could have been so much more i rate this one 4 10 br br br br br br
<START> debut wow cross eyed is easily one of the most enjoyable indie films that i've watched in the past year making it hard to believe that cross eyed is the writer's debut film i mean i <UNK> onto imdb to find more films by this writer because cross eyed has that unique signature you want to see what else this writer might have to say these days its rare to see a movie that is well written well directed well edited and well acted for me cross eyed <UNK> what movie making should be about combining the best of all film elements to create a clever artistic and poignant tale more please
<START> george and kim are traveling with their young son miles to a remote cabin in <UNK> new york when their car hits a deer and <UNK> into a <UNK> but what seems to be a mere <UNK> of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying journey where myth becomes reality and a flesh eating spirit half animal and half man wendigo <UNK> a small town wendigo by larry <UNK> is a thought provoking horror film that often <UNK> into a somber family drama the acting is great the characters are well developed and there are some bone chilling moments the subtle glimpses of wendigo are handled effectively and it's never clear what is real and what is imagined or even if the story is taking place entirely in <UNK> head overall wendigo is my first contact with larry <UNK> work and surely won't be the last give this film a chance if you don't mind watching something unconventional 8 out of 10
<START> i found this to be a surprisingly light handed touch at a 1950's culture clash movie john wayne would hardly be one's first choice as a cultural <UNK> being about as <UNK> with his good intentions as a bull run in <UNK> but this time he was left to play a part that was far more passive than his usual <UNK> persona and he accomplished his task with style the duke was a guy who really could act well his facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle br br despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time he failed to dominate this movie many of his good intentions came a <UNK> he had authority over nobody and the <UNK> narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian br br the story of american attempts to <UNK> favour with an <UNK> japan was one of political intrigue rather than <UNK> or hell for leather battles i cannot comment on the accuracy of its research but the <UNK> of the oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well there was a great deal of <UNK> choreographed ceremony <UNK> what looked to this <UNK> like authentic costume and props the set pieces were complex and detailed a lot of money and thought had been applied to it br br the <UNK> romance between wayne and his geisha added a little extra element and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flag waving effort script was good without being too <UNK> there was a great deal of japanese dialogue but the lengthy periods of translation didn't <UNK> with the narrative it was nice to see plenty of genuine <UNK> on the set whether or not they were japanese i couldn't say but anyway they looked the part at least the leads were not played by cross dressing <UNK> unlike other efforts such as <UNK> <UNK> yes i know they were chinese 'the <UNK> of the sixth <UNK> or even 'the king and <UNK> br br frankly i enjoyed this more than any of those other movies the script was better for a start i never liked the songs in 'the king and <UNK> and wasn't impressed by the heavy laden anti communist subtext of <UNK> <UNK> i confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very <UNK> to many of the <UNK> more popular <UNK> br br recommended
<START> only children below the age of 12 should be allowed to see this film the rest of us should take a book <UNK> player or just take a nice <UNK> to endure the experience of this event this can be best summed up as a blown up tv movie being distributed into theaters children will want to see this film and they will like and be amused by the movie
<START> <UNK> <UNK> rukh boris karloff discovers <UNK> x a powerful force to be used for atomic power unfortunately rukh has been <UNK> by the <UNK> and starts to glow in the dark and his touch causes instant death dr felix <UNK> bela lugosi develops an <UNK> but rukh starts to go mad due to the <UNK> and the <UNK> and sets out to kill all he believed <UNK> him br br the plot is silly and the effects that make karloff glow in the dark are laughable but this is still a fun little <UNK> it moves quickly has some great atmosphere notice <UNK> house and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night and karloff and lugosi as always give great performances there is also good acting by <UNK> drake as <UNK> wife and <UNK> <UNK> cooper as his mother so it's ok but just a notch below all the other karloff lugosi movies the plot is just too far fetched for me to swallow still i did like this i give it a 7
<START> talk about a dream cast just two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere peter ustinov and maggie smith together in hot millions a funny quirky comedy also starring karl malden robert <UNK> and bob <UNK> ustinov is an ex con <UNK> who gets the resume of a talented computer <UNK> <UNK> and takes a position in a firm run by malden with the goal of <UNK> in mind it's not smooth <UNK> he has attracted the attention of his <UNK> at the company played by <UNK> and his neighbor maggie smith who knows him at their place of <UNK> under another name becomes his secretary for a brief period she can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of <UNK> all ending with her being fired when <UNK> makes advances to her she invites ustinov over to her flat for <UNK> as a cover up but the two soon decide they're made for each other of course she doesn't know ustinov is a crook br br this is such a good movie you can't help but love ustinov and smith and be fascinated by <UNK> <UNK> his genius and the ways he <UNK> out of trouble but there's a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains don't miss this movie set in '60s london it's worth if it only to hear maggie smith <UNK> i've been <UNK>
<START> i had <UNK> the movie was going to be bad i'm a <UNK> fan from way back have three years of the tv series on dvd well i was right took the family to see it i really wanted to see the general jump again and some of the chase jump scenes were good but to sum it up the movie was a <UNK> down <UNK> up version of the tv show br br jessica simpson was pathetic while i can honestly say that the original <UNK> outfits were just as revealing jessica <UNK> interpretation of daisy was simply awful <UNK> <UNK> and denver <UNK> must be rolling in their graves as well br br don't waste your money if you are an old tried and true dukes fan like me and my three kids are you will be very disappointed
<START> years ago i saw the godfather and it made a lasting impression on me the atmosphere of the movie was first class the acting memorable and the storyline a classic recently i bought the trilogy and after watching part 1 again i looked eagerly to viewing part 2 i was so pleased to realize early on into part 2 that here was a fitting follow on to the great godfather movie again everything was just about perfect and i could not wait to see godfather iii wrong i wish i'd stopped at ii the storyline was not good it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story the characters were weak especially the daughter <UNK> <UNK> was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in godfather 1 or 2 then scenes such as <UNK> being invested with all the <UNK> of the catholic church with full choir the assassin on <UNK> riding away into the sunset the unseen helicopter machine <UNK> of the meeting where the <UNK> get away and everyone else is shot daughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of <UNK> across a board the pathetic shooting on the steps <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> down him with orange juice for <UNK> a man of his intelligence and <UNK> isn't ready for an <UNK> no it was not good and with the best will in the world i wont be able to watch it again but i'll watch 1 2 many times down the years
<START> this is quite an unusual and unique little western that is made mostly original due to its story that revolves around an unique and superior winchester <UNK> rifle and all of those who get to poses it at one point or another in the movie br br it's mostly a very entertaining movie to watch but not without still being a real western as well the movie got done in a typical <UNK> <UNK> style of western genre film making so the lovers of the genre should not be turned off by its somewhat unusual main premise br br because the rifle is actually being the main plot device of the movie it allows the story to follow multiple characters throughout the movie who are all connected of course and the story makes full circle in the end without that this movie would had been a pretty messy one to watch since the story often jumps from the one <UNK> occasion into the other with constantly different characters involved quite amazing how they even managed to put <UNK> <UNK> in this all but it's no criticism really i liked that the movie and its story were being original and how the movie seemed to move from the one event to the other it gave the movie a bit of a sense of adventure and entertainment br br it's also a really great looking movie i liked the settings the movie used and it seems quite amazing that this was actually the director anthony <UNK> first western luckily he would go on to direct more westerns later on which also often would star james stewart in the main lead br br it was a pretty daring casting choice to pick james stewart as the main lead he is one of the <UNK> and most polite looking and acting actors so casting him as a tough <UNK> seems like a bit of an odd pick but stewart is surprisingly convincing as a tough guy and it shows how versatile and really capable as an actor he actually was br br it also has some other surprising actors in the movie that are not often get connected with this genre shelley winters plays the female lead and also later well known actors rock hudson and tony curtis appear in some small roles br br a real western with also plenty of action and entertainment to it br br 8 10
<START> as steven segal movies go this one is bottom of the barrel his best was just fodder for bored teenagers this one <UNK> the <UNK> then falls off the characters are all cardboard the story is double lame i can't spoil it by telling you the ending you already know how all steven segal movies end if you have seen one here goes he is a super <UNK> government agent who know too much to turn loose so they decide instead of killing him to <UNK> his brain until he don't remember <UNK> he escapes of course gets arrested and is located by his old general who needs his one man in a million experience to get back a stealth plane that has been handed over to a terrorist gang in <UNK> by a rogue air force pilot who surprise surprise segal trained all the heroes except <UNK> character and his <UNK> girlfriend die <UNK> and steve baby save the whole world in one <UNK> <UNK> or fell <UNK> whatever made with some <UNK> air force and navy flying film and a lot of boom <UNK> get some <UNK> cartoons instead
<START> look if i were interested in a nancy drew book what i would do is pick up a book and read it i'm not ever since i can remember i read people <UNK> movies because it wasn't like the book i'm sorry in the digital age we can no longer watch movies on flip books however i'm sure you can still find a few short silent films in book form when lord of the rings came out people complained when the third one won an oscar the book was better when i watched to kill a <UNK> the book was better now a bunch of people are upset yet again because nancy drew wasn't like the book i'm not saying nancy drew is going to win any oscars if anything it'll be one of those <UNK> <UNK> or kids choice awards i'm saying give film a break it's film not paper as a movie i found nancy drew quite enjoyable featuring cameos from bruce willis and adam goldberg the <UNK> hammer and supporting roles featuring <UNK> <UNK> jimmy cooper on the o c and rachel leigh cook she's all that this is the first time i've seen emma roberts in a movie and frankly i enjoy her work more than most of julia and of <UNK> her character stays consistent throughout the film and <UNK> well with conflict a lighthearted movie in the spirit of harriet the spy is nice now and again br br i give it ten stars because i thoroughly enjoyed the movie would love to see it again and will probably buy it upon dvd release
<START> i <UNK> recall seeing this when i was 3 years old then my parents accidentally taped over all but a few seconds of it with some other cartoon then i was about 8 or 9 years old when i <UNK> it and since i was then able to comprehend things better i thought it was a good movie then fast forward to just a few weeks ago june 2006 when i re re discovered it thanks to some internet <UNK> video clips and it's just not the same movie i'm sure it's still good with the kids but to us 20 30 somethings it's definitely got cult status written all over it it's a shame that the original production went through a painful process if fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be but that's for fox to decide i'm rambling here i know i still think it's a great film but it could be better than great
<START> if this film had a budget of 20 million i'd just like to know where the money went a monkey could make better cgi effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage although i must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really really cool on an original play station 1 game and early pc games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made what <UNK> me is where did the money go <UNK> films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la george lucas circa 1975 <UNK> and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing or ruining in this case for about the same 20 million this is quite possibly the worst film ever made i would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of <UNK> than watch this film again i hated it completely i <UNK> i say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan 9 or killer tomatoes or santa claus <UNK> the martians these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them you love them there is no love for this film and no place in my dvd library for it i sold it to a guy for a dollar i'm <UNK> the money for the film was spent on booze and other <UNK> for the cast and crew shame on you <UNK> films i want my money back
<START> a cowboy sympathetic to the plight of a nearby indian tribe is wrongly accused in the rape and murder of the <UNK> daughter leading to much hate and violence br br this <UNK> <UNK> feature is fun to look at though thoroughly impossible to defend on any artistic level the terrible costumes and the fact that all the indians are obviously white makes this look more like a live action cartoon than the serious production that it's press <UNK> pretends it to be br br in short the <UNK> nudity the real reason for watching this is good everything else is not there's definitely better examples of both genres br br more interesting is that the <UNK> was filmed at the infamous <UNK> movie ranch and features not one but two members of the <UNK> family catherine share and bobby <UNK> who was probably already in the can for murder at the time this hit the <UNK> <UNK> screens of the <UNK> theater
<START> lot of silly plot holes in the film first we see him watching his master practice kung fu and die in the midst of his practice that's fine with me and then at the end of the film we see him use the kung fu that he learned just by watching his master when he was still a kid is that even possible i don't think so br br this show is purely for jay <UNK> fans and the film lacks a depth in terms of character development cinematography styles and unfolding of plot br br anybody notice that the captain of the basket team forgot his name and the <UNK> player li <UNK> look so similar to each other to the extent that you'd think they were the one and same person long hair sunshine boy look tall and strong the two of them looked like they came out from a mass production factory designed to <UNK> out products that makes teenage girls scream wild in <UNK> not that those two actors had anything of value to contribute to the movie as a whole for the movie industry at all br br the jokes were lame and not funny at all br br the scene with regards to the 4 masters of jay <UNK> coming back to help him out in the basketball court <UNK> into a pointless plot when they started bashing their opponents ala royal <UNK> style worse of all when the 4 masters won the fight the crowd began cheering and the match continued it was truly a wtf moment br br at the end of the show when they win the match all thanks to jay <UNK> excellent kung fu skills how he acquired those kung fu skills is a mystery because the show somehow shows him <UNK> the skills just by <UNK> his master br br and then his long lost father comes out of the <UNK> to acknowledge jay <UNK> as his long lost son seemed just a tad too quick of the director to wrap up the film br br in short this is a jay <UNK> flick instead of the usual chick flick watch it only if jay <UNK> is your fan if you are one of those whose tastes in movies <UNK> greatly with those in the list of <UNK> top 250 films of all time then this film is not for you
<START> i love these <UNK> baby movies you couldn't make a movie like this today and it is rich in cinematic history it is goofy and the film was made to make you laugh which it does how they ever got these kids to act i'll never know i think they are precious and the kids make me laugh but so do the others who made this movie as it shows the <UNK> that existed in the early 30's you have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young the stock market had crashed the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world the fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my <UNK> but then dinner for 25 cents is too it was a different time with a totally different mind set
<START> after watching this movie i was honestly disappointed not because of the actors story or directing i was disappointed by this film <UNK> br br the trailers were suggesting that the <UNK> have chosen the third way out other than surrender or die polish <UNK> were even <UNK> that they had the choice between being killed by own <UNK> or german guns they even translated the title wrong as misplaced <UNK> this have <UNK> the right spot and i bought the movie br br the disappointment started when i realized that the third way is to just sit down and count dead bodies followed by sitting down and counting dead bodies then i began to think hey this story can't be that simple i bet this clever officer will find some cunning way to save what left of his troops well he didn't they were just sitting and waiting for something to happen and so was i br br the story was based on real events of world war i so the writers couldn't make much use of their imagination but even thought i found this movie really <UNK> and even a little bit boring and as i wrote in the first place it isn't fault of actors writers or director their marketing people have raised my expectations high above the level that this movie could cope with
<START> myra <UNK> is one of those rare films that established its place in film history immediately praise for the film was absolutely nonexistent even from the people involved in making it this film was <UNK> from day one while every now and then one will come across some maverick who will praise the film on philosophical grounds aggressive <UNK> or the courage to tackle the issue of <UNK> the film has not developed a cult following like some notorious <UNK> do it's not <UNK> as a misunderstood masterpiece like scarface or <UNK> out to be <UNK> as a camp classic like <UNK> br br undoubtedly the reason is that the film though outrageously awful is not lovable or even likable myra <UNK> is just plain mean as a hollywood satire it is cold blooded and mean spirited but in a hollow pointless way myra takes for granted that hollywood is a corrupt town but goes further to attack such beloved icons as laurel and hardy shirley temple judy garland and gary cooper the film seems to imply that everything about hollywood is by its very nature vile it seems to think that there is something <UNK> courageous about mocking sacred <UNK> but doesn't supply a <UNK> for doing the mocking in the first place the film is also <UNK> anti american and anti establishment and anti this and anti that but all in a superficial late 1960's trendy way like casino <UNK> <UNK> doo i love you alice b <UNK> and other would be hip epics myra is a middle aged vision of the <UNK> <UNK> youth culture it tries to embrace the very attitude that it <UNK> but instead of being <UNK> self mocking myra makes no attempt to <UNK> its contempt for everything that comes within its grasp myra <UNK> has the humor of a bully there's not a single moment of innocence in it its intentions aren't honorable time magazine <UNK> described it as being about as funny as a child <UNK> but it's not nearly as sympathetic br br for instance poor mae west bore the <UNK> of so much of the criticism aimed at the film being described as looking like everything from an aging drag queen to a <UNK> walking corpse the <UNK> star obviously didn't know just how ridiculous she looked playing a <UNK> talent agent <UNK> after men young enough to be her <UNK> or even her great <UNK> but director michael sarne had to know but he used her anyway why because she apparently was the joke just like john huston john carradine grady <UNK> andy <UNK> and other veteran performers in the film they are there only so the film can mock their age and use them to trash their film images they are cast as smarmy self parodies as is rex reed the arrogant <UNK> film critic who is cast as just that in the film but the real reed the celebrity <UNK> jet setting talk show <UNK> can be charming in an <UNK> funny way but as <UNK> <UNK> alter ego he is just obnoxious again apparently for sarne reed is the joke br br you watch myra <UNK> and you don't see actors you see victims none more so than <UNK> welch no one will ever <UNK> welch of being a great actress but it is a testament to her <UNK> and her appeal that she survived this film and her career <UNK> being in almost every scene welch was front and center as a target for abuse aimed at the film but to her credit she gives a remarkably nuanced performance though of course centered between the scenery chewing huston and the almost <UNK> west welch doesn't have to do much to strike a good balance even so she <UNK> her horribly unfunny dialogue with a deadpan <UNK> with just the hint of self righteous glee that would do any james bond villain proud legend has it that welch was <UNK> by a condescending west and subjected to repeated verbal abuse on the set by bumbling director sarne not to mention being featured in one <UNK> scene after another making it all the more remarkable that she was able to give such a cool and <UNK> performance br br the film's only intriguing element is trying to figure out just what the film's agenda is the whole story is a fantasy fable which should indicate that it has a moral to deliver but what that might be is <UNK> guess with all of its talk about destroying the last <UNK> <UNK> of traditional <UNK> from the race it would seem to have a feminist axe to <UNK> but as a feminist myra is a monstrous figure a sexual predator besides myra isn't a woman rather she is a <UNK> of <UNK> who presumably is a gay male that might explain the male rape scene as well as the character's love hate attitude toward the macho seemingly straight <UNK> rusty but it doesn't explain his her obsession for and the supposedly lesbian <UNK> with farrah <UNK> mary ann the film is obsessed with sex but can hardly be accused of being in favor of the sexual revolution all the sex is treated as being if not dirty than at least perverse and <UNK> turning to gore <UNK> original novel isn't of any help because it is as confused and pointless as the movie br br and this is a rare movie that actually seems to hate movies not just movies as a business but movies as part of the culture as well the film itself is wall to wall <UNK> references to old movies all of which director screenwriter sarne approaches with a <UNK> disdain he has <UNK> the film <UNK> of 20th century fox and <UNK> the film with snippets of old films not as an homage or to provide a social commentary but to mock the innocence of old hollywood how can an artist if you <UNK> want to call sarne that make a work of art if he already hates the very medium he is working in the very effort is totally self <UNK> br br myra <UNK> doesn't seem to be in favor of anything other than being just nasty it hates hollywood it hates america it hates sex it hates gays and <UNK> and women and men and old people and young people and laurel and hardy and well you name it and it probably has a scene showing contempt for it in a very sad and sorry way myra <UNK> may be the first punk <UNK> a celebration of pop culture <UNK>
<START> i enjoyed this film perhaps because i had not seen any reviews etc it was delightful and a little bit of a <UNK> i don't know why it didn't make more of a <UNK> than it did as far as the story goes i could relate to some aspects of the paul reiser character and i could see my dad in <UNK> character made me remember a lot of past times when i was a kid and listening to my grandparents too if you enjoyed movies like grumpy old men or on golden pond this is your movie a sleeper in my opinion and one of those feel good stories peter falk and paul reiser had many wonderful verbal <UNK> yet nothing was overdone i would say it rates at least an 8 perhaps higher
<START> this is a brilliant political satire no wonder why it was largely ignored in the u s it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is br br another good film from this era rendition was also totally <UNK> simply because it showed accurately that the u s is a war machine bent on torturing murdering and <UNK> civilians in its quest for total world <UNK> br br a clever plot good acting some big stars john cusack ben kingsley marisa tomei anyone and some scenes of hilarity should have made this movie a hit unfortunately americans don't like to hear the truth about themselves especially when they are <UNK> in mass murder
<START> batman the mystery of the batwoman is about as entertaining as animated batman movies get br br while still true to the feeling of the comic books the animation is done with a lighter spirit than in the animated series bruce wayne looks much like he has before but now he appears somewhat less <UNK> the dick grayson robin has been replaced by the less edgy more youthful tim drake robin br br kevin <UNK> as usual <UNK> the voice of batman better than most live action actors br br kelly <UNK> did a much more decent voice acting job than i was expecting br br as in the live action batman films the movie lives or dies based on the quality of the villains my all time favorite the penguin is here his design is <UNK> than it has appeared before <UNK> more to the burgess meredith portrayal of the <UNK> than the danny <UNK> portrayal of batman returns david <UNK> <UNK> is the perfect choice for the <UNK> voice the penguin is finally portrayed as a cunning <UNK> just as he most <UNK> appears in the comics hector <UNK> voice creates a <UNK> who's much more memorable than the forgettable version in batman robin and finally batman has a descent mystery to solve putting the detective back in detective comics that is what <UNK> stands for after all the revolution to the mystery is a delightfully <UNK> twist br br the score adds to the mysterious ambiance of the movie it sounds like a mix between the score from <UNK> and the score from mission impossible all in all it's more entertaining than your average cartoon
<START> life in some future fascist or near fascist state which severely <UNK> personal <UNK> is a <UNK> theme both in modern literature and for film makers such works post us <UNK> about <UNK> <UNK> in our society to watch out for but to be effective they must also be entertaining unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in <UNK> the <UNK> than in entertaining us enough to become really widely read whilst with the films the problem is usually the other way round the first such work to become really widely known was probably george <UNK> 1984 first published in 1948 and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and as a film br br watch or read it and then when you are feeling a little depressed by man's <UNK> to man reach for cinderella 2000 this is a <UNK> light low budget film comedy based on the same theme which provides <UNK> but <UNK> viewing and as with 1984 the <UNK> has now passed beyond its <UNK> period most of the comedy is laid on with a <UNK> although there are just a few genuinely funny moments to exercise your mind in the long <UNK> between these you can focus it on the question of whether this film will gain a new <UNK> of life by being released as a dvd or whether it will finally disappear into oblivion as existing tape copies <UNK> past redemption there are many worse films appearing as dvd's these days and frankly i do not care much what happens either way br br so far the best of the films of this genre has probably been the <UNK> tale but i would very happily <UNK> them all for a well made film of jack <UNK> <UNK> novel the iron <UNK> ambitious as this would be it still seems incredible that no modern film maker has yet <UNK> to attempt it imdb only lists a b w silent version made in russia in <UNK>
<START> when i first started watching this anime i never thought that something about making bread could actually be interesting but thankfully i was mistaken from the moment i started watching it anime just pulled into the world of bread making i was hooked br br the biggest advantage of this anime is it's humor which is very intelligent and very funny with some recurring gags but the animation soundtrack and character development are below average while these <UNK> aren't seen so much in the first episodes because of the great job on this anime it really starts to show in the last 20 episodes when the reactions and recurring gags just grow old and aren't as funny as before br br as far as i'm concerned if this anime had ended with episode <UNK> i would have given it a 9 but the last episodes just leave a bitter <UNK> which sadly can't be washed away by the awesome 50 episodes br br 7 10
<START> mpaa rated r for violence language nudity and brief drug use <UNK> rating 13 canadian home video rating <UNK> br br i saw <UNK> today this film is also known as <UNK> out and street fight after watching fritz the cat i wanted to see more of <UNK> films i saw cool world and thought it was mediocre and i saw this when it was first released the film was very controversial it was considered racist and al <UNK> wanted the film banned he even led <UNK> outside the theatre where the film was playing the film was only released on vhs under the title street fight it is now considered a cult classic film and african american celebrities such as comedian richard <UNK> director spike lee and the rap group the wu <UNK> clan are said to have enjoyed this film i personally thought fritz the cat was a much better film but this is very enjoyable as well worth watching for <UNK> or <UNK> film fans the film mixes live action and animation sort of like the film who framed roger rabbit i would have preferred it in full animation but whatever the film starts off with a <UNK> and another man racing to rescue two of their friends from prison while the prisoners wait the older one tells a story of three men he knew the film then switches into animation format we see three black men who sold their house to this man they decide to make names for themselves in harlem so the leader a black rabbit kills a big player in harlem and he basically becomes a big shot the film moves on as the italian mafia want him out the mafia involves the godfather his three sons who are homosexual and an italian clown <UNK> is an entertaining animated film that's worth checking out if you can find it
<START> warning it contains spoilers if a movie starts with a sex scene then it's a bad movie see for example 300 this one <UNK> the above <UNK> the second scene <UNK> the spinning center of all the action the fact that we know the end makes the movie boring even more other plots are revealed as the story goes back and forth several times and this made more frustrated to compensate the <UNK> lack of suspense we learn more and more about how <UNK> are the characters and oh yes they have lots to show andy p hoffman for example is a drug addict more he is cheating his wife more he plans to rob his father more his wife is cheating with his brother more he doesn't regret his <UNK> to his mother's death more he is a serial killer more etc etc it's not enough space to write here i wonder how could he have a top job and why his wife didn't leave him before on the other hand i enjoy much the performances of the actor hoffman br br even here <UNK> saves what is left from my 7 spent for this absurdity why absurdity because it doesn't have sense why should i care for the despicable characters another broken <UNK> is that a movie should have a sympathetic at least pleasant character br br also it's a lot of sentimentality for example we are supposed to care for the <UNK> of the widowed father without knowing anything about the <UNK> before the crime
<START> i don't understand why people would praise this garbage its wrong stupid unrealistic awful and just about everything else the film is a view on life racial issues prejudice and everything else that strangely goes on in college this is where it fails it has no <UNK> on reality from many questionable non sense scenes in the movie such as for example br br a black man chasing down a white man with a gun the black man and stopped by the security guards <UNK> and carried out while the <UNK> runs right past them br br the same white man <UNK> down people from a roof topic which is stopped and beaten down by the same black man is then stopped and given a rodney king style beating while the gun man runs free while a moment later being chased back down by only one of the four guards br br as one previous reviewer pointed out several white <UNK> men being beaten down by several black men <UNK> around <UNK> including the <UNK> bust a <UNK> br br another critical flaw in the film are the shallow uninteresting main characters from the scared and confused white people and the mean angry and yet <UNK> black people its almost as its an insult to both black and white people i am a white male and i know many black and hispanic people who agree that this movie is wrong to portray characters and giving them those characteristics exclusively due to their race br br the storyline which i will explain now revolves around three characters one a black <UNK> the other a confused scared white girl who questions her sexuality and the third is a white man who is also confused and scared then blames his problems on black people in which he becomes a nazi later in the film they all have their share of problems and adventures including sex rape fights love hate prejudice racial war and oh yeah don't forget education which all comes down at the end for the fatal shoot out in which after they go back to their boring lives and think being white is bad does this sound alot like your college years didn't think so i don't think the director attended college especially if he were to make this awful mess br br overall this is a really bad bad ugly movie if you want to see a more accurate view or racial issues go see american history x if you want to see a more accurate view of college rent <UNK> just avoid this mess
<START> <UNK> was a bold film by raj <UNK> at it's time in 1997 when such a topic was damn out of the box br br to give him his credit he does succeed in showing how greed changes a person and to what extent the person can go to get what she wants br br the film however is damn melodramatic many places ridiculous br br one wonders why anil doesn't buy a tv for his wife when he earns so much just to show how poor he is br br the twist is well handled but the handling is straight out of 80's the <UNK> <UNK> comedy which entertains here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it doesn't fit in the story br br even there are several <UNK> scenes br br direction by raj <UNK> is adequate though at times too melodramatic music is okay but most songs look forced br br anil does his part well <UNK> is excellent in her part <UNK> is decent amongst rest <UNK> khan is as usual <UNK> <UNK> is funny <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is decent
<START> i hired this movie expecting a few laughs hopefully enough to keep me amused but i was sorely mistaken this movie showed very minimal moments of humour and the pathetic jokes had me cringing with shame for ever hiring it aimed at an age group of 10 15 this movie will certainly leave viewers outside of these boundaries feeling very <UNK> worth no more than 3 votes highly <UNK> for anyone not wanting to waste 2 hours of their lives
<START> i think dolph lundgren had potential at being a big action star a la <UNK> stallone and even van damme to certain degree he had some big moments in his career but he also made some poor choices and this is definitely one of them although made later in his career the strange thing about jill the <UNK> or jill rips or tied up is that i honestly think they seriously thought they were making a provocative and serious thriller it shows in the way that they describe it on imdb on the dvd case in the <UNK> and this film is not serious to call it campy would be a huge understatement the film tries to be complex and intelligent when in fact it's nothing more than shallow confusing and gratuitous on top of that they put lundgren who is known for action films in an attempt at a serious role which makes it even more campy because his range as an actor is pretty limited the entire film revolves around the kinky sex world and yet they attempt at making it a serious thriller just the plot and premise immediately make it a b movie porn at very best br br dolph lundgren plays <UNK> former cop and raging alcoholic matt <UNK> who decides to play detective when his brother is murdered i mean put aside the numerous plot holes that has lundgren getting free <UNK> to investigate crime scenes and witnesses and everything else even though he's not a cop anymore and you still have a pretty strange and rather lack <UNK> performance from lundgren <UNK> brett is <UNK> eventual love interest and his brother's widow brett plays her role <UNK> enough considering the script and campy story the supporting cast is huge and no one particularly stands out in their performances unless it's on the negative side such as the absolutely horrible performance by victor <UNK> who seems to go by several different names in the film boasts an awful accent and is a really awful villain br br i honestly tried to get into the mystery and film and watch closely but there wasn't any reason to because it was all a <UNK> of ridiculous plot and gratuitous sex games including a downright ridiculously hilarious scene where lundgren goes under cover and is strung upside down nearly naked to explain how classy and well done this movie is sarcasm sarcasm the back of the dvd i picked up it was really cheap has <UNK> character listed as murray wilson not the name of his character in the film while somehow lundgren manages to be usually watchable the film falls flat on it's face trying to be serious considering director anthony <UNK> is infamous for really b movie horror flicks it only makes sense even though i think he was really trying to be serious hard core cult lundgren fans will have to see it no one else should certainly for any sort of mystery or suspense 3 10
<START> claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the movie too long face only shots where you most of the time get the feeling that the lower half of the film is missing that the screen is cut off because there seems to be important actions going on but you cannot see them there is anyway already too much confusion in the movie so these viewing angles make it worse and do not contribute to <UNK> visuals br br i like <UNK> made movies and unconventional camera work i can handle deep and slow movies but this one is trying too hard to be something <UNK> and fails in my opinion painfully br br nothing to get attached to to any of the characters because they are not worked out well enough to work out characters more is needed than just minute long face shots at least with this set of script director actors br br i wonder whether some of the not so good acting is due to the script and director or due to the actors br br i will stay away from films both written and directed by le you for sure in the future br br what an annoying film even for someone who would be interested in that part of history and for someone who spent time in shanghai
<START> yes it's flawed especially if you're into hollywood films that demand a lot of effects a purely entertaining or fantasy story or plot and you can't actually think for yourself br br <UNK> films are for the intelligent film goer and <UNK> is a perfect example br br the characterizations are brilliant the story is excellent but like all <UNK> <UNK> films it has you thinking on every level about aspects of reality that would never have <UNK> on you before his films always make you think and personally i like that in a film br br so don't expect to come away from watching this film and feeling all happy happy because it's likely you'll be disappointed br br but i think it's excellent
<START> hear are some of the interesting things our combat hero faith <UNK> pat his son gordon t v <UNK> seems like a family business and terry <UNK> won miss america in 1973 by wearing a <UNK> and

<START> <UNK> again from the darkness how rare it is for a film to examine the lost soul of men in pain adam sandler stars as charlie a man who lost his family in the 9 11 tragedy and has since lost his career his reason to live and arguably his sanity don cheadle co stars as <UNK> former dental school roommate who appears to have the perfect life that sandler apparently had prior to 9 11 br br of course the parallels in these men's lives are obvious but it is actually refreshing to see men's feelings on display in a movie feelings other than lust and revenge that is watching how they actually help each other by just being there is painful and heartfelt writer director mike <UNK> the upside of anger and <UNK> <UNK> in this film really brings a different look and feel to the film some of the scenes don't work as well as others but overall it is well written and <UNK> directed br br sandler and cheadle are both excellent <UNK> character reminds a bit of his fine performance in punch drunk love but here he brings much more depth cheadle is always fine and does a nice job of expressing the burden he carries just by watching him work a jigsaw puzzle br br support work is excellent by <UNK> <UNK> smith as <UNK> wife <UNK> tyler as a very patient psychiatrist <UNK> <UNK> in an oddly appealing role donald sutherland as an irritated judge and melinda dillon and robert <UNK> as <UNK> in laws br br the film really touches on how the tragic events of that day affected one man so deeply that he is basically ruined in addition to the interesting story and some great shots of nyc you have to love any film that features <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> bruce <UNK> and roger <UNK> as well as eddie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> not exactly a <UNK> upbeat film but it is a quality film with an unusual story
<START> i still find it difficult to comprehend that a movie as bad as this could be made in hollywood the acting and story is simply pathetic the direction is awful i don't see any logic behind this trash except may be that the director had nothing good to do i took me ten minutes to realize that i had wasted my precious thirty <UNK> it filled me with <UNK> that i was going to waste some more time of my life on this crap i bet the movie was made in less than a day i don't know what category it falls into please avoid this movie at all costs just do anything even bang your head against walls but don't go for this movie
<START> the premise of this anime series is about bread of all things to base a plot on i truly laughed the main character has a special bread making power that he was born with and he goes off to bread <UNK> school i wish it were available on dvd and it doesn't matter if it's subtitled or dubbed it's that good even the theme song alone is funny at one point in the theme song there's an african japanese man with an <UNK> on <UNK> wielding a french <UNK> as if it were a samurai sword these images will not make sense unless you see the anime you'll laugh until your sides hurt it is definitely the most unique anime i have seen thus far
<START> citizen x tells the story of <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> who killed <UNK> people in 8 years time mainly women and children it shows how the investigation was <UNK> by soviet <UNK> how hard it was to investigate the crimes it does the job in such a brilliant way that it will leave no one <UNK> in the beginning it's perhaps a little bit slow of pace but it really grabs you as the story unfolds i can only say that next to the silence of the <UNK> this is by far the best movie about a serial killer i've ever seen br br it is very hard to say which actor's performance stands out above the rest in this movie stephen rea is really brilliant as the inexperienced <UNK> expert who is put in charge of the investigation donald <UNK> performance as his cynical superior and the only person in the russian government willing to help him is as outstanding as <UNK> and what to say about jeffrey <UNK> playing the serial killer <UNK> brilliantly created a character who <UNK> empathy rather than hatred yes he is a monster but he is also a sad figure <UNK> and <UNK> by his wife his boss his co workers he is tortured ashamed as well as extremely vicious br br i can only recommend this movie to everybody who's interested in a well made <UNK> drama where the actors are still more important than the special effects it deserves at least a 9 10 perhaps even more if you ask me
<START> i saw saving grace right after it came out on video since then it's become one of my favorites the plot isn't particularly complex but it doesn't take away from the entertainment it's chuck full of comedic moments and has a very endearing quality to it the characters are what makes the movie so good they each have their own quirky qualities which adds to the humor the two old ladies played by linda kerr scott and <UNK> law leaps to mind superb acting was done by all particularly brenda <UNK> she and craig <UNK> were great together in pulling off some of the funnier moments if you're looking for a good comedy i'd <UNK> recommend this movie
<START> this <UNK> directed fantasy is the second in the popular by flawed tarzan series put out by mgm it is a first class adventure for many reasons i suggest fine photography strong imaginative qualities a delightful cast good <UNK> jungle locales and a very exciting storyline johnny <UNK> plays tarzan a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sort unlike edgar rice <UNK> creation but he is honest loyal brave and very courageous and he needs to be during this narrative as jane parker his wife who had been jane porter in the novels maureen <UNK> is very attractive and lively as well as being athletic where the script calls for that quality the effect of the lighting the <UNK> and clever sets is quite unusual this is an <UNK> adventure filmed on the mgm back lot which really works the fabulous <UNK> <UNK> is a remote locale which allows tarzan and jane to live <UNK> but into their <UNK> come people searching from them <UNK> of a civilization jane has left behind and into which tarzan could not really be <UNK> <UNK> one is harry holt still in love with her who with his friend <UNK> her to come back to civilization with him the <UNK> and <UNK> interest her but she refuses to leave tarzan tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals in scenes that look like a <UNK> king king the group claim to want to hunt animals and tarzan agrees for jane's sake to a bit of big game <UNK> but at some point the idea of <UNK> and of <UNK> a fortune turns the <UNK> <UNK> minds tarzan is shot left for dead and the group force jane to <UNK> them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the fabulous <UNK> graveyard but they find the area <UNK> by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions tarzan rides in on an elephant he has <UNK> in time to call in a most spectacular elephant filled scene he saves jane and what is left of the expedition who return home little <UNK> but much wise as jane continues her savage <UNK> with her new husband the film was directed by set design wizard cedric <UNK> and quite beautifully too his work and the lighting are the outstanding <UNK> of this entertaining and exciting film which manages to seem real despite all its hollywood shortcomings from start to finish neil hamilton is a very good harry paul <UNK> is even better before and after he reveals himself to be thoroughly bad <UNK> harvey and nathan <UNK> round out a small cast very <UNK> an unusual and well realized fantasy film with interesting situations and some strong dialogue <UNK> as well recommended
<START> earlier today i got into an argument on why so many people complain about modern films in which i encountered a curious statement the character development in newer movies just isn't nearly as good or interesting as it used to be depending on the film s in question this can be attributed to a number of things sometimes generic special effects and plot driven hollywood garbage like war of the worlds but in the case of over the top uninteresting attempts at social commentary and a desperate struggle to put art back into cinema it's movies like dog days that are to blame br br i normally have a very high tolerance for movies no matter how dull or pointless i find them ranging from good long ones like <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to ones i've considered painful to sit through a la <UNK> dog and wild wild west i shut this movie off 45 minutes in which is 30 minutes more than i actually should have i wasn't interested in any of the characters whatsoever and found nothing substantial beyond a thin <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> in an attempt to say something about the <UNK> of society this film too easily falls into being self indulgent trite and exploitative in a very sincere sense granted i've seen many disturbing movies on the same subject but there are so many better films out there about depressing pathetic people happiness <UNK> kids <UNK> storytelling <UNK> that actually contain characters of great emotional depth and personality dog days had none more than an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for society choosing to ignore any true intelligence about the way people actually are and instead choosing to be a dull awful and hopelessly unoriginal attempt at a work of art this isn't a characterization of the unknown or a clever observation into the <UNK> of society it's just boring and nothing worth caring about
<START> i've noticed how all the other reviews of this film mention how wholesome and entertaining it is these people need to get out of the house more often i don't know why they're <UNK> for this vapid insipid brainless piece of fluff pat <UNK> has absolutely no acting talent whatsoever and his <UNK> is <UNK> only by that of his co star pamela austin a former model yet one more reason to outlaw the <UNK> practice of <UNK> talentless models on an unsuspecting <UNK> public a foul habit that unfortunately <UNK> to this day a good supporting cast terry thomas edward everett <UNK> among others tries hard to make some sense out of this but to no <UNK> i noticed that two directors shared credit although credit isn't the word i would use neither is director as for wholesome entertainment there are plenty of those types of movies available without torturing your loved ones by forcing them to sit through this find one of those films and skip this one
<START> the revolt of the zombies is not the worst movie i've ever seen but it is pretty far down on the list when an expedition is sent to cambodia to discover the trick to making zombies after world war i one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions and he succeeds at least at first a love triangle <UNK> the story some br br this really was a tedious movie with horrible acting that made it difficult to tell who were zombies and who weren't the dialog was little better and the plot was unbelievable not the zombie part of it but parts related to the romance and while i am not any student or expert on cinematography the camera work didn't seem to help the film much either br br while i have seen a few movies that are worse this is unlikely to please anyone it's bad and not in a so bad that it is good kind of way
<START> the trailer for this movie didn't do the movie justice and while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across the first half of the movie being a light romance comedy and the second have a more serious romantic drama the overall impact was much better than i thought it would be this movie was more of a date movie but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be kidman being one of my favorites of course i'm biased but this movie proved to be a light sensitive if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better three out of four stars 9 5 <UNK>
<START> i watched this last night after not having seen it for several years it really is a fun little film with a bunch of faces you didn't know were in it arkin shines as always check it out you won't be <UNK> by the way it was just released on dvd and contrary to its <UNK> it is widescreen the transfer is rather poor but at least the whole movie is visible
<START> this film is really bad with a script full of <UNK> lines and incredibly bad performances the special effects are also bad not the worst ones i have seen either and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it just two short themes 30 seconds long or so are repeated constantly throughout the whole film br br all in all one of the worst films i have ever seen
<START> there have been far too few mainstream films set in post colonial africa and the ones that have are a mixed bunch this one with its <UNK> <UNK> to expose slavery in the 1970s shows the best and worst values of africa which turn out not to be too different to the values of humanity as a whole it also has shortcomings given the <UNK> influence of western pre <UNK> of <UNK> and especially <UNK> br br dr <UNK> <UNK> the beautiful african american wife of the english doctor david <UNK> is captured by arab slave <UNK> along with a teenage <UNK> girl and a young boy the lead slave <UNK> <UNK> is every bit the stage arab with his <UNK> and sometimes humorous <UNK> and gestures to match which would not be out of place on carry on follow that <UNK> but are not up the standard this film deserves peter ustinov of course had more than enough skills to address some of the shortcomings of the script and he rescued what could otherwise have been a <UNK> one dimensional character br br continuing the stereotypical theme all three of <UNK> arab employees are <UNK> and one has <UNK> <UNK> towards the boy which thankfully are not portrayed on the screen br br one of david's first <UNK> of call is the local police officer a stereotypical pompous and incompetent african <UNK> david then meets two stereotypical white ex <UNK> an <UNK> walker played by rex harrison and an american <UNK> played by william <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> with conventional views on mixed race relationships who initially refuses to help unless david provides <UNK> up front won over by david's love for <UNK> and conscious of his own inability to find love he agrees to take david up in his helicopter to help search for <UNK> they find <UNK> and his <UNK> crossing the border and are unable to pursue them into the <UNK> territory as a result of <UNK> <UNK> and david's lack of experience with <UNK> his helicopter is shot down but david survives br br we then see david introduced to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an african who has lost his family to <UNK> and is now only driven by vengeance they find the <UNK> girl with a group of <UNK> and know they are on the right track to find <UNK> br br in one of the most heart <UNK> scenes they kill a party of slave <UNK> only to find that it was not <UNK> group and have no choice but to send their <UNK> to the <UNK> they met earlier br br later on we discover that the young boy who had been raped is a witch doctor and in an excellent scene with supernatural overtones he uses his knowledge to kill one of <UNK> henchmen <UNK> on her part and despite the <UNK> of the boy manages to engineer the demise of <UNK> two other employees br br by this time <UNK> and his slaves are within days of reaching the slave market br br <UNK> now in no doubt that <UNK> is trouble attempts to sell her to an <UNK> wealthy arab prince omar <UNK> who is corrupt but intelligent on discovering that <UNK> is an american working for the u n the prince rather <UNK> decides to carry on with the <UNK> without considering the consequences the scene where the two men <UNK> is one of the best in the film br br at the slave market the young boy is sold to a middle aged german <UNK> and we are left to guess whether the boy will still be considered <UNK> when his owner is on the receiving end of his witch <UNK> skills br br david and <UNK> finally confront <UNK> and there is a bitter sweet ending from <UNK> point of view br br ultimately david and <UNK> are re united and <UNK> whose life is in ruins can <UNK> himself with having seen the task he set himself completed br br the overall plot of the film is excellent but it loses marks for its stereotypical portrayal of nearly all the leading characters credit must go to all the leading actors for addressing many of the shortcomings of the scripting
<START> <UNK> again from the darkness this one will be compared to the princess bride and although it doesn't measure up to that classic it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right the story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained but the execution is fine even building up strong suspense br br charlie cox plays <UNK> who falls for the wrong girl <UNK> miller and agrees to <UNK> her a fallen star who happens to be played by the stunning claire danes not much suspense on what happens with these two but the suspenseful part comes in with the wicked witch played by michelle pfeiffer and the prince son of king peter o'toole looking to <UNK> the ruby <UNK> our star is wearing lots of bad chasing the good br br along the way an encounter with the strangest pirate you will see including any from the <UNK> robert deniro plays captain shakespeare tough on the inside and shall we say in touch with his feminine side another encounter involves the brilliant ricky <UNK> as a fast talking <UNK> and that is good for a couple of laughs br br not your typical chase coming of age or fantasy film but director matthew <UNK> <UNK> cake effort deserves an audience sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money my guess it will find big success on video
<START> emily <UNK> <UNK> is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character i have ever seen on a screen she is the queen of this film beyond all doubt or is she <UNK> to the king the <UNK> <UNK> of the chess games and the <UNK> struggles for control power and victory is stunning just as the chess masters in the film do the director is playing many <UNK> games with our mind at once but all <UNK> into either major or minor <UNK> the period the costumes and imagery of early 20th century <UNK> lake district is captured <UNK> not a single square of space is wasted br br so many brilliant scenes abound i cannot <UNK> them all i recommend <UNK> enough time to watch this movie twice possibly a week apart because you can't possibly capture all the poetry within a 64 square yet multi dimensional <UNK> in one setting br br i did not read <UNK> book but to try an <UNK> of my own what i am reading reminds of me of another <UNK> <UNK> poetry as game movie barry <UNK> the natural it totally <UNK> the downbeat ending of bernard <UNK> <UNK> book in favor of a romantic <UNK> that was uniquely american well the director did that one better by <UNK> <UNK> russian and italian morals and <UNK> as a backdrop to enlightenment the true story here is that games are zero sum there is a winner and a loser unless both contestants draw but in life and especially in the context of our immortal souls we are only limited by those constraints and life's conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit br br pure love as <UNK> by emily <UNK> <UNK> can <UNK> and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously only the <UNK> <UNK> by our fears can cut us off from it br br this is a magnificent movie 10 10
<START> awful movie it's a shame that a few of <UNK> top actors and actresses made such a <UNK> poor film br br there is barely something changed since the first movie and the tv series same actors same prototype characters same scenario emotional complications the team under emotional pressure but everything turn out tip top after a predictable grand finale another constant fact in the work of jan <UNK> is the exaggerated product placement company <UNK> on the <UNK> shirt and along side the pitch ok but two times a commercial by one of the characters about an internet <UNK> is just over the top br br meanwhile <UNK> has it about the making of a second series for <UNK> commercial tv station <UNK> <UNK> or not the station where jan <UNK> is <UNK> manager since a few months br br to conclude and the golden <UNK> award for worst foreign movie goes to team spirit 2
<START> frustrating to watch because of one man's <UNK> to leave his native country for the dream land in switzerland and what he does to achieve that creates <UNK> for all those involved along the journey he encounters <UNK> who take advantage of other human suffering and desperation
<START> honestly i was expecting to hate this one and really only checked it out because jenna jameson is in it but i have to say i got a kick out of evil breed a group of college kids and their teacher go on a field trip to ireland their <UNK> are located near the woods where it is <UNK> that strange things happen and tourists often disappear without a trace the group of post teens is warned by the <UNK> caretaker not to venture into the woods but being the stupid b movie characters that they are of course they pay no attention and pay for their mistake one by one first off there is plenty wrong with evil breed the acting dialog is pretty weak and my major <UNK> is that a film that has jenna jameson <UNK> <UNK> ginger <UNK> and taylor hayes should have far more gratuitous nudity than was on display here and <UNK> role in this production is grossly over hyped as she has a combined total of about 2 minutes of screen time even less with <UNK> and ginger <UNK> shows no skin and has the worst irish accent ever also the last scene of the film makes absolutely no sense and feels like it's thrown in just to end the film those <UNK> aside there is some good stuff as well richard <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are both <UNK> early on with <UNK> nude <UNK> ending up on a <UNK> spit and <UNK> guts hanging out from being torn in half though how she ends up this way isn't shown on screen not bad for the first 5 minutes the other kill scenes are pretty inventive including <UNK> forced breast <UNK> <UNK> a guy getting his <UNK> pulled out through his ass a knife through the face and a few other <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> scenes also have uncut versions that are on the special features and it's a shame the producers made them chop 'em so to speak also the film moves along at a pretty good clip once it gets moving so you don't really have too much time to be bored the creature fx are also done competently which definitely helps overall evil breed was not nearly as bad as i expected this one along with <UNK> little <UNK> have almost <UNK> my interest in american low budget straight to video films i usually steer clear of them as a whole but these two have been decent enough to give me some faith evil breed is no masterpiece but it is a decent way to blow 90 minutes might not hurt to suck on a bottle of cheap <UNK> while you're at it i know i was and i'm sure it didn't hurt the experience 7 5 10
<START> <UNK> is on the australian all shorts video from tribe first <UNK> <UNK> the talents of first time directors br br i wish more scripts had such excellent dialogue br br i hope rachel <UNK> has more stories to tell she does it so well
<START> for a comedic writer woody allen really lets the paying viewer down with this <UNK> attempt at character development there are a few entertaining moments but no more than one would have listening to their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> balls br br will ferrell wastes his time in this movie which fails to showcase his usually funny delivery amanda <UNK> did well but again didn't have the room to move in this otherwise corpse like movie the movie is so heavy and dull that it cannot be carried but if it were carried <UNK> mitchell did it br br if you enjoy movies that go on and on in one scene and don't really accomplish anything but to show that their writer can write a few lines of snappy dialogue on occasion then you'll love this movie
<START> if this film was a comedy i would have given it a 10 oh my where do i begin put it this way i've seen lots of terrible horror films but this one makes <UNK> 2 look like <UNK> saving private ryan it's as if a group of porn filmmakers decided to make a horror film changed their mind in <UNK> and decided to do a comedy then went back to horror and then decided that they should have just stuck with porno <UNK> at that everything about this film is simply terrible the musical score someone shoot the guy who invented the <UNK> keyboard the script the directing the cinematography the acting there simply are no words to describe this oh wait yes there are holy
<START> i've never been to paris but after seeing paris je t'aime i'm crazy to visit this city i've been to ny several times and i love the city and its <UNK> i kinda expected to be touched by this film to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away but lo and behold i regret the time and money i spent with it there are no love stories between people or a person and the city there's a lot of dysfunctional <UNK> and relations or people who know each other and it just doesn't work out fine maybe this reflects a characteristic of the city where it's said to have thousands of people living on their own can't you find love in new york
<START> <UNK> films people in extreme emotional situations usually with several violent scenes in la <UNK> <UNK> he's dealing with the devastating effects on a woman's husband and son as she dies of cancer in a <UNK> <UNK> the teenage girl's sexual <UNK> leads to violent <UNK> with her family here we have a rather spoiled young woman who <UNK> her husband to take up with a sexy ex con her motivation is a little <UNK> since <UNK> is incapable of reading or discussing anything more challenging than tv shows on the other hand he's got a fabulous body i wonder why depardieu never made a sports movie to show off that <UNK> he would have been great as a <UNK> player br br the casting is impressive isabelle <UNK> isn't allowed to give a bland <UNK> performance she has given many depardieu plays <UNK> with all the <UNK> and charm you could want see the scene in the bar where he's stabbed in the gut runs away and seeks treatment then soon <UNK> with <UNK> guy <UNK> with those coal black eyes and <UNK> look plays <UNK> husband beautifully it's a fine repeat of the pairing in coup de <UNK>
<START> the crush is a pleasant enough 40 something friends romantic chick flick for the first two thirds or so as it tries to be a brit sex and the city br br i particularly enjoyed the turn around of the <UNK> young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out come to think of it we didn't see all that much physical flesh of him either and kenny <UNK> is worth seeing more of br br they sure make a lot more deal of young man older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of sabrina neither movie do i like or for that matter with the douglas zeta jones or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br surrounding <UNK> <UNK> as an ex pat otherwise are welcome <UNK> from brit dramas and comedies such as <UNK> <UNK> anna <UNK> br br the plot twists towards the end feel very <UNK> ex <UNK> but it wasn't until the credits came up at the end that i realized what might really be wrong just as with sex and the city the writer director is male here first <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> and i think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work the characters are a school principal a cop and a doctor which would have been a better and more interesting movie the working title for the film was the sad f <UNK> club which would have made its parallels with the gay broken hearts club even more obvious br br originally written 4 6 2002
<START> this is an hilarious movie one of the very best things about it is the quality of the performance by each actor from the largest role to the smallest each character is vivid unforgettable and so understandable it can also make you laugh so hard your health will improve
<START> this is a unique and bold film it's energetic with highly developed characters very good performances br br i love directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to look <UNK> ask questions and dig underneath the surface by the nature of the film it practically demands that the viewer look <UNK> as well it can take some courage to do this i can see how some close minded people might find this quite disturbing however i found it thought provoking much more than just entertainment br br <UNK> <UNK> is truly an original filmmaker with vision i am curious to see what he will do next br br watch him
<START> it's hard to believe that this is a sequel to henry fool hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both movies while henry fool is refreshing witty comical fay grim is slow boring and doesn't go anywhere where has the wit gone i am <UNK> br br it is 10 years since i saw henry fool and many of its dialogs and scenes are still vivid in my memory fay grim is painful to watch this is no fault of the actors who are good parker posey or great jeff goldblum the blame lies entirely with the plot the dialog and even some of the filming low budget is no excuse a huge disappointment br br sorry i couldn't pay attention to the plot i was so bored so disappointed if you enjoyed this one you might not enjoy henry fool so much the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other there is no continuity in the characters' personalities it's all a fraud to <UNK> fans of henry fool to watch the sequel br br i'm switching this off now henry in some sort of jail with a <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> has all ingredients to impress the academy its director joe wright has already <UNK> a best picture candidate the leading actor robert downey jr starred in a widely praised superhero film finally the movie itself is a drama when it was mysteriously pulled from release in late 2008 <UNK> and critics were <UNK> now that i've seen it i assure you universal didn't just <UNK> this film to promote iron man oscar buzz the <UNK> is a weak drama with no <UNK> conflict that is vastly inferior to any 2009 best picture candidates br br downey and co star jamie fox aren't to be blamed for this <UNK> joe wright is largely at fault but even he can't save a lifetime story many movies are too complex and alienate viewers this one is unusually simple it's a movie about a newspaper reporter steve lopez downey who befriends a homeless musician <UNK> <UNK> jamie fox that's it <UNK> is <UNK> and doesn't <UNK> with <UNK> traditional approach to friendship the two become friends they begin this movie as <UNK> and are <UNK> by its end tension consists of moments like this will <UNK> let lopez take him to the homeless shelter this material would have been better suited as a made for tv production rather than a feature film br br wright includes many scenes of cheap humor to obscure the lack of content lopez battles yard <UNK> <UNK> in what i consider a sub plot do you remember when this happened in <UNK> or pride and prejudice those films were structured enough to <UNK> an occasional joke but nothing so prolonged <UNK> back story is fleshed out when it doesn't need to be worst of all these scenes are not connected and appear at random <UNK> it's a way of <UNK> that the main story carries little appeal <UNK> was a <UNK> <UNK> with a tough upbringing i was too this is a <UNK> attempt to create sympathy with <UNK> when most of us already have it he's a homeless <UNK> for crying out loud the movie somewhat conveys <UNK> love for music like <UNK> and <UNK> lives upstairs it isn't as effective as either of those pictures however the entire film is <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> it ultimately is how he <UNK> with everyone else his being a musician is a nice touch but hardly worth including the film doesn't <UNK> this characteristic fully into his persona take music out of <UNK> or <UNK> lives upstairs and no film remains the <UNK> is more about friendship in general than music <UNK> could be a writer or film critic and few lines of dialog would need to be seriously altered br br this is only joe <UNK> third film and his first that isn't a romance staring <UNK> knightley let's hope this film isn't an indication of how limited his abilities are there are <UNK> <UNK> to his earlier works but the <UNK> is much weaker than either of them in his defense universal should not have agreed to widely release this picture this film seems <UNK> for imagine entertainment <UNK> of <UNK> i wouldn't be so disappointed with it if had a limited release its poor box office performance may <UNK> better dramas from being distributed <UNK>
<START> haven't seen this film haven't even heard of this film it wouldn't surprise me one of the few truly independent films produced in the last ten years no studio had faith in the picture and it was never picked up for major distribution the independent company <UNK> films gave <UNK> and lena a very limited run with virtually no promotion and the majority of major film critics didn't even bother reviewing it i guess a movie based on a one act one set play about the apartheid and its affect on two individuals never really had a chance in today's market and it's the intelligent film <UNK> loss br br for the record both angela <UNK> and danny glover deserved <UNK> nominations as did the cinematographer but the film received such little <UNK> that i can't even blame the academy on that one this is a film that is challenging thought provoking and heartbreaking and it actually requires the audience to meet it on it's own terms taking that into consideration it is definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment director john <UNK> wisely does not attempt to dress up <UNK> <UNK> play sure we're given a few <UNK> flashbacks and some breathtaking <UNK> shots but the film version of <UNK> and lena remains on the whole a story of two people living in <UNK> conditions br br stripped of their basic human rights <UNK> glover and lena <UNK> have no one left to attack but each other a third character joins them for awhile willie <UNK> amazing in a largely silent role but the film's focus never <UNK> from the title characters and what they've become <UNK> and glover give brave performances as the broken couple performances that simply could not be improved upon <UNK> and brutally stimulating both intellectually and emotionally <UNK> and lena deserves to be <UNK> of home video hands down the best film of the year 2000
<START> john waters has given us a genuinely enjoyable film this certainly isn't without its shocking waters <UNK> moments but it is <UNK> than his older <UNK> stuff such as pink <UNK> pecker <UNK> back to john's early mainstream stage in that it reminds the viewer of the same kind of humor that was evident in <UNK> overall a really fun comedy with some great moments
<START> this was <UNK> to the fans as the winner takes all match occurred between two separate companies the world wrestling <UNK> and the alliance an <UNK> of former <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> because the final match to <UNK> the superior company was a tag team match the <UNK> were confined to <UNK> opponents from each side of the ring to another each wrestler concludes that in order to <UNK> their opponents and to <UNK> the match <UNK> is necessary each wrestler merely <UNK> an <UNK> with punches <UNK> a special move and <UNK> in a partner the storyline had previously been <UNK> by the <UNK> of vince that a member of the <UNK> would be <UNK> and join the <UNK> it was obvious with that statement that the <UNK> would <UNK> overall very innovative storyline but poor execution which is not the <UNK> of the <UNK> because the match format is tag team the remaining matches are just revolting br br edge versus test potent big boot by test but this did not display the true talents of both stars br br al snow versus christian good match but <UNK> to the pay per view br br <UNK> versus william regal the worst match of the night br br <UNK> battle royal this was an <UNK> fun match to watch but because the main stars of both companies were involved in the main event only a wrestler who <UNK> appears on heat and is probably a <UNK> light <UNK> reject i e the <UNK> who is merely hired as an entertainer br br hardy <UNK> versus dudley <UNK> the best match of the night jeff hardy executed a <UNK> bomb from the <UNK> of a cage and through a wooden table and matt was <UNK> into the cage which appeared to be extremely painful br br because stone cold was the <UNK> champion rob van <UNK> was the hardcore champion and kurt angle was a mole in the alliance all fundamental stars in the main event on the <UNK> of the alliance were granted work after the <UNK> outcome except for booker t who recently attacked a wrestler on raw and will inevitably be given work <UNK> <UNK> will return to television somehow and everyone desired to witness the downfall and demise of the alliance to see stone cold out of work the <UNK> has done much better a match in which all <UNK> were brought to one <UNK> would have been better and what ever became of <UNK> and iron man matches
<START> here italy i write from <UNK> why <UNK> the abc should have given it a chance to build an audience the cast w hope davis campbell scott erika christensen <UNK> <UNK> jay <UNK> and bridget <UNK> is one of the best i've seen in recent we need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals not mindless <UNK> i hope that abc will <UNK> its decision or another station will pick it up please sign online <UNK> to abc http www <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> please sign online <UNK> to abc http www <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> julie waters is always marvelous but adrian <UNK> is a positive revelation in this <UNK> gender bent comedy about a <UNK> who cannot <UNK> his obsession and the changes he goes through when he's discovered <UNK> <UNK> the vulgar <UNK> easy jokes for genuine wit and true insight and has an absolute ball while doing it a very nice low key feel good comedy
<START> unfortunately this movie never made it to dvd i saw it when it was first released to the theaters in 1983 and then again when the vhs was released in 1992 when i recently saw a vhs copy at a flea market i immediately bought it i was not disappointed first the obvious <UNK> <UNK> is beautiful and a joy to behold but then the film takes you into an unreal world where you have to reflect on your values and decide what is really important to you the movie is about a lot of things it is about how the world bank and large <UNK> exploit and <UNK> developing countries with their <UNK> schemes to force them into a debt that they can never <UNK> it is about how our economic system exploits us by forcing us into debt with credit cards <UNK> and car <UNK> it is about trying to save an innocence that maybe we have never really had and maybe we cannot really save it is about good and evil and about how hard it is sometimes to tell one from the other it raises a lot of questions but does not give answers i think sometimes this is good for this reason this is a film really worth saving and seeing
<START> this is one of my favorite govinda movies of all time and best film of 1994 david <UNK> does a great job in directing this movie he makes it funny and adds family drama govinda is excellent as <UNK> <UNK> and gives a great performance <UNK> kapoor is an actress i hate this film she is a little less annoying but still <UNK> in some scenes <UNK> khan is a <UNK> in acting and yet gives a superb performance <UNK> <UNK> is terrific as the mother and gives a outstanding performance <UNK> kapoor is brilliant as <UNK> the sidekick this film has comedy action family drama and romance a full on entertainer
<START> this movie was more of a passage into <UNK> for one gay man and how he must deal with everyone his mother is depressed his younger sister is a pain his older sister is somewhat accepting the relationship looks good with his boyfriend <UNK> and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy unfortunately the new guy <UNK> around on him and says it really didn't mean anything our young gay man goes <UNK> and ends up in the looney bin and eventually leaves <UNK> his new lover and starting over we are left with him starting over and viewing not <UNK> in happiness so maybe things will go better for him in the future the ending was kind of a <UNK> but the whole movie was entirely realistic and so i will let this real ending slip bye with a high rating
<START> what a outstanding movie is this i have not words to describe i don't know how come the rating of the movie is 7 3 it should be 9 3 but anyways no one else can make this movie and the acting by akshay is just outstanding the second half of the movie makes u cry and the movie has a really good unexpected ending which makes the movie perfect you should watch this movie once i think twice well it's up to u anyways i love this movie and it's not just sad and funny but it also gives u a really good meanings and what u should be doing so i think this is one of the best movie in the bollywood history but i know the people has <UNK> chooses so ya the only thing i don't like about this movie is the music well the background music is good but the songs are not good enough i think the music would be better if a r <UNK> would be the music director but anyways we can't do anything about that so ya
<START> the last tarzan film starring johnny <UNK> looking surprisingly aged a year after tarzan and the <UNK> is bad in spite of all the trivia one can add to make it look better it is obvious that rko tried to make a great farewell for <UNK> shooting in beautiful scenery in <UNK> with a top star of that country <UNK> palma and multiple award winning cinematographer gabriel <UNK> and bringing in <UNK> composer <UNK> <UNK> to do the score although it may have cost less for filming abroad it looks more expensive than any other rko film in the series taking advantage of <UNK> <UNK> and real <UNK> as <UNK> and with impressive <UNK> for all the scenes related to the temple of god <UNK> especially the exterior built on <UNK> rocks kurt <UNK> should have stayed as director instead of robert <UNK> who gives it a very slow pace <UNK> had done a fine work with tarzan and the <UNK> tarzan and the <UNK> woman and tarzan and the <UNK> and finished his career directing the classic the fly the year before his death while <UNK> became a television director after a career of few remarkable films if <UNK> looks tired the <UNK> playing <UNK> is not as good as the others but the worst character is <UNK> an obnoxious <UNK> who sings horrendous songs that have a <UNK> air in a location supposed to be africa and shot in <UNK> boring and decidedly of dubious taste it was a sad farewell to <UNK> tarzan
<START> this movie is truly one of the worst pieces of garbage ever it really is surprising that something so completely terrible could be made but if you can stand the mind numbing plot character development and direction you may get a kick out of the soundtrack which is so appalling that it is funny the movie begins terribly and quickly becomes unwatchable someone should give anyone involved with this movie some sort of <UNK> because their career was probably ruined because of involvement in this movie if you do end up seeing this movie or have seen it already i feel your pain then these words have come too late for anyone else stay away at all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it will waste 2 hours of your life then at least you can clean up or something while viewing it
<START> i admit having come of age in the hippie <UNK> age i am a sucker for these kind of movies i can enjoy some of the schlock of the hippie genre far more than most normal people however this movie is simply awful in every <UNK> way br br every trite perception of the hippie silliness is presented as <UNK> cops kill a young long hair when he <UNK> lands a plane this movie is so horrible that it is not even funny to watch as a goof on the <UNK> of the hippie <UNK> it is like a left wing version of <UNK> except without professional actors the only reason i gave it two stars was because there are some <UNK> of interest on the soundtrack besides i couldn't find a selection for negative stars br br no actors almost no plot <UNK> barely even a script you got it an art movie all this done at root <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dragging out each meaningless scene just to fill up time br br in a bizarre twist of life imitating art the star <UNK> of the movie joined a <UNK> in real life and robbed a bank in boston one of his co robbers was killed and he was sent to jail where he was killed in a suspicious <UNK> accident and just think he got to leave this behind as a legacy <UNK> <UNK>
<START> hood of the living dead and all of the other movies these guys directed look like they got together and filmed this with their buddies who have zero talent one afternoon when they were bored lines are completely <UNK> and unconvincing i find that 95 of amateur movies and 90 of home video footage is better than this film although the similarities between them warrant the comparison hey lets see if anyone is dumb enough to buy our movies hopefully nobody else wasn't my apologies to those involved in the <UNK> as this review is somewhat harsh but i was the <UNK> who read your fake reviews and purchased the movie
<START> <UNK> direction ruins an otherwise compelling period story that stars the wondrous zhang <UNK> in an excellent role as a woman who joins an <UNK> group in <UNK> china just prior to the japanese invasion of <UNK> and <UNK> with a former lover who is now working for japan every bit of drama and forward motion of the story is sucked dry by director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> directorial style characters stand still staring at each other for long minutes saying nothing hand held cameras hold forever on faces showing interminable reactions way longer than they need to edits repeat the same reaction is triple <UNK> we know nothing about the characters as the story begins and are given little new information as the story progresses only silence and static shots of lovers who don't speak who interaction through silent dances but share no apparent emotional <UNK> a very sleep inducing film
<START> the fallen ones falls under the waste of life <UNK> category i am sad that i am now two hours older was not entertained my other family members also watched this movie and threw <UNK> comments at the screen and <UNK> for the mummy i felt sorry for the actors wagner i have read other negative reviews and cannot add anything else to this movie other than it could be reduced to 25 minutes so it could take a 30 minute <UNK> on tv without any loss of plot it reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients but when served is bland with no flavor at all in my humble opinion the <UNK> foot mummy should have been 8 10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the <UNK> and replacing him with several people who want to <UNK> the facts and want <UNK> <UNK> for evil reasons the heroes are <UNK> and tossed on there ear by their <UNK> later after everything was screwed up by the evil people the heroes would save the day and prove everyone wrong
<START> made me think about it for days after seeing it that to me is the mark of a great movie eyes wide shut had the same effect on me i am tired of these people <UNK> these happy hollywood cookie cutter endings i am planning on going to see it again tonight to understand the plot a little better but regardless the emotional messages of the movie were totally felt
<START> kurt thomas stars as jonathan <UNK> some kind of a <UNK> who trains for a special game which involves being hunted by a group of ninjas but those ninjas won't stand a chance especially since <UNK> is a <UNK> taken as a whole <UNK> is one <UNK> bad movie the atrocious acting the god awful script and really incompetent directing make the quality below human standards however this movie is so terrible it becomes really really funny i mean with dialog such as i know i'll <UNK> them or ha your through only add to the mock value that <UNK> more then <UNK> besides it's wisely the only movie that has are hero a <UNK> who finds things to swing on in the heat of the moment
<START> i had watched several days film shooting of this movie that summer the end result was just two scenes in the movie the location was <UNK> lake in the black hills bring the <UNK> stop the <UNK> etc so this <UNK> youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed the local buffalo herd was being <UNK> so the shooting scenes were for real yes doris animals were hurt during filming i think the ending was copied by jack nicholson in the shining a great western social comment from the 50's this should be in the same class as high <UNK> for real western drama or used as a social statement like <UNK> jungle or rebel without a cause was for 50's youth
<START> i saw this in the theater and i instantly thought that it is good enough to own on video i am a big nut for sci fi action flicks though anyway br br without giving any of the story away it is worth seeing if you like sci fi without <UNK> much thought the story is basic and the plot is very good worth your time to see br br maybe they will make a sequel br br 8 out of 10
<START> based on <UNK> leonard this is a violent and intelligent action film the story a business man is <UNK> by some 3 criminals roy <UNK> does great job as the leading character and special <UNK> got to go to john glover who plays sort of a naughty psychopath i must mention that the villains characters are very complex and interesting something that is very rare for an action film also features some beautiful and sexy women most notable are kelly preston as the young <UNK> for <UNK> character vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as the hooker who is connected with the three <UNK> i'm glad to say that ann margaret still hasn't lost it this lady is a true babe don't look at the rate of this film i really don't know what the public and some critics have against this film but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this truly gripping and under rated film you will enjoy it that's a promise recommended a
<START> at the name of <UNK> every <UNK> shall bow especially after his <UNK> literature prize acceptance speech which did little more than <UNK> <UNK> by the numbers sixth form anti <UNK> but this is even worse not only is it a tour de force of <UNK> a superb example of how to get away with <UNK> on your decades old reputation but it also represents the <UNK> of a superb piece the original sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind yes it was a theatrical <UNK> and it is easy to see how it's central plot device would work better on the stage than the screen but it still worked <UNK> well this is a michael caine vanity piece but let's face it caine is no olivier not only can he not fill <UNK> shoes he couldn't even fill his bathroom <UNK> the appropriately named caine is after all a distinctly average actor whose only real recommendation like so many british actors is their <UNK> in the business he was a good harry <UNK> excellent in get carter but that's <UNK> lot mate give this a very wide <UNK> and stick to the superb original this is more of a half <UNK>
<START> this movie is a great the plot is very true to the book which is a classic written by mark <UNK> the movie starts of with a scene where hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called when you <UNK> your toe on the moon it reminds me of sinatra's song high hopes it is fun and inspirational the music is great throughout and my favorite song is sung by the king hank bing crosby and sir <UNK> <UNK> overall a great family movie or even a great date movie this is a movie you can watch over and over again the princess played by <UNK> <UNK> is gorgeous i love this movie if you liked danny <UNK> in the court <UNK> then you will definitely like this movie
<START> this is a bad b movie <UNK> as a <UNK> the porn documentary filmmaker in the movie has almost as much screen time and dialog as any other character that completely destroyed any documentary feel that they may have wanted to create br br the fact that the film is not actually a <UNK> is the least of it's problems the film is not funny the film is not sexy the film doesn't have anything insightful to say about the porn business it's not even particularly <UNK> while there's <UNK> sex the amount of nudity is mild for an r rated film br br someday someone will make a good <UNK> about the porn industry this is not it
<START> i could name plenty of funny movies there are comedies that set out to be funny and are some movies like a <UNK> for example try to be serious but end up funny the ladies man is a film that is desperately trying to be funny but could not be less funny if it was about a guy who got a lot of chicks in the middle of the <UNK> of a nuclear holocaust it's anti funny br br i don't think i laughed harder than a chuckle at anything in this movie it's simply unfunny it's boring stupid inane annoying mind <UNK> bad but not funny i don't particularly care for tim meadows or this character from snl but i expected better than this br br the movie is completely lacking logic or common sense it's like the script writer had a bag over his head while he was <UNK> and he couldn't see which keys he was hitting they tell the origin of the ladies man but fail to include a motivation for his bizarre fascination with acting like it's still the seventies the movie tries to get humor out of a man who appears to <UNK> himself to porn shortly after he tried to hang himself this is comedy i like to consider myself having a pretty keen sense of humor spending a lot of time writing comedy as i do but maybe i'm just not quite bright enough for this film br br lee evans so funny as tucker in there's something about mary is outrageously bad here i was <UNK> with him in my head to shut up br br by the end i was <UNK> on my chair <UNK> under my breath and had the film gone on any longer would probably have attempted suicide this film might not be as bad as battlefield earth but it's the first movie i've seen that's come close br br
<START> the memory banks of most of the reviewers here must've short <UNK> when trying to recall this <UNK> <UNK> of a gem because practically everyone managed to <UNK> lloyd <UNK> walter <UNK> when in a fit of <UNK> anger he <UNK> the <UNK> garden <UNK> at his new wife <UNK> randall <UNK> a nearly <UNK> pia <UNK> which was used to sexually assault her earlier in the movie but i'm getting ahead of myself in any case poor lloyd could've been <UNK> that line at the speechless audience as much as he was his put upon co star br br hard as it is for most of us to believe especially these days nobody in hollywood sets out to intentionally make a bad movie this is certainly not the most <UNK> argument to make since there just seem to be so damn many of them coming out but then again there is that breed of film that one must imagine during the time of its creation from writing casting and direction must've been cursed with the cinematic equivalent of trying to shoot during the <UNK> of march br br the lonely lady is in that category and represents itself very well considering the circumstances here we have all the ingredients in a recipe guaranteed to produce a <UNK> fallen <UNK> pia <UNK> a <UNK> singer actress so determined to be taken seriously that she would take on practically anything that might set her apart from her peers which this movie most certainly did a somewhat high profile novel written by the <UNK> himself harold robbins of the <UNK> and dreams die first fame a cast who probably thought they were so fortunate to be working at all that they tried to play this dreck like it was <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> plus a director who more than likely was a hired gun who kept the mess moving just to collect a paycheck and was probably <UNK> <UNK> not to demand the use of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to protect what was left of his reputation like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i spit on your grave roger <UNK> <UNK> paul verhoeven's <UNK> or the <UNK> of really bad film making frank <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the lonely lady is still often discussed usually with disgust disbelief horrified laughter or a unique combination of all three yet also defies <UNK> description or even the <UNK> logic of <UNK> <UNK> sure how it came to be how it was ever released in even a single theater or why it's still here and nearly impossible to get rid of but take it or leave it it is here to stay and i don't think that lovers of really good bad movies would have it any other way
<START> kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in <UNK> its awfulness the plot is so contrived and unbelievable starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain then we have the <UNK> behavior of at least six and maybe more people including <UNK> involved in what is a crime everywhere next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being <UNK> happy to very shortly kicking over the <UNK> a very unpleasant and <UNK> <UNK> mother aided <UNK> and supported by a politically correct group of friends moving the setting from an island off the coast of south <UNK> did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget the very beautiful buildings supposedly <UNK> the monastery did not seem to <UNK> suit an island small enough to need golf <UNK> and such a small ferry service kim basinger whom i do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her <UNK> certainly belongs in another decade also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads i thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all the movie i kept surfing back and forth to had to leave whenever that <UNK> music got too much unless you like an unbelievable story wooden acting a <UNK> mixture of religious <UNK> allegory my advice is to skip this one oh and maybe a small <UNK> criticism but wouldn't a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat the best part of this movie is the scenery
<START> i rented this film to see what might be a bloody non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action drama that makes <UNK> look like die hard lou and <UNK> are in vietnam and as lou saves <UNK> from the <UNK> he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever the vietnam scenes are shot in <UNK> backyard i swear lou is now brain damaged and <UNK> and him live together and own a bar super <UNK> lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and <UNK> goes on a killing spree to get him back there is no good fight scenes at all the punches are two <UNK> away from a person characters personalities change in matter of seconds one guy is a bad and in the next scene he's good the acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental frank stallone sounding song that would make you sick i hated this film
<START> if you loved long way round you will enjoy this nearly as much it is educational funny interesting and tense <UNK> shares the screen with two interesting <UNK> two tired <UNK> two excellent <UNK> and too much russ ewan makes a few appearances but <UNK> really pulls it off alone he is funny engaging and still a <UNK> of stress and doubt great stuff br br the series <UNK> up in 7 episodes like <UNK> the <UNK> is nearly as interesting as the race though they cover the ins and outs of the race well there could be a bit more explanation of the <UNK> and cars which are merely mentioned and rarely even seen racing it is a motorcycle movie though and anyone on two <UNK> will love this br br the series features stunning photography as well as a few interviews of peoples mouths <UNK> there is another extremely catchy theme song like <UNK> but this one is not nearly as good as the <UNK> br br if you live in the us god knows when it will be released so buy it on amazon uk and watch it on your computer as i did oh and be prepared to buy another <UNK>
<START> i caught this movie on sci fi before heading into work if you've any interest in seeing dean cain dive and avoid being <UNK> in flames at least a dozen times this movie is for you if that doesn't peak your interest well i'm afraid you'll wish that you were the one about to be <UNK> in flames because this movie is pretty bad the acting to begin with is awful awful awful the characters are all completely obnoxious and the dialogue is worse than your typical z grade sci fi movie towards the end the movie began to remind me of <UNK> man' complete with escape via elevator <UNK> except with a dragon not a naked invisible man unlike other similar flicks however this one wasn't even <UNK> bad it was just plain bad
<START> it's not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered but <UNK> midnight cowboy is still a <UNK> showcase for two young actors just <UNK> into view at the time directed by john <UNK> and written by <UNK> salt the movie seems to be a product of its time the late 1960's when american films were especially <UNK> but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that <UNK> no matter what period the film's cinematic influence can still be felt in the <UNK> <UNK> found in ang lee's <UNK> mountain br br the meandering plot follows joe buck a naive young <UNK> who decides to move to manhattan to become a stud for hire for rich women full of energy but lacking any <UNK> he fails miserably but is unwilling to <UNK> defeat despite his <UNK> <UNK> he meets a cynical <UNK> petty thief named ratso rizzo who first sees joe as an easy <UNK> the two become <UNK> on one another and rizzo begins to manage joe things come to a head at a psychedelic drug <UNK> party where joe finally lands a paying client meanwhile rizzo becomes <UNK> and the two set off for florida to seek a better life this is not a story that will appeal to everyone in fact some may still find it <UNK> that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures yet their <UNK> feel <UNK> authentic br br in his first major role jon voight is <UNK> cast as he brings out <UNK> paper thin <UNK> and <UNK> sexual <UNK> as rizzo dustin hoffman successfully <UNK> his clean post college image from the graduate and <UNK> himself in the personal <UNK> and <UNK> hope that act as an oddly <UNK> <UNK> to joe the honesty of their portrayals is <UNK> by <UNK> film treatment which vividly captures the <UNK> of the times square district at the time the director also effectively <UNK> montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the character's fragile <UNK> credit also needs to go to salt for not letting the <UNK> cynicism <UNK> the pathos of the story the other performances are merely incidental to the <UNK> of the main characters including brenda <UNK> as the woman joe meets at the party sylvia miles as a <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> as a religious <UNK> and <UNK> hughes as a lonely out of <UNK> br br the two disc 2006 dvd package contains a <UNK> print transfer of the 1994 <UNK> and informative commentary from producer <UNK> <UNK> since unfortunately neither <UNK> nor salt are still living there are three terrific <UNK> on the second disc a look back documentary after midnight <UNK> on a classic 35 years later which features comments from <UNK> hoffman voight and others as well as clips and related archive footage such as <UNK> screen test controversy and acclaim which <UNK> the <UNK> of the movie's initial <UNK> rating and public response to the film and a tribute to the director celebrating <UNK>
<START> i will always have a soft spot for this disney flick another of their part live action part animation entries that sought to recreate the success of mary <UNK> and never quite made it when i was in grade school every once in a while we would have a movie day where the whole school would crowd into the <UNK> and a movie would be projected the old fashioned way multiple <UNK> and all at the time it seemed like a <UNK> occasion whenever this day arrived and <UNK> and <UNK> is one of the movies i can remember seeing this way br br and from what i remember it's quite charming angela lansbury never put her name to anything that wasn't at least competent and she's winning here as a witch with a magic bed boy that could be <UNK> couldn't it who can take her and a couple of young kids on magic adventures to far off places come on what kid wouldn't want a bed like that br br grade a
<START> when a small town is threatened by a child killer a lady police officer goes after him by pretending to be his friend as she becomes more and more emotionally involved with the murderer her psyche begins to take a beating causing her to lose focus on the job of catching the criminal not a film of high <UNK> excitement but solid police work and a good depiction of the <UNK> mind of a psychotic loser
<START> holy cow what a piece of sh t this movie is i didn't how these filmmakers could take a 250 word book and turn it into a movie i guess they didn't know either i don't remember any <UNK> or <UNK> in the book do you br br they took this all times <UNK> classic added some <UNK> <UNK> and sexual <UNK> and <UNK> it into a <UNK> joke this should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like i have to say visually it was interesting but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor if you even think that kind of thing is funny i don't want the kids that i know to think it is br br don't take your kids to see don't rent the dvd i hope the ghost of doctor <UNK> ghost comes and <UNK> the people that made this movie
<START> this is the <UNK> film i have ever seen but in all fairness it's watchable and rather funny i don't think the film makers intended it to be your typical hollywood blockbuster quality it's just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets <UNK> in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow as it's the middle of winter he then turns into a killer snowman which is enough to to make you laugh on it's own this film is really stupid but it's funny the killings are hilarious i wouldn't advise you to go and buy it like i did the cover looked good but if it happens to be on tv one night and you're up for a laugh then stick it on
<START> i do have the <UNK> to inform you to please stay away from <UNK> the <UNK> film based on the real life story of the grotesque serial killer <UNK> <UNK> more in relation to the mentality of its focused subject jeffrey dahmer who murdered over 15 young males and ate some of their body parts was probably the most <UNK> serial killer of our generation however the real sick individuals are the filmmakers of this awful spectacle who should have had their heads examined before deciding to <UNK> this awful <UNK> project this is not an easy film to <UNK> even though jeffrey would have easily <UNK> it with some fiery <UNK> <UNK> or even some real life mr <UNK> <UNK> failure
<START> dreaming of julia was the title of the original script and was filmed in the summer of 2000 in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to release the picture they change the original name to cuba <UNK> the director's cut was 3 and a half hours long it was released on the festival of <UNK> in thailand it was the second film of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the first was <UNK> <UNK> br br and the first of juan gerard as a director in the poster the names of diana <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> does not appear diana plays the grandmother and <UNK> the mother of the kid they are great actresses and they keep the story together specially diana check her out in other things you would be surprised
<START> i rented this some years ago the video store had only vhs at the time straight to video was hitting it's <UNK> you know where the box covers use the same <UNK> and color schemes of successful films i didn't know what to expect other than what was <UNK> first thing i thought while watching was what the <UNK> wrong with the sound obviously there was no dialogue dubbing words <UNK> so i stopped <UNK> on whatever i had to pay closer attention mind you there's no shakespeare here just simple talk the story is simple enough boy meets girl etc what struck me as humorous and heartfelt was the people in the movie didn't seem like caricatures written into the story but rather non actors <UNK> <UNK> from their real jobs uniforms included all the while you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after then see that there are no attempts at cheap humor people hurting their <UNK> using <UNK> this couldn't have hurt the marketing there was something honest about it i thought if they'd have a bigger budget then it would have been better which i'm sure they considered daily but they went ahead and made it this i felt was what independent film making is all about the word <UNK> is thrown around as if it's a genre ha that's funny
<START> this is a classic with so many great dialogs and scenes nobody should miss nice story funny <UNK> to <UNK> situations mel brooks is not a bad lead maybe not perfect but he is funny d don't pay attention to the rating it's <UNK> watch it then watch something like final destination 2009 and tell me that life stinks deserves about the same rating if you do i don't think we can be friends <UNK> at this point i recommend the fourth season of <UNK> your enthusiasm to every brooks fan vote 10 against the ignorant opinions of <UNK> i've to make 10 lines here to post a comment i don't wanna write a book here p
<START> i can't believe this is on dvd even less it was available at my local video store br br some argue this is a good movie if you take in consideration it had only a <UNK> budget i find this funny i would find it very bad <UNK> the budget br br still more funny i read the following in another review <UNK> aside if you love horror and you love something along the lines of duel 1971 updated with a little more story and some pretty girls thrown in you'll love this movie br br what this is a shame comparing those two movies br br i give a 1 since i can't give a 0 i just don't see any way this movie could be entertaining
<START> alright so i've been dying to see this movie <UNK> about the who's who in horror land that are in the film well my friend rented this brought it over and we started watching it it's supposed to be a comedy i did not <UNK> even once until the <UNK> mark br br does it have to do with the budget not at all in fact there's films out there that cost close to absolutely nothing and they're amazing to me anyways also while watching this film i couldn't help but realize the similarities i e stealing to a low budget indie film titled actress apocalypse read my review about it it destroys this film btw br br this film it had potential it really did it had the star power stolen plot lets film the behind the scenes of the making of a movie ie actress apocalypse seriously this <UNK> me the more and more i think about it really could've been funny a lot a lot of the jokes fall flat the acting is alright for what it is but it dragged on wasn't funny and the plot was totally stolen br br i give this a two because it wasn't <UNK> awful but that's the only reason
<START> i had never read gary <UNK> novel <UNK> for which 'a cry in the <UNK> is the adaptation of so i can't make any comparisons to the book i will however say that as a film on its own adaptation or no adaptation it was an underdeveloped adventure that provides no major explanation of its few characters br br think of 'a cry in the <UNK> as a less <UNK> teenage <UNK> was <UNK> california the only place this was filmed version of <UNK> away ' jared <UNK> is 13 year old brian <UNK> a kid headed on a small plane to visit his father until the craft crashes over some deserted mountain <UNK> leaving the kid stranded for quite a while and having to defend himself br br there are basically three parts to the film the obvious being the ten or fifteen minute introduction of the characters namely brian and his mom br br the next third of the movie which really <UNK> nearly all of the film is that of brian <UNK> it these scenes contain no particularly amazing action nothing spectacular other than lots of beautiful cinematography of a beautiful <UNK> landscape nothing to put you on edge no real encounters except a <UNK> confrontation with a <UNK> and no major <UNK> to <UNK> some sort of enjoyment or connection with the character on the screen you might even feel briefly bored with the passage of time as we witness brian dealing with his situation through first primitive means and then more improved ones using tools etc for his survival it is more like the ordinary time that passes if you were actually stuck in the situation and that is pretty much about it in other words they put no meat on the <UNK> words when they translated them into a visual media br br and of course the third part of the movie is his rescue br br there is a subplot that continuously seeks to make itself known during this time however some conflict between brian and his parents that created a rocky awkward relationship between them however for the most part it is only explained in brief <UNK> minimal dialog flashbacks that look more like a back story for a music video any minute the singer from <UNK> starship should <UNK> in an start singing <UNK> ' other than what the viewer can draw from the <UNK> or guess for his own need to fill the gaps in the narrative we get a very underdeveloped back story which was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and create a connection to the characters whether or not it really had anything to do with <UNK> survival adventure in the third part of the movie these are the flaws in the narrative that through the viewer into a <UNK> as he struggles to find out what the heck those people there on the screen are doing and for me almost done to the point of screaming at the television to say something and tell me more br br it certainly was not for me a good adventure tale but for fans of jared <UNK> it was one of the last few movies he made so watch it purely for nostalgia if nothing else
<START> well on the endless quest for horror we will come across this film apparently re released on dvd recently for some <UNK> reason the transfer is awful and the quality just sucks i don't think this is due to a bad <UNK> or anything i just think the film is poorly done br br obviously filmed at an abandoned school with a budget that was no doubt wasted on cheap beer and no talent <UNK> slaughter high starts out slow and doesn't pick up pace until about an hour in first we get to see a <UNK> as he is picked on by a group of i actually don't even know what they were supposed to be <UNK> the <UNK> with his ultra <UNK> is so ugly he should have definitely been cast as the nerd then there is a <UNK> <UNK> and a couple of dumb losers and chicks who are supposed to be <UNK> but aren't it's a mystery why this group of rejects is picking on one of their own but i guess the viewer is to assume these are <UNK> kids' picking on a <UNK> the casting choices are horrendous as most of the high <UNK> are played by thirty somethings as other reviewers on here have pointed out the actors if you can call them that are a bunch of brits whose accents slip out numerous times throughout this piece of crap we are left to assume that this group of <UNK> were the only students at this school as their <UNK> is only them at the school which is now shown to be abandoned is just them br br the kills are lame the gore is not great and the script is like scooby doo with real people lines like <UNK> place gives me the creeps ' and <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> are highlights it's just not good skip this one unless you are getting wasted with some friends and wanna laugh at a real lame attempt at a slasher if you wanna see good get <UNK> bay of blood done 14 years earlier and a heck of a lot better if you wanna see a good bad slasher see just before dawn or the burning 2 out of 10 kids
<START> i <UNK> this and <UNK> 5 as the best television sci fi series made both stand out in my mind because unlike early star trek series there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters if you look at the original star trek and star trek <UNK> they were fine shows but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes in many ways you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring this was less the case with deep space 9 with its giant battles that took up all of the final season and the other trek shows as there was more of a larger story that <UNK> them this <UNK> seems to have developed as a concept with <UNK> 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with sg 1 the bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form sure there were a few throwaway episodes that were not connected to the rest but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny br br and speaking of funny i loved that sg 1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasn't so dreadfully serious in this way i actually enjoyed it more than <UNK> 5 jack o'neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of homer simpson it's really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons br br to truly appreciate sg 1 you should watch it from the beginning and see how <UNK> the plots work this <UNK> gives the show exceptional staying power and if you don't like sg 1 after giving it a fair chance then sci fi is probably not the genre for you
<START> if you are planning to rent or buy this movie don't it's the worst thing i have ever seen i would comment on it more but it has been 10 years since i saw it and have <UNK> all of it from my mind save yourself some time money and well being and stay far far away
<START> the documentary revolves around eva <UNK> <UNK> a holocaust survivor part of <UNK> experiments on twins <UNK> primarily her version of what happened at <UNK> and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments the movie obviously had great reviews it's one of those topics that no one <UNK> to voice a contrary opinion about br br i too for a large part of the movie got sucked into the emotion that the movie maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on one of the user reviews on imdb by eric <UNK> obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum could only find the <UNK> <UNK> in one of the many dramatic sequences as a group of jews argue with <UNK> at a jewish center the meaning of the word forgive is even <UNK> but the isolated and <UNK> <UNK> holds her own but by this time the sappy hold that the movie had on my <UNK> emotional <UNK> had let loose enough that i could see clearly once more after the strong <UNK> eva <UNK> <UNK> her nazi <UNK> the movie begins to delve into what <UNK> is all about at least from the viewpoint of <UNK> the movie goes about following her past her public statement <UNK> the nazis and into new territory to me this was the meat of the movie surrounded by <UNK> fat of her act of forgiveness obviously it was a very sick cow br br on a mission to test her theory of forgiveness in order to <UNK> wounds of the past she makes her way to the promised land to meet with some <UNK> to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with <UNK> and discussions with jews in the us on her act of <UNK> the nazis including one at a jewish center in chicago from then on anyone not so <UNK> eyed that they can't see the screen will find it hard pressed to miss the obvious <UNK> in her statements br br firstly you immediately notice her body language <UNK> and unwilling to listen in a room full of arab <UNK> and teachers her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time effort and money the entire act was a rather annoyed dr <UNK> <UNK> professor of education at <UNK> university gets it just right when he tells <UNK> off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment br br finally the debate at the jewish center in chicago where she is <UNK> on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts br br i will cut to the chase by the end of the movie i was hoping i hadn't chosen to watch the movie the movie was badly made failing to delve deeper into anything about <UNK> apart from the purely trivial just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is <UNK> in the viewers memory and to <UNK> a <UNK> of tears it showed that <UNK> the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion her discussion abilities were limited to <UNK> her stance on forgiveness at best to a complete <UNK> to listen or participate br br lastly is everyone so retarded today that they can't notice the difference between making peace and <UNK> <UNK> another imdb user i don't see her forgiveness as being weak quite the contrary she just wanted to <UNK> its hold from her soul she wanted the suffering to be over so she let it go that would be the perfect <UNK> definition of making peace br br i guess in a world of propaganda blind faith and political correctness there is no room to question those that have gone through more than the human mind can <UNK> br br p s the <UNK> certainly should go into all those books to buy lists everyone keeps making
<START> thin story concerns two small town brothers and their struggles over family honor david morse is the responsible straight laced cop and <UNK> brother viggo <UNK> the <UNK> boy is a former soldier and ex convict as an actor particularly in his earliest years sean penn seems to have <UNK> his performances under the method turning first time writer and director for this arty <UNK> drama he works his script and characters out through the same <UNK> process <UNK> the pacing down to a crawl ostensibly so we can catch every nuance and <UNK> this approach might be fascinating if there were three dimensional characters to care about but <UNK> morse and <UNK> aren't really convincing as siblings worse we expect more from <UNK> billed veterans charles bronson and sandy dennis who hardly get a chance to come through with anything interesting the picture is <UNK> with turgid sequences a <UNK> narrative and confusing editing always <UNK> to point up the artistic <UNK> <UNK> tricks with the camera show off a talented eye yet they are mostly an <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> <UNK> of the <UNK> is a film <UNK> in flop sweat i can recall no film that has tried so hard to be so <UNK> outrageous provocative and important yet failed so consistently across the board it is like a stand up comic who's not getting laughs but can't leave the stage the harder the film tries the <UNK> each attempt at a laugh results in a <UNK> <UNK> the desperation the film displays is so glaring it almost <UNK> pity for all those involved br br the film achieves laugh out loud status only twice once is in the sight of <UNK> <UNK> playing an obnoxious arrogant and amoral tv <UNK> journalist which is funny only because he apparently doesn't realize he is playing himself the other scene that deserves to be laughed at is the film's final big moment <UNK> the judge played by morgan freeman delivers the <UNK> lecture about what morality is it's what your mama taught ya the <UNK> of the moment is insulting to the point of being absurd br br yet one must admit it is a noble effort it does have a good if poorly cast band of actors who try to make characters out of cardboard thin caricatures the film looks <UNK> made and the little cinematic <UNK> that director brian <UNK> just loves are apparent if not particularly effective but the film which apparently wishes to be a commentary on modern morals and <UNK> never <UNK> above the level of cartoon satire requires style farce requires energy even sitcom requires timing but the best <UNK> can <UNK> is desperation in the end you don't want to laugh you just want to turn away
<START> the only scary thing about this movie is the thought that whoever made it might make a sequel br br from start to finish the tooth fairy was just downright terrible it seemed like a badly acted children's movie which got confused with a wizard of oz witch melting and happy <UNK> ending combined with some bad gore effects and swearing br br half of the cast seem completely unnecessary except for conveniently being there to get murdered in some fashion the sister of the two brothers <UNK> the aura reader and mrs <UNK> have entirely no point in the film they could have included them in the main plot for some interesting side stories but apparently couldn't be bothered the people watching the film know the characters are there for some bloody death scene but come on at least try and have a slight plot for them the story in general is weak with <UNK> behavior from the characters that makes you wish they all get eaten by the witch br br add the weak plot and the weak acting together the children are particularly wooden and the movie ends up a complete failure if only mst3k could have had a go at this one
<START> this film deals with the irish rebellion in the 1920s and more specifically one man's life after he informs on a friend for the bounty on his head and the subsequent consequences watching the film i got the feeling that you could take the script and with just some minor <UNK> do it again and it sadly would still fit contemporary events but <UNK> remake wouldn't be nearly as good a magnificent performance by victor mclaglen for which he deservedly got an oscar and a fine ensemble cast that includes most if not all the actors with <UNK> in hollywood at the time most of them recognizable character actors either established at the time or just starting out a very good film well worth watching highly recommended
<START> this juvenile bland flick is strictly for teenagers in old <UNK> bodies desperate to <UNK> their <UNK> challenged teenage years how by burning up gas and <UNK> a fast reckless car or plane with freedom br br the plot borrows heavily from mister <UNK> neighborhood if it were run my an oil <UNK> and <UNK> run if it were heavily <UNK> and lacked a clear sense of style br br starring lee <UNK> and burgess meredith this film is set in a post gas crisis world in which an all powerful government doesn't want you to <UNK> drive your car and burn gas sort of the opposite of today's <UNK> and bush oil grabbing <UNK> pushing government br br this <UNK> alone makes the film laughable but wait there's more although the film is set in the future we're not shown any signs of future technology beyond a return to <UNK> golf <UNK> and horses you will believe that the future looks exactly like today same clothing same suburban houses same green <UNK> as today and when the film was made there are no <UNK> <UNK> no <UNK> no <UNK> to alternate energy br br the acting is flat and <UNK> even scenes which could have been gritty or moving buddy flick honor romance horror all fall <UNK> than a paper doll under a <UNK> br br continuity is lacking the jet <UNK> by burgess <UNK> character changes colors and <UNK> from moment to moment as the filmmakers insult our intelligence with <UNK> stock footage again and again br br the plot is as moronic and only half as exciting as a dukes of hazzard episode br br even die hard car film and sf fans should avoid this film like month old <UNK> unless you enjoy <UNK> <UNK> executives trying to make a movie as empty as the hero's gas tank
<START> mercifully there's no video of this wannabe western that a stay <UNK> vehicle for big frank at a time when his career was <UNK> the story of a <UNK> who lives on the reputation of his big gun brother and who gets run out of town by bad guys only to return to <UNK> his <UNK> with a new found courage must have been written by a back room writer all in all this show stinks the story is basically boring ill conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence i must <UNK> complete from the other reviewer who found it underrated the critics <UNK> it at the time and deservedly so you'll have to catch it on the last show if you up late and having a bout of insomnia but if you can sit through it you've more <UNK> than most of my movie buff friends
<START> i awake suddenly aware that i'm <UNK> onto the plastic couch cover and realize it's a warm saturday afternoon why was i sleeping did i hit my head or accidentally swallow all of my <UNK> muscle <UNK> could it be adult <UNK> <UNK> br br no i <UNK> <UNK> on cheap seats while channel surfing and the stunning lack of humor and talent <UNK> my life force with such speed that i <UNK> out br br it's that head shaking mouth <UNK> shoulder <UNK> bad but i have to give these moronic and boring twins credit for selling this idea through perhaps they had the same effect on the <UNK> programming executive that they had on me and when he she woke up a few horrendous episodes were already in the can and he she hoped that since all the viewers will be asleep no one will now how awful it is and he she can keep the <UNK> 000 <UNK> <UNK> br br you've been warned
<START> i don't think most of us would tend to apply the term must see to action films but i was very impressed at how good this film was and it deservedly gets the must see <UNK> from me br br mandy played by shannon lee daughter of the late and great bruce lee and sister of the late brandon lee is <UNK> by martin a professional thief to help pull off a diamond heist at a museum for a criminal <UNK> and get rewarded <UNK> for it little do they know that another pair of thieves lucy and tommy a pair of <UNK> who were <UNK> earlier by mandy and martin to get in on the deal are also planning to steal the diamond br br how each pair of thieves plans out the heist is a thrill to watch things go awry as martin and mandy <UNK> find themselves a step behind lucy and tommy br br you'll find yourself rooting for these thieves as they find that they need each other to stay alive from the crime <UNK> who are not happy at all that the diamond is not in its hands br br action fans will not be disappointed as there's a healthy dose of gun battles martial arts and hand to hand combat sequences br br what is surprising is that it's not just the action that carries this film but the romance and laughs and i don't mean your typical one liners prevalent in action films that sneak in br br it's not easy to root for bad guys but we get to see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they develop br br a great film and one not to miss br br 9 out of 10
<START> the play bell book and candle was a favorite of mature actresses to do in summer stock and take on the road one famous story told by director harold j kennedy has ginger rogers <UNK> that her then husband william marshall who was not an actor <UNK> with her marshall wore a <UNK> and when he walked through a <UNK> his <UNK> caught on a nail and stayed behind <UNK> in the <UNK> as he walked on stage br br the play was adapted successfully into a beautiful color film starring kim novak james stewart jack lemmon elsa <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ernie <UNK> and <UNK> rule it's light entertainment about a normal appearing family of witches novak lemmon and <UNK> and the <UNK> stewart who lives in their building the most expert of them is the <UNK> soft voiced gillian who would love to be normal one night with stewart in her apartment she puts a spell on him using her <UNK> cat <UNK> and he falls in love with her br br bell book and candle was filmed on a charming set that <UNK> new york the movie is loads of fun jack lemmon is very funny in a supporting role as <UNK> brother a musician in the witch and <UNK> laden zodiac club he uses his powers to turn <UNK> on and off and to turn on the occasional woman <UNK> rule is perfect as the <UNK> ex college rival of gillian now dating stewart and ernie <UNK> has a great turn as an eccentric who is writing the definitive book on witches <UNK> and <UNK> of course are always wonderful <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> aunt and <UNK> as a sort of queen of witchcraft br br kim novak is a good fit for gillian giving the character a <UNK> <UNK> a witch showing emotion when it becomes appropriate and with that voice fabulous face and magnificent wardrobe she certainly is magical stewart in his last <UNK> as a romantic lead <UNK> with novak as he did in vertigo and they make an effective team he supplies the warmth she supplies the <UNK> and somehow together they spark in this of course he's much more elegant than in vertigo a charming film good for a sunday afternoon good around christmas as part of it takes place at <UNK> and great if you feel like smiling
<START> disney might just be on to something here first they had remember the <UNK> with denzel a story based on truth involving sports and a small town in middle america now with quaid and the rookie yet another sports story based on truth br br both movies move you to tears at times and both make you smile and feel all warm after seeing them my wife and i took in the rookie and we expected it to be a great feel good type movie we were not let down when asked if we'd be buying this on dvd when it comes out it was a no <UNK> most <UNK>
<START> i can understand how fans of filmmaker roman polanski could love this movie and i could understand how some could totally hate it ebert was one of the few who couldn't understand why people weren't running out of the theater after a first viewing i'm not sure i could fall into either category however as someone who can't get enough of <UNK> and bizarre dark comedies of paranoia the tenant is effective enough for its running time or maybe not this is one of those cases where it might have been more of a <UNK> if it were a half hour twilight zone episode with <UNK> delivering the <UNK> as <UNK> or <UNK> it might be <UNK> in his bed in <UNK> it's very similar in the treatment of the doomed protagonist as <UNK> was however it could be <UNK> that there was more ambiguity more of a sense of the surreal coming out through a <UNK> <UNK> of character and location and quite frankly a better lead performance than the tenant br br as it stands the tenant does have an intriguing premise the kind that one doesn't tire telling about to other people polanski is a polish <UNK> to paris who takes an apartment that was most recently acquired by <UNK> <UNK> who jumped to her near death out of the window and died soon after but the other <UNK> are conservative to the max in terms of noise after a saturday night at <UNK> with a few friends there are complaints of too much noise it won't happen again <UNK> good natured but slightly nervous tenant says but there is no peace even in moving a <UNK> or a chair soon complaints get <UNK> against another tenant but from him can he register complaints this is a case of not so much mistaken identity but of there being a lack of peace of mind with <UNK> and the surrounding people as the <UNK> spiral goes on polanski <UNK> up tension and dare i say black comedic laughs by showing <UNK> in the midst of a horrible dream one of <UNK> strongest scenes from the period and in finding teeth in the wall not to mention the bathroom across the way which i might add is always a cinematic lynch pin of horror and surreal madness br br but somehow the film never really feels all that significant aside from its excessive design as a would be mind f machine with <UNK> <UNK> only seeming to not be what they seem for a little while there's not as much suspense when finding out that they really aren't out to get him which makes the paranoia more self fulfilling at least once or twice i thought to myself as well <UNK> did polanski take the title role for himself ' it's not that he's at all a bad actor and he has appeared in several films and plays that aren't of his own direction but aside from being great at looking awkward and tense like in the church or in his moments of sort of flipping out when thinking that they really are out to get him to kill himself his transformation is less creepy than tongue in cheek a test of himself to see if he can pull it off which he doesn't entirely do despite polanski working at it well to look like the meek and <UNK> <UNK> i could see at least a few other actors who could pull it off with more subtlety and affecting personality by the time one sees him in drag it goes between cringe worthy and true camp particularly when he goes for the double climax at the end which of course is of little surprise br br and yet there is pleasure for the film buff and polanski fan to see the supporting cast try and dig into the much more ambiguous characters winters and douglas do this the best even as they have to strain through limited characters and the unexpected moments like polanski and <UNK> getting hot and heavy during a bruce lee movie or when he gets really drunk or in one almost random scene where he <UNK> a kid near a <UNK> are rather brilliant in and of themselves it's a very good film and one that could maybe stick my attention up when on too many <UNK> after midnight but an essential film not exactly
<START> 99 <UNK> pure crap and the other <UNK> was a brief moment where i thought the blond chick was going to <UNK> nope br br the dialogue was <UNK> bad the action sucked and there was no sex the <UNK> mentioned blond chick is <UNK> dressed alas the whole movie the cgi had the dubious honor of being the worst i've ever seen on film and the <UNK> were numerous and glaring acting was mediocre even from ben cross and <UNK> <UNK> the only <UNK> in this movie and <UNK> <UNK> looked really really bad br br i've seen high school plays more <UNK> produced this is the kind of movie that mst3k <UNK> on heads should roll at sci fi for allowing this steaming pile on the air
<START> mark <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of 1987 is a black comedy that is extremely cheesy in many parts but occasionally very funny nevertheless this movie could certainly have been a lot better the acting is terrible and some extremely cheesy scenes make it hard to watch at times but the concept is funny and it has some hilarious moments br br in the near future the year 1991 game shows have changed chuck <UNK> john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a game show called live or die in which convicted death row inmates have the chance to play for their lives and for money candidates who fail get executed on the air using many different methods such as <UNK> electric <UNK> and other more bizarre devices of execution followed by applause from the cheering studio audience the show is of course more than controversial and chuck has made lots of enemies br br <UNK> <UNK> is incredibly cheesy and crappy in many aspects and the acting is terrible but it is without doubt fun in many parts especially if you're a fan of dark humor you haven't missed anything if you haven't seen it but it is definitely funny and a good time <UNK> 4 10
<START> this movie was bizarre completely inexplicable and hysterical to watch with friends while drinking in a big empty house i really love the opening stuff with lisa wandering about lost in a gorgeous city i want to be a beautiful stranger lost in some exotic european locale though maybe not in a low budget horror flick definitely get the ending where there are the strangely non sexual sex scenes that were cut out in my dvd copy anyway don't attempt to understand it just go along and watch out for the weird bits which is everything don't watch this if you actually want plot or characterization or anything at all to make sense pretty beautiful though you may just give up on this and decide to watch an actual horror movie like say dead alive
<START> there is one detail which is not very common for jackie chan movies but which is present here it has some very tough and serious atmosphere about it while the funny elements are present too jackie is menacing and psychotic here he is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights back in a usual laid back pattern but he is the one who can go and start the <UNK> his manner of hitting that evil guy in the glasses is amazing every time it goes crack i also especially enjoy the scene when jackie goes to the pub and <UNK> the villains who had <UNK> on his girlfriend it's one of the best <UNK> put on screen besides the whole scene is shot with the background of some action character painted on the wall it also looks like a poster of <UNK> from our soviet era and some lines in russian on the left i noticed that quite accidentally that looks terrific and nostalgic for russian people i also like when the windows are being <UNK> in the movies here there's a lot of this stuff it's quite amazing watching the characters falling jumping running driving through all manner of <UNK> br br all three movies are great i had been preparing myself to see the down slide of the quality but i saw a perfect trilogy with sense and incredible stunts and not only jackie chan's character appears in all three movies that's also excellent and keeps continuity up br br i would like to describe each movie just in a few words no 1 great in all aspects it is one gripping story from the very beginning to the very end and funny many scenes are ridiculous no 2 raging jackie is really <UNK> off here and painful jackie gets tortured no 3 unbelievable the woman that fights alongside with jackie is incredible and <UNK> should i mention a lot of guns and explosions br br as to the rest much has been mentioned by the others br br it's a trilogy that can be watched over and over again at least by me its place is in top 10 among action comedy <UNK> finally it's been released in russia on dvd the 2nd film has the best <UNK> the chinese russian <UNK> and english russian subtitles br br solid 10 out of 10 thank you for attention
<START> seldom seen since theatrical release in 1970 myra <UNK> has become a <UNK> for cinematic <UNK> of legendary proportions now at last on dvd in an unexpectedly handsome package it is as unlikely to win wide audiences today as it was when first released br br gore <UNK> 1968 <UNK> was a darkly satirical statement most filmmakers felt that the <UNK> story structure and overall tone would not translate to film and industry <UNK> were surprised when 20th century fox not only acquired the rights but also hired <UNK> to adapt his novel to the screen but studio executives soon had cold feet <UNK> adaptations were repeatedly rejected and <UNK> writer director michael sarne was brought in to bring the film to the screen br br studio executives hoped that sarne would tap into the youth market they saw as a target for the film but sarne proved even more out of <UNK> with the material than the executives themselves rewrite upon rewrite followed the cast <UNK> disaster became increasingly <UNK> in her dvd commentary star <UNK> welch says that she seldom had any idea of what <UNK> motives were from scene to scene or even within any single scene itself and that each person involved seemed to be making an entirely different film in the accompanying back story documentary rex reed says that myra <UNK> was a film made by a bunch of people who <UNK> in their dressing rooms while waiting for their lawyers to return their calls br br the accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself the <UNK> of <UNK> story are there but not only has the story been <UNK> of all <UNK> <UNK> it seems to have no point in and of itself everything runs off in multiple directions nothing <UNK> and numerous scenes <UNK> whatever logic previous scenes might have had and while director sarne repeatedly states in his commentary that he wanted to make the film as pure farce the only laughs generated are accidental br br chief among these <UNK> is mae west it is true that west is unexpectedly well <UNK> in appearance and that she had lost none of her way with a one liner but there is no getting around the fact that she is in her seventies and her conviction that she is the still the <UNK> trick in shoe leather is extremely unsettling to say the least but worse really is the fact that west is outside her era her efforts to translate herself into a hip and happening persona results in one of the most embarrassing self caricatures ever seen on film br br the remaining cast is largely wasted <UNK> welch a significantly <UNK> actress plays the title role of myra very much like a <UNK> doll on <UNK> non actor rex reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of <UNK> but the entire role is essentially without point only john huston and cameo players john carradine jim <UNK> william hopper and andy <UNK> emerge relatively <UNK> yes it really is the <UNK> everyone involved in the film feared it would be fast when it should be slow slow when it should be fast relentlessly unfunny from start to finish it is true that director sarne does have the occasional inspired idea as in his use of film clips of everyone from shirley temple to judy garland to create <UNK> to the action but by and large whenever sarne was presented with a choice of how to do something he seems to have made the wrong one br br the how and why of that is made clear in <UNK> audio commentary sarne did not like the novel or for that matter the subject matter in general he did not want to write the screenplay but he needed the money he <UNK> did not want to direct the film but he need the money he makes it very clear that he disliked author gore <UNK> and rex reed at one point he <UNK> states that reed is not a nice person and to this day he considers that <UNK> and reed worked in <UNK> to <UNK> the film because he refused to play into their <UNK> <UNK> which when you come right down to it seems to have been their desire that sarne actually film <UNK> novel rather than his own <UNK> imagined take off on it br br although he spends a fair amount of commentary time stating that the film is widely liked by the gay community sarne never quite seems to understand that the appeal of the film for a gay audience <UNK> from his ridiculously inaccurate depiction of homosexual people when taken in <UNK> with the film itself sarne emerges as more than a little <UNK> and quite frankly the single worst choice of writers and directors that could have been made for this project br br in addition to the sarne and welch <UNK> and the making of documentary the dvd release includes several trailers and two versions of the film a theatrical release version and a restored version the only difference between the two is that the final scene in the restored version has been <UNK> to black and white the edits made before the film went into general release have not been restored but the documentary details what they were the widescreen <UNK> of both are remarkably good and the sound is quite fine but to end where i began this is indeed a film that will most interest film historians movie buffs and cult movie fans i give it three out of five stars for their sake alone but everyone else should pass it by br br gary f taylor aka <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> i would like to say that unlike many of the people who disliked this film and found it impossible to understand i was fully able to understand it for what it is a very incoherent attempt at a plot line br br i don't like to toss this word around but in this case it fits very well the director firstly presents the material in an extremely arrogant way and worse extremely <UNK> it is incoherent in that it presents the material in a messy <UNK> order making us think that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes come first and arrogant in that at 2 hours long they expect us the viewer to care by the end of it br br i respect <UNK> cinema for what it is creating a story around a more than real world that does not tie to real life but there is nothing surreal about having a story placed in ordinary modern times and a modern day earth setting that is most importantly not able to engage the audience but furthermore simply a <UNK> series of events that barely tie together the most accurate way to describe the experience of viewing this film is like viewing a story perhaps even a very good story as it was based on a book but being frustrated by the fact that the camera doesn't seem to capture the necessary moments and tie together any means of <UNK> br br let's compare <UNK> cinema compare <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to this he gave us a coherent extremely engaging and intellectually deep story this movie offers no intellectual study and while it is very <UNK> in it's <UNK> presentation the director has ultimately abandoned the essential art of good storytelling and all we are left with is a mess of events that barely tie in together br br yes indeed it is possible to make sense of things to a point but as i said earlier the viewer will reach a stage where they simply say who cares it plays out like watching a drab mundane story of a man going to a supermarket and buying <UNK> in <UNK> order even with murders it is completely uninteresting and <UNK> too many people these days will give high marks to something they are unable to understand or make sense of simply for fear of looking foolish and in every way this film tries to make the viewer look foolish br br if you have too much time on your hands then please watch this film taking into account what i have said of it it is a story based on a book that could have been presented in a much more effective way and that is my bottom line reasoning
<START> the first of the official <UNK> films laputa is most similar to its predecessor <UNK> but whereas <UNK> was a sf epic this is more of an action comedy adventure with a fairly weak sf premise br br for the first half hour of the movie i thought i was going to love it once again you find yourself in awe of miyazaki's attention to detail and his ability to <UNK> up an imaginary world in <UNK> beautiful perfection the animation though still not in the league of the later <UNK> films is a little better than in <UNK> br br i mentioned in my review of <UNK> that one character is drawn in a more <UNK> anime style here there are a whole bunch of them the pirates they provide the comic element in the film though quite why it needs a comic element i'm not sure there was nothing funny about <UNK> and i think it was better off for it still having said that <UNK> the pirate leader is easily the most memorable character in the film even if she's basically a female long john silver don't be surprised if you're reminded of <UNK> <UNK> at times and is well voiced by <UNK> <UNK> in the american dub br br the english voice cast <UNK> themselves well for the most part actually however something started going <UNK> shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark i think the best way that i could describe it is that the characters get <UNK> up by the vast scope of the story i'll come back to that later br br there is so much to admire about laputa and so many people obviously love it that i almost feel mean for only giving it 8 out of 10 but for me the <UNK> word here is <UNK> it was more impressive than personally affecting and at over two hours it just started to drag br br the crucial thing for me was this i really found that i didn't care much about any of the characters disney would have taken the care to develop the characters make you really fall for them rather than leave them as relatively two dimensional pieces to be moved around while you <UNK> at the amazing <UNK> in the movie even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard sf in the story to make up for it but it was basically a lot of <UNK> about <UNK> and magic <UNK> that's where laputa falls down as far as i'm concerned and that's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie having said that it must be admitted that miyazaki was <UNK> ahead of disney in general in 1986 when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty dire <UNK> mouse <UNK> br br laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film and you should definitely see it but i do feel it's over rated i definitely prefer the earlier <UNK> of the valley of the <UNK> br br btw if you manage to watch them in <UNK> order watch for the fox <UNK> from <UNK> popping up briefly in laputa
<START> i thought this was one of the best movies i've seen in a very long time it was a great story line and showed that people are so intricate in all kinds of different ways have recommended it to all my friends i always enjoy a good story line and this movie had one of the best i've seen in a long time i could see myself having a daughter and doing the same things that natalie did to find out more about her life and loves it showed how we not only have lives with our families but also have parts of our lives that we don't share with them as it may not be in their best interest to know all the details of things we don't do that we are so proud of br br i look forward to another such movie and will keep my eye out
<START> set in a post apocalyptic environment <UNK> led by <UNK> job <UNK> over the human population they basically keep them as <UNK> as they need fresh human blood to live off <UNK> and her brother managed to survive one of their attacks when she was a kid and years have past when she came face to face with the <UNK> again but this time she's saved by the cyborg gabriel who was created to destroy all <UNK> job and his men are on their way to capture a largely populated city while <UNK> with revenge on mind <UNK> gabriel to train her in the way of killing <UNK> and she'll get him to gabriel br br cheap low rent cyborg post apocalyptic <UNK> by writer director albert <UNK> who made cyborg prior to it and the <UNK> <UNK> the same year is reasonably a misguided hunk of junk with some interesting <UNK> very little structure makes its way into the <UNK> story as the turgid script is weak corny and <UNK> the <UNK> banter tries to be witty but it pretty much stinks and comes across being comical in the unintentional moments most of the occurring actions are pretty senseless and routine the material could've used another polish up as it was an inspired idea <UNK> up by lazy <UNK> lack of a narrative and an almost <UNK> tone the open ended cliffhanger conclusion is just too abrupt especially since a sequel has yet to be made makes it feel like that that run out of money and said time to pack up let's finish it off another day or maybe in another decade there's no rush however it did find it rather <UNK> thanks largely to its quick pace some well executed combat and george <UNK> <UNK> cinematography that beautifully captured the visually <UNK> backdrop performances are fair kris <UNK> dry and <UNK> persona works perfectly as gabriel and a self assured <UNK> capable kathy long pulls off the stunts expertly and with <UNK> however her acting is too wooden a <UNK> lance <UNK> gives a mouth <UNK> performance of pure ham as the villainous cyborg leader job who constantly having a <UNK> <UNK> scott <UNK> also drums up plenty of <UNK> as one of the <UNK> and gary daniels <UNK> about as one too <UNK> strikes up few exciting martial art set pieces involving some flashy <UNK> and gratuitous slow motion <UNK> into the background is a <UNK> but mechanical sounding music score the special effects and make up fx stand up fine enough watchable but not quite a success and it's minimal limitations can be a cause of that
<START> joan fontaine here is entirely convincing as an amoral beauty who is entirely incapable of feeling love for anyone but herself her husband richard <UNK> has lost all his money through a combination of his <UNK> and her <UNK> and they are reduced to living in a tiny room with little or no <UNK> they continue to put on the most amazing clothes and go out and <UNK> as if nothing were wrong he is a charming <UNK> but wholly <UNK> fellow however fontaine decides he has to go as he has <UNK> his <UNK> so she <UNK> to poison him when she realizes he does not want to divorce her so that she can move on she has meanwhile had a lover <UNK> <UNK> whom she decides to drop because he is not rich either she meets the aging herbert marshall who has a <UNK> with all the <UNK> and more money than even fontaine could figure out how to spend she targets him and decides he will do nicely he is all too eager to be eaten up by the young beauty he certainly isn't very exciting and has about as much sex appeal as <UNK> <UNK> but fontaine is one of those <UNK> who has eyes only for money and the man standing between her and it is transparent so that she doesn't even notice or care what he looks like she looks through him and sees what she really wants and goes for it she proceeds to poison her husband and <UNK> him very neatly and <UNK> so that everything is going well but as always happens in the movies and sometimes even in life some unexpected things begin to go wrong and the tension rises <UNK> so that fontaine begins to sweat fontaine is particularly good at looking wicked and terrified and as the net begins to close in on her her rising sense of desperation is <UNK> and has us on the edges of our seats <UNK> and fear take over from cool <UNK> and cunning but she finds a fall guy for her crime in the person of her cast off lover who is an innocent victim of her scheme to set him up he is condemned to death for murder because the husband's death by poison came to light unexpectedly but sir cedric <UNK> playing a <UNK> determined scotland yard inspector thinks there may be something <UNK> and begins to doubt the story and suspect fontaine he <UNK> in on her and some of the scenes as this happens are inspired portrayals of the <UNK> panic but will the innocent man's life be saved before he is executed will fontaine worm her way out of this one will herbert marshall protect her to <UNK> his <UNK> this film is expertly directed by sam wood and the film is a really superb suspense thriller which i suppose qualifies very well for the description of a superior film noir
<START> this is an <UNK> and <UNK> portrait of the early life of lincoln born <UNK> <UNK> kentucky and died in washington <UNK> ford's excellent movie takes abraham lincoln fonda from his youth he studied laws common law and began practice as lawyer in <UNK> this hollywood biography follows lincoln from his <UNK> cabin days initial relationship to mary todd weaver following the couple from their first ball and his departure for <UNK> candidate but focuses mainly on a brothers richard <UNK> eddie <UNK> accused for murder the <UNK> trial with amusing court debate scenes and the protection for their mum alice brady the lincoln fonda as <UNK> <UNK> and donald meek <UNK> are nothing short of brilliant br br excellent performance from henry fonda as idealistic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he was to star regularly for ford from this movie as <UNK> of wrath my darling <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> besides sterling acting by alice brady as <UNK> mother she was a great actress from the silent cinema but this one results to be her last movie because she early died from cancer the <UNK> deeds developing make for <UNK> appealing entertaining his portrayal shows a nostalgic longing for things past and old values and describes his goodness <UNK> and <UNK> lincoln like john ford was a straightforward man who never varied the ideals of his youth this american masterpiece is correct on both counts as splendid biography and as magnificent drama br br another <UNK> about abraham lincoln are the following 1 <UNK> <UNK> 1930 by d w griffith with walter huston <UNK> <UNK> talking from his birth until his assassination 2 <UNK> lincoln in <UNK> 1940 by john <UNK> with raymond massey ruth gordon concerning similar events to ford's film through his career as lawyer 3 tv version titled <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with sam <UNK> and mary tyler moore as mary todd
<START> the one thing that occurred to me after watching this drivel was i would never get the time i used to watch this back again if you want to see <UNK> <UNK> and michael <UNK> try and earn what must have been then the down <UNK> on a holiday home then stay tuned wooden acting poor special effects the only comedic highlight was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this is over as soon as she has done her obligatory b movie nude sex scene within 30 mins into the movie the opportunity to have made what could have been a decent movie disappears the moment nicole <UNK> <UNK> the alien in a bar within 30 seconds whilst the police military and joe public don't <UNK> on that the woman drinking coffee <UNK> use the cup handle and wears four <UNK> at once she must obviously be from another planet just where i wish i was when this movie was on
<START> bela lugosi is not <UNK> in this fantastic twelve part adventure serial playing the lead as frank chandler <UNK> the magician enjoying his role as a representative of the forces of white magic pushed against those of black while displaying <UNK> fighting skill successfully <UNK> a young egyptian princess and cutting a lean and dashing figure in <UNK> gear complete with <UNK> cap the somewhat <UNK> plot <UNK> chandler <UNK> in an ongoing series of <UNK> pointed at achieving the rescue of his <UNK> princess <UNK> maria alba and others from the <UNK> of the idol <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> which <UNK> <UNK> blood in order to <UNK> an ancient <UNK> princess <UNK> upon the mysterious island of <UNK> director ray taylor an old hand at such <UNK> keeps events moving <UNK> but repeated scenes and footage a good deal of which is to be found in the previous year's skull island setting from king kong and the <UNK> locale from son of kong <UNK> original action to less than 60 minutes from the <UNK> running length of over two and one half hours and if viewed at one sitting becomes lacking in effect to most viewers unless <UNK>
<START> as many reviewers here have noted the film version <UNK> quite a bit from the stage version of the story i have never seen the stage version of the story and therefore i have a more <UNK> review of the film than many other reviewers perhaps richard attenborough was not the best choice for director of the film but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancers trying to make the big time in choreographer michael <UNK> show the film does right by not <UNK> any famous actors or performers to wind up in the final try out group this way our attention is focused on the <UNK> movements and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of try outs douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part apparently some songs were cut out in favor of a new one and the <UNK> cliché ridden story of a romantic <UNK> between a dancer and the choreographer was added i have to say in all fairness this was the weakest part of the film the repeated <UNK> cassie made during try outs appear to mirror the almost desperate <UNK> one often has to make when engaging in the artistic <UNK> in the absence of talent and or luck however this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past and it's curious to see this tired old shoe kicking its <UNK> up once again the revelations of the dancers themselves began <UNK> enough with the i can do that number but then it <UNK> a little at various points while the dancers were telling their stories frankly their stories <UNK> little from real life folks who never get a chance like this of 4 stars
<START> i just have to say this is one of my favorite movies of all time i cannot even count the number of times i've seen it i was already in love with john travolta but the first time the camera pans up his body after he's all clean <UNK> looking beautiful for his first trip to <UNK> i was in awe debra <UNK> as always delivers a perfect performance as the young naive wife of bud but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard working cowboy if you're not a country music person which i wasn't this is 1 soundtrack that'll have you singing right along with every word if you get a chance please see this movie it won't disappoint
<START> mother night is one of my favorite novels and going to see this i was expecting a huge disappointment instead i got a film that perfectly portrays the irony humor <UNK> and above all else the <UNK> sadness of <UNK> novel br br this is certainly <UNK> best <UNK> to date he captures the defeat and <UNK> of howard <UNK> jr consistently from the subtle <UNK> of his speech to the held back tears behind his eyes br br alan arkin is <UNK> hilarious as george <UNK> <UNK> lee is haunting in her <UNK> from reality as <UNK> young lover john goodman is understated and more than effective as <UNK> blue fairy <UNK> br br this <UNK> story of <UNK> trying to be his own ideal hero and <UNK> becoming his ideal tragic <UNK> is a mature and vivid look into what we are as people and aside from that it is one of the most deeply romantic films i have ever come across <UNK> is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love and at the films <UNK> painful conclusion he finally learns what it means to be a real boy as his blue fairy <UNK> <UNK> him his wish and he realizes that well watch the movie and you'll see br br mother night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made it is a beautiful poetic story that <UNK> deep within our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author
<START> since <UNK> death and <UNK> absence the show has been left in the incapable hands of richard <UNK> <UNK> is not a film critic he just <UNK> anything he doesn't like personally i e films with country music get <UNK> because i don't like country music and children's movies get a standard don't see it now wait until it comes out on dvd and rent it for your kids <UNK> may well be an idiot <UNK> but in some other field the weekly guests <UNK> <UNK> for ebert fare better but who wants to pick a daisy in the midst of a cow pat all that said it is the only show in town and that alone makes it worth watching as for roger ebert if stephen <UNK> can talk so can you it's your mind and thoughts we long for do whatever is necessary to get that <UNK> off his self <UNK> throne
<START> it's hard to believe after waiting 14 years we wind up with this piece of cinematic garbage the original was a high impact dark thriller that achieved cult status <UNK> the fine art of cinema as directed by paul verhoeven this film adds nothing delivers nothing and ultimately winds up in the big box of failed sequels br br the opening sequence could have <UNK> an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerably talented and able cast unfortunately we are treated to a 90 minute <UNK> in the self indulgent life of catherine <UNK> or is it sharon stone possibly a <UNK> of both br br if the desire is too see a <UNK> of the <UNK> provocative <UNK> of sex as in b s 1 forget it you wind up with soft porn boredom which ultimately <UNK> the old <UNK> that a woman can be more <UNK> in clothes than out of them it's interesting to note that the wonderful charlotte <UNK> was <UNK> around in her <UNK> via the 1966 <UNK> girl when ms stone was only 8 years old a very talented actress and quite <UNK> at holding her own even here br br if you're a true cinema fan then you must see this film and judge it using your own rating system if not you might as well wait for the dvd release in the rated version <UNK> version <UNK> edition or ultimate version and perhaps in another 14 years we will be <UNK> with news of basic instinct 3 at which point ms stone will be <UNK> years old and nobody will really care
<START> where do i start per the title of this film i expected some degree of authenticity in the end i was <UNK> let down this is not the story of <UNK> <UNK> or the song <UNK> marlene rather it is a hollywood or pick your film making <UNK> story loosely based on some real life characters i should have had a clue when i heard a heavy english accent giving the intro to the movie in german the blood red text title artists should have been the 2nd clue the story line is contrived <UNK> was not tricked out of switzerland <UNK> <UNK> parents there is no info that <UNK> helped <UNK> jews from germany the original song had been recorded outside of the control of the <UNK> regime not while under control the record played at the station was picked up in vienna while a lt was there on leave etc etc the costumes are poor and incorrect for the time frames ss black uniforms used every where from border guards to staff positions these went away from daily use once the war started etc the characters are <UNK> types <UNK> bullies in a club once they were essentially out of power don't waste your time
<START> it's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera work and busy but <UNK> background score that <UNK> this 1933 release although sound came into general use in <UNK> there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman <UNK> married who <UNK> her husband for a younger man after a romantic <UNK> in the woods br br the most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town <UNK> to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover in a frenzy of jealousy he drives at top speed toward a <UNK> crossing but changes his mind at the last moment losing his nerve it's probably the most tension filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow moving and obviously contrived story br br hedy <UNK> is given the sort of close up treatment <UNK> on marlene <UNK> by her <UNK> but her beauty had not yet been <UNK> by the <UNK> as they were when she was transported to hollywood her performance consists mostly of looking sad and <UNK> while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love <UNK> <UNK> the handsome young stud who <UNK> her clothes after a nude swim br br the swimming scene is very brief <UNK> photographed and not worth all the heat it apparently generated the love making scene later on is also <UNK> photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film <UNK> so more is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism and this is the sort of thing that has others <UNK> the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece br br not so it's disappointing <UNK> crude in its sound portions including the <UNK> <UNK> music in the background and certainly miss <UNK> is fortunate that louis b <UNK> saw the film and on the basis of it gave her a career in hollywood he must have seen something in her work that i didn't br br it's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work the jarring workers scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring <UNK> where none is needed it fails to end the film on the proper note
