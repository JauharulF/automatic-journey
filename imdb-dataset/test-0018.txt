<START> i was struck by the awful acting and script for this movie all the characters seem rendered <UNK> by personal issues rather like deer in <UNK> they <UNK> around whining and <UNK> about their emotions when <UNK> actions need to be taken i found myself yelling at the tv screen trying to wake them up to their situation and do something the plot line is implausible every time there is a key decision to be taken by a lead character one of the other characters has to bring up all the problems with the obvious decision as though to further render the decision more difficult it is a tried melodramatic <UNK> and just wants to make you <UNK> clearly the <UNK> of the decision is obvious you don't need to treat the audience as idiots overall there is just too much emotional melodrama in the whole movie
<START> i was reading in a stuff magazine about some of the <UNK> <UNK> films that asia had to offer and i immediately jumped to netflix to <UNK> my <UNK> boy what a mistake i made this movie is one of the worst films i have seen first and foremost no plot what i expected to be the plot see revenge turned into a series of events just happening in a effort to spend their special effects budget of 14 <UNK> and waste studio time they should have kept their money and not wasted their time nor yours br br when a major plot twist occurs <UNK> ii body hammer is given a new identity and i wasn't buying it a flashback is given that should answer our questions but seemed to me like i turned on showtime at 3 <UNK> am and dropped acid the movie continues and <UNK> out of control with cheesy graphics and special olympic effects br br do i seem bitter about this film yes did i see iron man no was there a plot no was it so symbolic that i didn't understand no was there a body hammer beats the hell out of me so take my advice and stay away br br i must admit though i have had so much fun writing this and laughing to myself about this film that if you want to laugh watch it
<START> at the beginning of the movie <UNK> <UNK> says that <UNK> is his tribute to the godfather this one feels more like an insult it <UNK> terribly in comparison to the coppola classic although no one was expecting <UNK> <UNK> to fill <UNK> shoes the movie did create a lot of expectation and buzz br br amitabh bachchan plays <UNK> a character automatically drawing instant comparisons to indian political party <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bachchan plays his son <UNK> who returns from abroad and gets caught up in politics at home just like al pacino in the original godfather br br as most bollywood fare incidents and characters are overtly simplistic and devoid of any kind of solid foundation quick phone calls and sudden <UNK> turn the film from one direction to another takes to <UNK> murky underworld politics crime <UNK> like a duck takes to water <UNK> bachchan as <UNK> is supposed to look magnificent and powerful he just ends up looking old and clueless most of his acting is centered around constantly staring at different things around the movie set the actor in front of him the floor or in some other random direction br br however kay kay performs exceedingly well as the <UNK> elder son so does as <UNK> the <UNK> based <UNK> <UNK> who wants to gets his <UNK> in <UNK> this actor has awesome screen presence and can send chills down your spine with just the way he looks the moment he enters the screen you want to run and hide under the bed br br all its obvious flaws not <UNK> the film did well at the box office the buzz and the big star cast obviously helping also <UNK> manages to hold your interest albeit mildly towards the later half of the film he is actually making a sequel to this one which i am sure will be more of the same fare
<START> i remember watching this series <UNK> every saturday evening it was the highlight of the week i loved everything about it the location the costumes the actors and the wonderful music by i still have their legend album i loved the way they solved the problem of michael leaving by creating another robin this time the earl of <UNK> i believe there were legends of several <UNK> in medieval times another thing i loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors i'm sure robin and his men would have young after all people didn't live that long in those days other <UNK> always look too old kevin <UNK> with his ridiculous accent looked like <UNK> <UNK> the only sad thing was the ending it's a shame they couldn't at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending
<START> i have just watched the season 2 finale of doctor who and apart from a couple of dull episodes this show is fantastic br br its a sad loss that we say goodbye to a main character once again in the season final but the show moves on br br the bbc does need to increase the budget on the show there are only so many things that can happen in london and the surrounding areas also some of the special effects all though on the main very good on the odd occasion do need to be a little more polished br br it was a huge <UNK> for the bbc to bring back a show that lost its way a long time ago and they must be <UNK> for doing so br br roll on to the christmas 2006 special the 2005 christmas special was by far the best thing on television
<START> the movie everything is <UNK> comes from first time writer director <UNK> <UNK> adapting jonathan <UNK> first novel the book was ambitious and <UNK> its magical <UNK> elements and vivid use of language seemingly impossible to represent on screen the movie wisely attempts less while the end result is not as wildly original as the novel it's still an accomplished movie about a strange eastern european road trip or as one of the characters would have it a very rigid search br br that character is alex eugene a young <UNK> man who loves american pop culture but can't seem to get the english language straight nevertheless his grandfather russian actor boris who runs a tour company <UNK> to american jews convinces him to serve as a <UNK> for jonathan <UNK> wood jonathan is investigating his family history and specifically trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the nazis more than one family secret gets revealed during their quest br br the movie's jonathan not to be confused with the author of the novel is a semi weirdo who steals his own <UNK> <UNK> to add to his collection of family things <UNK> quiet wide eyed earnest manner works very well in this role makes an impressive debut as the loose <UNK> <UNK> alex his <UNK> are hilarious but he is also able to pull off the character's growing self awareness the dog is very funny as the demented sammy davis jr jr and one of the few movie dogs i've ever seen that isn't <UNK> cute and <UNK> br br everything is <UNK> eventually puts the holocaust on a human scale asking us to remember it not as a general event but as millions of specific small <UNK> reminiscent of a european movie it also <UNK> the effect of past events on present day young people like jonathan and alex with its original perspective strong performances and some very striking visuals everything is <UNK> is great work for a first <UNK> and hopefully <UNK> will continue to direct movies
<START> first i like s segal but in this movie he has hit rock bottom and started to dig br br the plot what plot very strange and plot br br the actions way below <UNK> standards br br the good parts mr segal is a pro and shows it that's it br br summary i could write and have done so a better script for mr segal in case you read this stephen mail me i'll give you a better script to do a better movie the only realistic part is the one where see spoiler part br br spoiler part stop reading here if you plan to see the movie gas <UNK> wow a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a hotel room i work in the industry laughable the bad guy <UNK> that much is true in life
<START> this thing takes the horny teenager genre very poorly respected to begin with and completely <UNK> it down the toilet the only people i would even consider <UNK> it to are teenage girls for a revealing scene in a <UNK> locker room and in the end i wouldn't make such a recommendation to do so would be to contribute to the <UNK> of a juvenile an absolute piece of garbage with utterly no redeeming qualities
<START> dr paul richard gere a successful surgeon has his wife leave him his son an uncredited james franco not respect him and <UNK> a patient he's operating on <UNK> willis diane lane has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her they both need to get away she watches over a beautiful <UNK> in at the same time he books a room they're all alone together you can pretty much figure out the rest br br this is what's known as a <UNK> or a woman's film it's beautifully shot with a romantic setting and lots of quiet scenes there's tragedy romance more tragedy and an uplifting ending sort of the great acting by gere and lane helps disguise the fact that this film isn't really about much every single bit of the plot is predictable i rolled my eyes a lot at some of the events also it's far too short i didn't believe the romance between gere and lane for a second if comes out of nowhere and moves very quickly still the movie does work the <UNK> itself is absolutely gorgeous and i was in tears by the end along with most of the audience so it's a predictable but gorgeous movie with some wonderful acting it doesn't deserve all the criticism it's getting i give it a 7
<START> this is a movie with a wonderful concept but very weak writing it should never have been released with out at least three more re writes assuming it got any the story is too <UNK> held together and there are too many 90 degree turns in the story to make it a cohesive movie it would be great to see what a decent screen writer could do with the story
<START> ernest p comes through with his third movie presentation jim <UNK> not only plays ernest but <UNK> as the evil mr <UNK> from start to finish this movie has some solid laughs and makes a good family film rated pg for comic book violence
<START> i've just seen this movie in a preview and i can only recommend to watch it it was about 90 minutes long and when it was over i felt like it could go on for hours the stories of the protagonists are so realistic and you feel really at home the movie basically consists of dialogs but i wasn't bored a minute 18 people of really different characters and each one of them acted out so well i had to laugh felt awkward was sad and still felt happiness all in all it is a movie that shows the different kinds of people in our society the way they communicate and how love has changed and nowadays is handled as an economic thing dating becomes something that is similar to an audition the whole audience loved it so please watch it if there's a possibility you'll love it
<START> for an independent film it scores well with reasonably high production values and a great cast the acting is uneven but the plot is compelling we could have used a bit more development of wes <UNK> character but hey the guy's fun to look at nonetheless mary kay place and <UNK> <UNK> are like <UNK> on the cake br br it's not surprising that it was controversial on its release it presents a less than <UNK> portrayal of the <UNK> church and its relationship with gays while like <UNK> mountain it's about tolerance and accepting one's own life i found it to be more successful in conveying a positive message it was more moving too
<START> the <UNK> color cinematography of leon <UNK> is quite remarkable here including his use of colored <UNK> for br br various scenes the alfred score has to be the most sensual and seductive score hollywood ever produced it's a shame it is no longer available on cd the actors however never rise to the occasion the accents are so varied from the subdued british of ustinov and <UNK> to the hollywood of <UNK> and mature that it seems a true <UNK> with no central vision tommy <UNK> is <UNK> american acting styles span the range from zombie like to stilted only ustinov as a conniving one eyed servant steals the show what there is of it to steal the premise the story of a young egyptian doctor <UNK> and abandoned by the rich and the parallel theme of the cult of the single god <UNK> <UNK> by the authorities has its interesting points but when the film's plot fades it is the haunting music and visuals that remain
<START> i have heard an awful lot about 'the english <UNK> and i finally decided to get the cd and find out what all the <UNK> was about what i found out was a cinematic delight and should i repeat always be watched with an open mind if you are a religious moral <UNK> i am afraid this is not a film for you as you will fail to see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece as you will keep on <UNK> on the moral <UNK> this film creates as i remember correctly before i watched this film i read the review in this site and was thoroughly disgusted by the views of that person who i quote said <UNK> the protagonists thoroughly deserved what they when it comes to morality i agree with him but this is not the way to comment on a film of this <UNK> br br i must admit rarely have i seen such a wonderfully crafted film i keep on hearing the background soundtrack in my <UNK> first and foremost this is a love story and yes it's an <UNK> affair beware but lets not keep focusing on that instead let's focus on how the story was told it's an of flashbacks and the present its set in the world war ii and tells us the story of a survivor of a plane crash count played wonderfully by ralph <UNK> who is looked after by an army nurse juliet <UNK> in war torn italy just before the beginning of the end defeat of the <UNK> powers the burn <UNK> patient very much in pain kept on remembering the <UNK> affair he had with an english woman <UNK> <UNK> scott thomas shown in flashbacks set in pre war africa the past and the present are <UNK> so <UNK> in the story that you're sort of transported in the story and get the feel of a first hand viewer the locales in the desert and in italy are beautiful and so are the characters i am a romantic and am not ashamed to say i had tears after it ended watch it with someone you truly love the movie starts and ends with the same shot of the desert where the sand <UNK> twist and <UNK> like a woman's body and it was breathtaking the sense of loss and grief was conveyed so <UNK> by the actors that it makes me wonder why god why do we have wars that destroys beauty and the most unforgivable of all the destruction of innocence br br anyway it deservedly won a bunch of oscars and i will go hunting for other works of director anthony it kind of brings back the <UNK> in the david lean genre of films it almost reminds me of <UNK> of <UNK> which was also based in the desert happy viewing folks
<START> i bought this film at blockbuster for 3 00 because it sounded interesting a bit <UNK> <UNK> with the idea of someone dragging around a <UNK> because there was a cute girl in a mini <UNK> on the back and because there was a <UNK> viewing <UNK> on it i thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge i was 100 wrong br br having watched it i have to wonder how it got the <UNK> <UNK> since there is hardly any foul language little violence and the closest thing to nudity honestly i don't usually go around hoping for it is when the girl is in her <UNK> and you see her <UNK> you see her <UNK> a lot in this movie because no matter what she's wearing a <UNK> of some sort even the anti religious humor is tame and lame <UNK> <UNK> derivative unoriginal and worst of all not funny in the slightest it would be better just to listen to ray <UNK> would jesus wear a <UNK> on his television show this would barely qualify as pg 13 it is not rated but blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this as if it was pornographic any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of <UNK> for a dream but they insist that <UNK> and <UNK> is worse br br it is but not in that way br br in a way this <UNK> me the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning if anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed <UNK> not this one but better ones like the virgin <UNK> it's teenagers if both of those movies were rated r purely because of the suicide aspect then i have little chance of turning a story i've been writing into a pg 13 movie the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers i think it's number 2 so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it br br just say no to this movie though 2 10
<START> if you think about it it's nearly unbelievable that a film could be made about the death penalty one of the world's most controversial topics that <UNK> neither those for nor against it's a testament to tim <UNK> extraordinary intelligence and sensitivity traits that can be seen in his acting roles as well <UNK> redemption <UNK> ladder br br this film in fact hints at a subtle compromise between the for and against camps so subtle that it can't be put into words subtle to the point of <UNK> yet one gets the sense after watching the picture that a compromise is possible that somehow it can be worked out if only we look deeply enough
<START> i saw this ego <UNK> effort at achieving a film of epic status in the company of several native russian family members five people gave 5 different reactions from worship to my cynicism br br i saw a movie that looked like took a lot of <UNK> money put some of it in his and other's <UNK> and turned the project over to a bunch of film students i counted at least 4 different styles in the movie there is no way that the same director is responsible for these different scenes contrast these for yourself br br <UNK> shoes with a dog br br station scene saying goodbye to <UNK> br br <UNK> shots br br talking through the <UNK> br br attempt on the grand duke and later chase scenes to get <UNK> back to sing in <UNK> br br sequence br br julia <UNK> is faster than superman learning about his transfer <UNK> she gets all the way across <UNK> in one minute to say goodbye to <UNK> br br the russian natives felt that the impression given of russian life was caricature and not history they called it tourist <UNK> russia br br they were all proud that a russian director producer <UNK> has managed to break into the big time and be able to waste over 30 million dollars of other people's money while maybe putting a little into local <UNK> during filming br br if you want to think you have seen russia go see this movie drink some coffee before you go
<START> in one sense i kind of liked this movie because of a <UNK> positive atmosphere it sort of conveys i had a problem with an aspect of the plot but more about that later first the characters were a little goofy and one dimensional the <UNK> <UNK> had similar physical and character traits and the <UNK> <UNK> had similar physical and character traits hmmm the basic storyline was ok pretty simple and standard nothing too exciting or <UNK> the main attraction was of course the <UNK> dinosaurs kind of a nice fantasy element to have however they had a very minimal presence in the movie br br outside of that the movie kept a <UNK> pace and didn't get too <UNK> down in any one place i liked this about the movie br br the problem i had with the plot had to do with the the idea of stealing i think this movie may not have been thought out enough <UNK> wrong especially if this is a kid's movie i'll keep the next sentence abstract to not be a spoiler skip it if you're worried the <UNK> <UNK> do some stealing and they don't have the same info the audience has so it's just stealing and that's kind of a bad thing for a kid's movie br br overall if you have kids because of a questionable plot aspect i'd consider passing however this whole movie is pretty low key anyway so it may not matter pass this one if you have any other interesting choices
<START> am i the only person who saw and remembers <UNK> every scene in <UNK> has its counterpart in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> accompanied by <UNK> strings to the entrance of anna through the dark <UNK> <UNK> by the man with the key to the very dialog of the conclusion with anna at <UNK> feet a la before the dying <UNK> does no one else recall the dialog in that script br br time <UNK> common time we begin with the strings and so it copies br br remember <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> against a door tears falling down her <UNK> face same scene just replace her with <UNK> nephew even the <UNK> humor fart jokes are the same we even have a <UNK> followed around by a plate of sweet <UNK> which recalls in the <UNK> hall does no one else remember br br and the scene where anna cries to god why did you give me this gift said the same thing br br and beyond all that we have a juvenile script with an opening exposition that reads like the character you'd find in a children's story i am mr <UNK> i am the composer br br and what after all is the purpose of the bridge <UNK> other than to <UNK> the technical against the artistic a comparison that is not at all developed probably because it has no meaning especially when it comes to who was a master of the technical br br there's only one great scene the playing of the <UNK> first the music which of itself takes you to tears but then there is the highly erotic interaction of anna the <UNK> keeping time and <UNK> <UNK> which surpasses the most explicit sexual <UNK> so intense it's almost embarrassing br br but please the rest of the film where is the world's collective memory you have seen this all before and better
<START> this film is without a doubt the worst action film i have ever seen i am sorry but it is just pathetic in fact the best part of the movie this movie is supposed to be a serious one is when a chicken <UNK> across the road on foot at about 100 miles per hour this pathetic editing mistake makes the film absolutely hilarious for approximately 2 seconds then it is back to non stop on the edge of your seat as you try to find a comfortable position to sleep in action
<START> faith akin has made me realize once more the <UNK> of my passion for this city called <UNK> being addressed as a city of cultural <UNK> faith akin has contributed to that addressing through the <UNK> of music performed in the film what's more the climax of the film in my opinion is the scene where a turkish music <UNK> sings at age <UNK> as well as she had done in her younger years and rolls the glass in the air without <UNK> out one drop which is a traditional act in culture she is just marvellous a turkish pop singer with her mystical and meaningful looks at the end of her song which gives the film its turkish title makes the scene no less than a climax last but not least the wonderful scenery of <UNK> can make you feel nostalgic if you are away beware
<START> i cannot believe i was hooked on this show instantly after seeing the first scene i was in it deep br br anyway first of all the guys are hot <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> heath <UNK> etc br br secondly the girls are cute sexy smart and are not afraid of being called <UNK> i like that which at the same time doesn't make them mean and greedy just realistic br br third the relationships are so great especially <UNK> and <UNK> lately every show turns very away from it's original path and people end up with someone who wasn't even in the first season <UNK> and <UNK> relationship is true love a kind that lasts they loved each other throughout the years and it didn't end when a guest star appeared br br in todays world maybe it's kind of unbelievable for two people to love each other for a long time but it happens and people define each other in college so i knew exactly who i wanted to be with in college just like <UNK> and <UNK> br br i hope there are many more seasons of this show and i hope we can see the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> now that they will probably stay together at <UNK> love this show
<START> i just saw this on tcm tonight and was shocked at the over acting by jean arthur her <UNK> her eyes out in surprise and just generally over doing everything was not in the same style as <UNK> and art <UNK> <UNK> was marvelous in her restraint and comic timing she being the best thing in this movie the wilder gags were flat and frankly more like something a <UNK> in college would write trying to get away w being wicked witty and dirty but just sounded boring and not funny at all it seemed the humor was being pushed too hard to be funny the ending was totally contrived br br spoiler ahead never for a moment did i believe that art <UNK> suddenly fell outta love w <UNK> and then was suddenly <UNK> in love w arthur oh billy get real 3 out of 10
<START> did i waste my time this is very pretentious film in the beginning you will think there's something going on but by the time some 30 minutes go by you realize nothing is happening i waited for another 20 minutes and by then i was so frustrated that i started reading reviews on imdb and realized that the director has wasted precious time of so many people br br unbelievably boring pointless film stay away so many good <UNK> i will give one point for the police inspector joke because that worked for me i laughed for a long time but otherwise a very bad film stay away 1 on 10
<START> why was this film made what were the creators of this thinking the first <UNK> film at least had a plot that made sense and was potentially interesting the first film was about the snuff film industry this sequel is about hold on the porno industry yes as if the snuff film industry an industry in which people are supposedly killed on film for entertainment were at all in the same league with the adult film industry an industry in which people film other people engaging in sex acts and situations for <UNK> the idea alone should warn you about how poorly conceived the idea for this film alone is it isn't helped by a lack of plot character acting direction script logic theme or even sound design this is a remarkably boring film that never once held my attention literally nothing works why would a mystery thriller film about the porno industry involving assassination and betrayal work anyway i don't have much of an interest in adult films but i certainly have watched them before why would somebody make a film about the <UNK> of it and that they would make it in a sequel to a film about snuff movies i don't even know if there is an industry involved in snuff film making but i hope it doesn't the idea of a snuff film alone is horrific and only people who are truly sick and bad would be a part of it i don't think that the adult film industry revolves around murder and torture i'm pretty sure that a lot of people make pornographic films for good intentions rather than to hurt and kill people it is never okay to hurt another human being the adult film industry isn't about hurting people it's about creating films that are to me a <UNK> and a waste of time what is this film trying to say it doesn't work
<START> a powerful movie that has <UNK> much of its meaning in this second half of 2007 after the new desperate movements of the <UNK> people against their <UNK> i felt a complex mix of feelings about the people there something like compassion and admiration at the same time together with a bit of rage because i feel that no one neither the countries of the world nor themselves is doing anything effective to end this shame i think these feelings became directly from the movie and that they were intended when it was made so it is a successful movie the desire for peace the quest for enlightenment the respect for life sometimes leads to <UNK> in fact it is the <UNK> <UNK> culture who has left the doors wide opens to their <UNK> but how can you feel angry about these poor people
<START> george original version of the <UNK> aka the man who wanted to know offers one of european <UNK> most quietly disturbing <UNK> and one of the most memorable <UNK> of all time shamelessly stolen by tarantino for kill bill volume two but it has plenty more to offer than that playing around with <UNK> and <UNK> the usual clichés of standard <UNK> plots it also offers superb characterisation and strong <UNK> but convincing performances br br unfortunately i can only assume that when it came to the remake <UNK> was so determined that no one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself but few people could have anticipated how <UNK> he <UNK> his own work his career never <UNK> from this disastrous <UNK> br br chief <UNK> is an astonishing performance by jeff bridges that has been over thought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level a friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that bridges was a great <UNK> actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing and this film is the proof of the <UNK> every movement is overly mechanical in its <UNK> making him look like a rusty clockwork toy while his voice is a bizarre mixture of <UNK> from taxi and a <UNK> who have all been taking <UNK> lessons from <UNK> e <UNK> no <UNK> of evil here just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying please let me kill you thank you for your consideration ' but the blame really needs to be shared out here none of the performances are good often they don't even look good  <UNK> sutherland looks more like a baby <UNK> than a <UNK> man at his wits end in the <UNK> scenes at the gas station nancy travis <UNK> badly and sandra <UNK> makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession not that they're given any help by either director or writer todd <UNK> the script is particularly weak the <UNK> has been altered to put the focus firmly on bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film worse is the rush the film is in <UNK> the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next rather than the high low mood shifts in the <UNK> relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her as for the new and improved happy ending  standard woman chased by <UNK> in the woods <UNK> stuff complete with lame <UNK> end on a joke like a tv cop <UNK> moment  best not go <UNK> which is advice that holds for this entire <UNK> of a movie even a shockingly bland and uninspired jerry <UNK> score can't do anything for this one
<START> this movie is a great movie only if you need something to sit and laugh at the stupidity of it as a <UNK> this movie gets most of the important facts wrong and uses actors that are too young to even be considered in the top of their fields it is interesting how it shows <UNK> <UNK> in massive <UNK> below the <UNK> surface it also is funny how active areas are shown to have massive destruction from a 6 5 <UNK> <UNK> they seem to forget the building standards in these areas would be higher needing a bigger <UNK> to do this much damage also it is funny how much they make the coast line of washington state and also <UNK> to look as though they are nice <UNK> of southern california the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is very entertaining even if the way it is used is wrong the director does a good job of adding more comic relief with the 2
<START> in this film we're invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional <UNK> of someone who isn't likable to start with what was the point of making the film then to show that it would have been better not to have had in cold blood a book i admire incidentally in order to have kept our hero's integrity intact hardly he behaves at the party at the start of the film exactly in the same way he behaves after his <UNK> reading from the book so his <UNK> is a matter of degree are we supposed to care enough about capote to take seriously his claim that he and murderer perry smith are <UNK> spirits with the former having had all the breaks while the latter had none mr <UNK> plight didn't touch me at all i'm afraid so if that was the central idea it was wasted on me but even if i could <UNK> why the filmmakers visited this pointless project on us the clunky storytelling would still have bored me as it did hoffman gives a <UNK> performance to no emotional effect while <UNK> and cooper are so warm and interesting that i was yearning for more of them dreary beyond belief
<START> if you watched the series and love the league as i do then prepare to be disappointed i went to the cinema with a group of die hard league fans and we were all in <UNK> that this film wasn't as funny or dark as the three series before in my personal opinion it was a money <UNK> the writing was contrived and the plot confused no not confusing just confused with what it was trying to do it was self <UNK> of the worst kind from writers who are far more talented than my pitiful criticisms i hope the league at least can be honest enough with themselves and acknowledge this film as being inferior to the superb three series i will not be buying it despite <UNK> most of the league <UNK>
<START> don't believe the hype if you have high hopes or have anticipated this movie to any degree you may be disappointed even the hilarious and talented steve <UNK> can't save this poorly written over long silly spy flick for the <UNK> fans of the original tv series this movie bears little resemblance to the original characters and influence agent 99 and <UNK> except for their names are simply not the same characters there are several isolated references to the original but not enough to convince this fan that it is anything more than a poor shadow of the tv version for those not familiar with the original tv series you may not be disappointed but chances are you will be bored there are a few cheap hollywood political shots as well really pathetic and oh so typical for an election year we left after the first hour and weren't alone some left after 20 minutes
<START> arthur <UNK> plays a very stereotypical role as a mountain man probably the <UNK> who goes hunting with his favorite dog however the dog appears to be drowning when <UNK> jumps in after him it becomes obvious pretty soon that despite <UNK> and his dog <UNK> about after leaving the water that they both died in the water as no one responds when he talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and the <UNK> death yet oddly <UNK> is really slow on the <UNK> and it takes him a while to understand they are talking about him i think this was actually done as padding as there really wasn't enough material to fill the half hour time <UNK> br br later in the surprise twist he comes upon heaven or at least his concept of the place he's invited in but since they won't allow dogs he has other ideas overall reasonably well acted but of dubious spiritual value with no twists or irony this episode is a bit dull not twilight zone y enough for my tastes
<START> i recently read the story to see how these two match up and if you can believe it this film <UNK> upon <UNK> the story is moved around i think to drive home the idea that colonel <UNK> is a man who has suffered much and yet he comes home not a hero but as an <UNK> br br as someone mentioned i was initially confused if <UNK> was akin to the return of martin <UNK> no it is firmly established by <UNK> that <UNK> is the real deal what's interesting though is not is he isn't he but how his wife and society treats him br br i think this is a timeless story of men who go off to fight for their country and when they come home time has left them behind <UNK> is a tragic figure made all the more poignant by the amazing gerard depardieu i don't care that he's been in 1 million films he's captivating br br <UNK> <UNK> has a horrible character to play once a prostitute rose has used her feminine <UNK> to climb the social ladder are her emotions true for i think they are and perhaps couple that with her social standing at the time and you start to feel some empathy for her br br is slowly his way into my heart he's exceptional here as br br i think if you can get your hands on this gem of a film you won't be sorry french cinema at its finest
<START> you have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder what all the fuss was about when <UNK> in the dark opened to such an enthusiastic <UNK> from audiences in the 1940s br br on top of some weak one liners and ordinary sight gags the plot is as far fetched as the tales the fox red <UNK> tells his radio audience you have to wonder why anyone would think he could come up with a real life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it but then that's how unrealistic the comedy is br br but if you're a true red <UNK> fan and enjoy a look back at how comedies were made in the <UNK> you can at least enjoy the <UNK> cast supporting him ann <UNK> and virginia grey do nicely as his love interest and conrad <UNK> as always makes an interesting villain one of his more amusing moments is his reaction to <UNK> explaining the mysteries of wearing <UNK> i never knew that he <UNK> impressed by a minor point that is cleverly introduced br br all in all typical nonsense that requires you to accept the lack of credibility and just accept the gags as they are not always easy for a <UNK> viewer as many of them simply fall flat the way many comedies of this era do because the novelty of the sight gags and one liners has simply worn off
<START> i had the <UNK> of being one of the still <UNK> on the set of grand champion and enjoyed every minute of the <UNK> days i worked on the movie i have been in the photography business for 25 years and have worked on 16 movies and i can't think of a time when i enjoyed providing my craft more the kids were wonderful to work with and little emma roberts has so much energy she's a real trip she even grabbed one of my camera during the scene rehearsal and started shooting some of her images were used for <UNK> i could have made more money working for a production with a bigger budget but i doubt i would have had the fun and been around so many great actors and the great people of west texas as i was
<START> i liked this comedy so much will smith does not do anything slow it is always right on target with the greatest scripts and comedy that keeps you laughing and involved in the plot you are watching a skilled comedian who plays all his parts well one fully believes he is who he is playing i loved him and tommy lee jones in the men in black this comedy rates right up with that movie the humor is fast moving and will smith is as sure of himself as he was in men in black quick witted and well skilled in the art of making others score each time but doing it in a <UNK> manner and with <UNK> br br will smith seems to have <UNK> his comedy routine well he was so darn funny i loved the part where he had an <UNK> reaction to something he ate and his face <UNK> up and he looked more like <UNK> clay after a fight then he did himself then seeing him <UNK> on the bottle trying to bring his head back down to the right size i laughed so hard he knows how to make us all laugh
<START> no more <UNK> and <UNK> for her br br this little romantic comedy clips along from scene to scene with a few exotic twists some imaginary scenes and a costume party all of this is centered around the wife of the husband s who is looking to break out of the <UNK> played by gloria <UNK> she is twenty here both the leading men have a natural air that is convincing and of course <UNK> is perfect in all kinds of <UNK> from <UNK> to worried to hopeful br br behind all the games and apparent <UNK> is that old serious problem of staying in love and not <UNK> in love there's a little <UNK> but director demille is on top of keeping it snappy and believable in all as with many films from this period the subtitles do not just tell what they are saying or thinking but often give a kind of philosophical insight as if to justify the tragedy or and there is that higher purpose here probably better without the <UNK> text but it's part of the narrative style and it's kind of quaint br br if you are looking for visual or <UNK> <UNK> you won't find it here but as a story well acted and filmed with <UNK> and economy it's really a great example the events might not come as a total surprise but it's such a modern love story set almost a hundred years ago it's a gas and did i saw <UNK> was perfect
<START> every episode i saw when i was an innocent child was stupid there were some funny looking puppets called the <UNK> who would always discuss childhood things they would play this song before the <UNK> part of the show that goes like this let's join the <UNK> there was a <UNK> marx puppet that told jokes before the session this man would sing hot <UNK> right on there was a green puppet with teeth that was called <UNK> we would always see more <UNK> he would crack jokes and sing every episode there was always a moral in every episode one episode a man sang <UNK> are losers another episode he was singing about sharing and caring <UNK> said tell me about those two little girls sharon and karen the hot <UNK> <UNK> part has this man doing weird stuff and they played weird music
<START> i saw borderline several years ago on <UNK> i've been looking for it ever since it was haunting visual <UNK> sensual this movie took me somewhere like a dream and i didn't care where i will never forget the curtain blowing in the <UNK> i still remember the way it made me <UNK> my head i remember my facial expression when i saw it i didn't know what had happened when the movie was over but i find life is that way it didn't bother me the <UNK> of the ultimate <UNK> of an innocent character strikes me as sadly real i loved the faces the way the camera <UNK> upon them the camera <UNK> at the set with the <UNK> eyes of a borderline was real to me in a way movies aren't it was exactly the lack of explanation color <UNK> that made it enter my consciousness like a thief in the night i love this movie someday i will own it
<START> john <UNK> what have you done br br silver city had moments in which i could see the <UNK> hope of a good story well drawn characters thought provoking dialog and then those moments would quickly be covered over by layers of poor writing clumsy direction and abysmal acting i truly love almost all of john work but silver city is ghastly br br i got the feeling that <UNK> may have been working on the <UNK> of a good story involving the illegal labor and industrial corruption plot lines but then he got rushed and stuck the secondary plot line <UNK> the bush administration onto it the two stories don't really connect with each other and the weaker elements of the political theme dominate the first 3 4 of the movie causing me to lose patience with the whole affair br br the other major flaw is danny <UNK> acting his dialog in every scene is delivered with a <UNK> grin regardless of its to the mood i hated this guy by the end of the film having been reminded of every bad actor in every high school play i've ever seen not having seen huston in anything else i don't know whether to blame him or to blame direction of him more regardless he's the unfortunate <UNK> point of a very unfortunate movie br br right down to the last <UNK> subtle final scene i was disappointed by silver city <UNK> at his best or heck even <UNK> at mediocre can be so very much better than this film see any of his other works instead this isn't even worth a rental
<START> set during the hungarian revolution of 1956 this story has all the suspense of a good cold war book or movie as a <UNK> group of <UNK> attempt to <UNK> jason <UNK> out of <UNK> into <UNK> however three things <UNK> the story making this an extremely good movie br br first the actors use the actual languages of their roles the russian soldiers speak only russian the <UNK> only hungarian the germans only german except to the minimal extent to tell the story since debra kerr is english she speaks only english and of course <UNK> <UNK> and a few others essential to the story also speak heavily <UNK> english as a result the empathy of the audience to the <UNK> becomes paramount the viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an <UNK> border crossing when he she cannot understand any of the languages spoken around them very powerful feelings are <UNK> in the audience and notwithstanding the heavy use of foreign languages the audience is never at a loss for following the film no subtitles are necessary br br second i was in <UNK> in 1995 and i'm telling you this movie has it right on from the gypsy music <UNK> the dinner meal to the underground <UNK> in the buildings where much of the action takes place to the village scenes the realism is incredible if i didn't eat in the actual restaurant in the movie i ate at its double i thought that i actually walked down the main street in that village actually the film was shot in <UNK> br br third and most important this movie <UNK> kerr and <UNK> <UNK> after the king and i and the <UNK> between them as the story unfolds is nothing short of oscar <UNK> of course <UNK> already received an oscar for playing that relationship so the <UNK> wasn't going to give him another one but that is the quality of the film don't miss this one
<START> this is one of several period sea <UNK> <UNK> of its era which has the added distinction although not in itself unique of a female <UNK> at its center at first both leads â jean peters and louis â might seem miscast but they grow nicely into their roles eventually thanks no doubt to the talented players herbert marshall thomas <UNK> and james robertson justice who support them <UNK> voiced marshall is <UNK> cast as the obligatory philosophical lush of a doctor and <UNK> is suitably larger than life as the pirate br br the cast is completed by debra <UNK> as wife who <UNK> the jealous rage of the <UNK> titular character in whom <UNK> the first <UNK> of love which however does not spare him the occasional <UNK> or sword wound incidentally the film was the second exotic <UNK> of and <UNK> in one year following <UNK> bird of paradise the direct result of this unexpected <UNK> of character is her falling out with crew and her unlikely climactic sacrifice in order to save the lives of the stranded <UNK> and marshall br br while the film is not a particularly outstanding example of its type jacques energetic direction and <UNK> <UNK> score ensure an above average effort that moves along at a <UNK> pace incidentally <UNK> had already done service in the genre with the superior burt <UNK> vehicle the flame and the arrow 1950 as usual with vintage technicolor productions the cinematography gives the film a <UNK> that is <UNK> by the way <UNK> running times are given for this film <UNK> or <UNK> minutes and for the record the version i watched was the shorter one
<START> probably the worst movie i have ever seen it is so <UNK> filmed the focus is not even on this supposed real half <UNK> it is more on the crew coming from hollywood to make the movie no cinematic significance whatsoever and if i could take back the almost 1 1 2 hours that i spent watching this film i would feel much better br br at first it starts out giving you the impression it will be filmed somewhat <UNK> like an actual hollywood production however then they go into the narration of the story and it's filmed so f ing terribly it's supposed to be a take on blair witch project really since they pretty much use what you would think is <UNK> camera <UNK> it's not don't be fooled br br worst movie i have ever seen on the positive side it has like one semi scary scene in it and the visuals of the half <UNK> weren't too bad looking at all don't rent
<START> how is it possible to like and dislike the same movie br br the plot is very much like that <UNK> foster thing only not as good nicole was great jude was adequate they didn't give him many lines is there a reason for that generally he's a pretty good actor she's so elegant his character is so country <UNK> it makes one wonder what they see in each other br br romance between two such was only successful in lady lover br br i think the dislike comes about because the movie is too long they could have told the story in two hours br br the story is good good locations good filming the character actors were great
<START> a woman and her aunt go to scotland to locate her <UNK> fiancé this is a much <UNK> film because of its denouement but up to that point it's interesting well acted eerie and with fine set design by william cameron <UNK> developed for 3 d projection <UNK> <UNK> is captivating and <UNK> sort of a <UNK> british marilyn monroe still in love with richard <UNK> who is hiding a family secret in his <UNK> castle there are even bats in the it moves <UNK> until the final extraordinary set piece when <UNK> and her aunt <UNK> <UNK> also the narrator sneak out of the castle in the night to venture into the <UNK> and find what they're looking for in its center as a kid i always remembered this sequence there's nothing scarier or claustrophobic than not finding your way out of a 10 foot high <UNK> of <UNK> naturally the two women get separated setting the stage for engrossing suspense with horrific music the final result is mildly disappointing really since <UNK> <UNK> at the end makes some sense to all the goings on even provoking sympathy worth seeing
<START> as soon as i saw the ad for on the history channel i knew i'd love it it captured the spirit fantastically you would die if you didn't have mates around you the characters of were strong and each brought something different into the story and the japanese soldiers weren't <UNK> but were depicted as normal soldiers doing what they thought was right just as the <UNK> were doing direction screenplay acting and setting were all done wonderfully with a clear easy to follow plot humour was the <UNK> key to survival and it was great to see a mini series about war actually have some sort of humour in it which is usually difficult to do without <UNK> people from what i've read about soldiers in <UNK> camp this story is a very realistic approach to the three and a half years those australian british new zealand american and dutch men spent there i would recommend this series to anyone whether you are interested in war or not 10 10
<START> <UNK> loses her parents and other family members in a gruesome car accident she starts living on her own as an independent woman without taking any help from her relatives she has a boy friend named <UNK> and is about to get married to him but backs out due to the behavior of her future mother in law and due to lack of confidence shown by her boyfriend <UNK> <UNK> joins her neighborhood and he starts making feel comfortable and secure the rest of the story is about why <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> corporate house of <UNK> has chosen to <UNK> as neighbor of and what follows next br br this movie has a <UNK> to it which we rarely see in indian movies to it although the story goes slow you get a sense of <UNK> with it kudos to the director <UNK> for such an awesome direction brilliant music and background score composed by k m adds to the quality <UNK> <UNK> as has given a marvelous performance i think she was the best choice for this role because of her non glamorous looks and amazing <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> has done well too i have watched this movie <UNK> now and enjoyed it thoroughly every time it is a class apart from the daily dose of action movies we get here highly recommended
<START> will there be please coming an end to <UNK> movies that are dealing about social conflicts or other human disasters okay care is about care is about <UNK> <UNK> boys in a school and how disgusting it might be if it's a movie with a poor script and made with bad playing actors then it stays a bad movie care is a movie that could have been but is it because it was a i don't know but everything seemed so limited that it comes over as some cheap movie that will be seen by some <UNK> and fathers who decide not to go to bed there are so many unanswered things in this movie the relation with his mother for instance or the death of some abused boy from which we know nothing more care should have been much much better
<START> i have noticed that people have asked if anyone has this show i have all 26 episodes that aired in the u s and will be willing to share these with anyone interested all i require is that you supply the vhs tapes or blank dvd's i have them on both <UNK> and pay for <UNK> my email is net just send me an email and your request and i will <UNK> you and we can make the <UNK> the quality is very good and they are very enjoyable to watch especially if you have not been able to see them since they aired in the 60's it was one of my favorite shows as a child and hold a very special place in my heart because it brings back a lot of memories of my childhood as well as other shows like and <UNK> br br peter
<START> like the <UNK> from <UNK> a <UNK> in central park lacks the spark of personality to be the main character that carries an entire movie we're supposed to like him because he's nice but that's about all he is br br his character design is unappealing the top of his head is a sort of <UNK> that is than the <UNK> bottom half of his head br br and <UNK> should not have teeth i know that <UNK> the parrot in <UNK> had teeth but maybe that worked because it made him look more like his voice actor gilbert <UNK> with his <UNK> little voice provided by martin short looks funny with that big set of <UNK> in his <UNK> br br tim <UNK> who is usually delightful at being evil does some sort of <UNK> <UNK> dude accent as the villain might have been a good voice for a comic relief <UNK> not the supposedly menacing main villain br br the entire plot revolves around the hero and <UNK> love for female penguin <UNK> who is just as dull as both of her <UNK> br br worst of all is the pacing we keep cutting back to the villain to watch him <UNK> <UNK> some more this time in dialogue this time in song br br barry <UNK> may be a great <UNK> but in animated films like this and his songs feel limp and <UNK> especially the <UNK> the only song i liked was the 1930's ish good ship misery song br br i read that the <UNK> made some cuts in this film against the <UNK> wishes and that could have caused some of the problems though i suspect the real problem is that they didn't cut the rest of it
<START> don't waste your time one of those cool looking boxes that you pick up at blockbuster on a <UNK> but not even worth that you will not say it's so bad it's good just it's bad the greatest american hero is a writer who <UNK> a cabin on african island called snake island some other tourists are on the boat that drops him off but they are not staying on the island they just stop there to let off the writer then the boat is stranded there and in true hollywood originality the one and only radio on the island is <UNK> so they start walking around and see a bunch of snakes like hundreds of them which really became annoying and you knew the plot would go nowhere it's not like there ever was one main snake like a giant mutated snake or an extra <UNK> king of all snakes instead there are just a bunch of ham and <UNK> snakes of all kinds of <UNK> their only goal then was to escape the island as opposed to having to <UNK> the enemy because there were so many snakes you knew they couldn't possibly try to kill them all and they didn't try i've seen a similar movie where a town was haunted by snakes and they lead all the snakes into a cave then blew it up at least then you get the feeling that the good guys killed the bad guys and it was a normal ending in snake island by the way every single character was shocked to see snakes on the island it's named snake island for a reason there was no plan other than trying to get gas for the stupid boat oh they never do get gas by the way they just happen to find another boat on the island already <UNK> up
<START> despite the solid performance of penelope ann miller this movie was an awkward mess the lead character's american accent was ridiculous and he never seemed comfortable as a result there was no chemistry between the two actors and i'm still not sure what ann margaret was doing there
<START> this proves just how awful the wb network was in the last few years of its existence as a i of course <UNK> this show for its ridiculous fantasy land obscure unfunny stereotypes about the kids being weird hippies who are so smart they're <UNK> from the super cool high school students sorry tv writers the world as viewed from inside your ass containing your heads apparently when you wrote this show is not the world we talented people see with our eyes as we live in a little thing called reality as for those who actually liked this show please dear sweet jesus please <UNK> the statement that you actually liked this crap over a very long walk the acting is even more hollow phony and wooden than the stereotypes the whole show was built around thank you wb for doing the right thing and putting this horse out of its beginning to end misery this show never ever should've even had the <UNK> of being made no less having so much as eight awful episodes i really hope that these actors eventually got a clue and stopped playing roles in garbage tv shows like this as soon as this show ended
<START> if you want to see a film starring stan laurel from the laurel hardy comedies this is not the film for you stan would not begin to find the character and <UNK> of those films for another two years if however you want a good travesty of the <UNK> <UNK> blood and sand which had been made the previous year this is the movie for you all the stops are pulled out both in physical comedy and on the title cards and if the movie is not held together by character the plot of movie is used well sort of
<START> one of my desires is to be a film maker and i just have to say there's no way i will be able to compete with the powerful drama the war at home the reason is because the acting is perfect and when you see the movie you'll know what i'm talking about all i can suggest is watching it i got so involved in it and was extremely impressed br br and <UNK> relationship on the screen was absolutely amazing br br and so was his relationship with his mother kathy bates some of the best scenes include these 2 br br as well as the relationship between sheen and his daughter sister in the film br br 10 10 and definitely in my top 10 i want the dvd
<START> can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime despite betrayal on many levels tom <UNK> is no brutal othello in the setting of modern day england so gradually a web of <UNK> begins to be woven and we witness <UNK> of jealousy and <UNK> and guilt and <UNK> and so the web of separate lies begins to fail and then hold together again and life and death goes on despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives how many <UNK> of <UNK> are to be displayed in this growing <UNK> the <UNK> is to prop up sterling <UNK> and careers and relationships in this most <UNK> corner of the world <UNK> gives an emotional performance full of grace and <UNK> and <UNK> and yet humanity of those who have much to hide those who desire clarity and <UNK> on the way to justice will be disappointed with the <UNK> of so much deception and yet who among us has not something similar to hide about his loved ones nevertheless the viewer may wonder if this web is <UNK> to <UNK> some day
<START> although it <UNK> away from the book a little you can't help but love the atmospheric music and settings br br the scenes in bath are just how they should be although if you have watched it as many times as i have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene but that aside i like the scene where they are in the hot <UNK> but did the men and women really <UNK> together like that you could see all the men <UNK> around the outside <UNK> at the women it also seemed strange that they all had their hats on but perhaps this was the style at the time the ballroom scenes were very nice the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful i especially liked <UNK> dress in the first ballroom scene br br <UNK> <UNK> looked suitably <UNK> but i enjoyed the bath scenes better br br <UNK> gives a good but not exceptional performance as catherine <UNK> <UNK> gives the best performance as mrs allen i feel br br ugh peter <UNK> as mr he just talks a load of rubbish and is not a <UNK> as he should be it's hard to think of him being in love with catherine but then the book never really gave that impression either br br general is played reasonably well by hardy and stuart also gives a sort of good performance as <UNK> ingrid <UNK> did not give a good performance as <UNK> as for john well he gives the impression of a seedy and <UNK> man perhaps not the character portrayed in the book but i quite like it br br i can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation but when new scenes and characters are added it usually <UNK> me the i hate her she is not part of the <UNK> story and neither is her page boy br br some of the script is peculiar when catherine is asking <UNK> about her mothers death she asks i suppose you saw the body how did it appear what a silly thing to say calm response is stupid too br br anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me
<START> this movie is a waste of time though it has actors who have the potential to do something decent the acting in the movie is sub par and has a cliché point you never know what's going to happen tomorrow so live your life to the <UNK> and do what makes you happy that sentence saves you from wasting hours of your life on this movie people who like this movie are the same people who would enjoy sitting for two hours before finding that the entire movie was a dream sequence if the most important part of the movie isn't even going to happen at least make it enjoyable to watch and captivating there's a reason this project didn't make a theatrical release and though <UNK> films can turn out very good this one does not even come close
<START> i've seen some bad things in my time a half dead cow trying to get out of <UNK> high mud a head on <UNK> between two cars a thousand <UNK> <UNK> on a kitchen floor human beings living like animals br br but never in my life have i seen anything as bad as the cat in the hat br br this film is worse than <UNK> worse than hitler worse than <UNK> the <UNK> worse than people who put <UNK> in <UNK> br br it is the most disturbing film of all time easy br br i used to think it was a joke some elaborate joke and that mike myers was maybe a high cocaine <UNK> drug <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who lost a bet or something br br i <UNK>
<START> having seen the movie years ago and been disappointed by its <UNK> potential when i heard that it was becoming a tv series i <UNK> refused to watch it my best friend became a <UNK> fan immediately and knowing my love for horror movies could not believe that i wouldn't watch a single episode i told him that the movie had <UNK> me for life as far as anything buffy was concerned and he told me to forget that the movie even existed he insisted that i give two episodes a shot once more with feeling and this one br br both of them are why i am a buffy fan today he was right i was hooked immediately i have never seen a show with the guts to dare try an episode that has next to no dialogue and nothing else could've pulled it off with the <UNK> and the pure creativity of buffy i think x files <UNK> gotten away with it if they'd thought of it first but i'm glad that buffy did it instead br br it is a credit to everyone involved that you are <UNK> for the entire hour sometimes hanging onto the edge of your seat and when it was all over i <UNK> to know more about every character so i went out and bought the season one <UNK> set and the rest is history br br i guarantee you that if you've never seen it either you'll want to see more if you make this episode your first br br the only reason i'm not giving it 10 out of 10 is because i'm <UNK> that score for once more
<START> it's hard to imagine in this day and age how popular and how much of an impact a norwegian immigrant and would be <UNK> had on the american public and how much of a national tragedy his sudden death in 1931 was viewed but was an extraordinary individual who both <UNK> and <UNK> college football and put a small obscure catholic college on the map br br i've heard clips of famous <UNK> talks and it is uncanny how pat o'brien got the voice and the <UNK> perfectly in what turned out to be his career role pat o'brien captures the integrity and fighting spirit that was is <UNK> by well by <UNK> page as bonnie stiles who complained about her home being a training camp for <UNK> dame but never threw anyone out of her house br br first impact on football was as a player with <UNK> dame not a coach one fine day in the second half of a losing football game against heavily <UNK> army and team mate gus played by owen davis used the forward pass as an offensive weapon before that football was simply a game where you just got bigger guys for your side and ran through the defense didn't <UNK> the forward pass but he <UNK> and football became a game of <UNK> as well as <UNK> after that br br knew how to work the media also those well <UNK> <UNK> talks of his were not just to inspire his players they were well <UNK> and it was in a lot due to him that college football became a major sport in that golden age of sports in the roaring <UNK> br br playing a small but key role is ronald reagan as george the first player <UNK> to achieve greatness reagan not only got a good performance but forever after a name that was handy in his subsequent political career that <UNK> scene which <UNK> was accurate became a <UNK> battle cry as many a <UNK> underdog went out to win one for the br br i still remember a widely distributed photograph in 1981 that was one of the first of recovering president ronald reagan at <UNK> <UNK> with his old friend pat o'brien reagan always credited o'brien and dick powell of all the warner brothers stars of the period as the ones who were the <UNK> and most <UNK> to a young player on the lot trying to make good br br <UNK> dame itself owes its <UNK> to it's quite possible that <UNK> dame would be an obscure small catholic college without the reputation that football brought to it br br though george and the later famous of the four <UNK> certainly had their place in the sun it was who had the reputation it's no accident that warner brothers was able to get <UNK> <UNK> glenn warner howard jones and william <UNK> and <UNK> with great <UNK> in their own right to appear in all american it was there way of <UNK> the guy who was number one in their profession br br i think more than football fans will enjoy all american though you might become one after seeing the film
<START> i don't mind some adult humor but this feature was just downright dirty the first 10 minutes consisted of <UNK> swearing at some guy taking pictures followed my even more <UNK> i don't know what happened between that time the the last 5 minutes because i walked out after seeing this i never looked at richard <UNK> the same way again and to think that he actually went on to host a <UNK> show br br if profanity and tasteless unfunny dirty jokes make you laugh then you'll probably enjoy this but if you're an old fashioned type then don't bother
<START> i love this film <UNK> portrayal as a k a shut up robert was so hilarious whenever he got hit during a fight scene you could hear him <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> robert a k a rabbit i love that <UNK> kapoor a k a crime master <UNK> <UNK> double role is so <UNK> hilarious for his portrayal as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> kapoor are out of this world my brother does a really good <UNK> of saying relax please relax i love the scene in which <UNK> khan puts a <UNK> in salman <UNK> <UNK> food which caused the <UNK> <UNK> movements forcing him to use the toilet <UNK> number of times
<START> i watched this movie with no idea what it was about beforehand i was intrigued for the first whole hour it was <UNK> up to be a great thriller a very talented cast and good dialogue then it all fell apart for me at the sight of the first vampire i couldn't believe my eyes a great thriller was <UNK> down the toilet the rest of the movie from that point was totally awful br br i gave it 4 stars for the brilliant beginning alone i think that's a little generous but i was entertained for a while i'm not a fan of vampire or zombie movies at all if you are then you may disagree with my opinion
<START> first off i hate sci fi stuff and although this movie got a little sci fi at times that's <UNK> because at least it focused on andre <UNK> in the last 3 andre seemed to have kind of been mentioned but the stories never really focused on him which made me mad what also makes me mad is the amount of <UNK> it got on the voting <UNK> give it a rest people if you saw this movie and liked it please vote for it please what i loved about this movie is that it went back to where it all started when andre first learned the secret to life i would recommend renting this if you have seen a puppet master movie before and liked it but not renting it if this is your first time viewing one from the <UNK> collection mainly because you might think all the puppet masters are as dull as this one
<START> john and his wife emily accompanied by their child edward venture from the comfortable <UNK> of <UNK> to the village where the husband spent some of his childhood there has been a death in the family and john must begin proceedings to take control of an old <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by the <UNK> and once inhabited by an old man who has apparently committed suicide br br <UNK> about the circumstances of the death john <UNK> himself from his family and from reality puts his own life in peril and puts on the clothes of the old man who is now dead br br the film now changes nothing is what it seems the people of his past appear in full gothic <UNK> glory his wife <UNK> about his mental state and his son disappears into the <UNK> br br john finds that the old man didn't commit suicide that his death is far more mysterious and strange in a spine chilling finale we learn that the events of the film actually never happened and that the entire narrative was imagined by the little boy edward who is struggling to come to terms with his parents' divorce proceedings br br modern love is a macabre piece of high art cinema a puzzling and perverse piece of <UNK> full of vague suggestion and <UNK> red herrings it is <UNK> and seemingly <UNK> with current indie <UNK> which both <UNK> its creators but also <UNK> it <UNK> br br but the weaknesses of this australian film are fully <UNK> by its sheer muscular cinematic vision its bloody minded and <UNK> <UNK> and its oddball euro horror the of script <UNK> and lack of slick dialogue <UNK> into <UNK> against a backdrop of noir and a lead performance that needs to be seen to be appreciated br br one of the most <UNK> weird australian films in years
<START> this movie reminds me of harry potter not the style but the marketing <UNK> there may be part 2 part three until one day the product life cycle of course on the condition that the part one has a commercial success so many things seems to be hidden and thus the story looks quite <UNK> the action design is boring set design is ok but not fine perhaps edison <UNK> would be a big star one day he really looks charming even on big screen the most impressive is still anthony wong 4 10 br br
<START> i viewed the original outer limits in real time when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in re runs and complete on dvd i find the new outer limits well more than just a remake of old <UNK> episodes as some of the more adolescent <UNK> have suggested br br with seven 7 years of programs versus just the two 2 years of the original series the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced cable tv series plots are intelligent <UNK> accurate <UNK> of the unknown possibilities of the sometimes frightening and <UNK> future br br while most producers and directors in hollywood <UNK> view sci fi as <UNK> from horror and fantasy this series returns to the origins of science fiction in the logical moral and philosophical <UNK> of current new <UNK> into their possibly <UNK> near term <UNK> this series does this very well and remains unique in its <UNK> of the shoot em up video game monster mentally of much of the current generation it has brains history a message and good entertainment it is an adult series without unbearable teenage know it all fantasies <UNK> br br now if we can only get mgm to release the entire new outer limits series on dvd instead of just the six poor <UNK> <UNK> and the 1st season now only available
<START> i really like ryan reynolds and hope davis and i actually had high hopes watching this last night on dvd mainly as i try to avoid reviews until i watch something myself and form my own opinion big mistake my 2 10 is for the first segment which in fairness is actually quite decent and if they had made the movie about the characters in section 1 alone it may have <UNK> above the 5 10 mark once it moved into tv <UNK> <UNK> territory it <UNK> to high heaven ryan reynolds captured the essence of an actor on the edge wonderfully but as a gay tv writer and famous games creator devoted family man he was definitely less effective from the <UNK> on the box i expected a flashback thriller along the lines of unfortunately this is nowhere near that standard of movie
<START> story about a widowed father claude <UNK> bringing up his four daughters emma <UNK> page is loved by big hunky ernest dick <UNK> <UNK> lola lane is <UNK> by an old but wealthy man kay <UNK> lane wants to become a singer ann <UNK> lane is a romantic drop dead handsome felix jeffrey <UNK> a business associate of their father comes to stay with them all the sisters fall in love with him then tough cynical mickey john garfield enters the picture br br very entertaining movie was a big hit and nominated for five academy awards it's beautifully directed by michael <UNK> has a pretty good if predictable script and a very attractive cast especially <UNK> also this was john <UNK> first film and made him a star this was so popular there were three or four sequels which i never saw this is an engrossing entertaining big budget soap opera well worth seeing
<START> i like a lot of myrna loy movies this film was produced before her character actor personality was developed it would be an okay short film but seems to go on forever in it's complete form br br myrna loy it seems is told what to do with her acting and does the job that is about all you can say about her br br her gypsy character is shoddy and the film has many flaws such as the jewelry shop scene br br this film will probably be interesting to myrna loy fans but even as such is something of a disappointment
<START> <UNK> the <UNK> are flying is a superb film winner of the golden palm at cannes film festival it has an excellent cinematography and performance by the only russian actor ever to win an award in cannes for a performance she plays <UNK> a teenager in love with her boyfriend happy and without <UNK> with plans of getting married her life will get upside down when world war ii strikes and her boyfriend <UNK> to the army the film depicts the effect of war on a teenager love and on the people that stayed and saw their loved ones go and fight waiting for a letter or other information it is a portrayal of lost innocence does a magnificent job and her character transformation will break your heart the camera movement is fast with a lot of close ups it is a dancing camera the first scene in the stairs is fantastic but it isn't the only one there is later a scene when <UNK> attempts committing suicide and another in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in movie history the bombing of house when she runs the stairs in the middle of fire to find her apartment completely destroyed simply great 10 out of 10
<START> just saw this at the madison horror film festival and was disappointed a few shocking funny moments the hollow carla a <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> and two competing interesting premises similar to new nightmare with belief bringing a mythical character to life and also lost highway with a man living out a fantasy in his head but had long stretches of no movement and incoherent plot development just because you use the <UNK> of dreams or a mental <UNK> state doesn't make it <UNK> you need the compelling visuals and creepy performances br br positive things dr <UNK> had real comic timing and all the girls were very cute <UNK> father and ingrid pitt looked like they were having some fun and tom <UNK> at least looked like he had his lines <UNK> and we couldn't see if he was just reading cue cards br br i get the hammer references but it looks like the director realized the script was a <UNK> and just added some shocks to try and get some laughs out of whatever footage he could put together but they don't work because they're too few and far between and create an inconsistent tone <UNK> this to 30 minutes of all the fun parts and you could have a surreal goofy short but at feature length skip it it's not so bad it's good it's just so bad it's boring
<START> ok i don't want to upset anyone who enjoyed this film but it was a really bad movie just the way the scenes were edited and the acting it made me cringe at some points i really tried to enjoy it but it was like a student film they must have had the smallest budget i really liked the story line to an extent and the characters were likable but the film on a whole was just awful also why is it that in almost every film with lesbian characters one of them has to either commit suicide or die or turn straight this is so sending a wrong and unrealistic message i gave it 3 stars and everything considered i think that was very kind of me only watch this film if you want to laugh at how bad it is
<START> a tough life gets <UNK> when the three children of a single mom are <UNK> to be sent to separate foster homes after her <UNK> passing br br to stay together the older boy plans a daring high risk escape to find a distant lost uncle their only remaining next of <UNK> br br their trek takes the three <UNK> <UNK> on a chase through the desert in a classic beetle <UNK> hungry desperate <UNK> by <UNK> and too young to drive hunted by the ever threatening civil authorities br br what the movie lacks in acting and plot realism it makes up for in the honest human need to be a part of a <UNK> and complete family even if that family is <UNK> together with spare parts of broken lives br br sure the ending is forced and too over dramatic for the critical movie goer but every heart beats the same cry for family <UNK> and <UNK> br br with all its weaknesses i still give this movie a strong recommendation
<START> the <UNK> is really quite charming and is rated far too low on imdb the songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the jungle book but they weren't bad at all the animation is really lovely the best sequence being the landscape of paris in general it looked beautiful this is probably disney's most relaxing animation i think and as another reviewer quite rightly said who doesn't love cats another great piece of animation was <UNK> looking into <UNK> eyes as their romance was so believable while not obvious a good thing the plot about a greedy butler and a fortune reminds me of <UNK> <UNK> was a little unoriginal but worked very well and the script was really funny especially the fights between the <UNK> they remind me of me and my brother and 3 sisters always fighting my favourite scene was the chase of edgar with the two dogs who were always fighting about who was the leader the voice talents were a delight most notably phil harris whom i <UNK> from the jungle book and eva <UNK> from the <UNK> the supporting characters namely <UNK> cat were also well done in conclusion a really pleasant film that is definitely underrated 8 5 10 <UNK> cox
<START> one of my favorite bum actors c tom <UNK> stars in this tepid remake of <UNK> he runs around a lot while a cgi generated spider like machine goes around killing everyone the budget for this one obviously was pretty low it also was one of the asylum productions have you seen any of those <UNK> i am not sure why anyone would have made this while the big budget spielberg version was <UNK> them at the box office and if truth be told neither version is all that hot the george pal version from the 1950s remains the best representation of the h g wells novel primitive special effects and all perhaps because gene barry was much more convincing in the lead than <UNK> or tom cruise
<START> et juliette is one of those french romantic comedies where they seem to break all the rules rather like belle pour <UNK> the gorgeous daniel <UNK> learns about true loyalty and love when his life threatens to crash around his ears the film isn't a preachy morality tale but a wonderful story that will keep you hooked until the last richard as juliette is a heroine that women will cheer her laughter is my <UNK> memory of this warm and witty film the down to earth way she has of including all her children by their different fathers particularly the <UNK> gives the film an edge that lifts it above your average romantic comedy but its always the french that seem to show us how <UNK> this all is
<START> no pun intended i'm not going to spoil anything about the story but it's safe to assume that you already know what kind of character the main actor portrays and of course being a priest while being naughty <UNK> all that plus this is the most erotic movie from park chan <UNK> yet br br if you have seen previous works movies you know he is very visual in a good way and it shows again here while it <UNK> away from the vengeance theme of his prior movies on the surface it still has quite some heat hidden underneath and when that <UNK> quite a few bad things start to happen but through all that dark there also moments of light fun to be had too a very <UNK> and though provoking movie that lives outside the mainstream and does a very good job
<START> one crazy summer is the funniest <UNK> not necessarily the best movie i have ever seen br br just when one crazy scene is done another emerges it never lets you rest just one thing after another the soundtrack is great the songs are the right ones for the scenes br br it is also a clean movie little that is dirty in it br br of course it has the story of the guys you wouldn't trust with your lunch money taking up a challenge and winning over people with more resources who'd want to see it if they failed there is a serious side in that parents and children do not live up to each <UNK> dreams one should always have an open mind and <UNK> all the <UNK> this applies both to parents and children in one crazy summer the parents are wrong this is not always the case
<START> <UNK> zone as this dvd was sold in oz is about the worst b grade junk i have seen apart from a restrained deadpan act from singer <UNK> he knew how bad the movie was going to be the other actors <UNK> about genuine attempts at line delivery <UNK> and <UNK> or absurd <UNK> of classic movies scenes <UNK> makes the most ham <UNK> portrayal of dying since jim <UNK> mask all of this with no real thread to suggest an attempt at a spoof by genre period or any common vein is plain annoying don't even try to join the <UNK> with the plot it is blade runner <UNK> disguised with no content actors or scenery due to a very limited budget you gets what you pay for is never more apparent there is repeatedly annoying re use of limited sets with no attention to set dressing and a <UNK> of special effects that would have hit the cutting room floor for dr who in 1976 the helicopter explosion is worth a <UNK> to demonstrate my point of course there are <UNK> that will lap up this tripe but if you are watching this movie for a bet make sure you get more than your pay rate at 2 this dvd will make a cheap and interesting beer coaster
<START> imdb forces reviewers to type a certain amount of lines but all i really want to say is this is an incredible film and you can't consider yourself a film fan without having seen it you ought to just trust me on this one and stop reading this review and get the movie and push play but i have to type something so let me point out the following br br 1 <UNK> edge contains what still may well rank as <UNK> <UNK> all time funniest and best performance in a film and if you have been following <UNK> glover at all you know that that alone <UNK> giving it a 10 funny lines <UNK> br br 2 <UNK> edge contains the second most memorable performance of dennis <UNK> career other than the one in blue <UNK> and it is really excellent dennis hopper is really funny br br 3 <UNK> edge contains the best performance of keanu <UNK> career and it is excellent it was the role he was born to play he has plenty of good lines but one in particular is really really funny listen close when his character and the step dad are talking to one another br br still the best <UNK> film it is much more than just that it tends to show up in the drama sections of film rental stores but if this is a drama it's the funniest drama of all time
<START> basically this was obviously designed to be <UNK> material for the movie produced by the same horrible director which happens to be even worse than this documentary and absolutely the worst movie i've ever seen so avoid it at all costs br br as for this documentary it's entertaining entertaining and blatantly misleading most of the historical looking footage is most likely just that historical footage from completely unrelated events that were sadly cut and <UNK> into this documentary to make it more dramatic than it would have ever been otherwise there's no doubt that <UNK> is a pretty interesting place with plenty of it's own fascinating history but <UNK> a documentary to market the locale and the related production is for lack of better words <UNK> useless br br and yes i've lived in kentucky my whole life and i have visited the location numerous times <UNK> hills deserves respect and there's nothing <UNK> about this lame documentary
<START> the <UNK> stars carol <UNK> of the e that usually appeared at the end of her first name lombard as a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert <UNK> <UNK> drew who has since become a down and out alcoholic and torn between her love for him and the interest of new york crime <UNK> robert armstrong top billed it's virtually a <UNK> of what was wrong with the earliest <UNK> stiff direction <UNK> cameras <UNK> acting and ridiculously slow paced delivery of lines at the time the sound <UNK> were telling the directors to have their actors speak every line s l o w l y and not to start speaking their own line until after the previous actor had finished theirs done about five years later this could have been an interesting movie but director howard <UNK> <UNK> follows his sound <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the talents we know lombard and armstrong had from watching their later movies the <UNK> was made in <UNK> a year that despite the transition problems from silent to sound nonetheless gave us some legitimate masterpieces  <UNK> <UNK> applause <UNK> <UNK> heroes <UNK> ladies of <UNK>  all from directors with strong enough <UNK> to tell the <UNK> to get stuffed and let their actors talk and act too bad howard <UNK> wasn't that strong as it is watching a naturally rapid paced actor like armstrong <UNK> through the part in the ridiculous way he's been told to speak one can't help but wonder where that 50 foot gorilla is when armstrong needs him
<START> they do each sequel is worst you who think that <UNK> 2 or 3 need a 1 please watch this sequel you'll be wondering with the first three parts then you'll give a 10 to the first 8 to the second and 5 or 6 to the other that's because <UNK> 4 really gets the big 1 from me it does
<START> do not miss this picture that defies ages with no <UNK> a masterpiece not only the script and the music but also casting br br cut everything contributes to the perfect achievement now nearly 25 years ago and still amazing of maturity art and br br sensitivity available now in dvd do not miss either the is perfect br br and the sound re <UNK> one mystery remains about this superb work why the actors did br br not succeed better after this flashing start
<START> i know this movie isn't for everyone and i won't push my opinions on you but what i have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie it was the best i have ever seen it was funny and even though it wasn't the scariest movie i had ever seen it kept me on the edge of my seat because i didn't know what was gonna happen next if you like funny scary movies you have got to see this one
<START> this lame harold lloyd sound film has <UNK> a laugh in it and makes one wonder if this lloyd is even the same one that made all of those delightful and hilarious <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> becomes <UNK> and limp when we can hear him talk and a <UNK> restrained pace <UNK> the zany antics of his <UNK> lloyd plays a young son of a <UNK> who grows up in china and then finds himself <UNK> to contemporary new york city without a clue as to how life outside his chinese village works he finds himself an unlikely victor in a <UNK> election and quickly draws the <UNK> of all the government <UNK> because he refuses to look the other way in the face of rampant corruption when he's framed in an attempt to bring him down he decides to play just as dirty as everyone else and stages a fake execution of every crook in nyc as a scare <UNK> this darkly <UNK> ending feels out of place next to everything else in the movie but it's the only part of the film that comes remotely to life everything else is a dull bore br br i don't like having to admit that a harold lloyd movie fails because i like him so much but i don't have a choice with this one br br grade d
<START> movies seem to fall into two categories films that <UNK> existing societal values and beliefs and those that challenge them this film is a <UNK> degree shift from the idealistic <UNK> portrayed in offerings like the longest day and the green <UNK> which seem more like disney fantasies by comparison the apocalypse now project the production and resulting film is heart of darkness updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post <UNK> variety the cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve this is the plight of joseph <UNK> original character <UNK> who came into literary being in <UNK> and subsequently <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> the hollow men <UNK> he dead of <UNK> although neither a straight telling of <UNK> heart of darkness <UNK> nor a first hand account of the vietnam experience apocalypse now stands as a masterpiece which pushed on the <UNK> of cinematic potential apocalypse is not just about the horrors of war per se like platoon and the deer hunter but the darker sensibilities of human nature as revealed through the raw and <UNK> <UNK> of violent conflict on a mass scale apocalypse now is not so much seen as experienced br br the bulk of the movie is the journey of a trained secret assassin captain benjamin <UNK> martin sheen in a tour de force performance aboard a us military boat <UNK> an <UNK> river into the heart of vietnam and cambodia where few <UNK> would ever <UNK> his mission is to <UNK> colonel <UNK> marlon brando a career army special forces division officer who was the darling of the us military until he went <UNK> and <UNK> in the deep <UNK> <UNK> between vietnam and cambodia the official classified report is that the colonel has gone insane but as events play out something else has happened to him that is far more terrifying than simply insanity <UNK> mission is to <UNK> the colonel with the american public none the <UNK> br br the movie is rather episodic the journey along the river is made up of several vignettes as sheen and his crew meet different self contained aspects of the war at the ground level american audiences of the 1970's had probably never seen this kind of film making before with the possible exception of the deer hunter which was released in the previous year the first and one of the most notable is an helicopter <UNK> led by <UNK> robert duvall in an oscar nominated performance who is a cross between general robert e lee and richard wagner he loves to play ride of the <UNK> from <UNK> the ring when he <UNK> helpless <UNK> his line i love the smell of <UNK> in the morning is one of those <UNK> <UNK> lines from the <UNK> of cinema other encounters include an where <UNK> <UNK> will be entertained by the likes of hugh and playboy <UNK> br br despite all the production <UNK> that <UNK> getting this footage into the can the remarkable aspect of this film is its pacing the original release not the later <UNK> version does a fine of job of building until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climactic confrontation between <UNK> and <UNK> the strange <UNK> between <UNK> and <UNK> is worth the price of admission alone and some of the shots of both sheen and brando in certain places are some of the <UNK> and terrifying images ever produced on film not even the likes of clive barker wes craven or david <UNK> have anything on coppola in terms of horrific imagery <UNK> <UNK> in one scene in particular is so utterly terrifying it makes most other horror movies seem tame by comparison which comes from the recognition that the horror is not from without but from within br br without giving too much away <UNK> solution to the climactic moment stands as one of the most innovative of cinematic revelations according to the documentary hearts of darkness coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would <UNK> into melodrama and the atmosphere of the movie's darker <UNK> would be <UNK> he wasn't sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the <UNK> sacrifice of an <UNK> as <UNK> by the native people with whom coppola was using as extras in the scenes with <UNK> at his village after the viewing coppola had his ending and it is one of the most simultaneously disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of american film making love it or hate it no western viewer will be the same after seeing this scene br br this film is not for all tastes just as <UNK> original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on <UNK> it's not just the violence and the <UNK> of violence that are difficult for most american viewers to <UNK> it's the naked <UNK> of aspects of the human condition that seem so removed from suburban american life that make this film difficult for the average movie goer to handle which is as it should be coppola did not make a family picture however if the viewer can understand its larger point there is a lot to be gotten out of apocalypse now if you're looking for a film experience to <UNK> pre existing attitudes about american sensibility and <UNK> better stick with john wayne but if you're willing to be taken into places you've never been even beyond the <UNK> of war <UNK> apocalypse now will take you into a world you thought you'd never visited before and the disturbing part of it is that you may recognize it
<START> very rarely it happens that i sit down to write a comment for a movie but this movie oh my holy god never ever was there a hindi movie better than this and never ever there came a movie better than this it's the king of all comedies br br <UNK> khan is arguably the best comic actor in indian film industry though its funny to say that because he is a class act not a comedian but what he has done in this film is perhaps the most hilarious performance by any indian actor in an out and out comedy br br salman khan has never been a good actor in my eyes but this movie got the best out of him he was <UNK> comic if ever there was a term like it just what the doctor ordered as far as his role in the movie was concerned br br <UNK> <UNK> i don't know why never tried his hand at comedy again he directed great <UNK> like the legend of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> but could not recreate the magic of br br i don't care why this film bombed at the box office though i feel sad that a film like hum <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was the reason for it's failure as of now i hope the rumors become true <UNK> be 2 they say we as the audience can only say <UNK>
<START> good to see i'm not the only person who remembers this great film i have very fond memories of this movie seem to vaguely remember back to when i was about 8 and i'd watch the kids tv shows after school <UNK> <UNK> anyone this was the first and last film to scare me and the images of the boy surrounded by <UNK> on a hill will stay with me forever like most films of this era it has a happy ending aimed at children but with a definite ability to capture an adults attention the lovely <UNK> scenery really sets the film up to feel isolated and the ghostly scenes are simple but very very effective i'd love to try and find this movie again see if it still hits home
<START> oh how the critics fell all over themselves to praise their paul <UNK> author of taxi driver when this movie came out i never saw the qualities they were <UNK> when i watched this movie back in the day so i re viewed it to see if i got it wrong <UNK> is extremely uninteresting this is a <UNK> <UNK> movie about an author living working in a <UNK> culture the flat <UNK> don't hold your attention because they are emotionally <UNK> and <UNK> and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the <UNK> they <UNK> themselves to about <UNK> the admiration of swords etc br br it must be a triumph when you learn you've landed philip glass but then you have to get something out of him glasses score offers not a <UNK> of distinction from his other work nor does it provide the film any <UNK> value in <UNK> it should be clear to anyone that <UNK> <UNK> his career on work of no impact or importance cat people <UNK> light sleeper patty <UNK> american <UNK> he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie <UNK> than anyone else <UNK> has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films
<START> the cinematography is the film's shining feature park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera every shot is filled with vibrant colors that leap off of the screen every frame of the film seems to tell a story all on its own i hope there's a <UNK> ray release of this film because it will look fantastic it's rather intriguing to see which elements of the vampire mythology park used for his vision sang has to drink blood to survive and to stay looking flawless has incredible strength and is vulnerable to <UNK> he doesn't however have <UNK> and also has a reflection in the mirror br br although i've never seen the film i couldn't help but feel like this was chan <UNK> <UNK> version of twilight the entire middle portion of the film is devoted to sang and <UNK> love for one another it felt like the adult version of twilight really there's a lot of blood nudity sex and even a few <UNK> thrown in for good measure maybe it's the chan <UNK> park <UNK> in me but i honestly feel like i can guarantee that this is the better film of the two the psychological aspect that i love about <UNK> previous films is in <UNK> as well that's a major factor for me as any film that causes me to think or is unusual in any way winds up becoming a fan favorite the <UNK> to <UNK> films always seem to fit its respective film like a <UNK> <UNK> is no exception while the soundtrack is a bit more subtle this time around it fit the overall atmosphere of the film rather effortlessly br br the middle portion of the film did seem to drag on longer than everything else in the film it's weird though as the scenes during that time are crucial to the storyline of the film and it's hard to imagine <UNK> being the same film if any of those scenes were cut nevertheless it is my one <UNK> of the film br br chan <UNK> park bites into the vampire mythology with <UNK> and puts his own dark psychological twist on it <UNK> films always seem to have a specific formula or include most of the following great writing beautiful cinematography a solid cast some sort of psychological twist that'll mess with your head and a memorable ending <UNK> delivers on all <UNK> and will hopefully get more of the attention it deserved during its theatrical run on dvd and eventually <UNK> ray hopefully
<START> i think together all the reviewers have captured this film really well i have seen it many many times but i still feel a sense of joy and warmth just as i did the first time my emotional response to this film never seems to fade the final scene certainly brings me to tears but so does the scene between <UNK> and the children on his birthday and as for the kindly gentleman something else is going on with that character the generous <UNK> and <UNK> of problems he knows everything about everything and has connections everywhere a perfect father to run to and make us feel safe i do not know how the film does it but it touches something very english deep inside which has long gone from our daily experience but yet we all instantly <UNK> and <UNK> for again
<START> this is a movie that has all the basic elements of its genre it makes you wanna cry it makes you laugh it disgust you it makes you angry etc br br the topic of the story is fortunately not about some disease or drugs what is the common trend in gay themed movies in these days but it focuses on the social interactions between characters what could be considered not to be in the high school elite the play and the direction could be a little bit more sophisticated but on the other hand it's somehow better so because it really shows the distress of the characters that they are experiencing if this was intended then this is a remarkable job and <UNK> an achievement specially for such an young director br br it's actually a good story that gives you a little inside into how it is to be a fat girl and to acknowledge it to yourself
<START> i got a few laughs out of this one more than a lot of other so called comedies the big ship was a <UNK> and getting to see a lot of it's scenery was fun as was getting to see some of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this wasn't the height of <UNK> and career but it wasn't a total dog as some suggest

<START> out to sea is a fun movie starring that wonderful duo of jack lemmon and walter matthau this film is not quite as funny as their grumpy old men comedies which it strongly resembles but there are many laughs throughout lemmon and matthau play a couple of in laws who take a cruise together once they get on the boat the thing lemmon doesn't know is that matthau has signed them on as dance <UNK> so they don't have to pay for the cruise this <UNK> lemmon who's in no mood to dance what's worse matthau doesn't even know how to dance nevertheless they go along with it and it the process they meet some of their fellow passengers and crew members here are the crew members there's the cruise director <UNK> played to the <UNK> by star trek the next generation veteran brent <UNK> who acts like an evil dictator there's two fellow dance <UNK> played by barney miller star hal <UNK> and veteran movie musical star donald <UNK> there's the <UNK> owner mrs <UNK> played by golden girl <UNK> as for the passengers there's vivian a widow played by gloria de <UNK> who falls in love with lemmon there's liz played by one of my all time favorite actresses <UNK> cannon who falls in love with matthau there's <UNK> <UNK> mother played by veteran stage actress <UNK> and they meet others as well all these actors are a pleasure to watch as lemmon and matthau play off of them it's great to see cannon here <UNK> beautiful as ever is a hoot <UNK> is a funny comic villain who's plays it deadly straight de <UNK> is wonderful <UNK> <UNK> and have a good moment or two and finally the two main stars lemmon and matthau are fine as usual a nice little gem of a comedy br br out of four
<START> remarkably well done but under recognized because of limited distribution has big studio feel understands the horror genre <UNK> along with clever plot twists and never stumbles could have been a college cult classic if it had ever gotten the opportunity
<START> really don't care that no one on here likes this movie i do and that's what this review is about lou diamond phillips is great in this comedic role that line about train a b and c is now to me an instant classic the cg is great yeah train looks a little fake but the aliens wow do they ever rock todd bridges where's arnold and mr <UNK> wow he's been out of the loop guess that's what jail does to you a bullet train is on it's way to las vegas with the senator for him to deliver a big speech a meteor has just hit and now all of a sudden we got aliens running loose aboard the train and our hero cop has to save the day to make matters worse his ex wife is on board arguing with him i just thought this movie was so wonderful a must see if you like action
<START> i have one word focus br br well br br imdb wants me to use at least ten lines of text okay let's discuss the fine points of focus i don't know about the rest of you but in my first year of film school they taught us a lot of useless crap like all be famous avant garde filmmakers but they also taught us how to do this crazy thing called focusing the lens it was amazing you give a little twist and <UNK> everything is clear as a bell the person who shot what alice found needs to learn a few things about the <UNK> points of focus lighting too this movie is not only completely out of focus it's also lit like the corner of someone's basement br br don't even get me started on pacing or plot they could have <UNK> about ten seconds off the beginning and end of every single shot br br but who cares about that anyhow there is not enough lurid in this movie to make up for the utter lack of regard to film's best friends focus and lighting br br words to the wise
<START> <UNK> panic from broadway to <UNK> <UNK> the giant claw boasts perhaps the ultimate flying monster in movie history described by one terrified <UNK> witness as la  she's de devil in de storm with de face of de wolf and de body of de woman with wings bigger than i can tell it doesn't say much for canadian women since when we finally see it in focus it's a cross between an <UNK> <UNK> a and <UNK> the great but this isn't just any old giant turkey  <UNK> to rockets invisible to radar and with a taste for <UNK> <UNK> whole and <UNK> away at the united nations building it's an <UNK> giant turkey from an anti matter galaxy millions of miles from earth that's come here to build a nest no other explanation is possible luckily for humanity jeff <UNK> test pilot and chief cook and bottle <UNK> in a one man society <UNK> a weapon to <UNK> its <UNK> shield so they can hit it with everything but the kitchen sink  but don't worry morris general <UNK> him we've got kitchen sinks to spare son  just in time for a last minute <UNK> with co star <UNK> some of the dialogue has dated rather unfortunately  i admire your <UNK> and you keep climbing on our backs whenever we've messed up  and strangely enough it's nowhere near as much fun as a film with a giant flying turkey should be but the beast itself is such a truly memorable creation for all the wrong reasons that it's hard to dislike even if you are liking it for all the wrong reasons and full marks to the cast for delivering gem after gem of with a straight face honest to pete i'll never call my mother in law an old crow again the only trouble is that the last time i talked to a <UNK> there wasn't any <UNK> line to the one and only place where we can get the kind of help we need and the immortal there it is now attacking the united nations building
<START> a very un tom and jerry short jerry <UNK> this tale that revolves around tom the cat falling in love and losing her to his rival butch tom is best friends with jerry here which <UNK> me a bit the cartoon is also presented in <UNK> overall i found this tom and jerry cartoon sad and depressing the should have just put <UNK> gets the boot on the dvd instead and i would've been happy this experimental animated short can be found on disc 2 of warner brother's 2 dvd spotlight collection set it's the last one on the set and i'm hoping that warner brothers chooses to release a second volume soon br br my grade c
<START> this existential thriller in portuguese with english subtitles is a modern version of the american <UNK> of the 40s complete with a surprise twist at the end it is riveting from beginning to end my only criticism is its poor production values the film looks cheaply made and it probably was so the black and white cinematography is vastly inferior to that of godard in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> another film noir of more than 30 years earlier most <UNK> of all the subtitles are often hard to read when will filmmakers learn and provide yellow subtitles so that they can be read against a white background i'd give this an 8 overall although with better production values it could have been higher
<START> star rating the works just misses the mark that little bit in between <UNK> behind the <UNK> br br based on another of stephen king's lengthy <UNK> this takes place in the sleepy little new england town of castle rock also the name of the film's production company where a new <UNK> store the titular <UNK> things has opened the owner and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> max von <UNK> hides you might say a <UNK> secret there's an item in his store that everyone in the little town wants a small cash price <UNK> is first required before a far more sinister price is asked for as suspicion hate and madness tear the town apart it falls to police chief alan <UNK> ed harris to <UNK> order and save the town from a terrifying end br br i read the novel of <UNK> things earlier this year and was eager to watch the movie adaptation again to compare them like that was going to be any contest but it had been deleted on video and dvd and i couldn't find anywhere to rent it from so i was happy when i finally found it in a flea market whilst on a shopping trip br br it's one of the <UNK> <UNK> that king novels are generally the best to read but when they get adapted to screen nine times out of ten they are complete junk as is the case here the material that makes his books great simply doesn't translate into a movie script very well for some reason and i suppose there's always the question why bother watching this when i could be reading the book again instead br br i appreciate that some are simply too lengthy i e it the stand to be made into a complete screen work with all the situations and characters included but there's no reason this one couldn't have included all the material from the book as a result a lot of key characters from the book i e ace <UNK> are not included at all and we have some terrible character development that means we don't care about the characters that are involved since they are so stripped of depth and motivation for example we have one character from the book keaton who murders his wife toward the end yet we were shown no build up to hint at any reason that he didn't get along with or hated her and so it has no impact when it happens unlike in the book where there was a lot of depth invested and it really involved you to find out what happened to the characters involved all the material in the script to fill in the cracks if you like is really stupid and corny and the typically goofy stuff that gets included in king adaptations like this br br most of the film's problems are that it <UNK> so far away from the book but there's also some terrible acting from a cast that obviously can't feel for the <UNK> material they're being asked to perform in the 90s a lot of king's work started skipping the cinema and just being made into made for tv video territory rubbish like this must surely hint at why
<START> is it just me or have all horror movies become nothing more than <UNK> slapstick and an over the top villain who cannot be killed this movie had no point whatever happened to the days of a person being able to escape from the killer as in hostel and at least make the killer a little more realistic victor <UNK> was the worst killer i have ever seen he reminded me of a demon <UNK> between <UNK> and <UNK> it was over the top that while victor was lying there on fire no one thought to finish the job and the ending was the biggest disappointment of all reminiscent of the <UNK> finale i had to agree with the <UNK> behind me when he <UNK> what the f if i could give the movie a negative score i would have taken care of it
<START> stay far away from this film the fact that you're reading reviews tells me you may have already been <UNK> by the awfulness it <UNK> this is a <UNK> horrid movie so let's get down to the problems writing and direction it <UNK> surprise me if these were handled by a group of <UNK> that watched <UNK> and 'i know what you did last a few too many times giant <UNK> plot holes abound while i can't <UNK> them for this movie its nice knowing they're finally <UNK> trained actors or lack thereof only the finest for this film the finest extras ever to grace a screen now starring in their speaking role debut as a <UNK> i have to note that i am capable of watching and enjoying just about anything i recognize a good movie when i see it but i can still giggle and <UNK> during bubble boy yes folks its true so when i say to avoid something you know i'm not kidding
<START> <UNK> fitzgerald ryan <UNK> is sent to jail for the murder of an <UNK> kid when <UNK> with the question <UNK> ' he doesn't have an answer while in jail he meets pearl don cheadle his teacher who decides to take matters into his own hands and helps <UNK> figure out why he did it throughout this film we learn all about troubled life including his ex girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> malone his famous father albert kevin spacey and his whole sad life br br this film is matthew ryan second movie and it is spectacular in nearly <UNK> this is one movie which will leave you thinking in the end and wondering about how it all works the movie is quite dark but if you can handle that then you will realize just how good a film it is br br in this movie there is no bad guy there is no one you can blame for anything that happens there's no stereotyping and the audience does not try to prove <UNK> guilty instead we sit back relax and watch this boy's life unfold throughout the of the movie all the problems depicted in the story are very real drug addiction <UNK> expectations overwhelming sadness they all exist in our world br br ryan <UNK> gives one of the greatest performances of his career in this movie as the depressed teenager <UNK> his father lives in europe and doesn't really care much about his son the only person he loves is <UNK> but she has problems of her own he knows exactly what he did but as he says in the film <UNK> want a why but maybe there isn't one maybe this is something that just happened ' there is a why but we don't find out about it until the end as you watch the movie the audience finds themselves amazed that such a young person could know so much about the world <UNK> notices things that people tend to ignore br br a particular thought provoking scene which really affected me was during one of conversations with pearl pearl just cheated on his wife and when <UNK> asks why pearl replies that he's only human then <UNK> says something which never really occurs to anyone why do people only say that when they've done something wrong br br another fantastic acting job was provided by chris <UNK> in the film he plays allen harris the boyfriend of <UNK> sister julie michelle williams although he is not one of the main characters i found myself amazed at how deep his character was you can relate to allen a lot you know how much he cares for the <UNK> family it's as if they were his own flesh and blood by the end of the movie you realize just how far he would go to help them br br overall this movie is a masterpiece which has been overlooked by quite a few people if however you take the time to watch it you will most likely see that everything i've mentioned above is true and once you're finished watching it you'll never look at the world the same way again br br 9 5 10
<START> i have always loved brenda <UNK> and <UNK> betty was no disappointment i saw it on satellite on dreary sunday morning life has been <UNK> and this movie made me laugh and see things we usually consider dire in a way i wish she would make more movies like this and saving grace brenda <UNK> is a great gal for us approaching 60 to see in action she is cute beautiful and full of life without appearing plastic and phony not many actresses are out there for us to relate to in a realistic yet comical and or serious way brenda if you see this keep going with gems like this we need more mrs and <UNK>
<START> i did have some expectations from this film because 1 it was a <UNK> raj production 2 when the songs were first shown on tv they seemed catchy 3 the star cast was new well i must tell u that i just couldn't sit through this movie with his red lips what were the make up artists thinking tries hard to look cool but fails miserably i won't even get started on his acting if u can call it that <UNK> with all her screaming and <UNK> n raving just makes you want to pull your hair out in frustration i think was slightly more tolerable than her she seriously needs to take acting lessons from her sister the story is pathetic the same old tried and tested formula absolutely no originality there is nothing worth watching in this movie makes me wonder why it was made in the first place
<START> if you like the 80's rock you should definitely see this movie i've only seen it recently and completely fell in love with it br br overall the movie is very entertaining provides you with a great load of rock tunes and not a single second of the movie do i find boring it was a great idea that some of the real life musicians were in this doing what they do best i was happy to see as well as <UNK> they all delivered solid performances i tend to agree with a lot of people saying that the first half of the movie was much better than the second one specially in the terms of the script that could have been worked on a bit better but not a major <UNK> one thing that did bother me a bit was jennifer <UNK> performance i thought she wasn't the right person for this role i just couldn't see her as a rock star girlfriend but as the movie goes on you somehow realize that she did a good job with this there is a certain amount of honesty and sincerity she delivers that just doesn't live you cold br br to <UNK> a good and a funny movie that doesn't go deep into characters but provides you with a good fun a sense of nostalgia and of course the mighty <UNK> by jeff scott <UNK> and mike
<START> i enjoyed the movie very much everything in the italian job is simple an explosive guy a safe cracker a computer genius a wheel man and a man with a spectacular plan of stealing 35 million without using a gun this film is entertaining although it has no central idea it is a non stop movie with lots of actions all the stunt work is gorgeous from the <UNK> chase in <UNK> at the beginning to the chase on the busy roads in los angeles involving three mini <UNK> and even a helicopter the best <UNK> chase i have ever seen i like the mini <UNK> the expert thieves used mini <UNK> for the <UNK> cars the chase between the mini <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> is amazing they chased underground i can say there was not a moment i was bored mark <UNK> charlie <UNK> <UNK> stella donald sutherland john jason <UNK> handsome rob seth green <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> left ear and <UNK> norton steve really did a good job i like the actors in this film i have seen a lot of heist movie but the italian job is one of my favourites a great hollywood action movie without a drop of blood after all i do love this kind of movie
<START> the <UNK> nothing to do with the mel gibson film of the same name came out steven seagal was still doing that <UNK> the thing in his movies which is fine but it doesn't make for good action br br when the plot of this film finally kicked in i saw the twist coming a mile off <UNK> anti <UNK> care for mother nature stance is not very subtle for a film that was originally going to debut in the cinemas it is shot very much like a tv movie despite some wonderful shots of the country by dean the photographer of dances with wolves br br steven seagal does like 1 fight scene in the entire film and it's totally boring as an action film it fails as a drama it stinks as an <UNK> message it's obvious avoid like <UNK> crossed with plague
<START> beyond the clouds is a <UNK> beautiful <UNK> work of art the overall <UNK> of the light that this movie is <UNK> in makes you want to touch the screen the <UNK> mood <UNK> up could only been achieved by a director who has seen many <UNK> of experience or to put it another way an old man i know of no other movie that captures and uses the <UNK> of light and <UNK> mood with such ravishing quality as beyond the clouds nearly all the people in this film are beautiful unless your idea of a beautiful woman is a blond bimbo that is the dialogue doesn't really matter too much not that there is much of it anyway and as for <UNK> forget it some films exist just as visual experiences this is one of them don't bother if you want simple entertainment this not for you br br i could about the visual perfection of this movie for days but i won't if you are at all interested in cinematography photography film direction etc watch this film
<START> me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a friday night before going to the pub it was the only programme that ever made us miss opening time it is one of the best comedies i have ever watched if not the best david jason was brilliant and was compared many times to buster keaton with his clever stunts that were pulled off so <UNK> i wish i could get hold of the series on dvd to watch again he had an amazing ability to make stupid things look believable and this series shows how much talent he has in so many different directions he is an accomplished trip and fall guy and i remember watching a trailer once where he showed people how to do this <UNK> certainly he is the one to teach people this art he only showed glimpses of it in other programs he did <UNK> this program shows how multi talented he is i am lost as to why david jason another series being made as for my mind it was one of the best things he has ever done and i've been a fan of his since he did this series it is said he did not like it because it showed the <UNK> of his early career well to my mind that might possibly have been the right decision when he took it but now his career has progressed so far i believe this would be a good time for him to do another series showing him looking back on his secret life full of <UNK> that he does not see rod
<START> what was he thinking how sad an actor as tremendously talented as michael <UNK> who stole our hearts in mighty <UNK> and fascinated us in ill town has sunk to this pathetic level the writing on this sitcom is the <UNK> left on the bottom of the barrel after it has been <UNK> shame on all involved there is a trend major movie actors that are no longer hot <UNK> are turning to tv often with disastrous results reference the on cbs and nbc however abc has a hit with boston legal hip writing and great nostalgic use of bill shatner to waste michael <UNK> in this all in the family rip off is an insult to viewers and mostly michael himself
<START> two things are changed from then first of all i am not a kid anymore and second most of new seagal movies are just terrible this is on my opinion the worst movie ever made with <UNK> starred by jean claude van damme there is no plot in this movie the plot is just an excuse to shoot some terrible action scenes which are painful to watch i love action movies but this is not an action movie this isn't a movie this is a group of irritating scenes which are connected in annoying way to kill the viewers love for the action movies i am sorry but i don't have any respect for anyone who liked this movie he has a serious intelligence problem then i hope that seagal will make some new good movies in the future good luck for him
<START> dick and jane <UNK> jim carrey <UNK> <UNK> wind up on the <UNK> line when the corporation dick works for is caught in a corruption scandal and after desperately and <UNK> trying to find jobs the duo turns to crime in order to get them out of poverty br br i've always been a fan of jim carrey it's been awhile since he has made a straight up comedy the last one was bruce almighty which was pretty good he has proved that he can do serious dramas but comedy is his real element fun with dick and jane proves that he still has it even though the film was funny it was still kind of disappointing it wasn't as funny as i thought it would be it's worth watching once though unlike most of <UNK> movies it doesn't have a good repeat value part of the problem is the script i was surprised the script was weak since this is the same guy that made the forty year old virgin some of the jokes just fall flat and other times they seem to be trying too hard if jim carrey wasn't in it than the film would have been a lot worse br br next to jim carrey is <UNK> <UNK> she's an okay actress but she just isn't very funny she doesn't match up well with carrey and she seemed to be <UNK> in her performance they should have gone with someone else the supporting cast includes alec baldwin richard <UNK> and aaron michael <UNK> the latter plays billy <UNK> and he actually gives a decent performance he wasn't as annoying as most child stars are alec baldwin was okay and richard <UNK> tried too hard to be funny to be honest i'm a little bias here the film altogether was pretty average but i liked it more because of jim <UNK> performance fans of jim carrey should enjoy it but that's about it in the end fun with dick and jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes but its not very memorable rating 6 10
<START> get <UNK> out of sight jackie brown and even <UNK> pick up folks were finally getting <UNK> leonard right making good movies out of his work so despite my <UNK> <UNK> about how bad this movie would be i couldn't resist renting it i thought how bad can it be <UNK> what a mistake especially right on the heels of reading the book which was lame and too self <UNK> too relative to the rest of <UNK> <UNK> books still the book was better than the movie leonard again <UNK> the weak and <UNK> screen writers who try to take over his book the dialogue written for steven tyler was painful to watch and the lyrics to the character linda <UNK> first song my middle <UNK> write with more depth sad sad sad why even give it a star because harvey keitel and uma thurman are still fun to see on screen and andre 3000 didn't make a complete fool of himself
<START> this story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty one years as a boy i enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness books like call of the wild white <UNK> the <UNK> and my side of the mountain influenced me tremendously i wanted so much to live like a mountain man but nothing inspired me more to do so than when i saw this movie on television in 1975 i wanted to be just like <UNK> however as i got older i found i was just too <UNK> to live like that nonetheless i still <UNK> about living that kind of life i agree with some other reviews of this movie that the storyline has the simplicity that is quite prevalent in type movies but if you can look past the <UNK> in which it was made and see the heart of the story the true themes then i think you find yourself pleasantly touched i make it a point to watch this movie once a year after thirty one years i still get a chill running through me when i see <UNK> of snow <UNK> down the <UNK> and hear the <UNK> haunting laugh of the <UNK> br br good luck old <UNK> and stay free br br ps if you want to read more about the true story i found this link on the mad <UNK> of rat river br br http www com <UNK>
<START> every movie quentin tarantino has made has become <UNK> worse i'd like to believe that most people would agree with that statement but seeing as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has an 8 5 10 from over 100 000 ratings it doesn't seem like the general movie going public has any sense even his best work <UNK> dogs wasn't a <UNK> ' the trouble is that claiming that you like <UNK> work has become trendy as soon as that happens you get <UNK> of people ready and willing to hop on another <UNK> they will ignore laughably terrible acting and utterly self indulgent writing just so they can be part of the <UNK> club called everyone this movie is so terrible that i swear it must be some sort of twisted joke by tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and still praise him like another reviewer has already said previous tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies this one is from a guy in love with his own writing i couldn't agree more this movie is nothing more than self indulgent and in joke <UNK> writing paired with acting ability taken right out of a high school play but thanks to the general movie going public i'm sure it will still go down as one of the best movies ever made bravo tarantino you've pulled off one of the best practical jokes of all time
<START> this movie is watchable but nothing special four girls on a road trip to vegas <UNK> decide to pick up a <UNK> because he is cute they all end up staying the night at a motel in the middle of nowhere and the <UNK> psychotic issues with women become apparent br br the characters are clichés there is a married responsible woman a <UNK> party girl an unsure bride to be and a man <UNK> who just got dumped the <UNK> is genuinely nice until he goes crazy br br there's not nearly enough gore and way too much rape i enjoy slasher horror thrillers a lot and this one did nothing for me the ending was just as lame as the rest of the movie br br on the positive side the actors did a great job with that they had to work with the dialogue isn't awful and overall i was impressed with the cast having never seen or heard of any of them before and the plot wasn't out of the realm of possibility although i really doubt any woman in this day and age would pick up a <UNK> no matter how attractive he is so i wasn't <UNK> that things didn't make sense br br overall the <UNK> was well acted and made sense but wasn't very interesting there are a lot of better movies in the same genre that i would recommend over this one rest stop the devil's rejects texas chainsaw massacre even the <UNK> remake do yourself a favor and skip it unless you don't have any other <UNK>
<START> this show just sucks i don't think i even need to say it or why because judging by the number of comments already i am just repeating everything keys to the <UNK> is like turning on your tv and having it throw poo at you that is exactly what it is like i am not even <UNK> even a little bit these guys are so stupid not funny and not smooth with the ladies that it's not even funny its stupid i sat through four episodes and i want my two hours back where do they find the contestants because they are obviously <UNK> mentally if i was the man who came up with this idea for a show and put it on tv i would do the world a favour and jump off the <UNK> building i could find how does garbage like this get on tv especially the comedy network shouldn't a show on something called the comedy network at least be a comedy show or maybe be funny so often
<START> 'the <UNK> has wit visual flair and an iconic performance by jack nicholson ' however has none of these things although it does borrow from its classic to wit a man <UNK> through a door and a woman running around <UNK> while <UNK> a huge kitchen knife unlike stanley kubrick's great psychological horror film is a work which <UNK> with a <UNK> lack of genius it is <UNK> <UNK> awful it makes the spice girls movie look like a work of vital art is the tale of a family that moves to a <UNK> community in the <UNK> all is to be well with the world they will live in peace and they will <UNK> go about their business away from those mean old city streets but no character julia starts getting <UNK> by those things that insist on going <UNK> in the night by empty <UNK> and doors that close themselves and her husband samuel played by <UNK> <UNK> switches in an instant from laid back family man to wild eyed <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> julia with a drug to keep her under his sudden <UNK> much respected as an actor is absolutely dreadful in this comic rather than menacing he simply cannot pull off a threatening expression he just come across as a <UNK> <UNK> ball who's had one drink too many so is there anything to redeem this film no the script is clunky the plot non existent and the cast without merit completely without tension and full of be scared now moments is an exercise in how not to make a psychological thriller it is ridiculous and overblown but as one of the most unintentionally hilarious films of recent years it's well worth a watch
<START> this was an interesting adaption of william shakespeare's last known solo play but in my humble opinion a terrible one <UNK> tries to change the personalities of the characters for a start he makes miranda seem insane after being stuck on the island for so long <UNK> is no different a mix of madness and self pity on his part i could not imagine shakespeare thinking his characters to be anything like the way <UNK> <UNK> them br br <UNK> appearance is maybe the only thing he got right but then again i was under the impression that was a tormented <UNK> monster but turns out to be an insane rambling who is constantly <UNK> not as i would have imagined him <UNK> makes a brief appearance naked most the time and quiet br br in fact to the point i stopped watching this awful adaption their had been so many lines cut from the play if anything i think <UNK> was trying to re write shakespeare and include his own scenes most the time so much text is cut out in the first part it makes it not a shakespeare play but a load of 70's melodramatic preposterous rubbish br br an attempt to interpret this play more realistically in the end but this play was never a realistic one and it was made nothing like the text displays it to be
<START> river queen attempts to pack a complicated sweeping historical narrative into just under two hours there are some breathtaking battle scenes and the scenery is beautifully captured however the film did suffer from some poor leads samantha <UNK> sarah especially came across as unconvincing there seemed to be an <UNK> about how the role should be played as a helpless <UNK> tossed by fate or as a strong determined character with a clear view of her destiny <UNK> <UNK> character private doyle seemed to be pointless and for the most part <UNK> irish <UNK> needs a little <UNK> on the other hand cliff curtis <UNK> and as <UNK> son boy were well rounded and believable br br the last 20 minutes of river queen came across as particularly <UNK> and rushed it seemed as if they decided they had to tie up all the loose ends before <UNK> minutes were up e g how on earth did know how to find sarah and doyle no explanation and very unsatisfying br br i did go to this movie with an open mind i hadn't read or heard anything much apart from its troubled production what i experienced was a <UNK> mash of new zealand history beautifully photographed but ultimately disappointing
<START> what are forest <UNK> and <UNK> collins jr doing in this light it up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece on problems in low <UNK> area schools while the topic is one that needs to be addressed the film uses every cliche in the genre and comes off as a <UNK> popcorn flick the characters are <UNK> from the inner city version of the breakfast club or even the <UNK> watch this with your children when they turn 13 or 14 with them it could be an <UNK> for a lesson on current social problems for anyone older it will be nothing more than something to watch and spit on at 4 in the morning as i did recently on bravo matter of fact what was this doing on bravo
<START> renting this direct to video film i was not expecting an amazing piece of cinematography not to say just because a film is in cinema it will only very loosely following the story <UNK> in the epic poem this film provides a unique take on the tale of monsters and super humans the general photography can be <UNK> as conflicted with its mixture of <UNK> and post apocalyptic reminiscent of mad max with a rock and <UNK> soundtrack to boot one comes away feeling a bit off the fight scenes though unbelievable are entertaining and christopher <UNK> possesses some of the most interesting weapon <UNK> i have ever seen on film though often a tad <UNK> <UNK> the special effects used for the monster grendel are surprisingly effective and are one of the few highlights br br christopher <UNK> delivers an average performance as beowulf it will be nowhere near as memorable as <UNK> but at least it wasn't as poor as <UNK> the supporting cast is rather neutral br br if you're looking for a good action adventure story with a complex and engaging plot i would not suggest this film however if you want a flick that is of little substance full of campy battle scenes and a somewhat predictable plot find a copy of this
<START> sorry this was a <UNK> excuse for a film a plot line so <UNK> it <UNK> a block of swiss cheese and a butch of characters who seemed to me to be utterly devoid of inter personal relations well except of course for <UNK> and lee miller who i could have <UNK> were meant to be in love unlike the union of tyler and miller who were for the most part like the rest of the film utterly unconvincing although the end product was and amusing for all the wrong reasons the production values were high and deserve some <UNK> but unfortunately the end result was rubbish what was everyone involved thinking they definitely should have packed up early on this one
<START> this kind of angst can only be inside a young person who seeks very seriously his religion and his place in this world as the text in the beginning of the movie says these pictures are dead they are the past already and have been right from the moment when the product was ready but that is only for the maker of these products maybe to somebody who is in the same frame of mind i think very many people at least of those who are seriously interested in religion go through the same terrible and doubts in their personal development and that of course is the reason that art is made in the first place <UNK> and <UNK> amongst fellow human beings br br this film uses very well the classic of the experimental cinema and this is where those are to my opinion in the best possible use as an <UNK> in telling stories and creating atmosphere to them not just as a pure <UNK> or as an end in those tricks have already been made many enough times some other movies that i imagine have influenced inspired this director are <UNK> and <UNK> it's interesting how these make this movie totally timeless there is nothing contemporary in this movie or nothing from any other specific time either it could have been made a thousand years ago br br it is interesting in this story how these people treat this new born holy child they use it <UNK> in their own purposes and don't even try to listen to him they beat him rip off his intestines and <UNK> him they drag his living body <UNK> from place to place and they do the same kind of violence to his mother the story also reminds me of the <UNK> short story el de <UNK> also the critique towards the practices of the christian <UNK> reminds me of the great el <UNK> br br unpleasant watch at times but beautiful very simple thought and concentrated very strong movie almost too strong the whole human energy has been concentrated to this also this movie shows that when you have the passion and ideas you can make a movie with a round zero budget br br but i have to admit it was a bit hard to watch for a contemporary viewer like myself because of the it was so slow and demanding but after all worth the suffering i have to give ten points just for the effort that somebody makes this kind of movie
<START> first off i want to say most of the people who give this a poor review don't like this kind of comedy the movie is great if you have an open mind and aren't afraid to laugh at some stupid things br br this movie is shot just like the tv show with a lot of short clips <UNK> into one long movie some of the scenes don't even have dialog someone will just come out and do something unexpected and it is funny the only negative i had is i felt like i wasted money on my popcorn and there was no way i could eat or drink anything during this movie i was constantly laughing i was honestly nervous of drinking some and seeing something that caused me to laugh and shoot it everywhere br br if you don't mind some male nudity and you enjoy jackass the movie jackass the tv show and <UNK> la <UNK> then for your sake go see this movie br br and if you don't like the first movie or the tv show don't see it and if you do see it don't post a bad review about it hardcore christians who see this and bash it just doesn't seem right to me
<START> tomorrow is another day is not the sequel to gone with the wind but a lovers on the <UNK> story and a surprisingly alert and moving one as well for a supposed hack <UNK> to b minus features like the devil thumbs a ride felix <UNK> proves <UNK> at filling his work with unexpected inventive details steve <UNK> leaves prison after 18 years for killing his brutal father when he was only 13 and now he's still a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> operating inside a man's frame <UNK> he visits a 10 cents a dance palace and falls for <UNK> <UNK> ruth roman but the sudden shooting of her police <UNK> boyfriend causes the ill matched couple to hit the road ending like the <UNK> in a california <UNK> worker camp br br <UNK> the revelation in her best known role as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in hitchcock's strangers on a train she was ill and under used here she <UNK> from bottle blonde taxi dancer to <UNK> wife and mother to be and a brunette to boot almost as good <UNK> between the suspicion of a wounded child and the explosive reactions of an under <UNK> male and the ending while unconvincing is nonetheless welcome along with they live by night and gun crazy tomorrow is another day displays a redeeming <UNK> and warmth that <UNK> its film noir <UNK>
<START> i just saw this movie at the <UNK> film festival and i have to say that i thought it was amazing the combination of humor and sincerity really made the movie worthwhile the movie was about a <UNK> year old boy whose mother and father are very religious the <UNK> year old ben decides to work for a retired actress who teaches him about girls and driving and life it is very comical and touching i honestly have to say that it is now one of my favorite movies i recommend this movie to anyone and everyone if you didn't catch one of the <UNK> at the film festival it's supposed to come out in theaters later in the year please go see it it is a great film
<START> what some hollywood movies try and practically never succeed creating somehow <UNK> connections between persons without becoming unrealistic manages this beautiful movie perfectly well resembling in that way a little to the wonderful <UNK> double <UNK> de of the same director and with the same beautiful actress this is a real movie that changes perspective of life a little bit intelligent and beautiful story masterfully directed excellent main actors masterful cinematography i've just seen the movie the 3rd or 4th time and i still think it's one of the best i've ever seen and if you should be unhappy with the ending of <UNK> <UNK> puts an happy end to the whole trilogy
<START> br br well known comedians <UNK> admit they wish they could do real satire like bill <UNK> <UNK> these pitiful <UNK> we are treated to what an exceptionally talented comedian can achieve when he could otherwise be chasing fame and fortune he didn't get his own talk show but at least he was no one's puppet
<START> this mess starts off with a real tank running over a car <UNK> with images of a toy tank this is followed by a family driving home from a birthday party without saying anything the unexplained tank and the family take up i swear over 10 minutes of film finally the family sees a car after it has been in a wreck and decides to report it to the proper authorities only to find that the citizens of the town are all hiding in their houses and the cops are hiding in the police station interesting almost when the town folk come out due to the family's presence we learn that both the writer and editor are <UNK> to substitute suspense with incomprehensible storytelling techniques in the hopes that the audience's inability to tell what's going on will somehow bring <UNK> upon the audience and it works but not in the way they thought it would i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense not in a fun david lynch sort of way but a sort of i walked in during the middle of a boring conversation sort of way over the course of the next hour we learn that the movie makers try to bore us into being afraid by showing <UNK> mundane scenes combined with the above mentioned what's going on type scenes br br the plot involves something along the lines of gentle looking old folks putting children into a <UNK> through the power of satan and then bringing them to a party to play with toys and an even more sinister intention and it's up to a group of white men everybody's white in the movie to grab their guns and save the day and a tag a long eye candy woman who <UNK> at the drop of a hat they look for the kidnapped children by looking in random places and yelling the kids' names br br this is a great horror movie for any person who has never seen a horror movie because that person is frightened by the mere thought of <UNK> <UNK> or even <UNK> due to a lifetime <UNK> of <UNK> from the <UNK> broadcast network this represents <UNK> as elderly folks in halloween costumes with <UNK> while at a party in front of an <UNK> with a priest <UNK> completely made up nonsense about <UNK> while calling them witches the message that anything that isn't can be all thrown into the same category for easy <UNK> br br about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors <UNK> <UNK> overwrought pseudo satanic <UNK> corny enough to make a teen <UNK> <UNK> almost always in <UNK> english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words br br highlights include a guy laughing at the idea of little green men for a solid 3 minutes a family staring out of the windows of their car without talking for 10 minutes while listening to elevator <UNK> a priest studying <UNK> for 4 minutes with <UNK> so scary drawings of demons to scare the church lady crowd random shots of dolls random shots of children paint instead of blood at every chance film school level dream sequences introduces <UNK> characters who do nothing before they exit sometimes they act as if the nothing that they're doing is a big deal br br the directing is sloppy at best an example of the directing includes a scene at the beginning where a man and woman are kissing and the man pulls away to look lovingly into her eyes and some dark red paint falls on her cheek looking up they see that it's not blood but from a girl's are ice and colored <UNK> water and would not have produced of the same <UNK> as paint not to mention the fact that her was a bright <UNK> orange hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing it then cuts to an alternate shot of the man woman and girl and shows that she's standing about four feet away from them so the wouldn't have <UNK> on the woman even if she'd held her out over the woman's face way to go editor of course the acting is blah the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and br br the director's most offensive technique is to give the actors no motivation and then go out for lunch as the <UNK> eye of the camera <UNK> as the actors make fools of themselves br br and finally after all that we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry <UNK>
<START> this movie was made on a relatively small budget 10 20 million dollars with almost no promotion at all from its <UNK> i only knew about it because i am a long time jean claude van damme fan and i always check out his latest films in hope that they will be at least watchable and aside from some real <UNK> <UNK> second in command they are this movie has an easy enough plot to follow and van damme gives a good humorous performance through out but the movie owes all of its credit to the fight scenes involving van damme scott <UNK> and the final one of them together the editing and camera work for most of the film is pretty terrible but <UNK> <UNK> can definitely film a good fight scene i too am happy that van damme has been acting better lately in hell wake of death until death but with the good acting came less martial arts in the shepherd van damme proves that he still has it
<START> this is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person the sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent just a great movie for ever to time limit just for the entire live you must have in your collection this is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person the sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent just a great movie for ever to time limit just for the entire live you must have in your collection this is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person the sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent just a great movie for ever to time limit just for the entire live you must have in your collection
<START> <UNK> <UNK> has made 3 great movies boys meet girls sang les <UNK> du <UNK> in fact those films were not that great but it has the violence of youth the beauty of juvenile wilderness <UNK> in these three movies was well aware of what cinema was but he tried to make his own vision of the art without thinking about about all he have seen but using it and melting it into his times x is a very different movie because <UNK> made les <UNK> du <UNK> a of 20 millions dollars a film that has destroyed everything on its way after such a movie you can't do another one in the same point of view so <UNK> <UNK> has to changed and he did the movie isn't as beautiful as its first it's more reasonable no more studio no more <UNK> paris <UNK> has entered at last reality it's not clean anymore it's not poetic characters <UNK> have become a romantic in the german sense of it
<START> one of the <UNK> of the early sound era is that they couldn't make westerns because they had trouble recording sound on location in fact it was the financial <UNK> of the depression that <UNK> killed off the genre at least in the a budget <UNK> however in the period <UNK> 1931 before the economic <UNK> had really kicked in the a western <UNK> notable examples including the billy the kid and <UNK> the big trail was perhaps the biggest of them all  a <UNK> <UNK> western shot in an early widescreen process appropriately titled <UNK> thanks to a recent dvd release we now get to see the widescreen version alongside the <UNK> that was shot simultaneously br br the director was <UNK> walsh a man for whom the spirit of adventure lay in vast <UNK> <UNK> and thus in many ways a perfect choice he makes great use of the wider frame to show off the western landscape at its most breathtaking very typical of walsh are a number of shots towards the beginning such as the one where a woman is <UNK> <UNK> most of the screen is tightly filled by the <UNK> and other clutter but in one corner we see the wilderness <UNK> out when the <UNK> train gets going the open plain is gradually revealed to us with <UNK> pulling away like stage <UNK> these shots are not so effective in the <UNK> version yet on the wider <UNK> <UNK> expression of the <UNK> was never better br br but there's an unfortunate <UNK> to this when it comes to dialogue scenes <UNK> tendency is to place the actors in the middle of the shot as if they were in an imaginary <UNK> box the extra <UNK> becomes just that  extra it may seem logical at first because it means that height wise we see as much of the actors as we would in a <UNK> picture however it makes the players look small and insignificant within the frame while all the background business <UNK> the shot  and there is a lot of background business in the big trail when widescreen <UNK> re emerged in the 1950s many directors would make the same mistake before eventually <UNK> that in <UNK> scenes it is better to frame actors from around the chest up losing some of their height but allowing them to fill the screen br br it's a pity because the big trail is a particularly well balanced and finely scripted effort the romance and revenge subplots are simple but well defined and do not <UNK> to each other or the <UNK> story it could have been a great intimate epic but it loses dramatic weight because every time characters start talking to each other we get distracted by <UNK> of cattle <UNK> <UNK> or whatever else is filling every spare inch of frame still <UNK> sensitivity to deeply emotional romantic moments is still on display and he manages to make the final scene effective and memorable there are also some nice comedy touches largely courtesy of comical <UNK> el br br the big trail is also notable for being john wayne's first lead role while wayne is another victim of the distant framing in dialogue scenes we do at least see his strong physical presence and hear his warm but <UNK> vocal delivery he betrays his lack of experience but the potential is clearly there sadly that potential wasn't widely realised at the time and he spent the rest of the decade <UNK> it in b pictures before he finally hit stardom also appearing in this picture is wayne's buddy and later prolific character actor ward bond he's not credited but you can spot him in a number of scenes most <UNK> around the 80 minute mark where he is stood to <UNK> <UNK> left br br the big trail is a glorious epic that manages to defeat itself as a drama and it was this <UNK> scale that would put the western and widescreen to bed for some time and although the 40s and 50s are now regarded as the golden age of the western it was by then a changed genre with stories of individual adventure and <UNK> in an established west  no better or worse but of a different form the early <UNK> period was the end of an era in which westerns could be truly gigantic
<START> five fingers of death started the american kung fu movie <UNK> but i remember seeing it for the first time as king boxer in <UNK> nyc without the bad dubbing and few americans i also was fortunate enough to see the american premiere of five fingers of death on times square nyc what a contrast this turned out to be same film but different audiences br br in <UNK> this film took on a more serious tone to the viewers it was because of hearing the real voices of the actors in chinese that made this movie more believable <UNK> theaters were showing violent kung fu films for years <UNK> boxer from beat them all in gore so the action choreography story were the main attraction rival school plots were not <UNK> yet so the storyline seemed fresh every great kung fu film had wonderful <UNK> villains you wanted to see get their <UNK> and had them too the star <UNK> lo was a known actor in chinese theaters the mostly chinese audience enjoyed this film immensely the audience buzz while leaving this film gives the final satisfaction to me br br on times square this film was an action comedy probably unintentionally i enjoyed it here too but for different reasons the crowd was ethnic and quite energetic from the start the movie made you laugh as soon as the audience heard those strange british accents come from those chinese actors the movie turned into a violent and gory cartoon most american audiences saw this kind of gore in a horror film not in an action film the action sequences blew the audience away unfortunately the movie studios saw that they enjoyed it so much that bad dubbing and unnecessary violence became a kung fu flick formula br br i had fun seeing this movie with an american audience but enjoyed it much more in <UNK> some films can pass the test of time but the dubbed version of can't the original king boxer is still enjoyable a classic
<START> many people have the irritating habit of dying before <UNK> a vital message thus confusing the hero not to mention the audience br br dr ben <UNK> james stewart and his wife jo a former musical star doris day are <UNK> in <UNK> with their son hank christopher olsen when they meet mr and mrs a british couple brenda de and bernard miles they are also <UNK> by a charming frenchman louis bernard daniel who invites them to dinner but then <UNK> at the last minute br br the go to a restaurant and end up having their meal with the when they spot louis bernard br br the next day in the market place they are caught in an assassination intrigue while they are wandering in the local market the crowds suddenly <UNK> to reveal an arab fleeing from his <UNK> dr <UNK> stands amazed as the arab falls into his arms a knife sticking out of his back br br <UNK> his last breath the dying man <UNK> some words and <UNK> dr <UNK> is completely taken <UNK> when the hood falls from his head and he is revealed as bernard in disguise <UNK> is left knowing too little but as far as the <UNK> are concerned too much br br to prevent dr <UNK> from revealing what he knows the <UNK> kidnap his son as a hostage the film is primarily concerned with the dilemma of to get the little boy back safely the subplot about the assassination is just the setup br br the film is a breathless <UNK> the death of bernard comes suddenly and points out that death comes when we least expect it br br stewart is charged with emotion as the <UNK> doctor accidentally involved in political intrigue his <UNK> facial expressions and <UNK> delivery made him convincingly person we could easily identify with it is his <UNK> that actually sets the pace for the entire film br br by 1956 the lovely doris day had won increasing <UNK> as an actress as well as a singer she had been particularly strong opposite james cagney in the ruth biopic <UNK> me or leave me ' but she was still unsure of her basic <UNK> talents br br the casting of character actor <UNK> as the assassin is brilliant the man looks like a menace and his <UNK> portrayal <UNK> evil
<START> yes absolutely dreadful and this coming from someone who loves bad movies but there's a limit i enjoy all sorts of horror suspense films and have seen some wonderful work from european film makers is sadly not among those those wonderful pieces of film making the camera work is worse than amateurish not the <UNK> shaky mtv cameraman needs <UNK> type of camera work so many film makers use to <UNK> their lack of talent this is simply bad frame composition and terrible image composition the acting is <UNK> when it is not entirely two dimensional the dialogues are stilted and unnatural even more so than your usual run of the mill horror suspense film <UNK> into pseudo <UNK> i think that what put me off the most was the horribly choreographed fight scenes at the end of the film these were bad to the point of being ludicrous i've seen what a small budget can do and it can do wonders this was just bad film making very very sad
<START> finding the premise intriguing and reading the reviews and being an angel fan i watched this movie it's sexy and original and quite entertaining david <UNK> is keith he's a hunky married man stay at home dad and he feels a little <UNK> in his marriage he makes the mistake of <UNK> a close circle of teenage girls who are fascinated with the idea of doing it with an older man they'll do anything to get into his bed including beg lie and blackmail but they mostly try to push his buttons the that ensues sends keith <UNK> and pushes friendships to the edge david <UNK> shows a little skin in this one and he's looking hot yes he plays a sleazy cheat but he shows enough vulnerability and <UNK> toward the goofy teens that you end up cheering for him in the end one more thing when someone <UNK> oh yeah oh oh yeah it's hard to see them as a victim of rape
<START> father hood br br i can understand why a lot of people hate this tale of a father kidnapping his two children and carrying them across america but i've seen much worse and when i saw this years ago i didn't think it was particularly awful patrick <UNK> is the worried father who takes his kids on the run with him for personal reasons and <UNK> <UNK> is the cop chasing them down br br overall a decent way to spend a couple hours of your life you could certainly do worse ever hear of the film <UNK> people br br 1 2 out of br br rated pg 13 for some traumatic scenes adult content matter violence and language
<START> chicago reporter frank <UNK> decided to go to <UNK> to confirm the existence of a so called angel he was not alone his partner <UNK> <UNK> and new colleague dorothy winters also joined him when they arrived at the destination they found that the angel michael was quite different from what they expected however frank still <UNK> michael to go to chicago with them so an interesting journey began br br although michael did not look like a saint he was a kind and funny angel in fact michael owned irresistible charming for women even due to jealousy of other men he was involved in a riot the climax appeared in the pizza restaurant dorothy sang lively country songs for frank that was just what michael wanted to see but the next day <UNK> 's dog was crashed to death by a running car michael was asked to save it that would be used to <UNK> whether he was a real angel br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in this comedy she also showed her singing ability john travolta proved his comedian talent again of cause pulp fiction still was his typical work br br a comedy that will warm your heart 8 10
<START> if you think it's beautiful to be obsessive about who you are in love with then i can imagine giving it a good rating but i cannot imagine that this theme of <UNK> and having little respect for others such as the way paulie treats the teachers who try to help her is anything you would want to teach your children yes it's also bad the way victoria treated paulie but guess what that's life isn't it a more important lesson to learn how to get past these <UNK> and make the best of your life or is falling off the roof a better lesson to teach our children secondly when <UNK> father didn't show up for the dinner and paulie helped mary release her anger that mary even said she wished he were dead somehow i don't think this is a good message either that you deal with your <UNK> through anger
<START> this movie is of interest to the fans of the famous rock group the band in that singer <UNK> richard <UNK> appears in several scenes it looks to me like the movie might have been shot some years before 75 judging by <UNK> looks interestingly jones would later act with the <UNK> <UNK> in a considerably better film coal <UNK> daughter anyway you really need a special reason to this tough to watch art film alas the <UNK> sensitive <UNK> would commit suicide i've never heard how he ended up in a movie four of the five members of the band would appear in another bad film man outside
<START> this may just be the worst movie of all time never have i seen such horrible film making before in my life its so bad i think i want to go watch barney instead i advise everyone who reads this to write a <UNK> to get this movie off of our film history so we can never hear from it again i give it 1 out of 10
<START> i always had this concept that korean movies were all about comedy and drama but christmas in <UNK> has changed my point of view this movie is so simple it have any melodramatic scenes or over the top comedy scenes not a single scene where the actors cry out loud not even a scene where the actor and the actress kiss not even a simple kiss and yet this movie is able to reach it's viewers in ways that i <UNK> know existed the ending of the movie left me speechless i <UNK> even cry but my eyes were red hot this movie left me a feeling i can hardly describe in words br br i don't think i can recommend this movie to everyone but i do recommend this movie to people who want to watch real cinema 9 4 10
<START> in a <UNK> completely <UNK> by europeans and americans in the beginning of the <UNK> century the <UNK> leader <UNK> el the magnificent sean connery kidnaps the american <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her son and her daughter his intention is to get some money and <UNK> as <UNK> for them to fight against the corrupt <UNK> of marc in times of election the american president theodore <UNK> brian keith agrees with the <UNK> however is betrayed and <UNK> helps him to be released from the prison with the american soldiers i do not like films about explicit <UNK> and lack of respect to the <UNK> of other countries but the lion and the <UNK> is indeed a great adventure the action scenes are very realistic <UNK> <UNK> the most beautiful american actress in the is wonderful performing an <UNK> woman like in the remarkable movie soldier sean connery is perfect as usual as an honest and <UNK> religious leader brian keith is great as the american president i do not know much about the <UNK> history to analyze whether there is any truth in this story but this movie is a worthwhile entertainment in brazil it is only available on vhs my vote is eight br br title brazil o <UNK> e o the lion and the <UNK> br br
<START> i just don't understand why anytime someone does a show about one of the largest <UNK> areas in the country <UNK> dallas austin san antonio etc they portray the average person as someone who wears <UNK> cowboy hat talks with a <UNK> has zero fashion sense and drives a truck on his way to either the saloon or his next hunting trip <UNK> <UNK> shooting or country music concert i have never even seen a small town cop driving a police truck anywhere in texas br br the funny thing is this is not done for artistic reasons or comedy they are actually serious and i guess believe the average person is too stupid to know the difference the bad scripts and equally bad acting give that away this show makes goofy shows in the past like <UNK> look like high brow entertainment at least <UNK> had the talking car
<START> maybe in its day this movie was special but five decades later it seems quaint just another cinematic <UNK> of the dreadful 1950s stereotypes abound in this <UNK> story about three female gold <UNK> who set up shop in a manhattan <UNK> in an effort to attract wealthy husbands br br i don't mind the shallow theme but the film's premise is lame and the execution is worse it's a romantic comedy but i found little to laugh at the plot point about an extremely bimbo is about the only clever element of the story overall dialogue is flat and so too is the delivery and the script structure is <UNK> the plot keeps jumping back and forth among the three ladies it's as if the writer couldn't quite blend the ensemble roles the result is a plot that seems choppy br br marilyn monroe was a good choice for her role but lauren bacall was too old for the role she played and betty <UNK> with her <UNK> voice and awful <UNK> was just plain annoying br br color cinematography is conventional but there were lots of shots using rear screen projection <UNK> to a dated look the visuals are made even worse by costumes that <UNK> of cheesy 1950's <UNK> they are just awful viewers must endure a fashion show a plot point that <UNK> how the film's director was smitten by those trashy glad <UNK> br br and then there is that orchestra in what is arguably the worst film opening in cinema history the first part of the film has an orchestra playing some dreary sounding tune at first i thought i was watching the introduction to coming <UNK> but no it's actually part of the film and the orchestra plays on and on and on it has nothing absolutely nothing whatever to do with the story what were they thinking br br i enjoyed marilyn monroe with her <UNK> voice as she <UNK> her way through the plot but the film would have been far better if they had dumped the other two ensemble roles dumped that orchestra enhanced the comedy dialogue and <UNK> those <UNK> cheesy costumes
<START> this is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you i found the film was great and getting to grips with the two main characters <UNK> this was represented in a great performance by both two michael and <UNK> whether the story is based around a true story i feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human on the whole this film reach into my soul and i too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity the whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character the play and only show part of the character that is believable to the audience but i feel that <UNK> two certainly made great use as their gifted talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama certainly one not to be missed
<START> this movie took me by surprise i first saw it more than 10 years ago and it stays with me still it's got it's just plain boring points and i personally would have ended it differently this has not in the least bit <UNK> me from watching it over and over and <UNK> it to others the acting is fantastic the cast and director do an amazing job with the script and anyone who likes <UNK> movies who has the patience to sit and say what the hell is this and allow themselves to be drawn in should give this film a chance if you just want alan <UNK> to be goofy or to see things explode this is not the movie for you
<START> well i had the chance to view this film the other day i didn't know what to expect as i never saw the trailer and such but what i did discover simply by watching the first 10 minutes is that this film is the worst i have ever had the misfortune to see br br i wish i could give it this film a 0 rating the first 10 minutes were bad but as soon as it <UNK> the party scene i wanted to just enter a coma it was really poorly done the actors didn't have any direction there was no real story i read some reviews that state its good if you have a little child to entertain for 90 minutes etc but really why should we expose children to this type of film its got poor humor rude and crude comedy at best and focuses on poor special effects to fill 80 of its time i am sure a few people in hollywood will be out on the streets after this film bombs br br also how can <UNK> people give this movie a 10 i mean get real anyone that gives this movie a 10 either has some mental issue and or works for the film company this movie should average at 1 5 10 instead of its current 2 3 10 due to the people that <UNK> it 10 truly sad
<START> i was actually around 13 years old camping near the <UNK> river near when this movie was being filmed my family was paid to leave our <UNK> for the afternoon when they filmed vincent floating down the river a little trivia the scene where they pulled him out was actually where he started his <UNK> down the river and if the stunt man missed the <UNK> there was 20 foot <UNK> about 1 4 mile down <UNK> br br anyway i watched it at the time and didn't get it it wasn't until years later when i saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it it's pretty powerful movie and certainly a fine job by jan at such a young age his movie career never really took off as expected but of course he later found success on tv i wish this movie was available cause i would love to see it again
<START> jimmy heath ledger is given a simple job by bryan brown a underworld <UNK> to deliver money to a particular address but when no one answers the door jimmy decides to take a <UNK> at the beach to pass some time but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone jimmy rings to tell him the problem but he doesn't want to hear it and his boys try their best to locate jimmy meaning no more jimmy if they get their hands on him so now jimmy goes into hiding to <UNK> a bank robbery to get money back also throughout this mess he meets the <UNK> sweet alex rose <UNK> and together they're in for one hell of a ride through king cross br br two hands is simply an engrossing pick me up film that's <UNK> <UNK> and incredibly fresh what you got here is pretty much an urban gangster film with a seedy backdrop and in your face what <UNK> that fresh you ask well because it takes us into the underworld where the australian culture shines with criminals wearing <UNK> flip <UNK> and shorts done up cars and a can of beer in the and don't forgot the australian sense of humour dry and sarcastic you can say it owes a lot to the likes of pulp fiction <UNK> a <UNK> of mine and lock stock and two smoking <UNK> for its inspiration but for me it still stands on its own the film has real mixture of light hearted moments but also a mean streak to it with some unexpected shocks and black humour that can actually be disturbing you just don't know what's coming and it has a nice touch of snappy irony especially the ending and great timing with its humour one scene involving a bank robbery will have you in <UNK> i guarantee you the <UNK> outline is really a coming to age story or about the road not taken with a <UNK> love tale added and then the gangster element to finish it off most of the sub plots were cleverly constructed and well maybe it could've gone without the supernatural element involving <UNK> dead brother but in the overall context the diverse plot seems to all click together intense natural and crisp dialogue filled the outrageously colourful script with quick <UNK> of aussie <UNK> <UNK> i'm fair br br what truly made the film was that of bryan <UNK> performance of he just gave his character such a <UNK> charismatic nasty persona that when he wasn't on screen his presence was still felt he gave his character two sides one being a <UNK> but the other side is such a good bloke a young rose <UNK> <UNK> with her <UNK> sweet quirky character alex she looked gorgeous and added a <UNK> personality then you got heath ledger who the buck as the naive jimmy great supporting cast involved with the likes of <UNK> porter tom long david field steve and steve le <UNK> such raw performances are achieved and from that you get riveting fun and believable characters <UNK> rock soundtrack <UNK> at the <UNK> with the likes of and alex lloyd provide a cool vibe also being shot on location in king cross really helped it stick out by holding a life of its own and showing the australian way of life <UNK> camera tricks captured the city's backdrop superbly especially the <UNK> <UNK> this was a film that when it ended i was totally satisfied with what i got overall a <UNK> paced crime thriller that achieves what it intended to do a fun clever and crazy roller coaster ride of thrills and excitement br br i say it's a successful aussie take on lock stock and two smoking <UNK> by director writer <UNK> jordan in his debut film if you come across it don't hesitate to it give it a go
<START> i saw that the <UNK> was <UNK> in the bottom 100 movie <UNK> here on imdb so i wasn't expecting much when i tuned into it on the usa channel a week back but i did have hopes belly of the beast which aired a month ago was a mess but it had great scenery and photography and some pretty cool moments scattered throughout so i thought that this movie might have some of the same br br alas this movie fails the standards of basic watch ability in almost every way the screenplay comes off as the bastard <UNK> of a john <UNK> novel and a richard <UNK> movie but done by people with none of those worthy <UNK> talent for plot and characterization instead what we got is a <UNK> mean spirited <UNK> <UNK> nest of muddled motives <UNK> <UNK> and back shootings and chest shootings and <UNK> and this carries over to the directorial style which relies on hackneyed shot slow shots every 10 seconds along with wire work and <UNK> jump cuts these <UNK> devices that were stale 10 years ago when mtv directors used them for videos and the director works them like a punch press hoping to <UNK> some weird art house <UNK> thriller <UNK> into the proceedings br br segal himself is just awful in this he spends the entire film talking in a <UNK> <UNK> half <UNK> and <UNK> between two expressions looking like he is sucking on a <UNK> while someone waves a small turd under his nose or looking <UNK> and he's so <UNK> and vain about it that he never actually takes off his <UNK> length <UNK> on camera i understand that it's hard to keep the <UNK> under control as a male actor ages although denzel washington and paul newman never seemed to have that problem but you deal with it by being honest about it and by growing as an actor not by hiding it with carefully chosen camera angles and floor length <UNK> br br so i can't really tell what's going on and the movie doesn't give me a reason to care about what's going on and the protagonist is completely one dimensional and visually unappealing not a recipe for a good movie experience br br oddly most of the set designs and scenery are atmospheric and striking in fact if you were to freeze the film on almost any given scene that wasn't a close up of seagal you would be struck by the care and <UNK> of the lighting colors and composition and by how beautiful the eastern european settings are but dressing up a rotten egg as a egg can't make it <UNK> and the proceedings are rotten at heart br br there are <UNK> movies like versus and there are visually striking but emotionally cold movies like underworld and there are paranoia conspiracy thrillers like the bourne identity and its remake with matt damon and then there is this thing which can't make up its mind what it wants to be pretends to be all these things and fails because it has no guts or soul br br this is a movie made by professionals with an actual budget so you can't really put it in the same class as <UNK> killer <UNK> or hobgoblins but i'd rather watch all three of those movies back to back several times than watch the <UNK> again even once
<START> this film is a perfect example of how to take a fascinating subject come up with 25 minutes of <UNK> material and stretch it into a six hour <UNK> resembling the shape a documentary might take if fox news decided to make one even the participants in this <UNK> <UNK> film can't <UNK> their laughter at the stupidity of their attempt to show one of the few great times in world history where people take a stand and work to make a better world if only the creators had spoken with ken burns for 5 minutes they might have come out with something mildly intelligent instead of this cure for insomnia
<START> <UNK> br br i've seen quite a few bad movies in my days a lot of them in the company of mike tom crow and the others from mst3k so was the case with this one as well and even though i found the movie in itself quite funny it wouldn't have been nearly as fun without the mst3k commentary br br the movie is a prime example of really bad movies coming out of europe during the eighties horrible music horrible acting horrible plot what little there is horrible dialogue and really really really horrible editing <UNK> br br this might be called a turkey if it weren't for the fact that it's not unique in any way whatsoever it's pretty much the same kind of film that almost every italian hack of a director <UNK> out br br so try and get the mst3k version it's a pretty fun episode with mike and gang in quite good form
<START> the basic plot of boasts of a romantic comedy <UNK> the film industry is kept as a backdrop an american actress played by ali carter gets stuck in india worse that she is out of money she then decides to play a small role in a bollywood musical so that she can earn enough money to get back to her nation here she gets to meet indian choreographer <UNK> played by salman khan basically the movie fails at the script level just by calling a film a hollywood venture doesn't guarantee quality cinema stands out as the best example the art direction is weak and outdated <UNK> turns out to be a dud <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is far from being acknowledged as a decent hear <UNK> salman delivers of his most amateurish performances till date ali is good and has immense screen presence performance wise too she is good br br one can also find good reviews regarding this movie at http www net films <UNK> id
<START> i wish i could use the time travel machine to jump back to the moment i considered seeing this movie and make other plans instead i saw a free screening of a sound of thunder so i can't complain about the price but i wish i could get my <UNK> minutes <UNK> the acting was mediocre and the special effects were <UNK> people shouldn't make movies about dinosaurs if they can't afford to make the <UNK> creatures look as good or better than those in jurassic park spielberg spoiled us edward burns as travis was the movie's only saving grace i noticed that females under 18 rated the movie the highest and the only explanation is that they over burns the whole time the whole long <UNK> minutes this movie should have been over in about 80 minutes it just dragged on and on and on don't waste your time or your money on this far fetched flick
<START> it's been a long time since i have been in the art house theater and i went to see because it has gotten such great reviews in the papers br br the thing is with this movie is that it has no head or tail but merely a section in time about the life of the three main characters br br when it started i already knew that it was gonna be a long sit down but sometimes things can get better in this case not there is no real character development or <UNK> between the players you start in the middle of a situation all of the sudden there's a girlfriend and then there's a guy with whom he needs to be friends with in order to fulfill his sports ambitions but the way they are put together is quite odd since they are just put together so it seems br br and all of the sudden they have sex with each other at least one you can see of the feeling of guilt or jealousy with the other guy is hardly noticeable and really all i could think of during the movie was when are they gonna have sex again and when you think of it it's quite insane really because it basically means there is nothing really worth looking at but three teens going at it and that for me at least makes it a very crappy movie stay clear from it and save your money my 50 is wasted there are better art house movies than this one br br i give three stars for the acting performance one each
<START> i liked house of dracula much more than house of frankenstein carradine is much more passable his acting isn't as ridiculous overboard as in <UNK> the actors deliver solid enough performances the subplots <UNK> the monster the village <UNK> the village idiot the <UNK> nurse etc are mixed in well so that none becomes an odd <UNK> as in <UNK> better run than the <UNK> together <UNK> the <UNK> nurse is as likable as the <UNK> in <UNK> the doctor is very good as well <UNK> <UNK> adds a classy touch with his <UNK> worth watching twice a classic universal horror with that typical 1940's long lost flair especially good is the doctor's performance before after his blood had been <UNK> with <UNK>
<START> can a mentally challenged black youth be a <UNK> to <UNK> people in a south <UNK> town the answer appears to be that in spite of his <UNK> james kennedy understood much more than what he was given credit for and went to become a <UNK> in the sports scene also the film is saying how many of us overlook people with problems that can be helped if only we have the patience coach jones showed to the young man because of his own guilt in his heart br br radio directed by michael is a formula film inspired on a true story yet the movie is not a complete failure because of the inspired performances the director was able to get from his wonderful cast br br coach jones is <UNK> in getting the young man who is called radio because his passion for collecting them involved in sports a passion he discovers in this retarded man who has had only hard knocks in his young life coming from a poor background radio lives with his mother who is protective of him and questions the <UNK> intentions radio is seen by the school kids as a <UNK> at first then his sunny <UNK> wins him the acceptance of everyone because he is a good person without an ounce of <UNK> in his body br br the film owes a lot to ed harris and cuba gooding jr who make a great pair as the coach and radio mr harris one of the best actors of our times is never boring in anything he <UNK> with his presence he gets the essence of the <UNK> coach who sees the possibility to make <UNK> for something that bothers him from his past cuba gooding jr is also at his best portraying the mentally challenged young man br br the supporting cast is excellent s one of the best actresses of her generation does interesting work as the mother of radio <UNK> <UNK> another good actress plays the high school principle with style debra <UNK> only has a few scenes in the film br br radio while being sentimental will warm anyone's heart because it shows how we tend to see some people are in our society that we know nothing about and how quick we are to judge them michael puts a lot of ideas in the proper perspective for us
<START> as the title suggests there is a philosophical thread running through this film if a man has the talent and looks to find his way into society and money what might be the outcome if he is denied it for failing to have the x factor this question is <UNK> dealt with in this adaptation of patricia book and left me rather cold along the way br br matt damon is the <UNK> of the title and apart from his way on a <UNK> to europe falls under the spell of his <UNK> target <UNK> law <UNK> and social <UNK> get all <UNK> up in a violent <UNK> which <UNK> and <UNK> themselves for the rest of the movie law damon and the <UNK> pleasant paltrow as girlfriend are ok i liked philip seymour <UNK> cameo ish <UNK> miles the <UNK> society friend that <UNK> can never be the problem is that the story is <UNK> without arc or redemption for that matter which makes it rather difficult to swallow 4 10
<START> the story of a <UNK> <UNK> downtown l a sounds like a nice plot for a disaster movie this one though is missed <UNK> the movie looks chaotic has a storyline which is hard to follow or believe and the acting was very bad br br im in <UNK> with a lot of comments that lee jones is only good at <UNK> people around as a chief in some particular field in this one he is heading the <UNK> office being chief of such an office it naturally is a good idea to bring along your daughter to dangerous scenes clever thinking ann <UNK> touching walls and walking in <UNK> that suppose to be degrees <UNK> <UNK> right aside from the bad acting those factual errors make the film look almost as silly as <UNK> the only good point of this movie is that there is no ben affleck to make matters even worse avoid this movie at all costs
<START> no bullets no secret agents a story that is entertaining funny and believable met some of the producers actors in this film at the theater they seemed as interesting in person as their characters on screen you may not hear about this movie on tv with high dollar ad spots but it is definitely worth checking out i have spent 8 for a movie ticket on a lot of other movies that weren't this entertaining looking forward to future projects by this production company
<START> flipping through the tv and saw that the secret life of was on gave george <UNK> a shot at being the host i know that jim <UNK> was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull he really didn't seem to want to be <UNK> his voice overs were monotonous didn't get involved with the guests it seemed like he was <UNK> guests for <UNK> and he just happened to be in the shot i don't know if george is going to get better <UNK> this show i doubt it because he has <UNK> his own show now the show did seem to pack more info in but only because we saw less of the host the formula of this show was very delicate and i fear it has now been <UNK> for good
<START> for those of you who have never heard of the movie until now of which i presume there are many lucky people who haven't i'll <UNK> it for you ryan <UNK> plays the titular character of <UNK> who also serves as the film's narrator a la kevin spacey in american beauty but without the intelligent observations on life <UNK> goes to jail for stabbing a retarded kid to death and the movie attempts to figure out why he did it he seems to be a nice boy if not mentally absent and is portrayed by <UNK> with a complete lack of violence anger or agenda and if you're waiting for him to reveal his sinister side later in the movie don't waste your time it's not that kind of movie once in juvenile prison <UNK> goes to classes taught by pearl madison <UNK> portrayed by don cheadle who is incapable of anything but quality even when in bad movies pearl attempts to <UNK> the mystery of <UNK> in an attempt to figure out how such a kid could do such a thing and so he could write a book about it later along with being a juvenile prison teacher pearl is also an aspiring author br br the relationship between <UNK> and pearl is the driving narrative behind the film as their talks <UNK> past to the audience however to call it the central focus would imply that this meandering film had one it does not the united states of <UNK> boasts an impressive cast which seems to be to the <UNK> of the film it seems as though writer director matthew ryan <UNK> don't worry that you haven't heard of him he's never done anything had to give every character a personal story arc and personality flaw in order to get the actors to play them most of these traits and stories are clichéd and most go underdeveloped and <UNK> br br i'll try and break them down here martin <UNK> and ann are the parents of the <UNK> retarded boy i love how the movie kept calling the kid retarded never mentally disabled that part made me laugh inside they apparently have a cold relationship because all suburban <UNK> in contemporary cinema must be cold their other two kids are michelle williams who is apparently an aspiring actress about to attend college and <UNK> malone who plays the same troubled teen <UNK> she always plays this time with a heroine addiction malone was also the girlfriend of <UNK> which gives him his link to his victim <UNK> boyfriend who was <UNK> and came to live with the family and is a baseball player looking to go to the same college as his girlfriend is played by chris <UNK> he ends up doing more with his character than any of the other bit players managing to steal the movie at times lena <UNK> is mother who seems to be <UNK> sad for some reason kevin spacey also the executive producer is cold and <UNK> father who is a famed novelist eventually <UNK> will show up to put a <UNK> in story if you even care at that point oh yeah and there's a drug dealing ex boyfriend a couple of fellow and a co worker of <UNK> with whom he has an affair on his long distance girlfriend with played by <UNK> washington br br sorry if all that synopsis and character breakdown took so long if it seemed meaningless and boring then you've just experienced a bit of what i did during the <UNK> minutes i spent watching the movie but the <UNK> supporting cast of over <UNK> clichés is the least of this film's crimes the biggest one is that the whole exercise is entirely pointless we aren't given a fascinating look into a troubled mind we aren't given an effective explanation we aren't given much of anything given that it sucked so much i'm gonna go ahead and spoil the ending for you so that you never have to see it <UNK> stabbed the <UNK> because all <UNK> could see in the world was sadness and wanted to spare corky or whatever the <UNK> name was the sadness in his eyes it's like the worst <UNK> band in the world made an album and titled it the world is sad so i killed a <UNK> oh and <UNK> dies in the end in a sequence so <UNK> of unbelievable <UNK> that it would have ruined the movie if the movie didn't already suck of course he dies in the end because that made the movie so deep br br i'm giving the movie 2 stars because the actors themselves all did a pretty good job with the junk they were given the scenes with cheadle and <UNK> together were even interesting on some levels but to <UNK> the film itself you have to believe that movies are more than the sum of their parts
<START> millions in gold is traveling by train to the us <UNK> traveling along is lois lane to report on it along the way the train is attacked by masked thieves they <UNK> the car with the armed guards in it and attack the remaining ones this leads to a vicious fight between the remaining guards and the thieves the thieves <UNK> them but then lois lane jumps in she beats the thieves off the train at one point using a gun but the train starts to <UNK> out of control lois can't stop it and the thieves will stop at nothing to get the gold good thing superman is on the way br br fast exciting non stop action probably one of the best of all the cartoons just great
<START> i hated it i hate self aware pretentious <UNK> that <UNK> as art this film is either <UNK> inane or <UNK> stupid after the first half hour i through the dvd version and saw the same juvenile over and over and over i became <UNK> that i had spent hard earned money for <UNK> <UNK> trap <UNK> drivel in <UNK> or blue does not make something a movie let alone art
<START> as i said sometimes low budget is good you get to see a good movie without a lot of the extra <UNK> that can hide an otherwise piece of crap well this was that piece of crap if anything i thought it had humor unfortunately the humor was unintentional the only half witted acting came from bill smith and his part was cut out that's a joke there was never a bill smith nor was there anyone cast who could act even <UNK> sucked and he's been cast in nearly 40 movies the fight scenes were comical and made me feel like i could kick all their the sound was horrible as if all sound was recorded on the set my 10 year old could have written a better script btw my 10 year old fell asleep no kidding i give a b to editing for cutting the movie to only 90 minutes 60 minutes would have been an a
<START> i had been delighted to find that tcm was showing this as i love the 1992 version with <UNK> lawrence jim <UNK> joan <UNK> this film had a <UNK> ann <UNK> a wonderful performance by frank morgan but <UNK> acting made the film more of a farce then the wonderful unfolding that the later film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is painful to watch and you can't understand why his wife <UNK> him i found out after watching the film that it was based on the stage play where the 1992 film is based on the book the original film also felt like it was a <UNK> of a larger piece and felt <UNK> too bad it was such a let down
<START> i must admit that i didn't get around to seeing this movie in the theater as it was released at the beginning of a summer blockbuster season this cute little film couldn't help but get a bit lost in the shadow of multi million dollar special effects movies could it br br return to me has a lovely and simple story at its core and is extremely well directed and written by bonnie hunt who has been in a number of major pictures as an actress herself along with this one the charming story is beautifully woven with clever comedy and brought to life with superb performances by veteran as well as younger actors br br to those who say that david duchovny hasn't really had a good shot at breaking out of his fox <UNK> mold i agree i've seen his other film work and is by far the best thing he could have done for himself <UNK> driver is simply beautiful charming funny and lively in her role as grace br br outside of these two leads however you are surrounded by <UNK> close <UNK> family and friends jim belushi is an absolute <UNK> bonnie hunt is a stable and real life force i cannot however go without mentioning the talents of robert <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ironically i watched this film again on dvd only the day before he passed away this was his last film and he gave a performance that an actor of his <UNK> could certainly be proud to leave as the finale to a great career br br overall return to me turned what would have still been just a fun love story and grew it into a film that has become one of my favorites take the time rent this one it's well worth the effort
<START> rourke does his usual bit part as a sinister <UNK> evil jerk in the same mold as in picture claire out in fifty get carter double team and the rest of the garbage he happens to be in br br he has very few lines br br of course all this is just junk rourke him and doesn't matter for his characterization as an actor still after seeing a <UNK> johnny handsome <UNK> 9 1 2 weeks year of the dragon etc etc for many years i considered rourke an outstanding smart intelligent man i think he has changed since br br he looks <UNK> br br he went about with gloomy looks despair inhabited his breast and made the man a perfect <UNK> the example br br i had absolutely no other reason to watch this dull movie except that rourke was in
<START> about five years ago my friend and i went to the video rental store to get something to watch my friend saw space <UNK> on the shelf and so we got it once we got home and started watching it we realized what an absolute piece of crap it was a beer can floating in space a guy taking a dump in a toilet a guy with a mechanical dick who tries to <UNK> a women by saying <UNK> <UNK> wtf the dumbest stupidest most retarded horribly throne together piece of trash my eyes have ever been exposed to my friend and i still refer to it as the worst movie we have ever seen only one other movie has come close to its <UNK> and that would be the stupid jackie chan flick the if you eyes ever see this piece of junk on the shelf at your video store proceed to do the following 1 take it off the shelf and throw it to the ground 2 <UNK> on it for at least 30 seconds 3 proceed to set it on fire in a contained facility bathroom <UNK> 4 lastly take it to your local <UNK> waste management facility immediately so that it may be properly dealt with br br stay away from space <UNK>
<START> as kids movie it is great for the family it just sucks i was truly hoping for something like the <UNK> which is a great film for all ages this movie was just <UNK> too much to the kids with the silly script and characters calling each other little names like <UNK> breath alan <UNK> was however a delight and why do people compare willy <UNK> to this movie just because there is a theme song closely resembling the willy <UNK> song <UNK> make this film anything like willy <UNK>
<START> the movie opens with charlie jeff daniels a business man just finishing his lunch in a neighborhood <UNK> it appears he doesn't have enough cash to cover the check instead of reaching for his plastic he <UNK> around to see if the coast is clear and <UNK> out of the place without paying <UNK> to charlie <UNK> <UNK> griffith had been <UNK> him from the other side of the <UNK> br br <UNK> is <UNK> out in what passed for cool back in the 1980's with a brunette page boy cut she follows him out to let him know that she saw what he did he tries to deny it but can't escape her <UNK> thinking he's in it charlie is surprised when <UNK> says she doesn't work for the <UNK> and then offers him a ride back to work br br when she heads in the opposite direction thus begins their <UNK> across the middle atlantic <UNK> br br we're supposed to get <UNK> as thoroughly modern <UNK> puts straight laced charlie into <UNK> situations it's all right when the two <UNK> adults get a little kinky in a motel room but off putting when they out of paying the check at a family style restaurant stealing the labor from hard working people is not my idea of wild charlie is a jerk br br <UNK> is a loony jerk she starts to pass off charlie as her husband first to her mom who <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and then at her conveniently timed 10 year high school reunion an event used later by another too cool for its own good movie <UNK> <UNK> blank br br the marriage comes as a surprise to <UNK> 's real husband ray liotta who's just been recently released from prison for armed robbery ray gives the two a welcome <UNK> and shows them how nasty crime really is br br i can't add any irony by writing that i first watched this by <UNK> in the movie theater no i don't do that sort of thing i taped it off of cable tv and assure you i view it strictly in the <UNK> of my own home br br so i got to thinking why i taped it when i don't like it very much and conclude that 20 years ago i was on a <UNK> kick and the soundtrack of something wild does <UNK> feature <UNK> the closing credits start with the treat of sister carol performing her version of wild thing
<START> what about scream baby scream is supposed to make me not feel like a fool for buying it i bought it because god help me i'm a sucker for old b cinema even as worthless as this nonetheless something about this movie <UNK> me it's probably janet janet comes off cold <UNK> seemingly with the intention of coming off as deep and noble with a look on her face that screams <UNK> she can't seem to agree to anything her uptight boyfriend wants i'm glad that this is her only role what really <UNK> me is that this is a 1960's gore film gone terribly awry and as we all know awry is <UNK> for zero gore it's like the director started with a <UNK> lewis style but backed out of the gore scenes when his wife found out so instead we end up with one dull conversation after the other and basically a whole lot of irritating nothing in other words we end up with florida bore joseph <UNK> should be embarrassed boyfriend jason is almost as ridiculous as she is this guy has something negative to say about absolutely everything come to think of it he's probably the least likable good guy in horror history the only thing this movie really has going for it is that it carries that 60's early 70's b gore vibe that you can find in stuff like undertaker his pals blood freak or most anything from <UNK> lewis even rodney from the gruesome <UNK> is in this i <UNK> his <UNK> comedy routine was irritating most everything from reel to reel is stupid even the trip scene was stupid the only positive thing at all is the small amount of beach scenery but that mostly includes janet whining about life not being perfect in the only real ironic twist scream baby scream gets even less interesting once the story finally gets started around the 45 minute mark if you happen to be indifferent to whether or not your entertainment is watchable but are offended by the color red you might not hate this why does troma <UNK> this wouldn't this be something weird <UNK> area scream baby scream very well may be the worst in florida horror gore of its era but i suppose underneath the unlikeable characters and the incoherent plot lies potential scream baby scream really just seems like it should follow the blood feast pattern so to steal a quote from janet if it doesn't fit i throw it out 2 10
<START> this movie brings to mind boys <UNK> the hood menace to society south central and others of its <UNK> and even shares actors with some of them the film's us vs the law mentality is <UNK> by the all black neighborhood vs the nearly all white police force here the cops are so bad they seem like caricatures and in one scene they even <UNK> the boys as they drive by in a car they've just <UNK> from its owner it's like a <UNK> from an old western but the contemporary setting makes it look all too real br br the story centers on young jason petty and his buddies to whom school is just an <UNK> that takes time away from their real <UNK> of <UNK> cars this happens to be <UNK> n j a <UNK> belt city low on jobs but <UNK> high on crime in fact the problem is so severe that the cops all have car <UNK> written on their backs to show that an entire unit must be devoted to this particular crime br br the boys use a slim jim to <UNK> break into cars and go joy riding as if it's no big deal they only run into real trouble when the police <UNK> them the vicious nazi like lt has a <UNK> against the boys seeing them not as human beings who might be worthy of redemption but as human targets in fact he's a little reminiscent of that sadistic nazi officer of the <UNK> ghetto who shot down jews for pleasure in the film <UNK> list when the boys steal a police car in <UNK> for the <UNK> things predictably go downhill fast they are severely beaten by the cops and jason finally ends up in prison clearly these are bad boys who'd steal your car in a minute but the film wants us to see them as anti heroes showing jason protecting his sister and his friend taking care of his own grandmother the film left us wondering whose side to take and who to feel <UNK> for the boys whose lives are going down the drain the honest citizens whose cars are being stolen left and right and who could be caught in the <UNK> of a shootout at any moment or the city of <UNK> itself the spirit of whose law is being betrayed by brutal soul dead cops br br in spite of the over the top portrayal of the latter the film offers a realistic looking rendering of the ghetto of the protagonists and their families and of the culture of car <UNK> in a city where there appears to be only 2 career paths law <UNK> and crime strangely the entire subject of drugs is never mentioned br br the filmmakers including producer spike lee are obviously biased against the <UNK> police who we hope are not as bad they are portrayed here nevertheless they've given us yet another a strong affecting story about the inner city and black youth gone awry and <UNK> <UNK> is fine as jason
<START> i found this movie at a <UNK> store for 1 on vhs the interesting thing about it is that camp video bought up the rights to it and slapped on a 1986 <UNK> date in the credits anyways enough of odd facts br br this film is absolutely not scary to even call this horror or a thriller is laughable there were only maybe 5 minutes at most of what you would call horror in this 80 minute film and that consisted of the acting because it was <UNK> all <UNK> aside the writing for this film was absolute garbage as well just as the special effects and makeup was laughable no wonder this is such an obscure film probably the director has spent the last 35 years <UNK> the country for all existing copies of it and burning them in one big pile so no one else could be subjected to it
<START> i like many this evening <UNK> the <UNK> winter and long lines to see what i had anticipated to be one of the best movies of this year however i was left sadly wanting in many ways after the credits rolled but to be fair there were <UNK> qualities although very few let's start with what worked first the on point in every way  from their terrifying <UNK> to their sheer <UNK> the action <UNK> visceral  when it did occur <UNK> victor and sheen <UNK> perfect now what did not and there is plenty this was less a movie and more a <UNK> of sequences and do not expect to see any supporting characters from the other movies except and profoundly missing was a well written storyline and anything of real substance to bring these pieces of film together the story seemed to start right in the middle  at the <UNK> where <UNK> had made up his mind to rebel therefore there was no context no tension no sense of betrayal  the devices needed to make everything else work moreover it ended at where the climax should have begun which needed to be after the <UNK> had <UNK> for a bit oh and it was way too short <UNK> will also find offense in some liberties taken to certain facts previously revealed in the first two judge that for yourself in the end this movie <UNK> to long on what should have been brief background scenes e g various <UNK> scenes and as a consequence we never really got to know or care about the principal players or the movie <UNK> d
<START> i have just read what i believe to be an analysis of this film by a lyrical <UNK> lovely to read br br however a <UNK> analysis of this film is that it is a <UNK> of the seven deadly sins with the four types of justice br br envy greed pride <UNK> anger etc and justice in the forms of blind and divine br br i could demonstrate three examples of each one for each of the three protagonists however it is much more fun to note them for <UNK> br br this is an excellent film br br don't miss it
<START> as long as you don't mind paying a little more attention than you normally might for other films this is one of the best thrillers you'll ever see the film portrays an incident that might occur in real life nothing in it seems fictional at all in fact it also portrays how people might react in real life br br in fact it portrays these so well that is seems like real life combine that with the lack of a soundtrack and you've almost got the best news like movie you've ever seen jane fonda and jack lemmon are particularly good in this late seventies masterpiece <UNK> concern on her end and genuine tragic pity on his end i highly recommend it to anyone who likes thrillers
<START> each year the company called <UNK> produces couple of action packed full of suspense movies this little <UNK> called iii until i visited this site i wasn't this is a whole trilogy is a great example of the good job the company is doing frank is as mean as always and does a great job as almost <UNK> <UNK> i won't waste any more words since i don't want to reveal the terrific plot and ruin you a couple of great laughs br br rating 2 10 for those hard working man putting together this kind of rubbish must be
<START> one of the most charming and for me at least the most powerful elements of anthony enthralling best picture winner the english patient is that in the mid 90s when hollywood was in the initial stage of having lost its nerve for grand new projects a film was created that brought back powerful the sweeping wonderful <UNK> that crafted movies such as lawrence of <UNK> <UNK> and the ten <UNK> 1956 the english patient contains very much of what made those films so powerful it has that glorious feeling a stretched running time that hardly seems long at all and fascinating characters with <UNK> and stories br br the english patient based on a novel by the same name by michael is like the godfather part ii 1974 in the sense of how it's constructed it's a <UNK> of two stories the past and the present and it all revolves around the titular character an english patient in the post years of world war two ralph <UNK> plays the english patient who has been <UNK> for life by a plane crash and being taken care of in an isolated church by a single nurse played <UNK> by juliette <UNK> apart from bonding with her <UNK> voiced troubled patient <UNK> comes to learn about his past when a stranger willem dafoe arrives and the two men appear to know each other br br that's just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this film the other one told in flashback is the <UNK> past before he was <UNK> and dying in a bed the story of the present mixed with the <UNK> past and his love affair that <UNK> changed his life forever br br to be blunt the english patient is a love story <UNK> with a sweeping epic sensation and it <UNK> <UNK> what i really admired about the love story between ralph <UNK> and <UNK> scott thomas was how passionate how obsessive how enchanting it was shown on screen usually in love stories such as later cold mountain 2003 the romantic elements seem far more <UNK> than obsessive to me some of the love scenes feature elements that may tend to be associated more with lust than love but still because it is so well developed and not rushed and not exploited out of <UNK> we can believe that there is a sure true love between these characters it reminded me a lot of vertigo 1958 in how well the filmmakers and performers convinced us that these were two actual human beings who truly fell in love with each other br br performances all around were great i was especially enthralled by the performance by juliette <UNK> who took home the oscar for her performance the following year i also liked willem dafoe playing the sort of cynical questionable character that he's always quintessential at playing and of course i can't leave out <UNK> and scott thomas and their portrayals of two very passionate lovers br br despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic i would be <UNK> if i were to describe it as a perfect film there are two flaws that i cannot glance over number one it is a little too long and the reason for this is my second complaint there are a few unnecessary subplots i was not enchanted or particularly interested with the second love story between <UNK> and a bomb <UNK> played by andrews my research has led me to assume that this plot element comes from the original book and i'm sure it worked perfectly in there but in the film it just seems a and the relationship between the two characters didn't <UNK> me i was far more interested by <UNK> character and his relationships with his two leading actresses br br nevertheless these two flaws are easily forgivable even if they do slow things down a bit those put aside the english patient is an extraordinary achievement of film making to me it was sort of like an insane mix up between casablanca 1942 and lawrence of <UNK> <UNK> two remarkable and better films and this effective blend proved to be well worth my time it is a real shame that anthony has left us for he was a truly gifted filmmaker this is all the evidence anybody needs
<START> irene <UNK> is mesmerizing in this final installment of <UNK> trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it succeeds in <UNK> all three films together i am simply in awe of the amount of talent it took to do one of these stories let alone all three everything seems to fit together so precisely all the elements of filmmaking so <UNK> executed and the end result so much greater than the sum of the individual parts <UNK> is epic in nature and belongs on any list of great cinematic achievements simply brilliant
<START> i finally saw this on video after years of hearing about it it is by no means a perfect movie but it is oddly hypnotic one of those rare special films that creates its own world br br spoilers first the bad stuff the scenes in class are excruciating even if the subject is social studies this guy is way over the top his speeches are so overwrought they are laughable and no teachers i ever had would <UNK> their students like that and tell the ones who protest to shut up these scenes are brief but they break the mood and pull the viewer out of the story next how the heck does just walk out of the police station near the end also what happened to <UNK> car after the first scene of him riding into town he spends the rest of the film being around by or end spoilers br br <UNK> this guy is great dennis hopper effortlessly steals the movie in the mail i love company you're my friend every line is a classic he gives an internal logic that makes the story work incredibly he actually makes the audience feel empathy for this guy especially when <UNK> talks about his <UNK> future br br by contrast <UNK> glover is hard to take sometimes yet the scenes of him driving around in the beetle are perfect kids with cars in high school always have something to do and <UNK> to do it with <UNK> low key attitude makes a good foil for their friendship is believable <UNK> mannerisms are a little much but he is consistent throughout he drives the plot and exudes a sense of urgency that no one else does just try to imagine this flick if were as much of a zombie as matt or <UNK> <UNK> br br spoilers what makes <UNK> edge unsettling is the fact that <UNK> is not really evil in the usual sense he is kind of a boring guy who got sick of being taken for granted in other words he is like thousands of other boring guys after he kills jamie he starts to unravel which creates some suspense as we wait to see when he will snap again end spoilers br br part of this movie's appeal is the way the action stays centered around the teens and their point of view the parents are comic relief mom tony's dad or overwhelmed <UNK> mom this <UNK> how the kids hang together for the attention no one else gives them it keeps the story focused on the relationships within the <UNK> and <UNK> that the only adult they can relate to is <UNK> edge is a <UNK> on alienation it conveys how awkward mysterious and <UNK> <UNK> is like no other film
<START> barney is just awful as many of the other reviews on this show say i'm not one to disagree with them i won't because i hate this show just as much as they do they use kids that look like they're in sixth grade cheesy plots horrid dialog and really crappy special effects not to mention that big purple dinosaur himself he makes every other kid show look like award winners <UNK> street has won awards that i know about br br please just watch <UNK> street thomas the tank engine or even the <UNK> avoid both this and its movie which i also reviewed they are both extremely crappy and are inappropriate to anyone even little babies
<START> putting aside the i'm so sure s and totally <UNK> s this is one of the <UNK> and <UNK> romances portrayed on film deborah <UNK> where is she now as julie and nicolas cage as randy are as classic as romeo and juliet tony and maria jake and samantha you can't help but fall in love with them plus the soundtrack the sparks the <UNK> the <UNK> and of course modern english is also outstanding for fans of films about young love i'd equally recommend the recent film all the real girls by david gordon green
<START> this film has a really weird mixture of genres toilet humour and action in one it doesn't really pull it off it should have stuck to one genre the best thing i can say about the movie is that the dog in it is cute br br the most disturbing sequence is in the middle of the film when <UNK> sandler and carter wayans decide to stop off at a hunting <UNK> motel i'm not quite sure what the point of this sequence is it just seems gratuitous in the extreme the <UNK> of the hunting <UNK> charlie is a very nerdy looking guy for some reason <UNK> starts a conversation with charlie about porno <UNK> off homosexual sex sex in a <UNK> charlie's photo of his wife appears to be charlie dressed in drag there is no reason for this really juvenile dialogue and scene anyway the whole scene seems to be directed to the moment when a naked <UNK> ends up with <UNK> gun up his butt and charlie sees them through the window it all <UNK> of school boy humour about homosexuality horrified and <UNK> all at the same time which i don't find funny at all br br i have a friend who is always raving about adam sandler movies this is the first one i've seen after this i'm not sure i want to see any more br br btw this is my husband's account he's seen happy <UNK> and he tells me it's quite good maybe i should give sandler just one more chance br br <UNK>
<START> sometime ago i watched a video of paul thomas anderson in which he express the big interest that he has in porn films and how this industry could've produce better films and in consequence a complete genre and not just sex in video tape paul thomas anderson put his own believes of porn industry in the character played in a terrific way by burt reynolds his name is jack <UNK> a director whose biggest dream is to make a real film that can keep the viewer in suspense because of the great dramatic story and at the same time exciting with the and with the big <UNK> and tits soon as he meets eddie adams mark he believes that he has found the new star for his films and that's how the story of the young eddie in the porn industry begins br br the film begins with a sequence inside a night club where we can see all the persons that will be part of <UNK> life and later we can see them outside the porn industry living their daily routine but soon we can see them inside the porn industry and after only one party the story of the new eddie begins the story of <UNK> <UNK> all of them will taste the real success with <UNK> as the main star winning lots of <UNK> and helping jack to make real his biggest dream with a series of films about <UNK> <UNK> the new character of <UNK> this sort of exploitation films are an amazing success and for jack are his <UNK> real films but here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the horrible 80's when there is going to be ex drugs and rock roll for <UNK> and pals but we all know that the <UNK> can destroy any person and the <UNK> can destroy any porn star and here the film focuses in their lives after the total success and how everybody is having a real bad time with many problems due to <UNK> bad look to porn industry and to a period with many <UNK> in <UNK> after trying and failing in the music industry there's a brilliant sequence that can resume in a perfect way how the things are going for <UNK> and his friends that sequence is the one of his first drug deal with the appearance of alfred <UNK> which ends in a total mess is funny for us and a terrible experience for <UNK> and pals but there's always a solution if you get back in what you know and when <UNK> is back <UNK> is back br br well i haven't mention most of the characters in my sort of a summary but i must say that all are amazingly well developed the cast is just superb with the best performance that i have seen of mark <UNK> moore has a powerful performance in a really moving character <UNK> macy hoffman heather graham <UNK> etc are just memorable all of their characters with funny and sad moments br br finally i really love the amazing cinematic style of anderson here with a unique view to the porn industry of the late 70's and early 80's i used to say that <UNK> was my favourite of anderson but right now after watching all except sidney i can't say that i have a favourite because i love them all br br ps somewhere i read that this film is the scorsese film of anderson so i'm more than sure that if you love <UNK> and casino you will love this one too i f <UNK> love boogie nights
<START> i <UNK> believe how well this kid did on screen you will completely forget that they are actors and loose yourself in the movie it is like watching home movies with a twist i <UNK> this to everyone highly
<START> throughout watching end of days i got the sense that the film makers were perhaps trying to make this unique to the average hollywood action film they failed of course but you have to give them credit for trying peter actually tried directing this time instead of just <UNK> out another flat action film he attempted to <UNK> atmosphere into the movie by <UNK> the lights and adding tons of blood this method can work if used correctly see <UNK> but here it just feels like a cheap trick to try and scare us is a decent action director and offers nothing more here than basic shoot outs and fight scenes except for the lackluster sub par f x end battle as a photographer demonstrates actual ability displaying some good frame work and movement but it is nothing above solid work br br screenwriter andrew <UNK> is the film's greatest enemy at parts the script actually shows the <UNK> of good religious thriller and at times it even shows some quasi intellectual thought the temptation scene between arnold and gabriel <UNK> but these small <UNK> are <UNK> out by a river of <UNK> generic dialogue characters plot holes and convenient plot points that just happen to point all the characters in the right direction are just a few of the standard hollywood black holes screenplay falls into the shadow of the good movie it could have been faded very quickly br br the film surprisingly has a good cast arnold still <UNK> that larger than life attitude tries to play a depressed on the edge cop with no more than average results stick to be the <UNK> hero arnie it's what your good at gabriel <UNK> is the strong point of the ensemble bringing a nice air of cynicism to the role of satan in a villainous role <UNK> for overacting <UNK> <UNK> himself and it adds a bit more menace to the character kevin <UNK> as normal is able to bring at least a few chuckles to the movie but he's done better also look for a stellar small role from rod <UNK> br br looked like he was trying to separate this from the <UNK> mass of hollywood action films he was heading in the right direction but had neither the script or originality to take it there br br 4 10
<START> i watch <UNK> blues every time it comes on it brings back happy times for me i grow up in a big city in the mid west it reminds me of when i was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same it makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost the big <UNK> of day are under the age of <UNK> will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other i hope that i was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past the music was great in this movie i truly felt like this should have gone to the theaters i would have paid to see it as i viewed the movie for the second time i figured out who life this movie was about he did an superb job in writing and producing this film i guess who better to produce a film based on your life other than you as soon as i can i will be <UNK> a copy for my home use i <UNK> enjoy black producer or directors they make such film feel like you were actually living in the time right than thanks for such a great movie
<START> i went and saw this movie last night after being <UNK> to by a few friends of mine i'll admit that i was reluctant to see it because from what i knew of <UNK> <UNK> he was only able to do comedy i was wrong <UNK> played the character of jake <UNK> very well and kevin <UNK> played ben randall with such <UNK> the sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions this one did exactly that the entire theater which was sold out was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie and were moved to tears during the second half while <UNK> the theater i not only saw many women in tears but many full grown men as well trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying this movie was great and i suggest that you go see it before you judge
<START> this type of show is not supposed to happen on television this is the type of <UNK> usually reserved for independent film this is what only hbo is supposed to do fact is that denis <UNK> has managed to come up with one of the best television shows ever easily joining the ranks of the sopranos oz ed etc kudos the gang at abc for showing that <UNK> blue was not a <UNK> and to mr <UNK> and his gang for creating a truly unique viewing experience my only complaint is that the show is not long enough an hour would make it better but i can't wait for the next episode
<START> one of low budget horror <UNK> actor john <UNK> more animated roles as a implied nazi scientist who is turning humans into zombies to serve the <UNK> mindless <UNK> brain dead only able to <UNK> the most simple of orders bit like staff in <UNK> br br hitler isn't mentioned by name since america wasn't at war at the time they was filmed but it's pretty obvious who the bad guys are working for br br there seems to be two types of zombies in film the traditional voodoo type popular in the old black white films of the 1930's and <UNK> blank eyed and just following the <UNK> of someone else as they stumble along and then there is the type we know from later films like 'the night of the living <UNK> and 'the evil dead ' still <UNK> about but with only the intention to kill and eat the flesh and brains of their victims both have their moments in various movies over the years br br features the former zombie type although these are particularly goofy looking and would look more at home in an old time freak shows as <UNK> as they bite the heads off <UNK> one black zombie named <UNK> with his wild hair looks like a young don king br br as to the plot the evil doctor decides to make his wife a zombie along with the others and that's where he makes his mistake even though he lets her keep her heels as a nice <UNK> touch as he turns her into one of the living dead she's not happy about it br br it all goes horribly wrong and ends in tears and the moral of the tale must be never ever turn your wife into a zombie it's just asking for trouble br br the film is interesting enough and it quickly rolls along to a finish but never rises above it's poverty row origins not a <UNK> on any true zombie classics but fun just the same
<START> after the suicide of his father charlie <UNK> davis ray boom <UNK> accepts the <UNK> and advice of his friend tiny michael <UNK> and travels to las vegas with him trying to become a boxer on the road they meet gina jennifer <UNK> <UNK> they give a lift to her and she becomes charlie's girlfriend johnny <UNK> rod <UNK> is convinced by tiny to be charlie's couch and the powerful agent alex <UNK> joe <UNK> after watching him fighting becomes his manager promoting charlie's career this movie is so boring that it indeed does not deserve to spend much time writing about it i do not like boxing but sometimes i watch some worthwhile movie about this theme but this one is horrible predictable full of clichés having an awful lead actor a pure waste of time my vote is three br br title brazil e <UNK> body and <UNK>
<START> boston <UNK> movies have some strengths mostly in that the pacing is swift and the hero is <UNK> <UNK> in even the worst circumstances but the plotting is frequently atrocious and the <UNK> comic bits often kill the pacing if the plot happens to be <UNK> good or are just unfunny and inappropriate br br this one involves <UNK> chasing an <UNK> from the asylum steve <UNK> in a really poor performance who has become <UNK> on beautiful nina <UNK> who puts in a nice rather subtle acting job inspector of course believes <UNK> has gone homicidal maniac he at least has some evidence in this one for that and is <UNK> trying to jail him as <UNK> goes after the real killer the plot has possibilities but any time any real tension gets going we a get a not funny comedy routine it doesn't seem like anyone at columbia understood that in a movie about a pursuit of a really dangerous maniac cute little comedy scenes about hiding an <UNK> body from the inspector <UNK> any willing suspension of disbelief one just concludes our clever hero is an idiot deadly for a film like this br br this one is not worth the time for a well plotted episode of this series see <UNK> boston <UNK>
<START> when i saw that this film was being aired on late night tv i initially decided to give it a miss i am glad that i then started watching yes the special effects are the same as <UNK> <UNK> puppet shows some of the actors actresses are from his other productions he obviously used the same composer later on as the cheesy soundtrack could only have come from one of his productions and the plot is as slow as a wet weekend get by all that and you have a film that shows up intriguing possibilities is there a planet on the far side of the sun is it a <UNK> earth is everything about it <UNK> and if so do they speak english in reverse i love this dated sf if only for <UNK> wonderful model cars planes buildings and <UNK> some of them are not so far fetched as they seemed back then and did you see the european space centre <UNK> very reminiscent of the euro <UNK> of today suspend belief and spend a couple of hours watching this you will be glad you did

<START> from what i remember seeing of this film it was not good i always say that if a film is good and can keep you attention throughout the hardest of moments example a <UNK> cold <UNK> war than it is a film that has done its job the fact that i was asleep for most of this film only proves the fact that it could not keep my attention and <UNK> it did not complete its job why did i fall victim to the <UNK> cold <UNK> when i had a film in my <UNK> br br to begin committed did not make any sense the acting was poor and the overall story left more doors opened that just couldn't be closed i am thinking of the moment when i swear i saw affleck and graham brother and sister in this film kissing that didn't make any sense then there was a scene with affleck and his roommates <UNK> that he was sleeping with one of them almost breaking up a perfect lesbian couple i suppose this was to show that most are not as committed to a relationship as graham is but for me it just was nothing more than filler i have this suspicious feeling that the director of this film was sleeping with affleck his acting in this film was atrocious i mean i have never seen him do any good acting but this was by far the worst oh i just had another moment during the battle come through my mind and i confirmed it with imdb com what was john stewart doing in this film that was yet again another moment when my eyes were opened just for a moment in one of those battles that seemed to last forever br br and frankly it's heather graham we could care less about her after a while she's just not interesting she's just bland boring and basically stops acting after a while while they desperately start throwing wacky characters into the mix to revive the movie it just doesn't work and instead of just calling it a day they start throwing more characters into the mix so now it's just weird tedious boring and really really long luke <UNK> slow <UNK> acting style slows an already <UNK> movie to dead halt why exactly were these two married committed is a truly terrible film the kind of hip comedy that leaves you <UNK> out depressed and bored br br grade out of
<START> the story of an obsessed lover <UNK> khan and the <UNK> he goes to get his true love <UNK> <UNK> who's already married to her husband sunny <UNK> the film is considered one of <UNK> <UNK> best performances and won him acclaim from critics and audiences alike fear that your love may not be <UNK> fear that you may lose the one you love fear that your beloved could have a change of heart in short fear is the villain in every love story br br but in fear is the ultimate expression of passion of obsession and of sacrifice is <UNK> khan story whose love and obsession for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> him from all fears of life death is sunny <UNK> story whose enduring love and passion for <UNK> gives him the courage to face the fear of death br br and finally is story who is caught between one man's love and another man's obsession she fears one fears for the other one stands for love the other for life in this battle between love life the supreme victor is love because love always wins in life death simply <UNK> is one of the best indian films ever made
<START> to judge a movie just for the landscapes <UNK> costumes it is just not right you are missing the core the story br br a movie has to <UNK> something to tell a story something that impress you yes i was pleased by the sea <UNK> clear water and all that but there is the plot br br they are more interesting movies with mad people such as flight over the <UNK> s nest etc etc this one is about a crazy woman who is more attached to dogs than his children or his husband just a clear psychiatric case nothing extraordinary unfortunately a waste of time and there is all that rage coming from fish smell sea
<START> this often <UNK> movie is a must for fans of blake <UNK> julie andrews henry <UNK> or hollywood musicals other writers have commented on the shifts in tone the confusion of plot etc but the film has many things to recommend it the score is one of henry <UNK> best and he has written many wonderful ones several songs are sung to perfection by andrews <UNK> performance is nuanced and she is <UNK> out in some beautiful clothes she is at her absolutely <UNK> here the on location shots are breath taking and there are some funny inspector <UNK> type sight gags to boot rock hudson basically <UNK> in his performance but he is <UNK> good a real curiosity item in that it was the last major film julie did for about 10 years and in many ways is a <UNK> to victor victoria it is lovely to look at and listen to when will it be available on dvd when it is i for one would like both versions the longer and shorter director's cut since it was <UNK> in s o b they would make a great two pack
<START> i watched this film on telly the other night and little did i know what a cringe fest it would be i knew it would be stupid but not this bad this film <UNK> everything that is awful in australian comedy apart from the most tedious uninspired scenarios and characters i have ever come across aside from those dubious french produced american tax break comedies most of the situations were boring unbelievable stereotypical and so not funny just terrible br br one such scenario that really annoyed me was the <UNK> on the bus scene from a screen writing perspective the writers used the most uninteresting not to mention unbelievable scenario to get these three stranded without their <UNK> they are on the holiday of their lives and they're going to risk it all including a 300 <UNK> <UNK> and room to <UNK> their rights to dance on a bus i mean they're about half an hour away from their destination at least they could have had the bus driver kick them off but no they leave willingly <UNK> <UNK> can't take it anymore <UNK> wreck their holiday anyway i can't believe the writers didn't <UNK> this appalling scenario out i think a ten year old could come up with 5 set ups more clever funny and believable br br i can go on with many others the really unimaginative stereotypical psychopath the whole relationship with the angry <UNK> girlfriend and tag along virgin the <UNK> man out there <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stuff on the train everything was just <UNK> i cannot think of one redeeming feature of the this film except that maybe the third wheel nerd was kind of cute <UNK> his career by appearing in this trash though
<START> brian what the hell were you on when you signed to do this br br i saw this recently at a festival and it was <UNK> by howling laughter throughout by the time the credits rolled tears were <UNK> down the faces of many of the audience br br the plot is a clunky <UNK> of r ' and 'the x <UNK> as <UNK> aimed at the tv audience as is possible to get without being <UNK> the sequences involving the <UNK> are hilarious both <UNK> staging of the from the and mad <UNK> pathetic plastic aliens drew <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> laughter br br limp camp and stupid my only hope is that it was an <UNK> as awful as <UNK> of the living dead <UNK> was good br br
<START> in this film there is a loose plot of a man <UNK> who wishes to obtain <UNK> for his construction business and marries a woman he does not love the wide eyed maria de in the process he maintains his passionate relationship with his first and true love and ultimately gets <UNK> in his own romantic web he never gives up his <UNK> act until the three main characters come face to face the film results boring with lots of free sex well both girls are really good all the reactions in the film are absurd incoherent and of course too much stupid none of the characters are believable which makes the movie a little annoying anyway the acting is surprisingly good for such a bad directed film which makes it a little interesting but if you can watch another film please
<START> there are those who <UNK> that this is not the opera but then they don't <UNK> with the film of <UNK> that was not the original show either all films of musicals operas are and have to be adaptations or they don't work <UNK> took more liberties with the original show than did the film of and <UNK> and yet it kept its original integrity <UNK> the material and is judged an artistic success the same holds true for and <UNK> it <UNK> the opera into a dialogue song <UNK> because audiences at the time loved musicals but stayed away from the few <UNK> filmed operas it would have been <UNK> suicide for preminger to produce a film of the opera it would have lost a fortune for the <UNK> studios br br that said this is a fine adaptation the acting is excellent the oscar winning <UNK> of andre <UNK> is magnificent as is the <UNK> singing and the individual vocal achievements are incredible robert dad of popular musician bobby dubbed and adele <UNK> dubbed <UNK> while sammy davis jr sang his own songs in the film his recording contract would not <UNK> his voice to be heard on the soundtrack album so cab <UNK> recorded his numbers spectacularly for that release <UNK> <UNK> bass <UNK> is extraordinary and pearl <UNK> is her own unique self <UNK> <UNK> although a singer of fine note has the small role of clara which required a high soprano so old reliable <UNK> <UNK> dubbed her singing br br the gershwin estate hates the film and refuses to grant the musical rights although the dramatic rights are in the public <UNK> this sort of hate <UNK> held up the video release of <UNK> for almost fifteen years although in that case it was the dramatic rights that were in <UNK> and is currently <UNK> both and <UNK> and annie get your gun from being released on video br br of all the stage productions given film versions it is these latter two which are the sole <UNK> to video only a campaign of letters to the gershwin estate in ny might <UNK> up the <UNK>
<START> i have to <UNK> all the terrible comments i love this movie i own the movie and the soundtrack i watch it whenever i need a pick me up granted it's not like the sound of music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing i <UNK> the late and great bobby and james has always and will always be a favorite i saw this when it first came out in the theaters i'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than <UNK> in the boyfriend it's a modern musical and shouldn't be judged by all that went before it's just the best for <UNK> like me who wish they could find this place no illness no wars no drugs all the bad things in life are gone this is nothing more than a feel good movie that is what all movies should be about shaun phillips title song is superb and explains the entire feel of the movie if the acting isn't the greatest who cares i love the idea of the movie peter <UNK> a very stiff actor <UNK> gorgeous as ever sally <UNK> surprisingly good voice michael york typical and olivia <UNK> stunning all convinced me they were normal run of the mill people not one of them acted like actors in a movie they acted like real people the same way i would act if i found this place torn between going home and staying there in awe of everything yes there are flaws in this movie but get over it it's not citizen kane it's a feel good musical
<START> where da <UNK> code introduced us to dr robert <UNK> and his knack for solving <UNK> angels and demons ups the <UNK> by providing a huge puzzle with an 8 hour limit br br with a cast of award winning actors ron howard does a good job of directing a story that was easy to follow and even easier to accept the da <UNK> code threw so many angles at you in such a short time that a quick bathroom break would leave you a bit confused on return i didn't feel this was with angels and demons the plot was straight forward and the action kept the interest level <UNK> throughout br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was easily my favorite character in the movie his portrayal of the <UNK> yet misunderstood rank of the catholic church was very good and combined with the victim of his treatment patrick <UNK> ewan <UNK> you will find yourself choosing sides immediately upon introduction there isn't a great amount of tom hanks time as the film focuses more on story than character development and this did well with me being that i had more than enough introduction from the first movie br br unfortunately i found character to be an unnecessary femme assistant in the quest since her lines were a bit limited and seemed much like an <UNK> she does play a key role in the beginning of things but she soon fades into the background of being <UNK> familiar more so than a necessary partner br br the plot is as such one of the <UNK> that the catholic church <UNK> in the past there have been quite a few has sought revenge in a most artistic manner some men of the church are kidnapped and are set to be executed at specific times until an ultimate end to the church itself will happen dr robert <UNK> is brought in to help <UNK> the clues and teams up with the beautiful a scientist who witnessed a colleague die at the hands of the <UNK> enemy br br music staying relevant and the cinematography beautiful i could <UNK> on about this <UNK> things but what makes angels and demons absolutely work is it's conclusion it was by far one of the most amazingly surprising endings i have seen in a movie and i was impressed at how off guard i was when it hit me like anyone else i appreciate a great wrap up and this movie <UNK> it up quite tight and drops a pretty bow on it needless to say i left the theater pleased at the movie in it's entirety br br if you are religious and unsure if this movie will offend your catholic principles i can say that where the <UNK> code painted <UNK> as a shady cover up group of <UNK> angels and demons paints them with a much lighter brush the church is shown as being a collective of good men who are made to suffer for the sins of evil and misguided men who wore their colors and even a few who have <UNK> their modern ranks
<START> i have neither read the book on which the movie is based nor the letters between <UNK> and <UNK> if i came to this movie with any expectations whatsoever it was maybe that the group including among others virginia <UNK> and which the were part of would be depicted it wasn't which however wasn't a problem for me what i am wondering about is how the people behind this movie managed to make it in my opinion so very uninteresting and repetitive and most of the characters flat in spite of great material and some very good actors the script is simply not good enough i agree with the criticism of my <UNK> neighbor too many pointless sex scenes but only between the women while there is nothing explicit whatsoever concerning <UNK> numerous love affairs too many pointless scenes in general too little information about the background of characters it seems odd considering the quality of the production on the surface it seems a really ambitious piece of work but the script holds of course the most weight and that is where this movie fails br br <UNK> relationship with harold struck me as unconvincing although both of them act really well especially her the way they kept <UNK> their <UNK> love for each other in a rather sappy manner i thought well simply unconvincing it makes a lot more sense that it should have happened through letters as points out i would also have liked to know where the <UNK> came from the russian ones as well as <UNK> why ever is someone called <UNK> given the <UNK> <UNK> it might be small stuff but it matters in <UNK> to the bigger picture br br i watched the movie with english subtitles on and where it should apparently have said it said instead that might explain my frustration with the <UNK> to some extent i could not understand why <UNK> should be greek while <UNK> was russian
<START> this was a fantastically written screenplay when it comes to <UNK> things from another perspective the comedy was <UNK> and not overdone the acting was generally terrific and the plot line served a greater purpose of <UNK> <UNK> when we think about people solely based on their <UNK> appearance the plot twists as the brother sister character of amanda <UNK> tries to play soccer on the boys team finding instead a new love interest along the way <UNK> <UNK> is where the real lies and he does a fine job of acting <UNK> at first later coming to realize the most important thing in life is friendship not attitude
<START> this was a very funny movie not oscar worthy but <UNK> the best dollar i've ever spent at blockbuster rupert <UNK> jones is a shining star and very well might be the new jude law so if you're in the mood for a british teen flick rent it
<START> this movie was horrendous it was sorta like accidentally watching a gay porn waiting for the girls but they just don't come i waited for almost 2 hours for the damn scarecrows they just don't come instead it's just some dumb ass wandering through a dead <UNK> with a camera it's a mix of <UNK> witch and some bad episode of the twilight zone and the best part is that as of october 23 2005 they started filming a sequel please don't be fooled by the box even though it looks exactly the same as the first dark <UNK> it's not lions gate bought the rights to the <UNK> the movie and had the brilliant idea to release it as the sequel to the original dark <UNK> which i thought was funny the only thing they had in common was they were both shot in a <UNK> this movie not scare the crop out of you like the first one so just stay away
<START> is upset that he never has a big party like all the other kids <UNK> and the gang seek to <UNK> that by giving him a surprise party unaware that all the <UNK> and <UNK> are for him <UNK> everything only to find out too late that the party is for him br br okay our gang comedy works in fits and starts the bits work but i don't think it really works as a whole part of the problem is that we all know where this is going and since much of the humor needs to have some form of surprise for it to work the whole thing falls down i think in a weird way the film just sort of misses its the type of thing that had they actually thought about it might have <UNK> to something more than a misfire worth trying if you lower your expectations
<START> this <UNK> from before the days of the production code and the <UNK> office is good fun not great but entertaining br br based on a song by rogers hart that was an enormous hit at the time the story revolves around dance hall girl barbara stanwyck who is <UNK> by wealthy businessman <UNK> cortez who was <UNK> handsome but whose heart belongs to her <UNK> neighbor monroe she and marry but keep it a secret while she <UNK> cortez who still holds out hope she helps <UNK> get a job in <UNK> company but married bliss quickly turns sour as develops a taste for the high life and steps out with a college sweetheart and <UNK> in high stakes bridge <UNK> i know it's pretty funny finally he <UNK> 5 000 from cortez and is about to go on the <UNK> when his devoted wife goes to cortez and i won't reveal anything else although the ending was certainly a surprise br br stanwyck is the best thing about this movie in one of her earliest roles she's quite accomplished is the weak point he's unattractive and <UNK> while cortez is amazingly suave and sexy while his performance is earnest but <UNK> br br while ostensibly a drama it's filled with laughs many as some elements of this movie have aged very poorly but there are a lot of good witty lines at one point stanwyck says to cortez my brains are in my feet while yours are in that's pretty darn suggestive for 1931 there's a lot of <UNK> and suggestive stuff in this flick in the last days before the code down and <UNK> everything an amusing <UNK> a good reminder of how far we haven't come in 70 years this story could very easily be changed to fit 2003 but could keep the basic plot with the original ending in place
<START> also known as the tormented or the or the ridiculously titled the eerie midnight horror show is a forgotten exorcist rip off which contains one of the best horror moments i've ever seen the scene is when the <UNK> comes alive this great spooky scene is unforgettable and totally effective great <UNK> it's a shame the rest of the movie doesn't maintain the level of creepiness <UNK> during that scene br br this is one of the most frustrating movies ever imagine the producers deciding to to make an exorcist copy but while making it they actually succeed in creating something truly original a possessed <UNK> of <UNK> man which is shocking when you think about it but then completely forgets their original idea in order to make a boring and uninspired exorcist rip off had the film continued with the possessed <UNK> concept with the characters trying to destroy it etc this film would have <UNK> but once the girl becomes possessed by the spirit of the <UNK> she never tells anyone from where the demon came from she and the script completely forgets the haunted <UNK> which is stupid br br if you like so called euro cult movies the first 45 minutes deliver unlike any other euro cult movies but after the scene when the girl has a vision of being <UNK> and she gets the remaining 45 minutes suck boring it goes nowhere fast as it tries to <UNK> badly the exorcist so watch the first 45 minutes of and enjoy the 1970s fashions the sleaze and the amazing statue comes alive to <UNK> the girl scene but after the first 45 minutes press stop and <UNK> and might as well go clip your <UNK>
<START> what i enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of being greek i adore my country and i liked the <UNK> director's point of view based on a true story during the years when <UNK> was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war nazis and <UNK> an italian soldier and a greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make nicholas cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this <UNK> in the beginning love i <UNK> christian <UNK> playing the <UNK> husband to be he looks very very good as a greek his personality matched the one of the greek <UNK> a true fighter in there or what one of the movies i would like to buy and keep it in my collection for ever
<START> i had the misfortune to watch this last night on the bbc i expect i may have been the only viewer from the beginning there was something quite wrong about the movie after a few minutes of viewing i managed to work out what it was the movie was bad not bad in a good way like <UNK> or a seagal film just plain old shoddy bad br br why was this made into a movie i've seen a few episodes of the tv series and thought it was alright but i only saw repeats of that because they made this br br i spent most of the film trying to work out what the story was and by the end i was none the <UNK> i seem to remember at some point a character maybe mentions that the <UNK> squad can get in to places regular cops can't the turns out to be a one of the <UNK> places to get into maybe it was student night i lost track of the plot at this point or maybe there was no plot and the movie was just chopped together from various <UNK> from other tv series remakes br br was it an action comedy i don't remember any laughs br br overall this movie lacked the real scene stealing power of someone like seymour hoffman as the bad guy with him <UNK> would have had somebody to <UNK> off
<START> lou <UNK> jr is an excellent and captivating actor but to have him take the role of a president and then have him act like he's james bond running around carrying a gun and entering a warehouse to <UNK> a plot to kill christians and then being able to escape the supposedly high security facility to live another day does not do him justice this movie has so many <UNK> issues br br i will attempt to list just a few br br 1 what was the purpose of a <UNK> if no one is for example the preacher could have been if the <UNK> force already had <UNK> on hand later buck <UNK> wife goes to be with the sick preacher and she herself becomes sick so was the virus therefore <UNK> if it was <UNK> then why did ray and his wife go into the church without proper protection why didn't they become sick too and when chloe <UNK> the wine and was <UNK> how did she suddenly know the wine was the <UNK> was it california wine ordinary red table wine could red <UNK> juice been adequate and if the preacher had received <UNK> at least every time he <UNK> maybe he would have had anti <UNK> flowing through his body already buck and chloe got a heavy box of <UNK> that was never used what mysterious message should we see in that br br 2 the presentation of evil forces who are working with the anti christ <UNK> to destroy the world as being russian chinese etc is really a <UNK> of the 1950's and the early james bond era and shows an ignorance of modern society and of humanity are we to believe that russians and chinese are <UNK> trying to destroy this planet and for what purpose mere destruction this was such a narrow minded view of this world and was so cliché as to be laughable br br 3 the main purpose of this movie was the scene near the very end where kirk cameron and lou <UNK> jr are <UNK> the non <UNK> in the audience by showing kirk <UNK> lou it was a movie with no meaningful storyline too many <UNK> with reality and a completely inappropriate plot for a great actor br br i therefore rank this as a 1 since zero is not available
<START> the movie uses random events of historical significance as its backdrop and willy <UNK> <UNK> crosses the lives and time lines of its 3 central characters to what purpose one may ask the problem with this film is that the script becomes the <UNK> not characters or their lives br br it starts off with a bunch of rich <UNK> college kids and a couple of not so rich too drawn into the movement affair <UNK> and <UNK> follows people go their own ways seemingly only till the heroine forces herself upon them not once but twice after a pause in the the next <UNK> for these 3 is the <UNK> <UNK> on the country by <UNK> gandhi lots of political figures <UNK> around for no obvious reason the sub plots are too contrived and don't add up to make a logical whole br br the movie tries to <UNK> a false pace but never reaches a true rhythm barely coherent at times there is no <UNK> and growth whatsoever in the <UNK> of the 3 ex college buddies even after they are presumably married engaged settled or whatever they are ever too eager to just <UNK> it all and head off to a village to have sex with the ex lover or ex flame what <UNK> imagination the screen writer possesses so many 4 letter words are used without any rhyme or reason that its downright abusive br br <UNK> has a horrible american accent that she doesn't try to hide its hideous hearing her mouth cliché ridden dialog like up i didn't think you'd <UNK> this after the <UNK> nightmare she's just been thru or in the beginning 'i appreciate your concern but i can take care of <UNK> <UNK> what kind of clown wrote the dialogs for this she invites her friend in to have a cup of <UNK> no less coffee wishes someone good morning and then is wished good night by someone else in the family now whats up with that br br the countless uncredited villagers and are the best actors the editing is really <UNK> with too many cuts obviously trying hard to make a bold statement <UNK> <UNK> screwed up big time on this one
<START> an excellent debut movie for the the director of batman begins comes the following a movie about a man who follows other people for inspiration of characters in stories he writes one man he follows he decides to go further and the man turns out to be more than he <UNK> for br br using a cast of non actors and his uncle writing directing producing and otherwise completely making this movie entirely on his own with almost no budget and produced <UNK> this movie is much more than you'd expect br br for anyone who likes <UNK> and complex twists turns shocks and messing around with time this is definitely a movie for you
<START> <UNK> <UNK> wrote several novels all involving sex and melodrama and a few of them actually were made into films including this effort and they all have the distinction of being some of the worst films ever made story here is about robin stone john phillip law and his rise to the top of television by being ruthless and <UNK> to everyone around him he's a playboy of the worst sort using and then throwing away every woman he <UNK> including the wife of the network president br br spoiler alert greg austin robert ryan is in charge of the television network and when his younger wife <UNK> takes one look at robin she wastes no time getting into bed with him greg falls ill and has to take some time off and this is where robin steps in and starts trying to run the network but during all this a model named amanda <UNK> <UNK> who is in love with him kills herself when greg returns to his job he tries to get rid of robin by using the morals <UNK> in his contract when rumors start flying about his relationship with jerry nelson david <UNK> who's a gay fashion photographer br br this was directed by jack <UNK> jr who went on to be a very successful producer in both television and movies but this was only his second film as a director and the material he was forced to deal with seems way over his head the script comes from novel and that would probably be why this resembles a cross between <UNK> and the valley of the dolls and i think the reason why her books never could translate well onto film is because the filmmakers made the terrible mistake of taking her stories seriously instead of tongue in cheek with that the laughs that come from this are unintentional especially during that totally ridiculous fight towards the end of the film which starts when cannon refuses to give back the slave <UNK> to the gay characters <UNK> was a very good actor but his role here is completely over the top and it has him wearing one of the worst <UNK> in history and using the term <UNK> in every other sentence law was not the original choice for the lead but another actor that was cast had a serious accident and law stepped in and delivers one of the more wooden performances this side of miles <UNK> the film's script suffers in two different areas in that it's both completely silly and horribly dull and it will test a viewers patience if they choose to watch this one has to wonder what would be the outcome if a director decided to film one of novels and not take it seriously because the attempt here is <UNK> and ridiculous
<START> this movie starts off as a college flick but turns pretty ugly after the main character's sister is gang raped by a biker gang driving a van it has a pretty good pace and james van <UNK> does a pretty good job in this cannon tax write off movie this was the first movie i ever saw at the drive in here in toronto the main feature was <UNK> city and young warriors was the added feature out of the 2 movies young warriors was by far more entertaining and memorable if you are a fan of blow 'em up <UNK> violent movies this one would make a great addition to any collection
<START> action packed with my favorite type of creature i won't give any of it away if you <UNK> seen it cause it's worth taking the time to sit down and unravel in the mystery of things as presented in this film it did gets slow at times and those were the moments my mind wondered which does easily anyways but <UNK> of it kept me quietly thrilled where you keep it in your head instead of letting it out probably the mood i was in at the time special effects and action sequences you could feel made up for the occasional <UNK> of course a of movies out there exactly like this the film still has it's own style and flavor which i respect from underground independent horror movies anyways
<START> no wonder a lot of us hate classical music and what are the children to think with educational <UNK> like this serious music will soon slip from life support to the <UNK> kids know when they're being talked down to and this is no exception why can't someone good do a movie about classical music for kids i must admit i enjoyed the actor who played <UNK> he took to the role with enthusiasm and a keen balance of the poignant and humorous aspects of <UNK> character he obviously did his research otherwise this is a third rate rehash of the old abc <UNK> special format with none of the occasional charm those short films had sorry about the rant but this is an important subject for young people to know about and it could have been done well i wonder if musicians or filmmakers were responsible either way the kids are <UNK> than you think folks br br
<START> the first time i saw the poster i was stunned by its <UNK> and beauty then the city of <UNK> has been haunting in my mind ever since br br not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as <UNK> and <UNK> like a <UNK> it itself is a landscape br br actually there are a lot of things going on in the film but the director deliberately <UNK> most dramatic parts and leave them to our imagination thus creating a really flat life mild spoiler one can see <UNK> crying in the toilet and then going out without a word but not their fight one can see accompanying his mother in the hospital but not her struggle from illness the most dramatic scene in the film to me is laughing out loud for the toy soldier he bought for his niece and that's when it almost broke my heart to see this boring lonely life <UNK> out in such a way br br with all the <UNK> in life the story presents us with pure inner world of all the characters their sadness anxiety loneliness regrets and as the story <UNK> i sort of finally <UNK> their desperate situation where their emotions were really no way out if no outer things <UNK> which is exactly every loner tries to keep at all cost especially for an irresponsible artist like br br i've just finished my second watching last night i into my <UNK> had some <UNK> beside my bed and went through the whole film in a <UNK> i felt two real lives going on one outside the screen one inside the screen i felt free from all those loneliness and anxiety 'cause the people inside were experiencing it i just had myself removed from all those things br br we cannot deny the universal problem of communication and loneliness even puts us far towards it and it becomes a vicious spiral i bet still didn't figure out a way of living in the end that's why he stepped out of his room to try to find the answers from the outer world the <UNK> and landscape
<START> h g <UNK> war of the worlds by director david michael is a slightly less than average flick which isn't too bad if one considers the budget he had to work with only 1 million for this budget the production value wasn't too bad the best part of it is the visual effects i was thoroughly impressed with the cgi considering the budget and sound design the less then stellar parts of this film are the story which is very prolonged at best but again i think this is because of the budget they had they had to <UNK> certain scenes to create the feature length <UNK> minutes the acting again it's because the actors had no story to work with very few exceptional camera shots and the music however again i can let the negative parts go for the most part only because this film was made for a <UNK> budget and still had good production value still you should d see it for the sake of seeing how a low budget version of war of the worlds can be made even with flaws 4 out of 10

<START> director <UNK> has made a cynical cash <UNK> by his own admission that is too cynical to impress anybody but a <UNK> genre fan br br the most extreme confronting genre <UNK> to <UNK> a character in <UNK> have a philosophy that is what makes them dangerous br br island of <UNK> philosophy is to throw many shocking elements into a cinematic mix and stir slowly the result is a dish with no taste but an ugly appearance br br not to be confused with brilliant who could kill a child sometimes called island of death effort is set on a greek island which is a stage for various forms of slaughter a little <UNK> and some <UNK> <UNK> br br everything moves at a pace and the violent set pieces are poorly directed br br <UNK> as the movie that the censors didn't want you to see i'd <UNK> a guess that the censors never saw it they simply read the until their knees <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i am easily pleased i like bad films i like films featuring attractive young women in small amounts of clothing br br this film gives all the above a bad name yes you know going in that what you're getting is not high art or anything like but even for the type of movie it is beach babes from beyond isn't very good br br some people have given it 10 i can only assume that these are people who have had the organs which <UNK> rational thought to take place <UNK> removed br br it isn't very good it simply isn't very good br br 3 out of 10 solely on the grounds of a novelty value for the famous relatives and burt ward and b some of the girls are cute br br oh by the way did i tell you that it isn't very good
<START> chaplin is a in his final film of <UNK> a who can not seem to get the <UNK> down straight he spends time over there in world war one <UNK> several gags stand out <UNK> cheese as a <UNK> <UNK> for one the <UNK> quarters of the <UNK> in the <UNK> and when chaplin and his mates are washed out of their <UNK> by <UNK> are highlights chaplin ends up capturing several german soldiers single handed and he the german commander for <UNK> a cigarette when asked how he did it chaplin replies that he surrounded them chaplin hides behind enemy lines as a tree of all things and those scenes are very very funny he escapes to a bombed house where he meets up with a french girl played by <UNK> he's <UNK> down by german soldiers escapes from them again and is arrested for <UNK> him chaplin is able to pull a fast one by <UNK> a soldier and using the <UNK> uniform he ends up saving of course and capturing the <UNK> in the process along the way chaplin employs some sight gags and slapstick in turning back the german soldiers with this film chaplin explored the location possibilities in filming while maintaining the audience's attention for closer to feature length time something his contract with the mutual film corporation him the film also allowed him to poke fun at the enemy something he would again do to greater effect in the great dictator of 4 stars
<START> like a lot of the comments above me also i though this was the average scifi movie but unfortunately it was not i found it rather <UNK> and indeed preaching br br but that is not the only comment the scenes are very not as in scifi as i will explain a in a few moments the next sentence is a small spoiler the movie more or less represents a discussion between two groups the physical setting of a discussion typically involves two or three men standing next to each other the middle one typically speaking in the worst case the other party is represented by one person br br also the interviews the <UNK> have are very artificial sometimes even <UNK> for example sometimes the discussion is between the <UNK> i mean from a point of the interviewed moreover the interview persons always stay calm they say everything without normal emotions i e you cannot tell whether they lie or not are mad or not they show almost nothing br br this is also very <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> always believe everything they are told by the people they interview br br bottom line br br all conversations contain br br facts br br pro con arguments br br there are no lies nobody lies the next sentence is a spoiler ignore if you still plan to see the movie the only lie happening is to demonstrate how <UNK> non <UNK> are br br this makes me conclude that the movie is a b movie it is very similar to <UNK> 9 from outer <UNK> from the 50's but this movie also has an annoying wrong set discussion about aliens and christian belief br br note i have no intention to insult christians people who believe in aliens or <UNK> else this is a thought i have about the movie not about people br br moreover i would like to note that i don't know whether the actors are bad or were just given terrible scripts
<START> if you're a child of the eighties like me you probably remember this 1981 disney movie one of disney's first pg rated films and michael j <UNK> screen debut i can remember watching this film over and over on hbo when i was on middle school and i only recently found a very old copy of it since disney stopped producing the movie several years ago needless to say this is a real fun movie to watch five college teams <UNK> clues in an evening race around los angeles trying to reach the finish line first watch for the cameo from paul <UNK> from the cheesy music to the disco scene with the fat twins this is a quintessential 1980s fun film that you'll love
<START> tourist trap is a bizarre great horror film from the '70s the film is about a group of young adults <UNK> jerry and molly who are traveling in a <UNK> through a desert area their two other friends <UNK> and her boyfriend woody are in a separate car when a wheel goes flat woody takes it to a nearby gas station and meets a grisly fate to some bizarre <UNK> mayhem and some creepy <UNK> the friends get tired of waiting for woody and go to a local tourist trap <UNK> wax museum in front of the entrance the car randomly breaks down and the girls find an <UNK> area to go swimming in where they are approached by mr who runs the <UNK> attraction that is now closed down he takes them up to the old western wax museum and the girls stay behind while he and jerry go to fix their car <UNK> the curious of the two wanders to an old house nearby where she also falls to the hands of a mysterious masked killer and a bunch of life like <UNK> after awaiting for <UNK> <UNK> and molly go to look for her that's when the real horror begins and the <UNK> can move objects with his mind masked brother of mr begins to kill off the teens one by one while controlling his large amount of human turned <UNK> br br sound similar to the 2005 house of wax remake well it is i'd heard of this movie but never seen it when i saw house of wax but now i can see the striking similarities the two movie share tourist trap was obviously a big <UNK> to the house of wax remake the <UNK> in this movie are scary to begin with some with moving <UNK> some with no eyes at all and some with dropping mouths that sing too the singing was extremely creepy if you ask me and the <UNK> were <UNK> designed <UNK> are creepy to begin with they're so <UNK> yet they really aren't the movie tightly <UNK> elements from texas chainsaw massacre the masks the killer uses are similar to those of <UNK> with a little bit of the original house of wax and the <UNK> powers that are displayed in carrie the result is quite satisfying the <UNK> was a nice touch to the movie it made the killer all the more menacing and <UNK> the masks were terrifying and the scene was really disturbing br br the score for the film was really well done if not a little <UNK> during some scenes the acting may not be particularly on key but it really wasn't that bad chuck <UNK> was really good as the shadowy mr giving the character a shady but friendly feel a young <UNK> roberts is also in the film she's most known for her role on charlie's angels and more recently the sitcom that '70s show playing <UNK> mother robert a burns serves as the art director he did a phenomenal job on the original texas chainsaw and does a good job here as well creating a <UNK> <UNK> atmosphere to both the <UNK> museum and the old house filled with <UNK> i found it a little odd that the original rating for the film was pg it seems a little too scary to have such a tame rating but the film really isn't too violent br br overall tourist trap is an <UNK> unique fast paced extremely under appreciated horror classic full moon gave it a decent 20th <UNK> dvd release the commentary was interesting and the picture was clear and crisp for the most part better than the video versions if you enjoy older '70s slasher horror films tourist trap is an underrated retro gem 8 10
<START> bill jeremy is an inspiring writer who hasn't gotten anything published as of yet bill also has an odd and strange habit he likes to follow people br br bill picks out some stranger in the streets diner or on the subway <UNK> and follows them as if he were their shadow maybe bill does this to help him in inspiring himself to write the great novel that he's been dreaming about or get an article of his get <UNK> in a major magazine maybe it's because it fills <UNK> lonely life with a purpose and even makes the person of his curiosity a face in the crowd with meaning and substance by his paying attention to him or her or maybe it gives bill someone to look after and care about and be responsible for besides himself bill has a simple rule that he follows <UNK> when he follows someone after you follow him or her to their home or place of work you stop br br one day bill follows <UNK> alex <UNK> home and instead of following his rule of stopping he still keeps following <UNK> bill will soon realize how right he was with that rule he set for himself in following people and at the same time how wrong he was by breaking it br br amazingly good low budget movie made by christopher <UNK> in 1998 before he hit it big in hollywood with his ground breaking and original motion picture classic <UNK> some two years later that has already become a major cult movie br br following is actually a much better movie then <UNK> because it's a conventional and easy to follow story compared to which was at first confusing and then when you realize what the movie is telling you in it's <UNK> storyline very complicated whats makes following so much better is just by it being simple but at the same time <UNK> in it's affect on those who watch it the movie is far more direct as well as devastating and you don't have to see it over and over to get just what it was trying to tell them like <UNK> did following is a story within a story within a story with one of the most surprising as well as simply manipulated ending if you watch the movie again and notice the clues that you'll ever see br br made with an unbelievably small budget of 6 000 00 thats less then what most hollywood movies budgets out for coffee breaks with a no name cast in black and white and just over one hour <UNK> minutes long hollywood as well as the motion picture industry outside of hollywood can learn a lot from chris <UNK> in how someone with nothing more then talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars in most cases can't make an intelligent and at the same time <UNK> film with next to nothing in money and no big name stars
<START> <UNK> starts as young female artist <UNK> sarah meets a mysterious yet charming man named <UNK> jonathan they end up back at her studio apartment where he gives her the <UNK> of some sort of tree which is used as a <UNK> drug when <UNK> down <UNK> quickly becomes hooked as she is <UNK> into an alternate fantasy reality which involve <UNK> creatures photographer friend <UNK> chris <UNK> becomes concerned about her as she <UNK> further from reality as she becomes addicted to the drug can <UNK> her kick the drug or will it end up ruining her life why did the mysterious <UNK> get her addicted to the stuff in the first place do the elaborate fantasy dream like <UNK> have any significance br br co produced directed by christopher <UNK> this <UNK> arty vampire flick is pretty much 95 minutes of tedium is <UNK> deserving of all the bad comments the script was written by the interestingly named <UNK> how the hell do you even <UNK> that anyway who is also credited as production designer his unusual name is actually more interesting than anything that ever happens in <UNK> i would guess that the makers set out to make a very serious fantasy based horror film with a strong moral message about the dangers of drugs drug addiction date rape drug at it's core the majority of the film is spent on the drug issue with initial introduction to the drug how great the first time was how she becomes hopelessly addicted which eventually destroys her her life her friends lives it's never explained where she keeps getting this drug from as <UNK> only gives her a little bit during their initial meeting but hey who cares the first twenty odd minutes of <UNK> are really boring dull the following hour or so aren't much better before a mess of a final ten minutes which involve a <UNK> monster <UNK> making a <UNK> the moral elements are <UNK> the fantasy elements seem like an <UNK> the horror is none existent there's also the dialogue which is awful every sentence tries to be profound have loads of hidden depth just tries to have so much meaning that it becomes tiresome to listen to br br the concept of the film is terrible so is the execution as there's absolutely no gore or violence to speak of the entire thing is set inside an apartment that doesn't appear to have any lights the fantasy setting looks a little better but it's <UNK> seen underused there are no scares here no atmosphere to make matters even worse the makers have decided to used muted very faded colours which i just hate find annoying what's wrong with a nice colourful image it seems to me to be a <UNK> with current filmmakers who seem to think that it automatically makes a film cool or adds atmosphere which it most certainly doesn't more often than not it just makes your film look dull drab as <UNK> here with <UNK> br br this probably had a low budget was shot in los angeles it has reasonable production values but it's all so dull the acting didn't impress me i didn't care for or about anyone which is never a good sign br br <UNK> is a terrible vampire film that goes for psychological horror as well as physical with all sorts of parallels to real life <UNK> addiction what it can do to little or no effect because the whole thing is so dull there might be an audience for a film such as this but considering the other comments not that big a one
<START> i really enjoyed random hearts it was shocking to see such a low rating on imdb but <UNK> a son and all that i am a big fan of harrison ford but i do have to admit that he was ill cast in this movie and the reason i gave it 9 instead of 10 <UNK> scott thomas though was just wonderful she was believable and beautiful in spite of being made up for half the movie like she'd been crying for days could random hearts have been better sure but it is very much worth seeing as it is
<START> we were waiting in line to see the good girl an excellent movie starring jennifer aniston when some lady came up with this <UNK> mock twenty dollar bill advertising <UNK> from heaven come see this movie she said you'll love it br br she then introduced us to the director of the film now this should have been our first clue i mean in how many cinematic situations do you have the director of the film standing out in the <UNK> begging people to see it is this a christian film i asked not really caring one way or the other i love jesus no shame in that no she said <UNK> what a load of crap br br this movie is bad so bad and it's not only because of the obvious christian agenda but because of the terrible dialogue acting that <UNK> between wooden and and the obvious lack of an editor the film is way too long had it been an hour and a half then maybe just maybe i wouldn't have had to visit the suicide <UNK> center after seeing the movie br br actually i lie see after an hour of this garbage we <UNK> into <UNK> at least with <UNK> we know it's garbage before going in to see the movie we know to <UNK> ourselves and <UNK> has hot half naked people the only thing half naked in this film is the desperation of the stars involved whose obvious lack of script offers is anything but hidden and the actress who <UNK> the nun it's called a personality get one br br the people shamelessly begging for ticket sales in the <UNK> told me that if i liked my big fat greek wedding then i would love their emphasis not mine <UNK> from heaven right more like if you like <UNK> you'll love <UNK> from heaven and <UNK> could actually <UNK> any of the <UNK> from this flick if that's not an insult then i don't know what is br br i've enough go see indie films but don't see the bad ones this is definitely one of the bad ones <UNK> from heaven is in need of some divine <UNK>
<START> it really amazed me to see that someone would take so much time to <UNK> such a bad movie the beginning of the film had some truth in it the <UNK> <UNK> was started in 1943 when two communist pilots from the <UNK> <UNK> deserted together with their <UNK> in 19 and 33 respectively the aircraft saw some action in <UNK> and hand bombing but didn't last very long one crew was killed and the other survived the pilot being killed later while flying a <UNK> <UNK> the real <UNK> <UNK> were established when <UNK> detached two of its <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> respectively <UNK> by ex <UNK> royal <UNK> pilots and <UNK> them to <UNK> forces on the island of <UNK> even those were never engaged in air to air activities but strictly for ground support so the film was one giant cow <UNK> to put it mildly and the lowest point for its otherwise not at all bad director by some <UNK> of fate i was present on the filming of the last sequence of the movie when dozens of german aircraft were destroyed <UNK> <UNK> used also in the flying sequences on the military airport the <UNK> were impressive and the <UNK> served <UNK> by the film crew was even better otherwise the film was a shameless lie was and frequently <UNK> about by the contemporary audience
<START> the film consists of the audition tapes of the surrender girls and some footage from previous films it's not hot or even suitable for late night viewing on <UNK> only an adolescent boy could be interested in <UNK> from beyond i recommend avoiding this one
<START> i watched this expecting to see the usual british stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue remarkably natural and <UNK> with black humour it was more like <UNK> goes to sea than in which we serve the scenes during the approach and attack are remarkably realistic in their depiction of a fighting ship and the stuff ups and banter among the <UNK> company well at least based on my service in the 1970s some of the throwaway lines are very witty i'm not joining the band of hope just to please some <UNK> fish <UNK> my only complaint is that they didn't show what happened to the irish <UNK> and his bride to be or the <UNK> <UNK> and his i love <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this film does for <UNK> what <UNK> boot did for <UNK> if you appreciated <UNK> boot then that is all you really need to know br br this is a well done piece of cinema on a par with <UNK> boot basically it follows a company of elite german <UNK> who leave <UNK> duty in an <UNK> italian <UNK> town and are immediately thrust into the chaos of the <UNK> russian front br br a good war movie <UNK> both the <UNK> and brutality of war and at the same time gives us insight into the experiences and essential humanity of those who fight this movie does that the film is full of drama and action and so is entertaining on that level as well
<START> this movie is awful the script is stupid and of course chase doesn't tell <UNK> he doesn't love her like every episode ill never understand <UNK> 101 the show also why the heck does <UNK> dad act so <UNK> and its only about <UNK> and chase what about the other characters its always the same in every episode quinn makes and invention something goes terribly wrong with the invention and brother always gets involved in it if you haven't seen it don't waste an hour watching this <UNK> you'll be wasting your time this may be interesting to an eight year old well 8 10 but i imagine older watching this <UNK> film but what can you expect from nick
<START> i remember when i first saw this movie i was <UNK> for a friend of my <UNK> and one of the kids suggested we watch it thinking it was the frankly laughable of <UNK> they were <UNK> into the video <UNK> i was prepared for a few hours of boredom what i got came as a shock a pleasant one i'll admit but still a shock br br now you all know the robin hood legend don't you i shall explain a little robin hood was a <UNK> criminal money here and there and giving it to people who needed it all the while <UNK> the beautiful maid marion and <UNK> the sheriff of <UNK> and prince john that's the <UNK> now on with the review br br this movie was released in 1993 and is a take off of the whole robin hood legend and a p take of prince of thieves in particular br br loosely following the legend robin of is first encountered in an <UNK> prison during the third century <UNK> and together with a as they were called in those days he <UNK> a cunning escape with a <UNK> br br after escaping robin to find his son a foreign exchange student in england and look out for him this robin <UNK> to do robin <UNK> back to england br br he returns to his home castle to find it being <UNK> away on the back of the <UNK> by and goes through he <UNK> revelation that his father dog cat and even the <UNK> are all dead desperate for a familiar face he finds the family's loyal blind servant sitting on the toilet with a jazz <UNK> in <UNK> the hilarity continues throughout the movie br br as with all robin hood stories robin must <UNK> the evil plans of prince john and the sheriff of who are <UNK> havoc and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on king <UNK> kingdom while he's away br br those familiar with the movies mel brooks has previously directed will have some small idea of what to expect after all this is the man responsible for dracula dead and loving it and young frankenstein all the jokes which range from visual gags to wonderful witty comments are in exactly the right places throughout the movie with never more than a minute between laughs br br cary <UNK> incidentally the only english man to play robin hood in a movie who many of you will know from princess bride brings his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> eyed presence to this movie and does a wonderful job from outlandish heroic <UNK> to a <UNK> sexy glance he really is amazingly funny and the man looks better in <UNK> than i do br br richard lewis is hilarious as the whiny arrogant prince john with the ever changing mole he gets the sissy boy behaviour down to a <UNK> and his <UNK> american are great all the way through the movie a mole on his face constantly changes position it starts on his left cheek then over to his right cheek then his <UNK> then his <UNK> before going back to it's original place this is a subtle joke based on the mole on alan <UNK> when he played the sheriff in prince of thieves br br roger <UNK> as the sleazy sheriff of is <UNK> slimy and nasty and has some great lines throughout the film br br there are some faces here you'll be familiar with from other brooks films for instance robert <UNK> playing the <UNK> in this film also played the <UNK> in blazing <UNK> another film directed by brooks he likes to add subtle references to his earlier films too with several in this film that die hard brooks fans will easily spot those who watched history of the world part 1 will <UNK> the music to the song <UNK> in also when patrick stewart arrives and marion mel himself playing <UNK> <UNK> the line <UNK> good to be a <UNK> one of his lines in history of the world br br the whole cast is wonderfully comedic even those with only a few lines bring a great depth of warmth and humour to them br br what makes this film so wonderfully warm and funny in my own opinion are all the improvised scenes although there was a script of sorts some scenes were completely improvised by the actors themselves such as the scene where <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for in her bed and he falls through the ceiling landing right where she wanted him which was totally <UNK> and thought out by the two actors br br there are few special effects and those that are there are small but fun moments of <UNK> camera <UNK> br br the soundtrack is memorable with some very funny songs and a couple of cheesy love songs you'll be singing <UNK> in or at least <UNK> it to yourself for weeks br br the rating is pg to which i say <UNK> <UNK> there is no bad language in the film except in the use of double <UNK> and one <UNK> of sh t and violence is minimal in fact i'd go as far as to say non existent apart from a few comedy fight scenes br br a great fun film that adults and children alike will enjoy
<START> evil <UNK> puts a town through pain and suffering not long before they call upon giant stone samurai for help soon comes and really gets the <UNK> with all his might the revenge climax is really funny as <UNK> guys under his feet and <UNK> guys with his fist and even drives a spike though a man's heart
<START> seeing les <UNK> calls immediately for comparison with <UNK> movie 'the <UNK> in my opinion the best film made about the 1968 revolt of students in paris actually director <UNK> <UNK> does not seem to avoid comparing with his much more famous colleague sharing the principal actor and even including a direct <UNK> eye in viewer eye about an older film of <UNK> and yet <UNK> is a different film and an interesting one br br the story line seems also familiar the movie starts with long scenes of the 1968 maybe among the best done until now the film is made in black and white and the perspective of the static camera on one side or the other of the <UNK> reminds <UNK> then as in the <UNK> the action moves in the <UNK> flat where the heroes of the defeated revolt make art smoke drugs dream and fall for one other there is no direct social comment no real explanation of the background of the revolt the movie focuses on the psychology of the characters and on the love story between the main characters it's like a <UNK> of the process of transition to the establishment that the generation of the 1968 went through it's just that not all the participants may adapt or survive br br the film is more about the characters than about the events and it is merely for the style it will be remembered about the black and white cinema is memorable not only in the revolution scenes but also when looking at the characters evolution many sequences are enhanced by a technique that is derived from the silent films movies with long takes accompanied by a off piano tune the effect is exquisite yet the length of the film is hardly justified it lasts more than three hours and i doubt that cutting it to only two hours would have been a miss actually i am convinced it's quite a contrary br br without raising at the depth and subtlety of <UNK> movie <UNK> is another perspective to remember about one of the more important years in the history of france and of the world in the 20th century
<START> joan crawford is convincingly <UNK> as our story starts and of course she get fixed up but she's a bad egg <UNK> one guy while living out another guy's anti social philosophy all of this takes place in sweden which is truly bizarre it causes anything and everything memorable in the visuals which are freed from having to depict usa but it makes a viewer wonder why every remake since is <UNK> and rendered <UNK> by the need to <UNK> everything there is plot plot plot so <UNK> that you could <UNK> in it and making matters worse is a framing device that adds <UNK> to the movie the photography is occasionally nice with odd angles and <UNK> <UNK> quite well but it's overwrought without ever once drawing you in
<START> when one of my friends recommended this to me raving about how well it was filmed the underlying themes and the general greatness of the film i obviously expected an amazing at least entertaining film br br the two hours i spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my time br br i understand that this movie is meant to be surreal but even in surreal movies there is something which anchors it down even if it is only in the slightest this movie on the other hand felt forced and fake a lot of the shots were unnecessary and watching it made me think the director was trying to hard to be artistic br br the acting was poor and the relationships between characters were not nearly developed enough maybe that's just me missing something that others could see but i hadn't even realised there was any sort of attraction between <UNK> and before they started getting at it like <UNK> randomly half way through the film then again maybe this film was just bad br br i am not against violence in movies but in this one almost all of it was just unnecessary throughout all the fight scenes i felt myself cringing at how painfully cliché it all was br br and the plot the word laughable comes to mind i would be amused if i hadn't wasted two hours of my life following this poorly thought out and ridiculous plot despite all the movie's flaws by the end of it i was expecting something interesting to conclude it i won't discuss the ending because i wouldn't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it just that the metaphor be it a rock or a grain of sand in water they sink as the same cannot be used as an explanation for everything br br this entire movie was made for shock value and shock value only i just hope sooner or later people will stop being so pretentious and <UNK> a bad movie for what it is i've seen many other great korean films and it <UNK> me that people have <UNK> <UNK> as the best
<START> i am insulted and angry over the idea that a sequel to with the <UNK> should ever have been <UNK> having expressed that i have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film the performers are talented people whose talents were wasted on this piece of garbage the hype surrounding this book and film just happens to be an exercise in <UNK> i think it will go down as one of the misguided films of hollywood i don't believe that the beloved characters created by margaret mitchell should have been <UNK> by the ideas and interpretations of another writer the film and the book should be on the list of worst ideas conceived in the world of <UNK> and film making the sad thing is that people actually made money off of this tripe
<START> i always thought my father had a second life and was eagerly awaiting the development of <UNK> <UNK> street when i sat down and viewed it for the first time amazingly this movie's journey took me to places i had not expected and made me <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> truly a remarkable personal story told in clever but straightforward manner i especially enjoyed the film <UNK> use of pulling out the type of his mother's daily diary very effective i read the previous comment and wish to note that the sound was fine when i watched this and suspect either the film was changed somewhat or the theater could have contributed to the <UNK> quality of sound for the other writer
<START> one of the most macabre depressing yet eye opening <UNK> i've watched in awhile there's no narration or story that's told just a third eye type camera following around 2 couples of heroin <UNK> in nyc through the seasons watching them shoot up on the floors of public <UNK> then clean their <UNK> in the public <UNK> sometimes it's a bit too much and you need to hit pause just to go for a <UNK> br br anyone currently in <UNK> of alcohol drug addition should watch this when they're <UNK> it really shows you to what you could be going back to after seeing this it's a wonder how anyone could even try this drug to begin with br br the only thing it needed was a follow up at the end to tell where these people are today judging from what is shown in the doc there's no hope for any of them they mention wanting to get better and quit but it seems the only end to their <UNK> is to quit by way of dying br br this definitely isn't for all audiences i found myself kind of like watching a car accident after i started watching it i just couldn't turn it off i had to keep watching with a dark morbid fascination of what it's like inside the lives of these <UNK>
<START> last night i am sitting in my tv room beer in hand bowl of <UNK> on the tv <UNK> i decide to put the movie monster man into my <UNK> vcr expecting a fun filled gory crash bash of a movie what do i get instead one of the most silly stupid predictable films i have ever had the <UNK> of sitting through and what's even worse all during the i use this next phrase loosely sex scene the girl keeps all her clothes on i'll make this summary short sweet mix dude where's my car about a good 1 2 of the film with a very watered down <UNK> add a redneck version of the antagonist from i madman as the primary villain finally some incoherent black magic <UNK> <UNK> you'll kind of get a clue how rotten this movie is it's also utterly predictable throughout the only notable factor to this buddy movie disguised as a horror film is that some of the moments between the 2 guys even though the hero is one major annoying geek the other is a jack black clone are kind of funny just mediocre funny i e like most of snl skits other than that monster man is a monster mess 3 10 this one i'll be <UNK> out at halloween time just hope after the person views it i don't get my house <UNK> or worse
<START> dan burgess is a nice guy he happens to be a christian dan can't get a date with a girl and thinks that all of his friends are having all of the fun he is constantly being bothered by non <UNK> and being made fun of br br dan <UNK> one night and wishes he was never a believer in jesus br br his <UNK> is answered for one day things get hairy from there an angel appears to dan and explains his <UNK> is granted br br so all of the impact that dan has had on starting a christian club br br he be friends <UNK> parks and making a difference is <UNK> for one day br br <UNK> eyes are opened his life really did make a difference
<START> i agree with the posters before that the characters were exceptionally strong and believable and all the actors at their top form i especially loved david <UNK> <UNK> in a part so unlike anything else he played proving once again his amazing gift for comedy the first part of the movie was light and funny the blackmail part was a bit <UNK> but interesting and it was all downhill from there br br i found it frustrating that at least two out of the 3 girls <UNK> and lisa get out of the blackmail betrayal <UNK> free <UNK> a trace left on their psyche i know the movie the darker ending of the play and i am not saying i missed the murder part but i surely needed to see those two getting their <UNK> somehow and i was left <UNK> in frustration with the ending it's why i gave it only a 9 br br but definitely an interesting film
<START> this movie tries to say something profound i'm just not sure what it was too much is left <UNK> in the end for me to figure out the main point a couple scenes really have me wondering what was left on the cutting room floor i don't think the wall was very well developed i never got what was actually going on there when the mother finally <UNK> it i just couldn't make any connection to the boy's silence what was the point of the boy not talking was he just <UNK> or did he <UNK> some sort of power what was the scene with the burnt girl all about another power the boy has or what i don't understand how that developed any character or moved the plot i got the bully bit but what happened to the dog did the dog come back or did mom get rid of fido for good somehow br br there were several additional plot elements that were more clutter than use like the radio talk show in the background discussing the iraq war i think that was supposed to create some sort of comparison to the grief and <UNK> the mother and <UNK> were experiencing but for me it was distracting and strained i didn't buy the link very much i also found the teacher getting on <UNK> about not saying here for roll call a bit much the mom seeing the doctor was pointless how did it serve the plot was that to show how desperate the mother was getting or was it something about the medicine that i didn't get was that the dad coming back in the last scene or just some guy so did writing on the wall work what happened to the dog
<START> the first in a new style of films for lamas no <UNK> or karate i for one miss them but this is a serious movie he plays a fbi <UNK> who has lived so long with the bad guys in his head that he no longer <UNK> anyone including himself gary busey is either a great actor or somebody i wouldn't want to meet in broad daylight on a crowded street <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lamas as <UNK> as she <UNK> the serial killer there is one surprise after another as the story unfolds not the least of which is the ending it seems to never come there is always one more <UNK> to the story <UNK> and lamas start out as the good guys turn into the bad guys and somehow end up the heroes but it's definitely worth the rental price for maximum enjoyment throw in a candy bar a bag of popcorn and a soft drink you're going to the movies
<START> i saw this movie so long ago but it remains in my memory as the saddest movie ever i cried non stop my mother will not ever watch this movie again because its almost painful to watch anyway apart from that the story isn't exactly complex ann margaret is dying and has to give away her 10 children as if that isn't bad enough it is during the depression and she has to break up the close siblings one by one i guess this was very sad to me because i too am from a very large close <UNK> family and could identify with each child's pain of leaving their mother and siblings br br maybe i am a <UNK> but i would like to see this movie again because it was well done and the end surprisingly is slightly happy so at least we could smile and <UNK> simultaneously it should come on tv sometime so i can see it again
<START> fred carpenter screened eddie monroe at boston college and judging from the enthusiastic response he has much to be pleased about a taught well done <UNK> impressive for it's big budget look and feel this movie has it all a tight script that grabs you and doesn't let go right up to it's surprise ending this viewer didn't see it coming excellent performances all around craig morris and jessica were were especially well cast in the leads delivering strong performances and kudos to frank and alex <UNK> for creating two detectives as engaging and interesting to watch as any in film i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it confirmed my belief that some of the best work in film will be coming from the <UNK> and fred carpenter looks to be one of the best
<START> stan laurel it's been noted first made a real name for himself by appearing in short parodies of popular feature films in the 1920s he certainly demonstrates himself to be an excellent comic actor and performer here in mud and sand a parody of <UNK> blood and sand but i think a film like this really works not because laurel was a great <UNK> but because it allows the audience to jump into the comedy already familiar with the situation and scenes laurel can then let loose with his inspired gags without either having to create context or to do without it i watched this the day after watching blood and sand itself it certainly enhanced the experience to know what was being <UNK> and where br br the scene where <UNK> character <UNK> if you believe the title cards or if you believe how his name gets written on the <UNK> board his mother out of money with a two for you two for me trick is funny on its own because it's a great gag but it's extra funny if the viewer is aware how it is taking the air out of <UNK> and melodramatic promises to give his mother any <UNK> she desires br br this is the best stan laurel solo work i've seen it's just plain funny even more so if you have had a chance to see the source material
<START> i like arnold and i love the subject matter but this was a very disappointing movie when i first saw the previews they were dark and ominous and <UNK> name wasn't even mentioned but i recognized him which led me to believe that he was making a movie that had more of a serious suspenseful mood that it wasn't just another <UNK> action vehicle though i admit most of his are pretty good he had thus far avoided movies with any real religious theme and i was excited i was wrong this is just another action explosion gun fire movie and it's a pretty bad one
<START> it's too bad wants to deny the reality of and clarence <UNK> purpose in the creating of the story and film of intruder in the dust i suppose the burden of a history of racism is difficult for any <UNK> to bear and i can understand that but to say that this film was not specifically about racism is ridiculous and inaccurate yes to borrow your use of the upper case there are many many many places where blacks and white people in the south get along quite well but to deny the way that black people were and sometimes still are forced to live the conditions and <UNK> they have had to endure are not imaginary sometimes black and white people got along because of genuine affection and understanding sometimes it was only as long as blacks their <UNK> the point of making <UNK> character in film and print a somewhat <UNK> type not warm and fuzzy was to <UNK> the fact that <UNK> is wrong in and of itself and human rights are just that for everyone regardless of whether we like a particular individual or not br br it would do good to stop denying the existence of racism and the great harm it has done to americans of all <UNK> the fact is that black people among others did not as a rule not an exception receive the benefits of the justice system as even <UNK> as whites <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are historical fact people like might claim these things were not as <UNK> as some think and would probably love to <UNK> their <UNK> and heroes from any connection with such behavior it would be a wonderful thing if southern <UNK> if any never <UNK> in any of the horrible racist actions that <UNK> this country's history and i hope they didn't if that is so <UNK> to them but that fact if true does not <UNK> the fact that others did and even if the horrible things that were done to blacks in the south and other areas let's not forget the draft <UNK> of the civil war era were only half as numerous only a third does that make them any less horrible is the murder of ten children the hanging of ten men the sexual assault of ten women any less horrible than the same things happening to a hundred br br asks us to get the <UNK> burning chip off of our shoulders before we see intruder in the dust well i ask you did the murders of the civil rights <UNK> happen or not why should that be forgotten forgiven maybe but in order to prevent their they cannot be forgotten or <UNK> into minor <UNK> the racism that is displayed in intruder in the dust is displayed there quite <UNK> it is there to make a point br br on a <UNK> historical level it is also ridiculous for to <UNK> the racial angle any viewer of films that were filmed before the 1960's knows that black actors characters extras were usually deliberately cast to judge from our movie history wars were always fought by middle aged white men there were no black people in the old west it was possible to walk down a street in a major city and never encounter a black person there were no black hospital taxi drivers <UNK> etc blacks were almost never cast with regard to a role unless race was a factor if and brown had wanted to tell a simple murder story he probably would not have made the <UNK> character black br br racism exists probably for different reasons i am sure we both wish that it didn't but it does wanting things to be the way we would like them to be probably can't be helped but it still does not make them so
<START> this is apparently the first film featuring gloria <UNK> the film that made her a <UNK> star while she was good in the film i can't see how this performance in particular was so noteworthy at the time but still it was a very good film br br gloria plays the wife of a rich <UNK> that continually takes her for granted he cares little for his <UNK> eats <UNK> and forgets their <UNK> and at the same time a <UNK> comes into their lives and begins paying a lot of attention to gloria and her <UNK> husband doesn't even notice or give her any reason not to cheat on him ultimately she <UNK> her <UNK> and marries the smooth talking romeo however while the movie could have just been an overdone melodrama they were pretty common at the time it takes some interesting twists and turns and is an imaginative and fun film while not the greatest silent film i have seen it is a standout and deserves to be remembered br br by the way the dvd release from image entertainment is surprisingly good with a decent print and music this hasn't always been true of other image releases particularly how <UNK> they handled the chaplin releases
<START> the diary of anne frank is the second best selling <UNK> book in the world and for good reason nonetheless sitting through this documentary about her life which fills in some of the details where the diary left off i thought just another documentary about anne frank i found it to be competent but not extraordinary that was my <UNK> attitude because i was already well aware of the story of anne frank most of what the documentary had to tell me wasn't news to me br br everything changed though when i got to the end of the documentary when i saw the motion picture footage of anne frank the emotional impact of seeing this footage only a second or so long made everything that came before it a thousand times more real but not just everything that was in the documentary everything i had previously known about anne frank suddenly became more real to me more personal i'd always been moved by her story but when i saw that footage what i felt was stronger and deeper and more profound than any other film experience of my life i knew beforehand that this documentary contained live footage of anne frank and i'd even seen the footage in a movie review on television but seeing it in the context of the documentary was a completely different experience it's not likely that my mentioning it here will spoil it for anyone br br i realize now that many people still don't know the story of anne frank it's <UNK> at times to be witness to this kind of ignorance i think to myself how could someone not know the story of anne frank this being the case though anne frank remembered along with reading her diary is the best place to start it's a story that everyone should know
<START> one crazy summer is a fun and quirky look at love through the eyes of <UNK> <UNK> what could have been hokey and dull is one of the <UNK> and most energetic comedies ever savage steve holland with john cusack to make the ultimate summer movie
<START> violent sequel to <UNK> was directed by <UNK> <UNK> never say never again the empire strikes back will never be as good as the original because it is almost <UNK> and it is extremely mean and should have been rated <UNK> 17 because of scenes with <UNK> being involved in <UNK> people threatening to brutally murder very young <UNK> with real automatic weapons and even scenes with a 12 year old using lots of explicit profanity giving drugs to lots of random people shooting and <UNK> shooting up and killing policemen and <UNK> officers opening fire on police officers when lots of small and young children are present and a whole group of children using strong profanity and beating up the store owner who is a very old man of an <UNK> store and stealing and destroying lots of items there this film gives new meaning to the term <UNK> mean but the effects and action sequences are exceptionally incredible overall an ok movie
<START> this movie is based on the true story of christopher <UNK> and his friend lee this fascinating story takes place around the time of the <UNK> in which during his time as a clerk for christopher was <UNK> to classified <UNK> which admitted the <UNK> involvement in australian political and union circles the movie shows several scenes involving <UNK> <UNK> over us tv where events take place which confirm the classified documents that christopher had read previously the <UNK> of <UNK> was an organized cia coup elsewhere in the film it was mentioned that most people have no idea about the level of deception that goes on ultimately to ensure that the us is used as a vehicle to promote certain <UNK> at the <UNK> of everyone else in the current age nothing has changed br br <UNK> life was profoundly affected read shocked by his knowledge of what and how the cia <UNK> foreign including the of allied nations to the united states christopher <UNK> probably not in the best way at the time by selling top secret information to the soviet union with lee acting as his exchange eventually christopher and were captured and convicted of <UNK> br br on <UNK> may 1982 whilst serving time in us prison christopher <UNK> agreed to a one and only interview with ray martin of 60 minutes australia because it was the australian connection that profoundly affected him it caused a in the australian media for about a week then it went <UNK> br br i liked the movie's symbolism of the <UNK> and in it chris was called the <UNK> and the snowman drug connection but in reality the title <UNK> was not something that was used by chris br br christopher <UNK> criminal or man of conscience you decide br br resources http www com <UNK> <UNK>
<START> before i talk about the ending of this film i will talk about the plot some dude named <UNK> breaks his engagement to kitty and runs off to craven castle in scotland after several months kitty and her aunt venture off to <UNK> arriving at craven castle kitty finds that <UNK> has aged and he has grown <UNK> <UNK> has certain rules for the castle the rules have been the same for 200 years <UNK> does not want them to stay but kitty insist on staying by making excuses one night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall it scares her so much that she <UNK> and another excuse they must stay longer kitty becomes more worried about <UNK> after she tries to go in the <UNK> but <UNK> catches her and is even <UNK> to her kitty then sends for <UNK> she calls their doctor who is actually their friend and his wide then to make things not look suspicious they invite a couple other friends who don't really do anything blah blah blah kitty and her aunt end up in the <UNK> where the most suspense of the story is they somehow get separated and they try to find each other but the aunt stumbles upon the creature here it is the moment we've all been waiting for what is the creature lurking in the shadows it is a giant frog <UNK> what is better than that after seeing the aunt the frog literally goes crazy and runs <UNK> i mean <UNK> up the stairs to the top of the castle the frog then leaps out an open window we then go on a shot from the ground and see the frog <UNK> towards us oh yeah this movie was in 3 d but you want to know what is funny is the frog that falls out the window is actually a toy because it is 1 10 the size of the frog before it takes the leap it is then revealed that this was all <UNK> fault blah blah and kitty and <UNK> get married then the last shot of this masterpiece is of the grave of the frog in the <UNK> the only place where he was ever really happy
<START> this production is an insult to the stooges especially moe it is inaccurate and poorly acted many of the events depicted just didn't happen that way and too much was left out or <UNK> over read the books written by moe and his daughter joan instead this was a waste of time
<START> when the film started i got the feeling this was going to be something special the acting and camera work were undoubtedly good i also liked the characters and could have grown to <UNK> with them the film had a good atmosphere and there was a hint of fantasy br br however as the film went on the plot never appeared to <UNK> and just rolled on scene by scene i was unable to understand the connection between the stories all i could see was the characters occasionally <UNK> into each other and references to ships in <UNK> without that connection i was just left with a few <UNK> short stories br br am surprised it did so well at cannes
<START> i like wes <UNK> especially adam beach but <UNK> is this movie a load of <UNK> <UNK> slow overly <UNK> to the point of not because the plot <UNK> it but because there is almost no plot even less in the way of characterization this is almost like one of those <UNK> old charlie chan mysteries the cheaper <UNK> studio versions with lots of red herrings oddball characters like the old ex senator with the <UNK> past who is now a <UNK> loads of people getting killed over <UNK> that you wouldn't look twice at in the mall great scenery though pretty hair on the <UNK> too although i never did figure out what she was doing in this at all neither could my wife <UNK> at least the old b movies had the decency to be short
<START> i don't know what dick steel was talking about but i found this film to be one of <UNK> most thrilling epics to date as for <UNK> or deep impact or for that matter the day after tomorrow is pale in comparison for what i know of films most of the <UNK> in films are basically run of the mill <UNK> flicks or one of which of global warming this how ever ran a different course a course of natural means where the <UNK> <UNK> is beginning to <UNK> to such a degree that it will take another piece of land with it for the ride what the scientific teams had to do was create a way to stop the <UNK> from going to far and sinking japan altogether in most cases this would simply be called shifting on <UNK> i found the characters rather appealing in every way from the child who lost her mother only to face her own demise among unfamiliar friends or the rescue girl who does all the she can to save lives in the face of disaster or a man who thought he could change her mind not to be such a dare devil and go with him to safety only to become the hero himself and save his <UNK> and let's not forget how the rest of the world just them all back only to be forgotten by having the world turning their backs on the japanese citizens who cried for help this was a great movie in all aspects what dick is trying to say is that this movie was not hollywood made that it was made in japan that it had characters which rival other actors around the world that the effects are very gorgeous as he mentioned but it's all he was waiting for and nothing else he lacks the vision of what's important to everyone and why this film had every element of feeling of <UNK> and of humanity i thought this film was top rate and i have seen many disaster films to know that japan sinks was possibly one of the most original and well thought out projects i have witnessed i really hope <UNK> <UNK> will make another of such films oh and by the way i am not japanese though in many ways i wish i was i am canadian born and raised and an avid movie buff in all aspects visions are bitter and not worth the effort to be recognized as an opinion dick you should watch it with a more open heart and mind don't just look for the eye candy which makes a films content look for what's more important and understand it they may not be american but the japanese have <UNK> the market lately for some of the most breath taking and down right gritty film making to date which is why spending 25 000 000 is just what the doctor ordered you heard right 25 000 000 to make this film now you tell me was it worth it or was it worth it because american actors weren't in it
<START> this is seriously the worst movie i have ever seen right from the start the movie goes straight down hill with its cheesy music score poor acting and total lack or real story or plot even for a b movie this is down right awful after reading some of the good reviews i thought i'd keep an open mind and watch it but all the bad reviews were so right i totally can't understand how anyone could have enjoyed it i'm a huge sci fi fan and this was way more than i could swallow do yourself a favor a move on to a different movie they are many other better movies that deal with this subject matter you have been warned
<START> this movie was bad but it was so bad that it may reach cult status in the distant future a sort of film noir meets plan 9 from outer space the story was well there wasn't actually a story there is a place reserved for the ed woods and russ meyers of the world and this film proves it so bad it might be good is the best way to describe it i seriously doubt if this movie will be picked up by any legitimate distribution company therefore it is unlikely to see wide release br br i will add that i expect to see more of actor ron carey he made the best of what he had the rest of the acting if i can call it that was quite forgettable i have seen worse from big studios with vast budgets
<START> north south the television mini series is to the 80's what rich man poor man the first ever tv mini series was to the 70's br br it's a fabulous adaptation of the first classic novel in the trilogy from author john <UNK> the story itself covers the two decades leading up to the years of the election of president abraham lincoln and the <UNK> <UNK> of the civil war north versus south the <UNK> stories <UNK> around the families of the <UNK> the in the title and the <UNK> and their two central figures of george and <UNK> who form a friendship whilst <UNK> on their west point training in br br north south is a wonderful historic <UNK> and as i have grown older and <UNK> it very much interests me to learn about the <UNK> attitudes to such controversial aspects as and and how these attitudes <UNK> br br the series also portrays some great characterisation development as we get to know about the friends and enemies in george and lives and also the women that stole their hearts as young men this aspect of the story also <UNK> a romantic tale that is set to the <UNK> backdrop of the american civil war br br north south along with rich man poor man is overshadowed by <UNK> roots as the greatest mini series of all time however it does come a close second third and also shares the same kind of <UNK> and themes as roots but don't let this one get away even if it's just to see the great scenery costumes and brilliant all star cast including gene kelly johnny cash elizabeth taylor james stewart olivia de <UNK> <UNK> anne down et al br br the series is beautifully crafted and is firmly tied to actual historic events and it's a pity the <UNK> and golden <UNK> didn't honour a lot more of the actors and actresses for their portrayals patrick <UNK> and james read the two virtual unknown lead actors at the time turn in compelling performances as <UNK> main and george <UNK> respectively however it's <UNK> <UNK> riveting performance as <UNK> sister that steals the show many times plus <UNK> <UNK> david carradine and philip <UNK> as bent are the delicious villains of the piece you just love to hate br br north south books 1 2 are now available on two dvd sets
<START> standard disease <UNK> in remote area expert who happens to be <UNK> in the area takes charge movie there are only a few <UNK> from the norm one is that the kids involved are pretty reasonable from the outset usually they are monsters who repeatedly <UNK> up the works until they redeem themselves in the end another is that the local medicine man witch doctor who is normally an <UNK> early on is never completely <UNK> or redeemed in the end perhaps since this seems to have been made for the faith oriented <UNK> channel they didn't want to seem too <UNK> about the faithful finally there were no evil local politicians <UNK> industry <UNK> trying to cover the whole thing up the lack of these stereotypes was refreshing if we have the <UNK> channel to thank for that i may have to <UNK> a few more of their offerings aside from that however this was pretty standard stuff you've seen it all before
<START> admittedly the only reason i watched this film since it's been about a decade since it was released was because of ian <UNK> i was intrigued to see his portrayal of my second favorite character in this play at any rate this film is as gritty as anything the old has produced since jesus of <UNK> but some of the best parts of the play have been left out i understand the directing editing choices but i don't think that it really does justice to the play perhaps i'm too much a <UNK> i would have to direct people who have read this far toward branagh's version if it weren't that i despise his tendency toward over <UNK> all the same he plays a better hamlet than gibson but then weren't we all waiting for gibson to prove himself as an actor now all he's done is to prove that he wants to make films in <UNK> languages br br perhaps the only shakespearean worthy acting here is <UNK> as the ghost
<START> a genuinely creepy ghost story full of chills and <UNK> this movie just falls short of what it promises it is apparently based on an old ghost story and perhaps relies a little too much on a simple premise for most of the way its imaginative and genuinely gripping but at the end its almost like just lost interest in it and brought it to a rapid ending br br the story is simple a woman and her younger lover kill her husband so that they can be together but their failure of nerve and his returning ghost <UNK> them to madness its beautifully handled with imaginative set scenes and the lovers passion is portrayed beautifully but too often the movie fails to really deliver on its promise almost as if loses his nerve in the same way the lovers do br br its a worthwhile movie to watch just to see how combines his great skill as a film maker with some exploitation movie tricks to pull the audience along but sadly its not a true classic in the mold of movies like <UNK> or woman of the <UNK>
<START> i'm guessing that we all no matter if we are fans of cars <UNK> the sound of a dodge <UNK> as it <UNK> along the road the noise a <UNK> chevy make as it screams with ecstasy when it tears round a corner and most of all the blast of sound as a classic vehicle bursts into flames as it explodes i'm not the biggest car <UNK> by any stretch of the imagination but any of the above really does <UNK> my engine there's no denying the importance of transport on cinema it has even been said that the invention of the train was one of the biggest influences on early cinema looking out a window almost like a moving picture and the idea of being transported to a different time space but the car remains the most popular and most <UNK> it's even got its own genre the genre a genre that focuses purely on the beauty of cars in effect it's just porn car porn and i'm not talking about that rather nasty documentary on channel 4 in which men actually had sexual <UNK> with cars whatever <UNK> your car i guess moving on whilst running on empty isn't quite as pornographic as <UNK> point richard c <UNK> 1971 for instance with its close ups of the car in motion all it's <UNK> and <UNK> this doesn't mean that the car isn't the main focus of this film in fact the cars themselves become characters more on that later they're <UNK> and as much as the women in fact maybe even more and holy holy are these cars something every car in this film besides the ones in the background are simply beautiful  works of art there's no question about it br br as i was saying these incredible cars are in a way given characters themselves you actually start <UNK> with the car spoiler  most notably during the scene in which the car is being <UNK> and burnt spoiler over this has become almost a convention of the genre the evil 1978 <UNK> fury from christine john carpenter 1983 <UNK> <UNK> lincoln mark iii in the car elliot <UNK> 1977 the nifty little mini <UNK> from the italian job peter <UNK> 1969 to the friendly <UNK> beetle in the love bug robert stevenson 1968 and of course each car from death race 2000 paul <UNK> 1975 and even wacky races 1968 1970 all of which had their own character ironically however this emphasis on the car often over takes the human characters and this is certainly the case with running on empty in which only one human character the blind character who drives his car with his hearing rather than sight has any sort of dimension the rest are very much stock characters these are all your stereotypical australian 1980s teenagers big hair annoying accents and none of whom would look out of place in <UNK> especially the <UNK> look a like but who gives a damn it's all about the cars racing and crashing that's it if you don't like that you really are watching the wrong genre br br the car scenes are certainly the selling point of this film and the best thing it's got going for it they are fast very fast and we're not talking about the rather annoying technique some films seem to use where they record the car at around <UNK> and then speed it up <UNK> no not with this film you don't these cars are <UNK> along at top <UNK> in real time  no fancy editing tricks here so we've got speed check what about crashes check check check whilst there isn't cars crashing everywhere a la the incredibly blues brothers john <UNK> 1980 when cars do crash in this film they certainly crash it would seem that they use <UNK> or something similar to build the cars as one little hit and they're up in flames it kind of reminded me of thriller a cruel picture bo <UNK> 1974 in that sense br br between these simply awesome scenes especially the very start and the very end there are quite a few scenes which slow everything done and in my opinion fail to add very much to the film note more exploding cars needed however there are a couple of exceptions here which are great scenes  spoiler especially the attempted rape scene br br so all in all this is a man's film a boy's film full of cars around the <UNK> and a couple of tits thrown in for good measure too i'd recommend this little film to anyone even if they are keen <UNK>  it's a great film which you can just switch your brain off sit back in your leather chair and put on full volume i'll give it 3 5 <UNK> out of 5 <UNK>  p s  amazon are selling this for just over <UNK>  it's a real bargain although the dvd lacks any special features whatsoever
<START> this is an astonishingly bad action film i'd say its primary flaw is that it's boring funky <UNK> retro <UNK> set design and decent cinematography cannot prevent this flick from being a <UNK> <UNK> second major flaw is its lack of character development <UNK> by the actors' lack of talent i tend to like claire <UNK> work so i was quite surprised by her non existent performance in this film <UNK> <UNK> is woefully miscast how could his <UNK> mouthed bumbling acting style possibly fit into an action flick as for omar <UNK> well he needs to take a few acting lesson to learn how to <UNK> the man had the same facial expression for the entire film my suggestion is to save yourself a few bucks and wait to see this turkey on cable
<START> i know little or nothing about <UNK> but nevertheless i was at first a little <UNK> about the plot of this movie it follows three children that were all born during a <UNK> <UNK> and so have no emotion and thus naturally become ruthless serial killers the plot does sound ridiculous at first but once you realise that a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out <UNK> and as you know <UNK> is the emotion planet it all falls into place makes complete sense and it's then that you know you aren't simply watching another silly 80's slasher with a <UNK> brain plot thank god for that seriously though bloody birthday is based on a ridiculous premise but it more than makes up for that with it's originality having a bunch of kids going round <UNK> people may not be the most ingenious <UNK> ever seen in cinema but when given the choice between this and another dull friday the 13th clone i know what i'd choose br br also helping the film out of the hole that some people would think it's silly plot <UNK> it into is the fact that it's extremely entertaining many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some gore this film however keeps itself going with some great creepy performances from the kids which <UNK> back to creepy kid classics such as village of the damned a constant stream of sick humour and a small but impressive for the type of film dose of suspense and tension one thing that i liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of <UNK> there's nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again <UNK> halloween <UNK> but that's not the case here as bloody birthday finds room for everything from skipping <UNK> to bow and <UNK> there wasn't any room for a chainsaw which is a huge shame but i suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it
<START> uwe boll slips back in his film making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of <UNK> and <UNK> taking on super soldiers on a remote island an okay cast headed by the excellent <UNK> <UNK> is cast <UNK> by boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked the mad scientist being <UNK> by a reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness however boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way its as if he couldn't be bothered to actually figure out what would work and instead <UNK> off stock camera <UNK> and walked away additionally the <UNK> of scenes has no spark or life i'm guessing that boll only shot one or two takes and just used what he had it really stinks clearly boll is in one of his <UNK> <UNK> films where anything he's ever learned about film gets <UNK> the last film he made that was this bad was seed a serial killer movie that is one of the worst films i've ever seen this isn't that bad but it is close simply because it should have been better then again <UNK> <UNK> is good enough that he does make watching his scenes worth the effort and make this a an almost so bad its good film i'd take a pass unless it's late at night and you're catching it on cable
<START> i laughed my ass off for an hour i had no idea who dan was why haven't i heard of dan <UNK> before he's hysterical and so are his <UNK> singers they make all of these women songs that we would never wanna hear a new experience they blow these songs away this was on bravo last night why isn't this dan guy like ultra famous great voice charisma to burn he blew me away with this show i just read on the internet that he was once a member of <UNK> i guess there isn't anything he can't do i saw <UNK> at a <UNK> theater years ago and those guys were amazing this show last night was done by <UNK> does that mean that spielberg did this why don't they star this dan <UNK> in a movie there was a standing <UNK> at the end of this show and every time the <UNK> cut to the audience everyone was so into it singing along or dancing the whole show had this amazing energy my only complaint was that it was not longer but looking back when you see how much energy these guys put out i guess it would be impossible for any human being to perform with such gusto for over an hour man i loved this show
<START> this is a great movie the best role peter <UNK> ever did the music is good the message harsh the actors great and the story is both emotional and raw only in the seventies did they make them like this one
<START> yeah i know my title sucks i couldn't think of any other title x ice is a brilliant first season episode very interesting idea and good acting as well the whole worm looking thing was really creepy in my opinion i've never been a fan of insects so all the <UNK> episodes are creepy to me x anyway lets go on to the good and bad things about this episode br br the good the <UNK> thing awesome br br <UNK> finally <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 33 br br it was a good idea to put another <UNK> in the ear though if someone told me they had to put that thing in my ear i think the whole cabin would be dead br br the bad how did the dog stay alive for so long br br how didn't <UNK> get those black spots or maybe she did but no one saw it br br conclusion very good episode especially for season 1 8 10
<START> rather like paul newman and steve mcqueen with their racing car movies this has all the appearance of a <UNK> project for robert redford as he gets to <UNK> up hill and down <UNK> in the <UNK> sunshine br br the story is as light as <UNK> snow with <UNK> small town boy david what kind of lead name is that who with his eyes on the prize of olympic glory gets up the nose of in no particular order his coach father and team mates women are a mere side show in his <UNK> world as <UNK> by a fairly <UNK> pick up scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his <UNK> <UNK> pursuit of heavens above a free thinking independent woman played by <UNK> the <UNK> ing sequences are fine with some good stunt work involving numerous <UNK> and <UNK> on the but their <UNK> is <UNK> by our subsequent <UNK> with top tv coverage of <UNK> events down to the present day plus i'm not convinced that the winter <UNK> has the same mass <UNK> with the general public as the summer games so that when redford eventually wins his gold <UNK> in the final reel i couldn't really be that excited for him one way or another br br of the actors redford best profile forward doesn't need to do much and indeed doesn't while gene hackman does better with equally <UNK> material ms does well as the chief female interest well who treats redford the way he's <UNK> treated every other woman in his <UNK> way br br in truth though there's a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences don't fully compensate and you don't care a <UNK> for any of the leading characters one of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers did watching it
<START> i really wanted to like this movie but i just couldn't it had the potential to be a really cool hip remake of a cool show but that's where it fell apart it was too hip too cool first of all all the cool lines and scenes were <UNK> in the preview trailers which i'd seen lots of times and the editing was very disjointed so that the scenes didn't seem to flow together and they all seemed out of place claire danes who i love as an actress failed to make this her break through to the beyond high school acting roles the only bright spot was <UNK> <UNK> as pete his slightly stupid yet actually smart style was funny and refreshing overall though i'd recommend just watching the previews instead of seeing the movie and wishing it was more
<START> this is the first woody allen film i've found not worth watching i think woody has tried many different genres to interest results but this movie just left me irritated and bored the music is lovely but don't bother watching this hopeless mock
<START> after reading more than my fair share of reviews for a vast number of different movies i have noticed a certain trend people judge to <UNK> on what the expected to see i figure if you go into a movie open minded not expecting anything certain than you will have better feelings towards it then if you try and watch but have pre created standards you want it to reach br br since i try not to be <UNK> i watched this movie with a very clean <UNK> and open mind and was very much pleased since it is not a mainstream title or award winning for that matter i did not know quite what to expect but in all truth i enjoyed it a good deal more than ninja <UNK> lovely animation deep story and the always <UNK> ninja hack n <UNK> combined extremely well to one of my personal favorite <UNK> ever made br br i am not promising that you will enjoy it but just give it a chance and you may come out with a pleasant surprise br br before speaking be sure of what you will say will be more beautiful than the silence chinese <UNK>
<START> almost no information is available about this movie or its air dates after an ongoing and <UNK> search i found the dvd to be available for 3 99 release date <UNK> 28 2006 try <UNK> dvd and video in order to get this information posted i will continue to state that this is a well made film with a true and fascinating story about a mysterious carpenter who builds a very unusual <UNK> in a church it is a chance to see william l peterson before c s i turned him into a star equally featured in the story is the <UNK> barbara <UNK> does anyone remember when she was barbara <UNK> <UNK> i have to keep writing to get this posted thank you to the previous <UNK> for taking the time to recommend this somewhat obscure tv film which obviously leaves a lasting impression on many
<START> were it not for the fact that this came as a 2 dvd set paired with the original american <UNK> were it not for the fact that i've been here in iraq for several months and at this point will watch pretty much anything i would have tossed this movie in the garbage after the first ten minutes this movie was <UNK> bad on so many levels i just don't know where to start poorly acted shot directed written scored edited my 9 year old daughter's first <UNK> into film making are superior to this and she was filming the dog sleeping come to think of it i give that piece of cinematography 9 stars but i'm biased if you have even the slightest appreciation for quality film making then avoid this piece of garbage at all costs no character in this movie has a single redeeming quality save for the <UNK> girl who doesn't even have a single line in english i'll not waste more of my time describing what a bad movie this is
<START> harvey keitel gives a typically top rate performance in one of his first ever lead roles as <UNK> ambitious <UNK> young staff producer coleman <UNK> a real talented hot shot with a <UNK> golden ear and the son of a famous jazz <UNK> to boot <UNK> eager to cut some tracks with the <UNK> r b outfit the group none other than earth wind fire in their <UNK> funky prime but his commercial label a <UNK> records run by uptight mob connected middle of the road square jerry a properly ed nelson wants him to record a hit single for the <UNK> insipid <UNK> like pop <UNK> trio the pages an allegedly <UNK> clean bunch which includes smarmy <UNK> step dad franklin a perfectly vile bert parks bitchy neurotic daughter a fine <UNK> turn by <UNK> <UNK> brunette <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> addict son gary former 50's juvenile sitcom <UNK> jimmy <UNK> the extremely naive and idealistic coleman must learn <UNK> how the music business truly works and play the <UNK> dirty game as best he can or else he'll lose both the group and his credibility br br <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> harsh and biased script from <UNK> <UNK> and rock journalist robert director <UNK> shore who's most famous for producing <UNK> shows a decidedly cynical and <UNK> depiction of the various <UNK> pay offs broken promises back <UNK> and double <UNK> which are an unpleasant yet <UNK> part of the largely corrupt rock music business with particularly thoughtful <UNK> <UNK> concerning art vs <UNK> fighting to retain one's artistic integrity and the then recent push to rock into bland useless <UNK> <UNK> mainstream <UNK> moreover this gritty downbeat gem offers a rare fascinating <UNK> detailed and wholly believable <UNK> glimpse at the recording process as recording booth <UNK> cowboy coleman struggles <UNK> in his own words to make chicken <UNK> out of chicken s t appearing in nifty bits are disc <UNK> and legendary fifth <UNK> murray the k as <UNK> <UNK> dj big john little bites his hand after big john <UNK> her <UNK> during a live on air interview new york soul dj and host of <UNK> friday night videos frankie <UNK> as his own self r b singer <UNK> doris <UNK> she penned the lovely just one look as a church <UNK> and <UNK> bald 70's <UNK> favorite charles <UNK> as a priest at a wedding the rather poor sound and allan <UNK> sloppy cinematography inadvertently add to the film's overall <UNK> rough around the edges documentary style authenticity although technically a bit lacking this movie overall still rates as one of the great most <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> behind the scenes gems from the 70's
<START> this is not a film is a clever witty and often heart touching movie it's a <UNK> of a failed relationship between michael connor michael campbell and his estranged irish girlfriend grace <UNK> michael down on his luck decides to make a documentary <UNK> his whole relationship and what went wrong he exploits his friendship with an actor he met at the gym <UNK> <UNK> who he gets to play grace the concept of this film is very original michaels relationship is shown from every point whether it's a high or low michael campbell pulls off a fantastic performance that makes you want to help him find grace if fact most of the characters pull off great performances except the <UNK> the <UNK> is needed to move the plot along yet seems too surreal to exist in a coffee shop his monologues are often <UNK> and pointless this is proved when he says out of this chaos we're all trying to create order and out of the order meaning but in reality there is no such thing as meaning something only has meaning if we make it have meaning br br the commentary saves this movie the commentary is done in the vain of this is spinal tap and has michael and his brother explain the problems they had while making the film michael offers a very funny self conscious commentary that makes for some very good belly laughs br br overall i'd give this movie a 7 10
<START> when i bought this film i expected to get a fun 1970's exploitation film instead i got this bore fest by amateur auteur andy <UNK> ah andy <UNK> with his tight editing <UNK> pacing and wonderfully well known actors you'd almost think you're watching one of his home movies seriously i couldn't even stay awake the first time i tried to watch it the scenes of boring people dragged on an on and whenever someone got killed the film would slow down sometimes it would speed up too making the characters voices sound like <UNK> which was probably the best thing about this film the script actually seemed a bit better than the film and seems more well suited to be in a soap opera than in a grainy 70's sleeping <UNK> where the actors constantly stumble over it's lines the cover said their prime cuts were curiously erotic but thoroughly brutal trust me there is nothing erotic about this film oh we do get to see characters that resemble extra <UNK> <UNK> cheese making out but that's about it and as far as brutal well the viewer is <UNK> the most with this here film and another thing
<START> people stranded in a country house during a storm discover that the home was the sight of an <UNK> murder years before during a dinner discussion of the incident the lights go out and when they come back on they discover that one of the guests has been killed <UNK> for their lives the guests attempt to find out the secrets behind the death before others can occur according to the dvd <UNK> synopsis br br there are a couple of clever twists in this murder at the old dark house story with the play within a play being its most interesting feature however the direction is rather ordinary which serves to highlight a certain <UNK> of production like most movies of this type there is or should be an ensemble of intriguing characters <UNK> only old time broadway producer richard <UNK> as herman wood and his <UNK> secretary johnny arthur as homer maintain interest br br the ghost walks 12 1 <UNK> frank r <UNK> richard <UNK> johnny arthur john <UNK>
<START> first separate the story from the film the story about a second continuing war in heaven is good very good religious themed films aren't the main choice for a lot of people but angels at war is i really loved the story and some of the imagery provided to back it up like the field of angels on <UNK> awesome imagery the actual film though was just poor i can't find any reason for the main character the priest <UNK> cop being in there at all the lead female also no reason to be there the main characters dialogue was just empty it had no substance the story could have been told well without them now some sterling performances did feature walken <UNK> and <UNK> pulled off some <UNK> though their scenes were mostly with the lifeless leads br br one other thing i am not getting from this film is why it features native american <UNK> to <UNK> the dark soul the child that carries it is clearly of native american origin but apart from the end scenario there is nothing that <UNK> here with that <UNK> the plot concerning the dark soul itself it barely told odd considering that the dark soul is the driver for the whole premise of the film the back story of its original owner the colonel is briefly touched but not enough to allow understanding as to why its his soul that is the special one br br i cannot find a justification for the <UNK> scenery shots in this film either several of the <UNK> around <UNK> i get the feeling they had a helicopter and wanted to make the most of it as none of the shots have any relevance nor are they in keeping with the mood horror the film falls into the sci fi category more than it does horror there was no real shock or scare scenes some mild gore and blood but no fear element br br so aside from 3 roles played damn well this film is a big <UNK> dud unfortunately the dud factor <UNK> the good acting factor just too many weekend actors
<START> this is a movie that will <UNK> up your day for sure <UNK> the frog is just an ordinary frog in his swamp when a talent agent stops by and tells him that hollywood is looking for <UNK> to be in movie lol on the way <UNK> meets <UNK> bear miss <UNK> <UNK> and his chicken <UNK> <UNK> the electric mayhem <UNK> and <UNK> but also <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> of a restaurant chain doc <UNK> french fried frog legs all things considered though <UNK> and the muppets make it to hollywood br br this movie is recommended for everyone young and old br br it has some wonderful musical numbers like the <UNK> connection i'm going to go back there someday and <UNK> right along the muppets also use many forms of <UNK> in this movie <UNK> rides a bike <UNK> drives a and another car <UNK> takes flight with a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> which is one of my favorite moments by the way and <UNK> and the rest of the muppets finally go the rest of the way by the electric bus dr teeth <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and animal who meet up with them in the desert after car breaks down br br even some <UNK> street muppets make cameo appearances i e big bird is walking along on the road on the way to nyc to break into public television the end is also a very heartwarming moment every single muppet created is in the final scene along with a final <UNK> connection <UNK> br br but those poor muppets worked so hard on their movie set then it all comes crashing down and the camera explodes in a huge ball of sparks you'd think everything is ruined and destroyed but the <UNK> comes shining through the roof at the end and it all sums up the magic of this film and you know everything will be all right br br perfect 10 10 watch it and you'll be enchanted by the fun and sadness of this movie
<START> bring back the a team was a hour long special screened on channel 4 in the uk of last year and <UNK> by <UNK> and comedian justin lee collins the show attempted to track down and reunite the fellow cast members of the a team together for the first time ever on tv this has been something which has never been attempted before by anyone well not by anyone that i know of that is br br justin makes a great <UNK> and his eccentric personality and humorous banter <UNK> throughout this programme the attempts he makes in getting hold of the cast members is ever so funny but also he was very <UNK> and eager to <UNK> this task too which is a credit to him i'd say mind you he is great on tv anyway be it by presenting a show such as this or the friday night project with his co host alan <UNK> br br there were appearances and interviews with <UNK> <UNK> the himself dwight <UNK> aka howling mad <UNK> <UNK> who played baker jack <UNK> aka general full bright the creator of the a team stephen j <UNK> and the big man himself mr t aka <UNK> they were just fascinating to watch and hear what they had to say about the programme that became a global hit during the 80s as they <UNK> and <UNK> the good and bad moments of the show both during and behind the scenes unfortunately no george <UNK> but of course he is already in heaven understandably and strangely enough no melinda who played amy br br i just didn't understand why she wasn't featured in the show okay she was <UNK> after 3 seasons or whatever but she was the first and original female member of the a team only to be replaced and so it would've been great to see and hear her side to the a team story in addition to the other cast members br br all in all bring back the a team was a great documentary style of show perhaps this could've been spread out more by means of which this could've been a six part documentary but nonetheless this was a great effort on the part of recommended
<START> i can't stand people who comment on this program or other hbo programs as too graphic or unnecessarily graphic or that they contain gratuitous nudity violence <UNK> etc br br guess what prison life isn't pg 13 the gratuitous graphic content is true to life of this situation prison contains <UNK> rape killings drug deals and <UNK> if you don't like it then don't watch the program i'm certainly no fan of prison rape but if it was left out of the show i'd be surprised and lend the show less credibility if the prisoners didn't curse it would just be silly sure it's gratuitous language but that is realistic br br the show is good some of the viewers not so much i guess
<START> if you read the book by carl the movie follows pretty much true to form with a few minor changes for hollywood in my opinion this is a great family movie luke wilson officer pretty well steals the show from an all star cast that includes robert wagner and jimmy <UNK> the kids in the movie do a great job led by logan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and cody br br <UNK> <UNK> is maybe a little too <UNK> to play <UNK> i <UNK> a bigger girl maybe 6 foot <UNK> <UNK> in the role of <UNK> this might have made her more believable in her role of beating up dana they should have developed her tough girl character more and had her bite through a tire or kick a soccer ball through a person she is very pretty and i understand why she was cast she is a box office attraction br br this is about as pg as a movie gets these days no sex and very little violence this movie is a come true a movie with a strong <UNK> message with kids that have deep appreciation for the beauty of florida and its <UNK> it shows how adults have fallen short in the <UNK> of our planet and that our children can demand better one of my favorite lines in the movie is when <UNK> fingers says florida could use some mountains like montana florida is so flat there is nothing to stop <UNK> from <UNK> it coast to coast also the photography of florida <UNK> spoke volumes without dialog as a family movie with kids ages 5 15 this is a great movie as a bonus parents' will be entertained especially if they're
<START> michael myers the deranged not so young anymore psycho who seems to get with every appearance is <UNK> by his <UNK> brothers to wreck more menace upon his family members and any one else who gets in the way gaps in logic seem to be ignored in favor of a healthy body count michael who originally preferred <UNK> and kitchen knives learns to swing an axe and use whatever means necessary to off his victims and the result is an awful <UNK> dollar store film virtually by a few genuinely creepy sequences donald <UNK> who died shortly after production seems to have been <UNK> into this story simply so somebody could be billed as the star you won't want to cover your eyes during this one but you will shake your head at the <UNK> slide of john carpenter's classic creation
<START> i caught up with this movie on tv after 30 years or more several aspects of the film stood out even when viewing it so many years after it was made br br the story by the little known c <UNK> is remarkable almost resembling a <UNK> like story of a man <UNK> by a <UNK> scheme that he cannot comprehend compare this film with better known contemporary works such as <UNK> list and you begin to realize the trauma of the world war ii should be seen against the larger <UNK> of racism beyond the simplistic nazi notion of <UNK> vs jews this film touches on the <UNK> dislike for the <UNK> the <UNK> dislike of the russians and so on even touching on the <UNK> questionable relationships with their christian romanian friends while under stress br br as i have not read the book it is difficult to see how much has been changed by the director and screenplay writers for instance it is interesting to study the romanian view of to usa with the view of making money only to return to romania and <UNK> his <UNK> there br br in my opinion the character of <UNK> was probably one of the finest roles played by anthony quinn <UNK> alongside his work in la <UNK> <UNK> the greek and br br the finest and most memorable sequence in the film is the final one with anthony quinn and trying to smile the father carrying a daughter born out his wife's rape by russians is a story in itself but the director is able to show the <UNK> by a simple gesture the act of carrying the child without <UNK> into melodramatic footage br br today after the death of princess diana we often remark about the <UNK> <UNK> the final sequence is an <UNK> of the <UNK> and the <UNK> media director <UNK> also makes a similar comment during the court scene as the <UNK> get ready to <UNK> on <UNK> br br the interaction between church and state was so beautifully summed up in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> statement i pray to god that he <UNK> those who have power to use them well br br some of the brief shots such as those of a secretary of a minister <UNK> while listening to a <UNK> said so much in so little footage the direction was so impressive that the editing takes a back seat br br finally what struck me most was the exquisite rich <UNK> of colors provided by the cameraman <UNK> <UNK> from the brilliant credit sequences to the end i <UNK> that he was the cameraman of another favorite french film of mine called of clay directed by jean louis i have not seen such use of colors in a long while save for the david lean epics br br there were flaws i wish character was more fleshed out i could never quite understand the <UNK> character the only intellectual in the entire film the <UNK> station scene at the end seems to be lifted out of sergio <UNK> westerns finally the film was essentially built around a love story that unfortunately takes a back seat br br to sum up this film impressed me in more <UNK> than one the story is relevant today as it was when it was made
<START> this scene shows how <UNK> experiment by using his brain manipulation invention goes terribly wrong creating the were rabbit his desire as a social <UNK> is to improve society for the better therefore created a brain <UNK> machine he <UNK> his own life to help solve rabbit problem and more importantly to overcome the <UNK> of <UNK> being <UNK> and <UNK> in his basement though he thought his experiment worked however it resulted in placing more pressure on him and <UNK> to find a solution before the <UNK> <UNK> competition again <UNK> his life <UNK> who is a silent faithful dog and a loyal <UNK> finds himself continuously thinking of innovative ways to save his master from his radical crazy <UNK> going terribly wrong what is interesting in this movie is trying to identify who is more <UNK> wallace or <UNK>
<START> i don't play video games at all but my children do br br i got a big kick out of this would like to see more of this type of film very cool as my youngest would say br br interesting characters and the overall story line was interesting like i said i don't play video games but i think that my children would enjoyed this it was not full of bad language and that is a pleasant change this visual concept was different which caught my eye plus the sound track was pretty good i might even try out some of the games my sons plays to see because of this film who knows maybe i'll be a <UNK> someday
<START> found this film in a dvd <UNK> rack for 10 it wasn't worth it some of the camera work and dialog look and sound as if it were done by a film student <UNK> performance was somewhat credible but the film was predictable and the action was <UNK> and dragged br br one thing that i will give them however unlike most action films people in this film actually ran out of <UNK> and dead bodies for new weapons and <UNK>
<START> i'm no <UNK> at finding redeeming social value whatever book or film people want to <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> heart of darkness to i don't know deep throat or the latest hostage <UNK> i sincerely wish they wouldn't i'm not a lover of porn or of violence as entertainment but what of them i chance upon i tend to see camera angles cuts pans lighting <UNK> nearly to the <UNK> of fear or <UNK> sometimes even missing <UNK> or actors' intent even from footage that reasonable people may argue should never have existed i always imagine there's something to learn i wonder more at how a film does than about what it does maybe that's wrong of me <UNK> but harder than <UNK> unpleasant cinema might be to see cuts pans etc at one with and <UNK> from no matter what content i ask myself what horror filmmakers and church <UNK> have in common add in political filmmakers fascist and not all manipulate with light space and sound in order to alter perception and mood how different are their goals how different are the goals of those who film real atrocities for use as propaganda br br when the original all night long trilogy appeared on my shelf i left it <UNK> for nearly year curiosity had made me buy it i <UNK> a few minutes of 1 the day it arrived up to the <UNK> sound <UNK> street corner stabbing that seems really an attack on film <UNK> sensibility found it inept but effective i'd have to come back to it certainly but didn't <UNK> the <UNK> clearly this wasn't the sublime horror of <UNK> cure angel dust <UNK> the <UNK> but still <UNK> framed horror of the first evil dead trap the overtly political work of <UNK> or even the brilliant <UNK> of early <UNK> br br maybe that word attack is key attacks not his characters but his viewers i can't watch these at this point in history without thinking of both abu some of which i think i recall was <UNK> on video and the hostage videos but also about <UNK> <UNK> in le <UNK> to whom atrocity is just a job a <UNK> of a person's <UNK> and then there's the prolonged northern california news story whose details i barely remember but can't entirely forget because it too <UNK> cinema a duo of serial killers notorious if suggestion isn't playing games with my memory for having <UNK> themselves torturing victims br br all three entries are revenge cinema vigilante <UNK> but i'm <UNK> these notes because it's the most ambitious and may <UNK> a turning point for director i haven't seen the entries that followed through the first two offerings i imagined a camera fallen into the hands of one of those <UNK> kids from middle or <UNK> school who <UNK> draw war scenes or other atrocities or as if one of revenge crazed characters had turned writer director anyone watching these who hasn't seen michael <UNK> <UNK> tom would do well to see it but seems to <UNK> to mainstream protagonist grows <UNK> plants allowing for some typically japanese cool close up nature shots there's also for the first time a film a <UNK> erotic sequence female boss <UNK> up and begins to <UNK> him while he's <UNK> at the love <UNK> customers finds himself <UNK> <UNK> between he's a <UNK> the brief thrill comes from the layers of <UNK> there's even a philosophical poetic garbage a garbage <UNK> who somehow makes me think of the poem repeated in not at all what it sounds like go go virgin br br i'm getting nowhere with this and it's getting in the way of my commenting other films can't escape the suspicion that a few years on i'll walk into a <UNK> at my local film archive maybe <UNK> by some learned character who's caught onto something i'm missing br br how much does it matter whether the director is or simply gets his <UNK> muddled protagonists does he even have to understand them maybe a director's job is just to <UNK> it out then let critics and the rest of us <UNK> things out maybe directorial or artistic responsibility is a bogus notion br br my final struggle with this thing had me wondering what on earth a woman thinks watching these <UNK> male <UNK> we put women through this over and over from star wars to et <UNK> and et <UNK> and on and on and on and on but is anything quite as male <UNK> as the all night <UNK>
<START> jack frost 2 the worst horror film i have ever seen why 1 the premise is well beyond ridiculous 2 the damn thing doesn't even have legs to move on 3 it escapes after being completely <UNK> in anti freeze first film 4 get this it travels all the way across an ocean of salt water to a <UNK> island to get revenge on the sheriff that did him in the first film 5 killer <UNK> i have yet to be drunk enough to see ginger dead man so as of the writing of this jack frost 2 hold the distinction of being the stupidest horror film ever even <UNK> the of it's predecessor if you can believe that
<START> i don't normally go out of my way to watch romantic comedy and maybe i will in the future after seeing return to me the plot was simple and no secret after the publicity you don't have to be einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes what you can do is relax and let the cast take you into a world where the chemistry <UNK> and the good guys win and you can just laugh and have a good time i love this movie and have the dvd on order

<START> i have spent the last 5 years in the entertainment business and most recently find myself working for the company that made this movie which is a real pity because i like these folks i just can't believe anyone could possibly make anything as bad as this this was crap from every possible angle from camera work to dialogue to acting to costumes and production design was one of the worst films i have ever seen the actors in this film looked like they had been taken straight off of a porn that was being shot in the san <UNK> valley and put on a set with an even less talented crew br br i just can't get over the fact that i am sitting on some of the best material i have ever read and contacts within the industry that could help me make my dream a reality and have hit every <UNK> possible yet the folks behind this spectacle of a film have no problems putting it together and in fact sleep well after it is released br br life what a trip
<START> problem child 2 was a complete waste of my time the original film wasn't very good but its a classic compared to this film the first film went over the top with its scenes of a <UNK> child <UNK> major havoc in the lives of everyone he's around here it goes even further over the top and one scene in this movie proves that theory that carnival ride sequence was too much for me to stomach it's awful this movie shouldn't have been made br br 1 2 out of four
<START> a very insightful psychological thriller <UNK> is a stylish example of the 70's powerful italian film making and <UNK> a wrongly underrated director and visually amazing the movie develops its unusual plot with an incredibly suspenseful atmosphere and never disappoints especially in its sad and dramatic finale <UNK> <UNK> delivers an excellent performance rich of nuances and touching sensitivity being able to portray a dark lady who is not only fascinating but also painfully real and <UNK> <UNK> but the all cast is a treat as well <UNK> <UNK> the mysterious kid by the beach italian screen legend <UNK> and stunningly beautiful b movie queen evelyn stewart in the brief but haunting role of the <UNK> friend and <UNK> kinski in a surprisingly disturbing cameo it's peculiar to notice how incredibly well done movies like <UNK> were <UNK> moody and creepy cinematography stylized locations and sets <UNK> <UNK> haunting score and first of all the story so intense and disturbing so intelligently layered and structured a thriller with fantastic elements but especially with a soul and a personal vision i wish movies like <UNK> would not be forgotten i wish the movies were more insightful and personal today as they were back in the 60's 70's and yes i wish somebody will soon make a <UNK> <UNK> widescreen dvd out of this little masterpiece

<START> in a world where humans can live forever you spend the entire movie wishing they would die first off if you insist on watching this movie do two things first put it on mute don't worry you miss a plot hell they don't even talk for the first 70 min of an <UNK> min movie after putting on mute you must now hit fast forward till the main chick dies don't worry even if your paying attention you won't know why or how she died once you get to the good part take it of mute oh how will you know the good part wait for an elevator scene with two morons in space suits with wwii weapons these weapons won't seem like much till you realize that the first protagonist had a laser tag pistol and a of <UNK> <UNK> the only <UNK> of a plot take place between a glowing ball and a semi hot chick who looks like she was attacked by <UNK> after listening to the plot you will wish they went back to not talking of the four people that are in this movie none of them can remotely act not even a little bit you will have better luck witnessing acting at a <UNK> theater br br to comment on the special on the special effects let me just say wow no really you will spend the entire movie saying to your self where did this movie's 1 8 million dollar budget go seriously it will leave you in <UNK> of the <UNK> of <UNK> the best sets are basically windows <UNK> backgrounds the ships are basically flying <UNK> wait some are that kinda look like <UNK> i have never heard so many made up words in my whole life they have buttons on their <UNK> large that can put them in fight mode and super mode makes them super <UNK> this will seriously drain their power <UNK> but they find bits of <UNK> to chew on to regain their strength the explosions were less impressive than my fourth of july i only had <UNK> br br so the plot as far as i can figure goes something like this mother is a space ship captain and goes to the desert for a while rides a rocket dies then her daughter <UNK> years in the future no i am not <UNK> recalls her mother's memories through some sort of capsule anyways they <UNK> on for another 10 min and then the cause a big bang yes the same big bang that started our <UNK> system it's explained how she goes back in time or something it does not really matter it happened i guess roll credits seriously the whole script was mercifully on one sheet of paper unless that actually detailed any of the dreadfully fight scenes br br after watching the credits i have now laughed more than i did the entire movie the jobs the created like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and then the special thanks to george lucas was just the best br br i really wasn't expecting that much for a movie i paid 99 cents for but seriously some body owes me for this most frequent comment heard after the movie i want my life back you have to admire that some but put time and effort in to this movie but seriously why
<START> the movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black and the agency needs a token on the board is ignoring the meeting reading jet magazine at the big table and everybody is ignoring suddenly the <UNK> on the spot no time is wasted a janitor is called to <UNK> off the corpse and the board immediately and <UNK> <UNK> the business of <UNK> a new <UNK> and as the votes are one by one the tension is built up and then finally <UNK> in a hilariously ironic climax to the vote that gives the viewer a delicious dish of logical <UNK> to <UNK> for the rest of the movie if you've ever talked back to some stupid television commercial you'll like seeing this movie too bad there don't seem to be any real in the world
<START> director j s <UNK> presents something a little scary and a little creepy but nothing more a widowed mother karen <UNK> <UNK> a home in the <UNK> mountains so she takes her two daughters and moves into the <UNK> estate in what seems the middle of nowhere but it is somewhere somewhere ninety some odd years ago a tragic mining accident claimed the lives of numerous children who were forced to labor in the dark and <UNK> the area and especially the estate seems to be haunted by the spirits of the tiny little wicked souls the legend is the screaming children come out in the <UNK> to seek their revenge and you better believe it also in the cast ben cross <UNK> taylor <UNK> chloe julie rogers and geoffrey lewis
<START> bloody birthday opens to a shot of <UNK> general hospital there three babies are being born at precisely the same time during a total <UNK> a <UNK> informs us that it is now california june 1 two teenage lovers duke benson ben <UNK> and annie smith <UNK> hope are getting down to business in an open grave they hear noises and duke <UNK> both duke and annie are murdered sheriff jim <UNK> bert kramer is <UNK> and only has the handle of a child's skipping rope that annie was holding as a clue unfortunately before sheriff <UNK> can solve the case his youngest daughter debbie elizabeth <UNK> and two of her friends curtis taylor billy <UNK> as billy <UNK> and steven andy freeman murder him just as they are finishing sheriff <UNK> off another young boy from their class named timmy <UNK> k c <UNK> turns up the three killers are unaware of how much he saw soon after the incident timmy plays with steven and curtis in a <UNK> curtis locks timmy into an old locker timmy manages to escape and tell his sister <UNK> <UNK> but she doesn't believe him at first the three children carry on their murder spree their strict teacher miss davis susan <UNK> a <UNK> couple john <UNK> and sylvia wright in a van and <UNK> older sister beverly julie brown are among their victims <UNK> begins to have her <UNK> about debbie curtis and steven which makes her and timmy a target for the evil trio will they be able to convince the authorities that these three innocent looking 10 year olds are really soulless killers br br co written and directed by ed hunt i have an intense dislike for this film i think it's absolutely awful and doesn't have a single enjoyable aspect to it's <UNK> minute running time the script by hunt and barry <UNK> gives us no explanation for the child killers motives beyond the <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> out <UNK> and therefore for some bizarre <UNK> reason these three children don't have any conscience so these are the only children ever born during a total <UNK> if that is true why do they wait until just before their <UNK> before starting their killing spree i guess it just suddenly kicks in right to it's credit it is reasonably well paced but i still found it incredibly boring and tedious to sit through the film as a whole is very <UNK> and predictable the children are revealed as the killers within the first 10 minutes and as i've mentioned next to no motive is given it's very silly at times too check out the scene where debbie stops steven by throwing a bowl of water over him the <UNK> death is put down to him falling down some steps yeah right the <UNK> suffered from that type of accident aren't going to be the same as if your beaten to death with a baseball bat like he was in reality any competent doctor or <UNK> would have spotted that within 5 seconds there isn't a single drop of blood <UNK> in the entire film and all of the lame killings are dull and unimaginative there is some out of place looking nudity as debbie charges to let boys <UNK> through a hole while her sister beverly <UNK> there is an early scene just after the 5 minute mark when <UNK> walks from the kitchen to the living room and the boom mike is clearly visible at the top of the screen not even a little bit of it the whole damn thing the general incompetence continues throughout the film the whole production is bland and instantly forgettable the acting is poor throughout those three kids are very annoying and got on my nerves right from the start and made sitting through this film even more of a chore especially curtis in his geeky over sized glasses i just hate this film really simple as that i can't think of a single good thing to say about it definitely one to avoid
<START> possible spoilers from <UNK> and director peter chan the love is a romantic comedy that takes place in a <UNK> new england <UNK> village where single mom helen kate <UNK> owns a quaint little <UNK> one day at work helen happens across an anonymous letter the love of the title that has somehow become <UNK> beneath the <UNK> of a reading couch upon reading the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she believes it has been written to her <UNK> placed in the couch for her to find and for reasons of her own thinks she knows the identity of her secret admirer inadvertently however helen leaves the letter out where her employee janet ellen <UNK> finds it believes it to be for her and of course thinks she knows who wrote it circumstances then bring it into the possession of a young man named johnny tom everett scott who thinks helen has written the letter to him and before it all gets <UNK> out you can only imagine the hilarious situations into which all of those involved have been cast and i do mean imagine because the way this movie plays out the audience gets little more from it than what it brings along itself there are two specific areas in which this romantic comedy fails miserably it simply isn't very romantic and it's not funny and that is a potent combination that causes this film to misfire practically from the opening credits once the setting and main character helen have been established it basically goes nowhere for the next ninety minutes or so by the time you finally find out who actually wrote the letter and to whom you could care less <UNK> out the cast is tom <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nicholson gloria stuart and <UNK> <UNK> it's a shame to see such talent wasted on such <UNK> as this and looking bad in the balance kate <UNK> who usually <UNK> up the screen just by showing up looks tired here while <UNK> appears to have just come in off a three day <UNK> that's lasted a week ellen <UNK> actually comes away looking the best of the bunch it is said that the journey is often a more <UNK> experience than the destination in the case of the love letter ' however it would have been best for all concerned if everybody had just stayed home in the first place i rate this one 1 10
<START> okay let me start off by saying that on the whole i don't like anime very much i've enjoyed a couple of the <UNK> <UNK> classic series but regard the medium as a whole in exactly the same way that i do american television namely that a good 90 95 of it is utter tripe with the remainder falling anywhere from watchable to decent this being the case it's no wonder that i don't like the self <UNK> anime parodies out there i don't get most of the jokes and the medium itself <UNK> a certain style of humor that doesn't appeal to me at all loud <UNK> <UNK> and completely over the top br br so when i started watching this series at the <UNK> of a friend i was <UNK> for disappointment after the first couple of episodes i figured that the characters were supposed to represent cliché characters from <UNK> story <UNK> and that their actions were supposed to be similarly satirical i could kind of see where it was coming from but didn't think that it was all that clever lots of wacky fun filled high school <UNK> and goings on only now we're being ironic about it at about the third episode my opinion drastically changed br br it was at that point that the strengths of this series started to <UNK> themselves the quirks of the non <UNK> episode order its <UNK> sense of self awareness and above all clever humor with gasp a well executed straight man br br in what i consider to be a <UNK> in any medium this show presents well thought out witty interactions between <UNK> opposed characters protagonist <UNK> sense of vaguely annoyed <UNK> provides the perfect foil to the actions of title character generic anime like exploits it's a break from formula and it works incredibly well br br based on that strong foundation the series further succeeds with a truly phenomenal level of attention to detail as previously stated the episodes air out of <UNK> order i considered this to be a gimmick at first but it works surprisingly well the <UNK> sequence of events makes sense <UNK> but the aired order of the episodes more closely follows the traditional structure of <UNK> drama the order chosen leaves no narrative gaps that cannot be filled by simple <UNK> but while it is possible to guess what happened in an <UNK> <UNK> episode one still feels compelled to watch exactly how those events unfold and superb planning <UNK> any plot holes or <UNK> i watched this series a second time immediately upon <UNK> it the first time and i was amazed at how well even seemingly <UNK> events were all tied together br br the last point is <UNK> of the extreme attention to detail in every area of the series while the stock anime character designs <UNK> a bit the background art is exquisite realistically rendered based upon actual <UNK> references animation quality is also excellent at important points for example there is a musical performance late on in the series in which the characters are shown actually playing a song this may sound trivial but the <UNK> effect of watching film quality animation which actually <UNK> to the soundtrack is incredible br br in short i love this series for some reason by its very nature it is something that i generally dislike but its execution is so unique and well carried out that i can't help it
<START> or vice versa br br this is a french film noir directed by an american film maker jules <UNK> who had to leave the country because of being <UNK> by hollywood thanks to <UNK> the premise of the story is rather familiar one last jewel heist for tony le and his <UNK> and so is the ending with everybody getting well no spoilers here for sure since this is the sort of film in which tension toward the ending is important br br <UNK> filmed in realistic lighting in black and white on the streets of paris using actors and actresses who are not glamorous the engaging sometimes <UNK> score by georges nicely enhances the movie and will remind viewers of many a similar score from american film <UNK> from the forties and early fifties jean plays the hardcore <UNK> lead in a <UNK> much as <UNK> bogart might have played him tony's recently out of prison past his prime but still tough and <UNK> when he has to be his mind still sharp when focused the kind of anti hero whose eyes water even though the tears will never fall br br <UNK> plays the italian and would be ladies man who knows the rules but gets <UNK> br br in film noir we are forced by the logic and focus of the film to identify with the bad guys often there are levels of bad guys the good bad guys we are <UNK> with and the bad bad guys who are out to do in our good bad guys and then maybe there's a really bad bad bad guy or two here we have <UNK> played by robert <UNK> a slightly sadistic <UNK> then there are the cops who are irrelevant or nearly so in more modern film noir the bad guys are not even good bad guys and they get away with it or something close to that in the old film noir which evolved from the gangster films of the thirties the usual <UNK> following the old hollywood code was crime doesn't pay with every criminal having to pay for his or her crime before the end of the movie br br probably the most impressive feature of <UNK> is how nicely the film moves along the plot unfolds quickly and <UNK> much the way the great film directors always did it directors like stanley kubrick louis <UNK> and the best of hitchcock some have actually compared this to kubrick's the killing 1956 and suggest that kubrick stole a little well directors always steal if need be and there are some perhaps telling similarities such as it being one last heist for the protagonist and having the girl <UNK> up the works the similarities may go deeper because as this film was <UNK> its end i suddenly thought oh no the <UNK> in the back seat is going to fly out of the <UNK> hit the ground burst open and all the money is going to fly into the air those of you who have seen the killing may recall what happened to the money near the end of the film which reminds me of another film with something bad happening to the money oliver <UNK> u turn 1997 starring sean penn there the money in his <UNK> gets blown to <UNK> by a shotgun blast ha ha ha getting the dubbed version of this film would be an act of <UNK> since the dialogue when there is some the heist itself is done entirely without dialogue about 30 minutes worth is <UNK> and easy to follow <UNK> only an occasional glance at the subtitles which by the way are quite <UNK> and <UNK> as opposed to having every word spelled out br br one other thing all the brutality is done as sex used to be done in film that is off camera a guy gets his throat <UNK> we don't see it i kind of like this approach we don't have to see the gore you could almost let your kids see <UNK> almost br br catch this one now and be on the <UNK> for a hollywood <UNK> starring al pacino and directed by harold <UNK> coming out next year in which you can be sure that the violent scenes will be played out in full
<START> you know i've seen a lot of crappy hong kong movies in terms of production and were good but running out of time was great br br i guess what made it so good was the fact that andy <UNK> and <UNK> wang have such great chemistry the film at first is really fast paced but slows down not enough to even notice which is also good we don't want to have a heart attack lol in terms of plot their is enough of other things going on to keep you interested <UNK> has some pretty good moments as he uses make up to <UNK> people from the underworld also the movie has the best oriental supporting cast since house of flying <UNK> br br the movie is great because its so unpredictable and leaves you wondering at every corner definitely a good rental with tons of comedy action and thrills <UNK> in to one 8 out of 10
<START> this is a very underrated movie to say the least as has been pointed out in previous <UNK> this movie has a somewhat loose and highly implausible script but you find yourself saying who cares while shooting milk or insert <UNK> of your choice here through your nose it was indeed due to a rare mix of actors in sync while <UNK> <UNK> is obviously a gifted actor reference this movie the supporting actors actress play their roles quite well i found in interesting how they threw in the part about <UNK> martin blowing the shot in the <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> basketball team if any of you is a basketball fan you'll remember martin from <UNK> men can't and <UNK> the and you'll know that martin had a short <UNK> in the <UNK> with the nice how they threw in believable character attributes such as this rob <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> character was the perfect <UNK> to <UNK> calm demeanor lauren holly played the <UNK> <UNK> with a brain well enough to make you want her to succeed this is a movie that will make you laugh even if you've seen it many times before the comic bits in this movie definitely last i still find myself laughing 12 years later br br is that one of my <UNK> <UNK> no this a parrot from the <UNK> well don't let it fly away that's <UNK>
<START> luis <UNK> will always be remembered as a great film because it is absolutely honest in its presentation of comical assault on religion it is one of those outstanding films which must be shown to all people especially young children in order to them with the notions of good and bad sacred and evil the <UNK> question asked by is about the strengths and weaknesses of organized religion it has been <UNK> by involving numerous ordinary people who are not at all above petty affairs in their mundane lives especially sins <UNK> scores tremendously by showing us that various questions related to class differences deserve frank honest and reliable answers appears credible as it has been made in a light comical vein this is the sole reason why it can be said that the story of an ordinary priest appears absolutely true to life to all audiences it is amazing how <UNK> approaches quest for true love issue in his film this black white gem was shot <UNK> by gabriel <UNK> one of luis <UNK> favorite cameraman film critic <UNK> saw at india during 13th international film festival of <UNK> 2009 was introduced by <UNK> indian cinema personality mr p k <UNK> as part of a special package called 50 years ago this is a film which should be with any <UNK> dvd collector
<START> let me say this new he man cartoon is not destroying childhood memories as i didn't like the old he man cartoon either i loved the action figures but i found the cartoon to be corny and i hated the storyline the he man i liked was the one from the very early pre cartoon mini comics included in the figure boxes where he man was a barbarian the sword of power was split in two pieces and there was no prince adam no ripoff premise and no anyway let's leave the old stuff alone br br the new he man cartoon or at least this pilot is a disgrace on its own s it represents both the worst cheesiness of the old show and the worst of nowadays i watched it because i had heard the in your face morals of the old show were thankfully gone and this one had more <UNK> and character development but i encountered an awful <UNK> of the worst clichés of the genre characters i couldn't help but hate and the sadly inevitable matrix <UNK> visual style br br i think it was a good idea to give a bit of a background to the characters as it was showing a pre face <UNK> <UNK> but that's how far the character development goes aside from the usual coming to age rubbish i see coming in the subsequent episodes where this <UNK> adam will be learning the responsibility of his new acquired powers blah blah at least in the old show adam was not a spoiled brat i found myself hating his guts that's what we get when they put out an adventure show aimed at pre teens pretty faces and wanna be cool and look juvenile clothes i should check new episodes to see if <UNK> make a special appearance man does this show remind me to the 1996 flash gordon <UNK> cartoon br br dialogue ha it follows absolutely every cliché in the book from the <UNK> <UNK> two shoes in the opening scene to immortal oh and he man i <UNK> in the ending and voice is still the same high pitch kind than in the old series 20 years and nothing we have <UNK> br br and sure nowadays there can't exist something remotely action related that's not matrix style leave anime to the japanese folks think fresh ideas and seeing the characters' poses while fighting didn't help either br br of course we have our usual dose of evil <UNK> now i think about it who the hell comes up with these names has no yellow skin now but grey ish oh so no asian people will be offended i bet won't appear in the show either shades of the 1996 again where <UNK> the <UNK> was a green <UNK> like alien br br people are complaining about lack of speech i don't think i would have liked this more or less if <UNK> spoke he's corny enough this way and you have your extra <UNK> of cheese with the shocking thing is probably many of the people who rightfully hated jar jar <UNK> might be huge fans br br i watched the feature <UNK> pilot and i've had enough leave the series alone 2 out of 10
<START> i would not deny that i have quite enjoyed watching any japanese horror films but everyone must get quite fed up with them after you have seen the same thing over and over br br the film follows the story of the grudge audrey as <UNK> by her mom is going to get her sister back but when she arrives something strange happens to her sister and then her sister is killed she wants to find out the truth behind the curse and later a photographer <UNK> joins her on the other hand there's also something happening to a family and three girls but they seem to realise it too late br br in fact i can't see the points for the three girls from international school to appear in the movies as they're not quite related to the story the reason why the woman holding the grudge keeps killing people is still not very clear it seems to me they're just telling the same things i saw in the grudge and the sudden appearance of audrey in front of the boy is undoubtedly odd which i suppose is an attempt to make the story about the family related the killing scenes are absolutely the mixture of those in the ring and <UNK> the acting would be another bad point as a hong i would really like to support edison <UNK> first effort in hollywood but as a film lover i really can't find any point to support bad acting other actors like the father though he just appears in a few scenes should also have done better what is kept good is the atmosphere of the film especially when i watched it in the middle of the night alone br br if you have time really enjoy any horror films and have seen all the possible horror films except this like me you can go for it to kill some time but if you really like japanese horror films of this kind you should spend some time watching the japanese version of the ring

<START> as a massive fan of the three tv series i was very interested to learn that <UNK> were moving onto the big screen in my more honest moments though i had my doubts about the likely success of the concept and whether the writers would be able to sustain the high level of wit comedy and horror that <UNK> the original series br br unfortunately my fears were not <UNK> and the film was a huge disappointment i struggle to understand the other comments on this site obviously people are entitled to their opinions but the guys i watched it with all agree with me and they are just as big fans as i am br br the acting lacked conviction but they are so good that even when not at their best they are still highly watchable the main problem was the plot and the script there were a few laughs but not enough a few moments of disgust but not enough worst of all was the feeling of <UNK> after walking out of the cinema so rarely have i felt so utterly uninspired by a film and so <UNK> to discuss it with others br br i write this comment as a warning to other league fans get a wide range of opinion on this film before going to see it if you love league you might be able to convince yourself that they didn't totally mess up their move to cinema if you can't convince yourself of this then you will have <UNK> in your mind the otherwise <UNK> genius that <UNK> the tv series br br <UNK> at the cinema more like <UNK> or little brown fish
<START> i never heard of architect louis <UNK> until this documentary in this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly his son <UNK> <UNK> explores his father's life from <UNK> to the <UNK> of north philadelphia to the university of <UNK> in west philadelphia where he studied and taught he travels to <UNK> israel <UNK> <UNK> and la california as well as new york city to explore his father's creative genius personally louis <UNK> had three families including his wife esther who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter sue ann <UNK> includes his family members louis also has another half sister alexandra from his father's previous relationship with anne <UNK> a fellow architect <UNK> passion was his art
<START> when <UNK> <UNK> at the cannes film festival many people didn't like it because they felt it was boring and too slow while i agree that it was slow one of the <UNK> movies of the year in no way was it boring as roger ebert said there has never been a movie like <UNK> ' i usually don't agree with ebert but for once he speaks the truth although john sunshine state may have some of the same immediate themes nothing that i have ever seen or known of can even compare to the striking originality of the polish <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> is a perfect example of how many times it's better to trek an extra few minutes to go to an art house film instead of the latest jack black movie the plot isn't some hackneyed cookie cutter plot it's just so strikingly original a small town in montana named <UNK> has a <UNK> nearby that is about to be taken down therefore the entire town must be <UNK> some people however just don't want to leave in a side plot a young orphan duel is very sick and <UNK> he's being taken care of by father <UNK> nick nolte the boy <UNK> himself as a fallen angel so to speak who help him out through his time of sickness br br although much of the movie is straightforward some of it could give david lynch a run for his money there's odd weather <UNK> a weird wooden huge dog thing and symbolism that would make fellini proud it's not as overall confusing as a lynch film but it's still quite odd that's what makes <UNK> so great it's so out of the ordinary and yet so simple and plausible br br <UNK> has a magical feel to it it's almost like you're watching something you're not quite sure what it is but you feel <UNK> by it as i said earlier i agreed with ebert on how this movie is unlike any other however i disagree when he says that it is not he goes on to say it's just enthralling ' perhaps he just thought he should give it good reviews because everyone else is but in <UNK> of how slow it was i still thought it was very entertaining something many dramas now can't do br br <UNK> may not be the <UNK> movie or the most popular movie but if you can get to and through it you'll be extremely surprised as i was br br my rating 8 10 br br rated pg 13 for brief sexuality
<START> admittedly before seeing house of wax i assumed it would simply be a second <UNK> low quality teen slasher film following in the footsteps of such movies as the darkness or <UNK> horror after catching an advanced showing at my college campus i can honestly say that the people at dark castle have done an excellent job with the task of making a slasher br br starting with the usual <UNK> of a teenage horror film such as the small group of friends <UNK> on a road trip coming across an odd <UNK> taking them through country back roads meeting creepy locals after the slow but mandatory back story this movie really reaches a fast clip paris hilton appears in this film as many already know but i really have to give it to her for her <UNK> performance clearly her acting wasn't worth an oscar but the filmmakers use her appearance to its <UNK> by <UNK> two blatant <UNK> of her let's just say less noble media appearance into this film ms hilton also claims the title for the greatest death scene in the movie and not simply because it was her death scene br br this movie is full to the <UNK> with <UNK> moments and cheap scares but <UNK> has definitely created quality suspense and tension between the characters the causes for the horror are in part based on making the audience care for the characters which we do by making the usual <UNK> followed with a loud noise and <UNK> camera some other scary moments these standard movie techniques adopted from many movies past are almost <UNK> with this film and provide many good scares in fact there isn't a slow moment after they get to the small town where the <UNK> house of wax museum is br br this film owes a lot to many previous movies of this and other genres though i'm not too sure how much came from the original 1953 movie of the same title references to such movies as both texas chainsaw saw and even titanic see paris <UNK> big death scene and you'll know what i mean are common but in the end the payoff will leave you scared and <UNK> if you are looking for a good scare with a few laughs not bad
<START> while walking to buy <UNK> the professional dancer daniel tom long is <UNK> and forced to have kinky sex along many days by three <UNK> women when he is released the director of his company <UNK> greta <UNK> has already replaced him in the play and his girlfriend gives a cold reception to him the disturbed and <UNK> daniel leaves the dance company and travels obsessed to seek out the <UNK> daniel has sex with many women that he suspects that might be the <UNK> br br the book of revelation is a weird movie with a promising beginning that loses the initial power and becomes a sort of too long erotic soap opera or soft porn <UNK> the production is classy the cover of the dvd is awesome but the characters are not well developed and the trauma of daniel seems to be excessive since most of the men would <UNK> with the dream situation that he was <UNK>  to become sexual object of three sexy women the melodramatic development with the illness of <UNK> does not add any value to the plot the open conclusion is very disappointing and there are no explanations for the motive of the women or the title it is very clear that the screenplay about a man's feelings was written by a woman it was good to see the still beautiful greta <UNK> again and her make up in the end is impressive there is a saying in portuguese that could be translated to english as follows if the rape is inevitable relax and come daniel should have done this and <UNK> me of watching almost two hours of a pointless story my vote is four br br title brazil o <UNK> the book of revelations
<START> hated it with all my being worst movie ever mentally <UNK> help me it was that bad trust me
<START> i've enjoyed this movie ever since i was a kid and i still do i also liked batman forever back then but the real difference is that this movie didn't date when i grew up i did notice a few scenes in this film that didn't make any sense like the crowd is angry hey where did they get those tomatoes from ' then i thought <UNK> cares this movie is not 100 serious anyway ' br br the original tim burton batman was great as well but it was a bit cheesy at some parts and i didn't like all the actors this movie improved on almost every aspect with a wonderful cast a more gothic style and no involvement of prince br br nowadays many fans of the christopher nolan movies dislike burton claiming that the nolan movies are more serious and therefore more loyal to the comics i don't think this is entirely true there has never been an adaptation of the original concept of batman which was a vengeful criminal killer with a gun batman has taken many forms over the years <UNK> its silliness in the 60's and a bit with batman robin a director is free to choose what kind of batman he's going to portray as long if it's good br br my opinion batman doesn't necessarily have to be serious it's about a man in a rubber suit with <UNK> ears burton managed to create a perfect balance between the silliness and the darkness surrounding the whole idea br br i just recently watched the nolan movies and i love those ones as well especially the dark knight there's simply something about this movie that interests me more <UNK> goal was to give the character much more depth and in doing so he looked for an explanation of nearly every aspect of batman that's a bit too much for me i'm a bigger fan of the more abstract version of batman the burton movies are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere br br my conclusion is that you shouldn't compare the nolan with the burton movies they're just different and it's up to you to decide which one you like better my respect is for both directors
<START> i hope the people who made this movies read these comments the choreography was horrid the plot was and the actors where so low budget power rangers appears 5 star to this junk br br the fight scenes where so slow you could actually see the actors waiting for each other to perform the next move camera cut <UNK> and poor lighting could not cover up the cheap effects the lightning was just plain stupid the weapons looked like something out of a final fantasy game and the <UNK> bow and arrow was just dull as anything i have ever seen br br next movie you decide to make try <UNK> in some <UNK> <UNK> better script and try actually spending some time on your stunts br br honestly there are shows on t v that play ever night and are thrown together in a few hours that look better than this one br br stick to martial arts unless its as poor as your acting then take up
<START> what should i say i only saw this flick for curiosity and this is truly a shame i grew up in <UNK> with stories of <UNK> legends and spent 5 years in <UNK> the town in which this film is said to take place shame that not any actor nor camera from this flick ever arrived in <UNK> they could at least have chosen a likely town or a likely forest but nothing even seem like <UNK> nor <UNK> and calling it a film about <UNK> legends is really making a fool of the audience besides those details it could have been a good film but it's crap silly scenario silly characters and no originality definitely to avoid
<START> this show is the best it is full of laughs and kevin james is the best so if you want a good show i recommend the king of queens and its a letdown that they canceled it so in the end this show will make you forget your <UNK> and troubles cause if you have a cast with kevin james and jerry stiller you cant go wrong so i don't know why the canceled the show if any one knows please tell me now a days you cant find a lot of shows that fulfill your needs as an audience after seinfeld and king of queens the only show worth watching is prison break and if that stops i don't know what to do in the end if i had to recommend a show it will be king of queens
<START> the polish brothers are unique film artists and they've really pushed the <UNK> here a fantasy that has points in common with wings of desire <UNK> tells the story of a <UNK> era small town in the middle of nowhere that is two days shy of being <UNK> and <UNK> thanks to the u s <UNK> desire to make a <UNK> on the place where the town stands it's a <UNK> <UNK> about loss and <UNK> featuring angels dreams <UNK> and the most hilarious government <UNK> since <UNK> man the performances are all outstanding especially nolte and woods i've noticed in reading down some of the comments that there are people who were offended simply by the fact that the polish twins use <UNK> storytelling tactics and i want to say that's one of the things that makes this film so great its <UNK> to embrace the mysterious as an aspect of everyday life david cinematography is stunning highly recommended if you've suffered a meaningful personal loss such as the death of a parent i would even call this film necessary viewing ray
<START> i really don't think producer george lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as more american <UNK> turned out to be but in retrospect it was the first crack in his then seemingly <UNK> armor coming straight off the huge success of american <UNK> and produced basically at the same time as star wars this film was the first that lucas successfully took away from coppola without having to bother directing it himself the result is typical lucas far more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it's edited than the actual material the writer director bill norton has been allowed to use a variety of different screen and split screens to produce odd <UNK> in the images while it's interesting to see ironic <UNK> of the 4 story lines the style ultimately only <UNK> the <UNK> nature of the film itself br br <UNK> brilliant original film was all about a group of friends on the <UNK> last big night before school ends and kurt ron dreyfuss and steve ron howard are supposed to go off to college one thing that made that film work despite the fact that it's very episodic is that you had the core characters together at the beginning and they come back together at the end there's a <UNK> of time like in nick <UNK> rebel without a cause where a certain period of time becomes very <UNK> and takes on more meaning than such a specific time really would in actual life but everything takes place in a static space more american <UNK> is basically the opposite the space is very dynamic with <UNK> charles martin smith off in vietnam his former girlfriend debbie candy clark <UNK> with hippies in san francisco steve and laurie cindy williams involved in student <UNK> in berkeley and john paul le <UNK> drag racing on the semi pro circuit in a contrived meeting early in the film all the principles are brought together to watch john race but after that the threads don't come back together and <UNK> apart the way they do in the original instead they split off and we follow the characters through about 3 <UNK> of time just seeing various events on new years eve in what seems to be 1967 <UNK> and <UNK> it's easy for the audience to become confused and i think it's fair to say that we do while the original film seemed to <UNK> important events and <UNK> of <UNK> into unreal theatrical time that produced an experience of nostalgia even for those who never experienced those events this sequel drags and stretches the few plot points from the <UNK> of the original and attempts to make them into a coherent film br br the best parts of the movie to me are the ones with candy clark in sf and charles martin smith in <UNK> some of the jokes do fall flat but the style of those sections is interesting and they form a neat contrast with each other a good movie could maybe have been made if these parts were just a bit better and if the other parts weren't such a drag speaking of drag racing the whole plot with <UNK> talking to a foreign exchange student was really lame unfunny and throwing in <UNK> phillips for a cameo didn't help at all it was just another contrived moment like when they briefly explain why <UNK> isn't in the movie because he's already in canada instead laurie just has another brother who is basically identical to <UNK> but has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor there's a black kind of satire to some of the vietnam stuff very similar to what i would imagine lucas and john original idea for apocalypse now would have been like and there's some of that manic fun in the san francisco scenes that made the first movie fun but still along with that fun stuff you have the rest of the movie dragging it down as if anyone wants to see steve and laurie argue in their horrible suburban <UNK> as if they were <UNK> for a spielberg movie about divorce and child <UNK> i think even if those parts of the movie weren't so painful it still wouldn't really be comparable to the first movie because there's no closure and no sense of coming back together or of anybody having learned anything it just sort of ends at the point when they ran out of money or something a cheap freeze frame imitation of two lane <UNK> and so many better films br br like the original however this film has a great soundtrack of period hits that is probably worth <UNK> for its own sake and almost makes the movie itself <UNK> the performances by country joe and the fish are great and scott glenn all up as a hippie in love with candy clark is a sight to see i wonder if even back then he had to use a wig i couldn't possibly recommend this movie and yet it has some small affection in my heart because i love the original so much every couple of decades i guess i have to give this movie a try just to make sure that it's really as worthless as i remember it being it's a party killer but it's something that every fan of american <UNK> or george lucas in general will want to see at least once or twice it shows how a lot of effort can go into something and it can still turn out pretty half baked it makes you reflect on how much of a miracle it is that lucas actually made such a good movie as american <UNK> in the first place as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods had been unfortunately such was not the case for this film or for bill norton
<START> i know a lot of people have said don't bother with this movie because its not a good fighting flick and hard with the subtitles that is a really lazy way to think of a movie if you want to focus on that part of the movie you should go find something else and also learn to to respect cinema as a form of art this being a masterful piece of work if you want to watch this its not about the fighting really there are good fight scenes sometimes that are filmed rather well with good camera work but the story itself is what holds the story together and is the important part this is not the basic kung fu movie the story is really the central focus and not the fights and the combination of the two make an excellent movie thats well worth watching and is even better in the original language with subtitles
<START> this flick which is a k a life in the fast lane is easily one of the least entertaining movies i've seen in a long time i think it was made in mind of the sick twisted and jaded l a women who represent about of the population in the states the characters are all one dimensional even the lead after she stabs her boyfriend in the head with some <UNK> a cheap laugh is attempted and by sticking a <UNK> in the <UNK> skull to stop the bleeding oh clever patrick <UNK> whose movies are almost always a class act sarcasm plays this devil who changes her life but from what we've seen her life was this series of vignettes to begin with no emotion no laughs no story the only reason i give this a 2 is that jeffrey jones is ok as the priest and there is a bit of style <UNK> zero substance in the <UNK> otherwise one of the 5 worst films i've seen grade 2 out of 10 an f i think that even the most drugged out <UNK> who would laugh at a toilet seat falling would dislike this film i can't stress enough how much you should stay away br br
<START> black water is a thriller that manages to completely <UNK> it's limitations it's an indie flick by continually <UNK> expectations to emerge as an intense experience br br in the tradition of all good animal centered thrillers ie jaws the edge the original cat people the directors know that restraint and what isn't shown are the best ways to pack a punch the performances are real and gripping the is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real <UNK> and the swamp location is fabulous br br if you are after a b grade gore fest croc romp forget black water but if you want a clever suspenseful ride that will have you <UNK> the water and wondering what the hell would i do if i was up that tree then it's a must see
<START> i was unsure what to expect from driving lessons unsure whether rupert could carry such a role but within the first few minutes i was completely hooked all the way through the music acting and scenery were absolutely stunning julie <UNK> as always gave a superb performance as the eccentric old actress and rupert equally as good gave a fantastic performance as the romantic ben br br right from the beginning i was forced into <UNK> <UNK> bursts of laughter and of joy as ben broke free from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend a very controversial story probably rather exaggerated but none the less one of the best films i have seen in a long time br br highly recommend to anyone seeking a good british film and an evening to kick back and just enjoy yourself
<START> since there have been so many reviews of this fine film i will write in a list form and attempt to address issues that have not been discussed br br 1 dana andrews was <UNK> during the filming of this movie his character according to the screenplay was in his mid <UNK> andrews a highly underrated actor did brilliantly play a character who was supposed to be much younger br br 2 march like all great actors needs at times to be restrained by the director to avoid over the top acting he was <UNK> for the cameras when he was drunk on the night after his arrival and also the next morning when he was checking out his hang over in his mirror br br 3 dana andrews was superb as he was in laura the <UNK> bowl incident a walk in the sun the purple heart and many other films why did march win the academy award and why was dana andrews not even nominated for his outstanding performance br br 4 harold russell gave the best performance i have ever seen by a non actor br br 5 i realize this was the 1940s but dana andrews seemed to have no romantic interest in his exceptionally attractive wife virginia <UNK> br br 6 ray <UNK> who played the right wing <UNK> years later became famous for portraying the sheriff on bonanza br br 7 the professor from the south wrote that the film was slow moving boring and poorly acted the professor more than likely is <UNK> about classic films the beauty and significance of these <UNK> classics is that they are slow moving character studies that avoid profanity excessive violence and gratuitous sex br br i was surprised that zero out of 3 people found my review useful
<START> sleeper cell is what 24 should have been 24 is a cartoon i watch 24 but feel cheated with every stupid episode all four or five seasons so far who can keep track as they are all the same jack gets in trouble jack gets out of trouble and then immediately gets back in to trouble and then sleeper cell is really well done and is far superior unfortunately they blew it with the ending in season two i can think of a half dozen better endings off the top of my head that would have worked better for the writer's obvious goals and not been so contrived shame on the writers for <UNK> what had been up to that ending a really good series
<START> dennis hopper must've been really hungry to do this movie atrocious special effects very poor writing cheesy dialogue stupid looking killer bio robots never mind the <UNK> disregard for science the awkward scene with the 2 young leads taking their clothes off the best part of this movie was the pull start <UNK> penis on the <UNK> out cyborg pirate captain 2 out of 10 stars because i'm in a generous mood
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is the 1 box office portuguese movie of 2004 this extreme low budget production <UNK> <UNK> 150 000 opened during christmas opposite american blockbusters like national treasure polar express the <UNK> and alexander but rapidly caught the <UNK> of the portuguese <UNK> despite the harsh competition the small film did surprisingly well <UNK> all other portuguese films of the past two years in its first weeks the film is a mystery murder with a humorous tone cleverly written and directed by <UNK> <UNK> who has become a solid reference in the european independent film <UNK> did i like the film oh yes
<START> this movie takes the plot behind the sci fi flick <UNK> an astronaut from our earth crashing on a <UNK> <UNK> on the opposite side of the sun and the cold war <UNK> <UNK> on that world and tries to turn it into a pilot for a tv series however the whole thing <UNK> without a trace and tv is probably better off for it br br everyone here is perfectly adequate in a <UNK> for <UNK> way cameron mitchell turns in his usual solid performance so does glenn corbett who seems to be a kind of poor man's john <UNK> who plays the rugged <UNK> whose very existence poses a threat to the foundation of the <UNK> <UNK> on counter earth br br but the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this sci fi adventure firmly <UNK> on the launch pad br br i'll give one example in the original <UNK> for this pilot <UNK> the <UNK> lose control of their landing vehicle in a <UNK> and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again then the two <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling <UNK> and winds only to be <UNK> down and overcome by <UNK> men yelling through <UNK> br br in stranded in space the <UNK> are sitting in their seats when sound things start shaking and the camera <UNK> into a <UNK> and as a friend pointed out it was pretty obvious that the actors were simply shaking themselves on their seats the director wasn't even shaking the camera or the set i've seen episodes of the twilight zone and the outer limits that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this made for tv mediocrity br br and that in essence is what's wrong with stranded in space no budget no time no imagination just making the token gestures and hoping the sci fi fan <UNK> imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest sorry guys it didn't work br br i'm sure that everyone here just finished their work on this one and walked away and never thought of it again except as a listing on their c v and that's what you the viewer will do you'll remember if pressed that you once watched a tv movie called stranded in space but it made no lasting impression on you and you can't recall too much about it
<START> director <UNK> mann was a much better director than this film <UNK> he directed all quiet on the western front that touch of <UNK> and the last days of <UNK> among others this mediocre made for television retelling of <UNK> masterpiece is so bad even those unfamiliar with the often filmed tale will be <UNK> br br besides the fact that the movie is available from only two known <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the poor quality of the transfer and the <UNK> and <UNK> sound track make the task of finding this film on video not worth the effort br br i have always believed that if a company is going to put a film on video and charge the public money to buy it then they should at least have a descent copy of the film and do a good job on the transfer unfortunately neither of the two <UNK> have such a work <UNK> and the result is only fit for the bargain bin in the local <UNK> store br br the story is told mainly through flashbacks making the film episodic and talky much of the rich detail of the novel is lost in this translation the characters of martha and others have been cut and the relationship of young david and is not explored enough so we are left wondering why david would hang out with the guy br br the relationship between david the boy and young <UNK> is never developed and it is hard to understand why she and david eventually marry since martha is left out it is a mystery how dan <UNK> finds his niece and the absence of makes david a very lonely fellow br br some have credited this film with doing a good job of the lengthy novel i disagree this is at best a <UNK> job on the book anyone who has seen the <UNK> george <UNK> version will agree br br the performances in that version by fields as <UNK> and <UNK> as <UNK> are definitely worth the trouble of watching it and the more recent masterpiece theatre version april 2000 and hallmark 2000 versions are both outstanding achievements in made for television adaptations of classic novels directors simon curtis and peter <UNK> who are responsible for those films are deserving of the highest praise br br my final comment on david <UNK> 1969 is don't buy it there are several much better versions of the film available if it is on television turn the channel to something else it is a waste of one hour and twenty minutes of your life sorry folks but i can't praise such an <UNK> bad film
<START> this is one gripping movie reminiscent of the mgm crime movies of the late 70's excellent cast crisp editing and good acting keeps the pace of the movie developing rapidly one of the better crime movies of the decade kudos to the director cast
<START> oh dear quite how alfred hitchcock north by <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> steps could turn out this nasty <UNK> shocker is beyond me don't bother looking for hidden depths or deep meanings there aren't any this is just horrid seedy and cheap the one redeeming feature is the home life of the inspector who leads the investigation his wife <UNK> herself as a <UNK> cook and constantly serves up her revolting <UNK> experiments to her poor husband this is amusing and just about saved me putting the film in the <UNK> <UNK> but the film as a whole is one of the most unpleasant i've ever seen i believe this was hitchcock's next to last film perhaps someone was trying to tell him something
<START> tom and jerry are <UNK> goods via airplane to africa but being white men they're worried they won't be safe so they put on <UNK> to fit in once they're wearing it they adopt black <UNK> and fully inhabit their new characters they crash into the ocean and use the wing of the plane as a raft before reaching land they suffer the advances of an over <UNK> <UNK> and more serious danger from sharks a <UNK> and a whale once on land they're frightened by fantastic creatures and duck into a cave inside it's even worse when they encounter living <UNK> in <UNK> and upon <UNK> the cave things are even worse than that when they are discovered by cannibals br br plane dumb is an especially sloppy effort from van studios one example a lion unknown to tom and jerry enters the cave before they do but the animators must have forgotten about it because the lion never appears again another example is the ending that's not an ending it's just an <UNK> stop br br according to a youtube poster the cartoon was originally intended to feature the voices and caricatures of a popular comedy team known as miller but <UNK> died of <UNK> before the recording session was completed and co directors john foster george were forced to <UNK> the animation into a <UNK> <UNK> story br br they shouldn't have bothered the crude animation and poorly executed gags make the film a loser from beginning to end
<START> this is a comedy romance movie directed by andy <UNK> starring will smith eva <UNK> and kevin james br br it is about a professional dating doctor will smith known as who helps men to land dates with the women they are interested in he is currently helping a <UNK> clumsy albert who is obsessed with a very powerful famous and rich woman called at the same time <UNK> has become interested in a <UNK> <UNK> sara eva <UNK> who has been assigned to write about when the best girlfriend of sara has a love <UNK> with a man that sara thinks that is a client of <UNK> she plots a revenge against <UNK> and the <UNK> leads the two couples to a <UNK> situation this film is not one that men should see as it has a lot of male bashing and both subtle and blatant male hating there are also double standards that you would have to be blind not to spot <UNK> and sara are both very <UNK> around the opposite sex <UNK> still likes women despite his burns from them in the past and is teaching men to make them happy but of course sara is a sexist <UNK> who makes frequent sexist comments along the lines of men want to have sex with anything that walks <UNK> self obsessed and knows she looks like a <UNK> and knows there are no <UNK> <UNK> out there what annoyed me most of all was the <UNK> guy who wanted a quick <UNK> with <UNK> best friend who is the classic example of a <UNK> <UNK> and even after being turned down physically by <UNK> receives as blow to the <UNK> from sara after which she says now i'm satisfied add to that the women are still <UNK> <UNK> you get from not being allowed to spend her own money after asking <UNK> from a table of men in spite of all the rubbish <UNK> and women can always tell when you ain't being straight with them this movie does have the correct point that in america love simply doesn't exist there are some funny parts in this film such as albert and his dancing <UNK> but this film overall only beats the dreadful film honey by a <UNK> amount
<START> there is a clever little scene in the karen carpenter story where both <UNK> are in a recording studio and richard makes an <UNK> decision to have karen sing for the owner of the studio br br richard picks the wrong key for karen to sing in so karen is singing above her natural range you can see a look of <UNK> on the <UNK> face he figures she really can't sing richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key the next thing you hear is <UNK> amazing beautiful voice and the owner does a priceless double take nicely done for some reason i have never forgotten that scene br br the karen carpenter story chronicles the <UNK> rise of the <UNK> and <UNK> struggle to overcome <UNK> a lot of things are <UNK> over this isn't a documentary and the movie left me with a lot of questions very little is mentioned of <UNK> solo venture the cd was released only a few years ago if you buy it you will wonder why they waited it's some of <UNK> best work the songs aren't as timeless as her work with brother richard but it was a great recording in my opinion br br i have heard it said that you can be listening to a cheap time worn little radio in the middle of the third world that would seem to produce more static than anything else but when a carpenter song comes on the radio you would think you were listening to a 1000 hi <UNK> unit br br watch this movie
<START> <UNK> turner proved that she could really dance up a storm in this 1940 <UNK> about the ultimate sacrifice that her sister joan blondell makes for her br br when both sisters come to new york they follow <UNK> beau a wonderful george murphy in this film br br as fate would have it the director of the show is impressed with turner but sees nothing ahead for blondell except a job as the cigarette girl not only does blondell miss stardom boyfriend murphy eddie falls for turner as well so as not to hurt her sister turner is ready to marry the producer of the show a wealthy <UNK> who has <UNK> 4 times br br the story concludes as best as possible with blondell taking a fast exit back to <UNK> look for paul ford as a <UNK> <UNK> in the film he is hard to recognize due to the date of the film and the fact that he is much thinner the film leaves you with the question of whether ford and blondell could ever get together br br blondell as the devoted sister sacrifices both career and love for her sister this film is sentimental and might have worked better if it had been shot in technicolor br br few realize that george murphy the future <UNK> senator from california was quite a song and dance man in his day
<START> <UNK> iv starts in a museum <UNK> facility where <UNK> leather clad blonde alexandra <UNK> randall is looking for a ancient jewel after <UNK> various guards she <UNK> the demon <UNK> who she <UNK> wants to have sex with unfortunately she lost the jewel so he's not very happy orders her to get the last remaining one which belongs to jonathan graves returning from the original <UNK> 1985 peter who is experienced in demonic possession stuff like that after the events of the original <UNK> alexandra sets about finding the jewel so she can bring <UNK> to earth <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> to well i don't know actually <UNK> that's about it really br br directed by jim <UNK> whose very name name sends <UNK> down my spine when it's attached to a film i'm about to waste 90 minutes of my life on iv is as i expected complete total utter crap from start to finish it's as simple straight forward as that the <UNK> <UNK> by mark has virtually nothing in common with the other <UNK> film except in it's title that they managed to convince to <UNK> his role which also has the added bonus of big able to use footage from the original even though it has no relevance whatsoever the story is almost none existent the whole film is a real chore to watch it's incredibly boring moronic it's slow it's predictable it's <UNK> clean as far as blood or gore goes it has two comic relief <UNK> whom i assume are supposed to fill the <UNK> <UNK> even though they look nothing like they did in the previous films are in fact just embarrassing to watch in fact i think they were <UNK> to be <UNK> during most of the film as when they speak their don't move you know i don't want to talk or think about <UNK> iv anymore so please believe me when i say this is one huge piece of crap of elephant sized proportions don't waste either your time or money br br <UNK> turns in a <UNK> rotten film on just about every level the special effects are terrible as is the whole film apparently <UNK> iv is meant to be some sort of horror comedy but it misses both targets by the proverbial mile it is neither funny nor scary the best thing about this film is actress randall in her <UNK> leather outfit running around trying to find the jewel that's hardly worth sitting through this rubbish to see there's a half decent runaway car scene with a few crashes but it looks like it was edited in from a completely different film given track record i'm sure it was forget about any gore as there isn't any br br technically <UNK> iv sucks it's obvious it had low budget but that simply isn't an excuse for it to be this bad is it is back in the cast although he probably wishes he'd stayed away <UNK> clad babe randall is easily the best thing about this film which says a lot br br <UNK> iv is crap there's nothing else to say really i honestly can't see anyone who enjoy films getting anything out of this i just can't i can't believe that i'm going to recommend the original <UNK> over anything but it's going to happen now because even though that's crap as well it's a hell of a lot better than <UNK> iv one to avoid folks you can thank me later the things i sit through so you don't have to honestly
<START> what's fun about <UNK> is that it's the story of a human on a rampage a deadly threat to monsters everywhere in this one the monsters the night breed of the title are the good guys it shares its sense of celebrating the different the twisted and the dark with the first <UNK> family movie and much of tim <UNK> work it also has the <UNK> that one expects from a piece by barker br br especially fun is the performance by <UNK> as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the as happens in most classic monster movies the villagers surround the <UNK> castle with <UNK> and <UNK> only this time the modern setting <UNK> the castle with an old <UNK> and the <UNK> weapons with guns and bombs and this time the sympathy you felt when you saw <UNK> monster burned in the <UNK> is the very center of the movie br br this isn't a masterpiece and even barker has done more interesting and certainly more chilling work but it's pure fun it looks great and remains light without mocking itself worth a look
<START> this showtime cable film features a talented cast and weaves together several <UNK> involving the darker side of new york from the naive and innocent <UNK> nightmarish adventure to a pair of undercover cops on the streets to an old friend's betrayal it has it all br br well worth a look as is its sequel
<START> this movie is horrendous the acting is cheesy and laughable if you know anything at all about <UNK> the match action is boring in fact any episode of power rangers contains more realism than this movie the <UNK> consists of no more than one pass and a shot of guy landing over the try line or being <UNK> without the ball and <UNK> hand held shots of who knows what it's impossible to tell there is nothing of the excitement skill and construction of try <UNK> that real <UNK> contains as for the this is a bunch of <UNK> trying to imitate a tradition they know nothing about much like the white <UNK> character that should have been left out of the film next time there's a <UNK> movie made we can only hope that people who know <UNK> make it
<START> i enjoyed very much the movie wooden camera i think it's a little bit influenced by the brazilian movie city of god but maybe this <UNK> between the two tracks possible to follow crime and art in social neighborhood are a reality br br i think the films made by are really beautiful i don't think it's unreal that he shoot such good films because there's a lot of artists that don't have any type of education and can be really genius br br i enjoyed very much the soundtrack it's <UNK> to the pictures br br see the movie it's good to show how can be a life in a social neighborhood
<START> <UNK> certainly entertainment probably but only on <UNK> of any shred of the viewer's common sense reality only in so much that it was made on this planet br br how thousands of people were supposed to have died as a result of a 5 wall of water in a city <UNK> <UNK> with buildings in excess of 25 <UNK> high is quite beyond me line to the effect of how could anyone survive that when the shot shows <UNK> of buildings with several floors above the water is completely laughable further if someone commits themselves to an area under water where one <UNK> of air is not enough i e they are going to die why not use the simple <UNK> of taking more than one <UNK> clearly the writer thinks that people in <UNK> situations cannot count beyond one one <UNK> one floor br br rather than watching this tripe you would be more informed and entertained by throwing the dvd away and reading the <UNK> information on the <UNK> outer <UNK> br br pitiful truly pitiful and a terrible waste of the on screen talent br br as for the sexist propaganda suggesting that only women can see through the problems to <UNK> the <UNK> to be <UNK> by the <UNK> men yet more pc small wonder that first blood <UNK> force navy <UNK> and other such movies of little or no merit will always have a following while this blatantly politically motivated <UNK> is <UNK>
<START> the best thing from the american pie <UNK> i found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the american pie movies to date also concerning the of the content i found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous american pie movies i thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience when the movie first came out i read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater i now regret that decision the movie far <UNK> my expectations in terms of plot dialog scripting and overall quality i give it two thumbs way up
<START> in watching enterprise for the first time as we all no doubt do with all shows i went into it with an open mind enjoying about half of the past star trek efforts and <UNK> the other half br br enterprise has fallen short but this episode a night in made me seriously question why i bother the shows from monday night on sci fi br br <UNK> some idea that it is one of those 'a day in the <UNK> episodes in which we learn about what makes certain characters operate as <UNK> the writers seemed to forget that this was supposed to be a starship <UNK> not the and the br br a planet especially one whose people had been offended previously by the enterprise crew for eating in public was no place for a dog as an animal lover myself i would have never taken one of my pets into an environment that had proved in the past to be tense br br but what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem with all of these st shows constantly depicting things that are sacred and insulting to other cultures as tho they are offering some insight into american religious <UNK> br br the aliens were now offended when the dog on a sacred tree yet the aliens were quite capable of taking the dog <UNK> as an insult br br strange how the <UNK> <UNK> wasn't regarded as some form of worship i wonder how that one got by the show's writers br br from there we are subjected to a captain who was misguided by his duties in watching the episode i found it very easy to forget that <UNK> was supposed to be the <UNK> captain br br he chose to sleep in and from there we are given more <UNK> of behavior sigh that we aren't supposed to understand and that causes us to <UNK> br br the doctor non <UNK> clips long hairy <UNK> and <UNK> them to hungry <UNK> animals then a white bat creature escapes br br oh how is anyone supposed to sleep with all of this going on <UNK> for crying out loud i was waiting for something that <UNK> on vomit to be presented br br then we were inexplicably given some idea that the captain was in love with <UNK> and that perhaps he was <UNK> those feelings with his concern over the dog br br endless amounts of rubbish br br your dog is ill so go have sex you'll feel better and of course the captain had to apologize and we humans had to regard his <UNK> as completely ridiculous because we are so everyone smile very <UNK> narrow minded saw depictions such as this endlessly <UNK> out on <UNK> br br oddly enough the only thing missing from this awful episode was that trip person offering his <UNK> and <UNK> tho <UNK> seemed to be covering all of that with the silly dog br br oh the dog survived so now go play <UNK>
<START> out of all the parodies of star wars i've seen this is probably the funniest not because of the premise star wars with simple <UNK> instead of <UNK> but because of how poorly acted it is this is <UNK> <UNK> and it makes it hilarious and since everyone knows its <UNK> <UNK> no one complains the special effects were also <UNK> as awful as can be and include a <UNK> on a visible string that shoots <UNK> and an egg <UNK> on a string this short is funny for any fan of star wars which i'm not or anyone that has 15 minutes to kill great short br br my rating out of 13 mins not rated
<START> the worst sequel i've ever seen really awful songs which is <UNK> considering how fantastic the first films score and story is also which ruins the film for me is the fact there is no john <UNK> so jean bob might as well not even be in it and the new villains are dreadful it is really annoying how that old woman type thing cant string a simple sentence together properly without repeating her words over and over and over again but to be fair not <UNK> up is a little bit funny but the fact it was her <UNK> birthday why do they draw her looking like an 80 year old i was going to give this a 1 but now i think i might give it a 2 but still the story line is no where near as good as the first film it is similar without the humour from certain characters overall i disliked this film entirely because of the disappointing music the severe lack of voice talent having changed the voice of prince derek and jean bob the new villains disappointing storyline the annoying <UNK> of some characters and the very simple animation
<START> although copies of this movie are hard to find if you can find it get it i believe this was aside from in the navy <UNK> and only musical although they twisted the plot around a little i've never heard a version where the butcher goes up with him you still enjoy the antics of the slightly idiotic but lovable jack and the greedy butcher mr slightly reminiscent of was a lady this <UNK> film will have you rolling on the floor only to get up and dance as lou <UNK> sings i don't know why they didn't do that in other films
<START> i can't remember exactly where i heard of them first but i listen to a little of one song and liked it went and bought the cd and had finally found the type of music i like i heard about this video and knew i had to have it it has a lot of clips from them playing in concert let me tell you watching this video doesn't even compare to them in concert i've seen them twice in concert and don't want to ever miss a chance to see them again the other two things it has is some interview and even a video for one of their biggest songs couple little side notes i saw them at 2001 and they ruled there but seeing them in a smaller inside stage was much better they had some really cool things to do with being able to cut out the lights the other in case anyone wonders means a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> my friends and i watched this movie last night it was pretty incredible by all means this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen at first it was tolerable it <UNK> of bad <UNK> but it was pretty <UNK> hilarious despite the scenes being too long drawn out and the terrible quality i read 400 budget above sounds about right of the film itself br br the biggest problem came from the lack of a script with a background in <UNK> i know how hard it can be to keep scenes short efficient what happened in this film was that the actors were left to <UNK> the scenes and they didn't know when to stop they just kept going for ages on stupid topics at first i thought this was because the movie was short and they needed long useless scenes to flesh it out as the movie progressed i realized it was just a really bad movie br br there were a lot of parts where i could see that the film maker had a really good idea for a shot but not the resources or talent to pull it off effectively a lot of the scenes were taken from a single shot cause you know <UNK> for what felt like a really long time so boring if you can stand to put up with and hour and a half of terrible <UNK> watch it it's really funny at parts but also really stupid and annoying the acting <UNK> from alright to absolutely terrible it seemed like the only good parts were the parts that really had nothing to do with the main plot the <UNK> kid who <UNK> lots the <UNK> etc etc br br but yeah painfully bad like i was literally hurting after an hour or so my friends and i just got bored and left
<START> i love his martial arts style it is quick close up and oh so fast but it seems like his movies are becoming more and more crime based lifestyle quality and less meaning i thought he was out to bring forth a deeper message at least some of the movies had a hidden meaning or agenda this one had some good redeeming qualities of the character but the rest was so far off i was very disappointed the martial arts is also suffering i am hoping to see a more devoted segal in his future films this movie also lacks in keeping the story line going there are too many gaps so the thought is lost too many things are <UNK> without a solution
<START> this film is undoubtedly one of the greatest <UNK> in history of cinema by seeing this film we can only <UNK> notice that world cinema in 1950s had such a purely <UNK> <UNK> such a strong and adequate use of sound image montage and almost religious admiration of <UNK> choices in human life cinema was then not only one form of arts it was much higher than ordinary life and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war it is said that even <UNK> was moved and cried that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years audience that time was also different i read that after seeing <UNK> <UNK> live in its first release young couple quietly told each other it is a good film isn't it i think contemporary cinema though technically developed and opened some new narrative perspective has lost the most important <UNK> of audience was once really the most popular art from and unlike modern fine arts and contemporary music gave millions of people hope and ideals in this point of view must be in the <UNK> of classics of all the time as city light <UNK> and la <UNK>
<START> given the acting roles he played in the 1940s casper <UNK> <UNK> mr peters <UNK> k ex <UNK> count <UNK> <UNK> it surprises many of his fans to learn that originally sidney <UNK> made a name for himself in comedies in the west end and broadway he was usually such a total villain or serious actor to the public that his comic talents were ignored in fact he actually did make four comedy appearances one a spoof of his villainous portrayals with his <UNK> partner peter lorre in a cameo appearance his best total film appearance in a comedy was probably that of magazine <UNK> alexander <UNK> in christmas in <UNK> although his <UNK> half mad soap <UNK> in the <UNK> is a close second despite some problems with the screenplay it is a good film and usually <UNK> in the christmas season br br elizabeth lane barbara stanwyck writes a <UNK> in american <UNK> magazine for <UNK> where she gives household <UNK> and cooking <UNK> she is the 1945 version of martha <UNK> except that ms <UNK> is a cook and house owner and can <UNK> for trying out and testing what she <UNK> stanwyck can't her cooking <UNK> are those of her friend felix s z a <UNK> chef and <UNK> the house she describes as her home a model <UNK> in <UNK> belongs to her <UNK> boyfriend architect john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> really would not mind marrying stanwyck but she is not fully ready to consider a final commitment to him br br as the film begins an american is <UNK> by the nazis this is <UNK> jones dennis morgan a sailor he spends two weeks in a raft before being rescued <UNK> publicity value <UNK> decides to grant <UNK> wish to have a genuine old fashioned christmas in <UNK> he basically tells stanwyck that she will entertain morgan and himself at her farm for the holidays stanwyck is unable to explain that the <UNK> image of herself complete with her ability to flip <UNK> <UNK> and raise a baby she supposedly had with her husband is a lie if she does she will be fired as will her immediate boss dudley <UNK> robert <UNK> in a moment of depression she accepts <UNK> <UNK> of marriage and then <UNK> finds his <UNK> home is <UNK> into becoming the actual home of stanwyck and himself and their baby br br of course aside from putting off <UNK> <UNK> curiosity stanwyck and morgan find that they are falling in love much to the annoyance of <UNK> he does actually expect that stanwyck will still marry him <UNK> following <UNK> occurs as lies <UNK> on lies and as <UNK> babies succeeds <UNK> babies before <UNK> begins to wonder if he is missing something but it is a comedy so everything works out well even <UNK> at the conclusion is amused by the entire madness his celebrated <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that of santa <UNK> for a change this is not a classic comedy certainly not a great one but amusing enough for the season to be worth watching in december
<START> when i was young i was a big fan of the naked gun movies but just recently i watched the show police and i think its great leslie awesome alan north is cool and who the heck is rex hamilton but anyways it's one goofy show br br one of my favorite parts of this show when they do the freeze frame scene during the end credits i think my favorite one is when not o j walks in during the scene and he tries to fit in with the freeze frame classic br br the only problem to me is the cigarette gag gets very old when shows a cigarette to someone and asks cigarette and the person replies yes i know i think they used it too many times by whatever br br good acting good gags great show br br 7 10
<START> as roger corman has said in an interview low budget film making <UNK> film makers to take chances on offbeat ideas well you'd be hard pressed to find a film that <UNK> on the offbeat as <UNK> as george <UNK> death bed the bed that eats br br the film does have a back story to it and it's an interesting one at that i'll <UNK> <UNK> any sort of details so you can hear them for yourself if you take a chance on watching it suffice it to say the title item of furniture has an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> with a <UNK> yellow <UNK> that <UNK> its victims like acid br br death bed is an eerie haunting little flick that plays out its absurd premise in such a way that it <UNK> the usual assortment of schlock fare it <UNK> its particular dream world in such a way that it was possible for me to take it seriously it's a truly strange and unconventional horror flick it in exploitative ingredients there's some tasty <UNK> of female nudity and yet is also art albeit art with a completely <UNK> sensibility br br the special effects are not too bad for a film with a <UNK> budget and barry gives the film a good and atmospheric midnight movie quality the acting from the cast is as uninspired as one could imagine although patrick <UNK> thomas lends a reasonable amount of <UNK> as the artist narrator and one definite point of interest is seeing one familiar face on hand future <UNK> meets <UNK> father william russ br br this film might not have even found the small cult following that it does have were it not for <UNK> copies making the rounds this certainly has to rank as one of the instances where such a practice ultimately ended up helping the film even if the exposure took years to take hold br br if you have a taste for truly bizarre obscure items death bed may be just what you've got in mind br br 7 10
<START> everybody loves to see a really bad movie sometime you watch it take a good laughs and forget it in the next half hour but this is not one of those it's the worst thing that will appear in front of your eyes for a while br br i would like to see someone to take responsibility for <UNK> he's really the most stupid villain you can think of a guy in leather pants that speaks with a voice over and has a victory laugh like a 50's dracula how can someone came up with this guy and the hero the dragon or whatever my <UNK> box has better acting skills than him maybe than all of them it's unbelievable but the worst are the fighting scenes where you would think there could be something in it they're so lame it's beyond any kind of description there's no shame i just can't believe how this movie was allowed by any studio but i'm just thrilled it was watching this is a self <UNK> pleasure see this only if you're in a movie quest for pain and in that case this one is a sure winner
<START> a fun filled romp full of silly if not sometimes cruel jokes not the best of movies but definitely well worth watching david niven and stewart granger are their usual charming <UNK> with granger as an especially delightful and ingenious gentleman <UNK> <UNK> as wonderful as always with such a delightful character that is absolutely the story line is typical but full of surprises especially concerning the unconventional relationships between granger <UNK> and niven
<START> this was a great movie it had one <UNK> so nice <UNK> plus there were some very intense drama scenes which might make it inappropriate for younger viewers under 6 br br for a under the radar film the acting was quite enjoyable and touched down in our family room for a near perfect landing it held the attention of our whole family and we were kind of sorry to see it end br br this movie had elements of spy kids with young people saving the day but was given a somewhat more believable scenario the dream scenes were a distraction at first but did a great deal to establish the plot the pranks and hi <UNK> were also quite amusing br br we hope you like as much as we did
<START> much like <UNK> <UNK> the people who made this movie can't tell the difference between <UNK> and <UNK> no build up at all just throw naked women on the screen no it doesn't work that way if close ups of female <UNK> aren't your thing prepare to be looking away from the screen at many points i often did the all women are <UNK> at heart mentality of the movie is offensive and the story is by turns absurd and boring the escape is the most boring part but halfway through there is a random scene that pops out of nowhere and involves one of the female prisoners and one of the male guards in a nude wrestling match which she wins with a couple of <UNK> moves although the choreography of the fight is bad the whole scene is undeniably memorable in fact that scene and the nice cinematography are the only two reasons i give this film out of 4 instead of 0
<START> what a surprise this film was i've seen a good few of <UNK> horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director he also wrote the screen play which shows that the <UNK> was quite capable of <UNK> a detailed complex story line the dubbing on this is not good but far from the appalling <UNK> that only further <UNK> later <UNK> like <UNK> br br the photography in this film is fantastic a strange almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered a scene involving the beating of a woman is uncomfortable to watch yet refreshing in comparison to usual cinema violence br br what went wrong lucio perhaps there is a strong case to suggest he had reached his peak with this film and it slowly went downhill after that
<START> i viewed this movie at the <UNK> theater in dallas a couple of days ago punk everyone and everything involved in the movie added to the of it the music well of course but the movie itself captured the whole punk genre even a grandmother and school teacher me can appreciate artists who are able to turn their ideas into reality well reality film wise this movie takes a handful of <UNK> off young film makers and clearly and cleverly shows the why of their angst over not being given the green light on finishing the <UNK> film the relatively happy girl gave good comic relief a nice <UNK> from the <UNK> but understandable <UNK> on the dude who left them in a <UNK> gotta love <UNK> though and be sure to watch read the credits they're the <UNK> on the cake
<START> i am a <UNK> a teenager living in the 21st century and its obvious that i'm not much into even bollywood let alone <UNK> movies yet when i watched it left me with a unique feeling one which only an extremely effective movie is capable of <UNK> br br it is a fact that like most indian movies the movie has its true and complete effect only if viewed in its original language a lot of the emotion and meaning of the movie is <UNK> in its <UNK> dialogues which however hard one tries can not be effectively translated into english br br explores in intricate detail the relationship between a <UNK> and a child and it does complete justice to this strong bond dialogues like pan <UNK> my is also one in a million enhance the emotion anyone who has closely observed the <UNK> child relationship will be able to relate to the situation portrayed in the movie br br overall it definitely worth watching its a movie that has left a profound effect on me i will surely recommend it to anyone
<START> like night stalker and then x files the show set up a fantastic situation and the main characters had to sort it out unlike these the hero <UNK> weren't left holding an empty bag at the end they had usually <UNK> results it was also made clear that the <UNK> <UNK> were in a dirty profession where they occasionally had to pull some nasty things imagination wit acting which didn't always take itself too seriously i miss it one reason being i'm hard pressed to think of too many shows aside which did as good a job of taking the viewer and grabbing their attention right off the bat the writers <UNK> at setting up hugely improbable if not downright impossible situations which the characters then had to find an explanation to explanations which often took 90 degree turns into the clearly unexpected yet for all that still made sense too i agree with another reviewer that the character was somewhat underused but when she was on screen it wasn't just for eye candy she was quite competent in her own right and stood up to the two male leads when she felt the point she was making <UNK> it a <UNK> in those days sullivan if he wasn't in the department he'd be working for the <UNK> or cia he's that sort of <UNK> efficient ruthless type he knows how the world works and realizes what it can take to get the job done king it's clearly a game to him one he excels at and which he into ideas for the detective spy novels he writes as his <UNK> <UNK> job he's probably the most fun to watch of the three although they all have their moments and often too i do agree that the eventual spin off series featuring only his character lacked the interest of the original however
<START> i've been a fan of larry king's show for awhile i think he does a terrific job overall and i don't think he ever out as so many people seem to believe he's a subtle <UNK> he gets his in when he needs to just as he managed to do last night with paris hilton during her first post jail tv interview br br the thing about this entire case that has really amazed me is that hilton is still apparently clueless about why judge gave her what she believes was a too harsh sentence and what's more actually made her serve it in all the time she was in jail supposedly alone 23 hours a day in her cell she never once in her mind <UNK> the events which led to her being given the sentence that judge saw fit to <UNK> on her she never once realized that it just might have set off a major red flag when she 1 showed up late in court for the original hearing and 2 <UNK> to inform him when he asked her did she not know that her license had been suspended did she not get the papers in the mail that i have people who read that sort of thing for me br br all the time she was in her cell she never came to the realization that this action showing up late and that statement and more importantly the attitude the utter <UNK> disregard for the court system and the law in general and her driving <UNK> in particular that she displayed just might have made judge <UNK> the pun go sour on her br br last night on king's show after giving lip service to how she has been changed forever by her traumatic experience how she has learned her lesson she answered his question do you think you got a raw deal with a <UNK> yes and during the course of the conversation if you can call it that she said more than once that she did not feel she deserved what had happened to her king asked gently more than once if she does not feel she creates the situations in her life that she finds herself in to which she pretty much <UNK> at him <UNK> she basically therefore holds the conscious belief that she's been <UNK> in this situation she does not understand how she herself caused it that day in court by her <UNK> attitude with the judge i feel this is very sad tragic even considering what a huge role model hilton is to some people and it <UNK> anything she said last night about her so called <UNK> state into the <UNK> of complete and utter <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> br br during the course of the interview hilton <UNK> to spending a lot of time in her cell reading the bible at the end of the interview king scored major points by asking her what her favorite bible passage was she <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> at her pathetic notes completely superficial non insights which she had read on air as if she were nelson or something and finally <UNK> out i don't have a favorite passage br br judge in my book is a hero and after last night so is larry king for subtly exposing hilton for what she truly is
<START> i read a lot of high hopes from readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of nora <UNK> story not having read the book i don't know if this adaptation was faithful but i do know it wasn't good actually the screenplay was the best part of the movie so kudos to nora roberts br br i planned ahead and watched <UNK> moon because of claire <UNK> i've never been sure if she's a good actress she's been decent in some movies average in others and really bad in this one but <UNK> wasn't alone the performances were all over the place oliver hudson was wooden and boring <UNK> davis was hammy then amidst all this b rate acting there's <UNK> <UNK> she didn't have a lot to do other than portray <UNK> but even <UNK> through that she was miles ahead of the others br br still <UNK> remains one of the most breathtaking women in movies and i was not disappointed in that capacity here i believe <UNK> can be more than eye candy but until she turns in a good performance in a good movie she continues to <UNK> at that and i'll continue to <UNK> watch everything she <UNK> in <UNK> is fun that way br br this movie though <UNK> moon was pretty bad in addition to the bad acting fake southern accents are really distracting the direction was pedestrian it wasn't horrible it was just the boring made for tv caliber you're used to seeing on lifetime br br if you're a fan of any of the stars you can probably enjoy <UNK> moon for that reason as i did if you're a fan of the book you might enjoy seeing the story on the screen albeit in a lackluster form otherwise this movie is <UNK>
<START> i just finished watching dog watch i thought parts of the movie were hokey with more than a few <UNK> the acting wasn't too bad and the plot wasn't bad but as the saying goes the devil was in the details br br some examples br br 1 the bleed through on charlie sam elliott <UNK> was shown to be coming from the back of his hand while it was his <UNK> that were bleeding br br 2 would a detective <UNK> of his murder victim from a very well <UNK> area this seemed very silly to me br br i am not unusually <UNK> about a movie but in my humble opinion this one is definitely not recommended by me
<START> after watching this movie i felt as if i had just eaten a box of stale <UNK> cracker jack only to find no prize inside this movie has real promise porn stars in a <UNK> feature unfortunately someone forgot to tell the producers that we like some t a in our t a flicks sure we get a few quick flashes and a couple of bathing in the creek scenes but where's the sex how can you have four girls <UNK> girls no less in this type of movie with only one pitiful 5 second lesbian scene good night usa up all night provides more <UNK> look we don't watch this type of movie for great cinematography <UNK> or action we want to see some <UNK> what a letdown
<START> honestly i don't know why this show lasted as long as it did ah well humor is <UNK> eh but yeah this show is incredibly unfunny if you ask me tim allen is annoying jill is annoying the boys are annoying al is annoying the neighbor is annoying it's just more annoying then funny the plots are all the same tim makes jill mad and has to make things right again and the latter seasons less said about them the better who the hell things cancer would be good for a damn sitcom yeah great idea <UNK> so yeah home improvement isn't a very good sitcom i'd recommend you go watch news radio or seinfeld if i had to give this show a rating i'd give it a 1 10 seeing as it never made me laugh once ever so yeah it's still better then the <UNK> though
<START> early 1950s sci fi directed by <UNK> special effects of course are very primitive but pretty good in comparison to what else was out there then drive in movie double feature fare still interesting enough to watch two leading men arthur <UNK> the brilliant young scientist dr jim barker and straight talking and <UNK> newspaper reporter steve <UNK> cameron mitchell are joined on a <UNK> flight to mars by carol <UNK> <UNK> huston another scientist and two other space experts richard <UNK> and john <UNK> upon landing on the red planet the space <UNK> encounter inhabitants that appear friendly and mentally advanced in <UNK> the martians are led by morris who has the idea of <UNK> earth to their civilization there is a beautiful martian <UNK> that dr barker <UNK> to take back on the return trip she is the movie's <UNK> element
<START> i just watched this short at the movies br br was a very sweet sad little movie about two brothers that are in love there is some great subtle acting from both the male leads often times movies with this subject matter seem to get too caught up in the controversy and shock value of the plot that they forget that there is an actual story luckily writer director james does not do this and instead lets the story play out with honesty the sequences of the two boys first falling in love are very sweet
<START> if you're a kid liking fairy tale real life adventures see it if you're a youth liking kids movies why not see it if you're a parent going to see a movie with your kids you're way better of <UNK> for the <UNK> br br the start of this film was a bit funny and set some good premises for the happenings to take place but after the kind of funny introduction of characters settings and potential conflicts the story turned out kinda dull when more or less the same things happen for the third and fourth time the word predictable repeatedly comes to mind just like parts of a <UNK> or those commercials you really hate and the <UNK> of the plot oh sigh poor poor poor
<START> when this show first aired i will admit to being intrigued by the premise and the setting with an open mind i watched the first two episodes and naturally <UNK> it as being destined to run for a half season at most i happened to be watching a e recently and witnessed an ad for this garbage and i could barely contain my surprise i truly hope people are watching this for a laugh and not taking it seriously the characters are truly some of the most ridiculous and outright laughable on television scripted or otherwise it's obviously <UNK> ratings so i must give the creators credit for establishing and maintaining a <UNK> but i seriously hope no one is watching this under any <UNK> of seriousness
<START> when the hit i was in <UNK> <UNK> and part of the <UNK> team we didn't do anything except <UNK> around trying to learn what we were reading in the pages of <UNK> magazine a couple of local hills provided all the speed <UNK> you could handle at the time mike <UNK> was the hot stuff along with russ whats his name with the z boys hot on their tail i had a <UNK> plastic board with power <UNK> <UNK> loose <UNK> br br my parents told me we were moving to california later that year and that they were taking a trip to go house hunting i was an extremely good son that summer and asked if i might not be rewarded with a real <UNK> from california they delivered it was a deck with the <UNK> magazine <UNK> screened on it wide <UNK> and big red <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> don't ya know they got it at <UNK> street a surf shop in <UNK> beach br br when i got to california all of 13 <UNK> had the <UNK> wave and had a great park as well soon came <UNK> odyssey in mission <UNK> an <UNK> park with every scenario imaginable all the while i was reading about <UNK> tony and jay this flick was right on the money and a wonderful experience to watch
<START> <UNK> is awesome <UNK> ray moore's kung fu <UNK> with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as close as you can get to becoming a spoof of a genre without actually being spoof citizen kane this may not be nor les <UNK> <UNK> but this is undoubtedly genius in it's own right the production values in this movie are so bad they could qualify as existential special effects the plot drags a little in the middle but the power of such a cheap premise as kung fu <UNK> is enough to bring all but the film lovers through the infamous ever present boom mike evokes shades of the <UNK> incompetent ed wood and never grows unfunny i sometimes wonder if the boom mike was left in on purpose as commentary on the ridiculous aspects of movies in general but i usually get distracted by erotic scenes that lack <UNK> to the point of high art everything is this movie is alive and breathing dripping with desperate longing to be simultaneously loved and <UNK> it works br br 9 out of 10
<START> this is one of those movies where you have to put to one side some of its obvious shortcomings a result of the date and location of its production and <UNK> the positive in many ways this is a truly superb film br br forgive the parody in the one line summary but the most serious <UNK> for an english <UNK> like me was the ghastly subtitles the print i saw had 1982 soviet film <UNK> subtitles which consistently used <UNK> <UNK> presumably to give the impression of 13th century speech the actual impact of this nonsense is to make it harder to follow the subtitles which means you spend less time looking at the images given that the cinematographic imagery is this films great strength this is a real issue br br other imdb have written plenty about the <UNK> propaganda elements of this film just in case the viewer doesn't notice them for him herself they have also written plenty about the battle on the ice scene which is superb in my view br br the love interest almost totally lacks subtlety and yet strangely almost totally lacks charm also but it is good to cringe every now and then br br i was familiar with the music to this film long before seeing the film the images and the music <UNK> each other <UNK> and it is the images that will stick in the mind for a long time bergman clearly learned a lot from these images the imagery of his medieval pieces e g the seventh seal the virgin spring building upon and <UNK> <UNK> ideas this film was made in 1938 in the <UNK> in that context it is a masterpiece albeit a flawed one br br for the modern viewer i suggest that you go with the flow and enjoy the many treats on show
<START> i shouldn't like jackass number two no one should there is and never has been anything particularly redeeming about jackass and yet it's one of the funniest things i have ever seen and i simply cannot explain why br br this new movie leaves the first one in the dust it's so funny so horrible and so wrong the whole team give their all with in chief <UNK> leading the charge he's nuts i adore him but he's insane and more power to him with his <UNK> film career he could have sat back and just let everyone else do the dirty work but the fact that he threw himself almost literally back into the world of the so <UNK> makes me oddly respect him more kudos must go to <UNK> who previously seemed content to sit back and just make sure everyone around him did pretty much what he wanted here <UNK> isn't the <UNK> but the tormented and is all the better for it br br i simply can't say what my favourite part is because i laughed the whole way through admittedly i viewed much of the movie from between my fingers but there hasn't been a <UNK> movie i've seen in a very long time that made me feel as <UNK> as this did love them or most probably hate them the jackass team have delivered above and beyond my expectations but i do agree with <UNK> there can never be a jackass number three because someone will die and i want these guys to stick around
<START> years ago i used to watch bad movies deliberately somehow i missed this one no gesture rings true no facial expression fits the scene or the action i've never heard such inappropriate music for a film at the final scene i was rooting for the car to run over that ridiculous kid one of the worst child actors ever br br only one name in it i ever heard of <UNK> <UNK> he must've been very hungry to take this part br br do not under any circumstances watch this movie you've been warned
<START> i went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go br br we were both trying to look at our watches well before the film ended in order to see how much more we had to endure two hours and six minutes long it is it's divided roughly equally between battle scenes about a dozen of them all more or less <UNK> and plot development br br one would have thought that with the subject being the son of a minor <UNK> chief who <UNK> half the world plotting would have been relatively easy there's a fair bit of raw material there from which to make a pretty good story however the writers <UNK> it completely we get no real history we get instead a hollywood version of history br br what <UNK> young through his long almost endless actually or so they seem to the viewer <UNK> why the love of a good woman of course br br how does he get out of prison well an old monk who <UNK> his <UNK> goodness and greatness sets out across the continent to take to this good woman a <UNK> that love for her dropping dead just close enough to her for her to find him as he lies there <UNK> in his hand and of course she then goes and having inexplicably become rich and powerful <UNK> him br br how does he escape from the <UNK> well he goes off to the <UNK> of the great wolf god or some such name and sets him free by magic yeah right br br why does he want to become <UNK> of the <UNK> the wolf god again apparently off goes to ask for <UNK> and surprise surprise he gets it laws he says to himself what the <UNK> need are laws good simple ones <UNK> it was impressive br br and then finally how does he win the <UNK> battle against his <UNK> more powerful forces better tactics certainly but also through the aid of the good old wolf god again who sends a storm at the height of the battle all the troops <UNK> as the thunder rolls and the lightning flashes <UNK> are scared of thunder you see but not our the troops completely <UNK> by his bravery acclaim him king br br i don't know what <UNK> people to keep producing this kind of garbage the funny thing is it's interspersed with all sorts of gritty realism lots of <UNK> of milk dirt and violence it's as if the producers of this movie wanted to get the trivial things right so that viewers wouldn't notice how <UNK> some of the big stuff is br br there's <UNK> of violence in graphic close up <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of blood <UNK> of blood clouds of blood the blood guys had a great time actually despite the realism it's impossible to take seriously br br i must mention the ludicrous cgi final battle scene how anyone can think these things look realistic is beyond me they don't oh and it's all shot in the standard hollywood style breathtaking <UNK> for the spectacular scenery and the super close up <UNK> stuff for the battle scenes and the standard <UNK> super sound effects of and <UNK> and the constant low <UNK> hum to sustain tension br br tedious br br avoid
<START> i finally found a version of <UNK> that i like anne doesn't look like a <UNK> maid in this version just a very thin aging pretty woman quite like she's described in the book captain <UNK> doesn't look like he's 50 nor does he look <UNK> angry but rather as he's described in the book he hasn't aged as much as anne and is quite handsome and they play their parts with such conviction and realism that's what acting is all about they were believable they created real characters and it was like the characters in the book came to life if you haven't seen this version i urge you to find it order it or request it from either a <UNK> or a library if you must it's worth the price and worth the wait br br i watched the 1995 version and the 2007 version and this one towers over the other two why it isn't rated higher is beyond my <UNK> the book conveys the <UNK> of their relationship and this movie makes the book come to life
<START> i really enjoyed this movie during the movie i felt that i wanted and captain to get together i heard myself screaming come on kiss her the movie has a happy ending good movie to watch in the evening when you want to chill
<START> the vietnam war era is certainly far before my time but it has always interested me and i have seen many films about it all of the others i'd seen had dealt strictly with the front line of battle when i read a description of the war at home i found the concept intriguing no vietnam war movie i'd ever heard of talked about what happens to a soldier once the fighting is over with br br one night while flipping through channels the movie aired on the sundance channel i set down the remote and settled back to watch it i did not move from my seat during the entire two hours it's one of those movies that keeps you very interested because there is no way to predict what is going to happen next br br this movie made me a huge fan of <UNK> <UNK> i had enjoyed him very much as billy the kid in the young guns movies but i never saw anything he did afterward <UNK> proved to be very talented at writing and directing as well as acting br br the pacing of the movie is done extremely well i am hard pressed to think of a point where it drags br br what <UNK> me is that it didn't get an oscar or any real recognition when it came out it is a dramatic story about parents trying to cope with the fact that their son is not who he used to be and probably will never be as they remembered him again definitely worth seeing
<START> this is wes craven at his worst this is the very worst horror if you can call it horror you will ever watch <UNK> from one of the masters of horror wes craven poor direction poor acting poor set poor atmosphere makes this the biggest pile of rubbish ever the bad guy is totally unconvincing you couldn't even feel sorry for the guy the gore and horror involved in the film is laughable it's just plain rubbish the only good points i can think of is it stars natasha <UNK> wagner <UNK> <UNK> and lance <UNK> but not even that cast could stop this from <UNK> out of control and into one of the worst horrors ever if you still ain't watch it yet don't bother you'll only hate it
<START> produced at a point in his career where he had the juice to do whatever he wanted eddie murphy took on the task of producing directing co writing and starring in harlem nights an expensive looking but ultimately empty gangster saga about a group of black nightclub owners gangsters running a <UNK> club during the 1930's headed by a <UNK> hot shot eddie murphy and his adopted father richard <UNK> and their attempts to avoid being <UNK> by white gangsters who think they are taking over <UNK> that it seems they think is rightfully theirs simply by virtue of their color this was an idea that probably looked great on paper but it definitely lost something in the translation this was a vanity piece for eddie and i think he <UNK> himself a little too thin here trying to be the whole show here admittedly it was a pleasure seeing murphy and <UNK> together on screen but the rest of the large supporting cast including hall <UNK> foxx della reese michael <UNK> danny aiello <UNK> guy thomas <UNK> ford stan shaw and <UNK> brother are really given precious little to do though i will admit murphy's fight scene with della reese is hysterically funny and probably the movie's best scene murphy clearly <UNK> a lot of money into this film and a good deal of it shows on screen the art and set direction are impressive and the breathtaking costumes should have won an oscar but this one was a big miss for eddie as he definitely tried to wear too many hats
<START> this movie is a quite fair adaptation of the <UNK> novel in the novel himself is a character don <UNK> is from north spain and historically a <UNK> country zone they can speak <UNK> language they are in <UNK> <UNK> south spain and they only speak spanish with <UNK> accent in no way they speak <UNK> but carmen explains to don <UNK> that she was living in you can believe it or not anyway this is the <UNK> version then you can't be critical with the movie about this be with the book you have to note are different the novel by and the opera by <UNK> and this movie is an adaptation from the novel anyway in the opera don <UNK> is still spanish from never he's french why so many people keep thinking don <UNK> is french i don't know but i guess because the novel and the opera are in french although is supposed to be in spanish br br the only important difference between the movie and the novel is that in the movie don <UNK> also kills the <UNK> lover of carmen and in the novel he doesn't neither in the opera i guess they wanted to keep the movie a little more gore i think the movie is quite good anyway
<START> there really is only one reason to watch this barely adequate and utterly predictable movie about an uptight chef kate armstrong catherine zeta jones whose life changes when she <UNK> her <UNK> niece <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> after her sister is killed in a car wreck and that reason is to watch aaron nick who with his <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> attitude looks good enough to slap between two <UNK> of <UNK> and eat with an <UNK> oil and <UNK> <UNK> and a few finely <UNK> sun <UNK> tomatoes he reminds me of sean bean the thought that he might take his shirt off really was the only thing that kept me awake until the end he removed his <UNK> <UNK> several times but to my disappointment never went further br br i can't be too critical because i was watching it on pay per view at home so it hadn't cost me the price of two movie tickets at least and i was brought up to be grateful for small <UNK> but really this is <UNK> com at its most formulaic zeta jones gives a very flat monotonous performance she seemed utterly lacking in passion possibly due to the amount of time she apparently spent in the cold store at the restaurant thirty takes in there can't have been fun and her face barely changed expression throughout the whole movie <UNK> <UNK> was pretty good as the niece she's such an appealing little girl that it's quite impossible to criticize her and anyway i loved her in little miss sunshine patricia <UNK> is always good value and i can't really fault her performance as the restaurant owner because she seemed very underused given what a good actor she is and how little she had to do here but the whole thing is just so clichéd much of the dialog banal and the outcome so obvious this is the cinematic equivalent of paint by numbers and zeta jones and generate little heat on screen br br nick likes italian food <UNK> <UNK> his burning inner passion and <UNK> to the sound of his appearance in <UNK> kitchen at 22 the <UNK> name predictably her <UNK> but his uncanny ability to bond with her niece by cooking pizza and building a <UNK> <UNK> in the living room brings kate around and despite a few stumbles along the way she ends up giving him her <UNK> possession no not her honour but her recipe for <UNK> <UNK> br br i'm being very unfair here aren't i i mean <UNK> com is <UNK> com and we all know what we are letting ourselves in for when we sign up but does it always have to be so mind numbingly dull
<START> linda blair has been acting for forty years now and while she will never escape the part of <UNK> in the exorcist few of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary status to such great effect as <UNK> does she plays jane brooks a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to purchase they are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents catherine <UNK> and rick farnsworth and upon arriving at the island they meet a photographer david <UNK> and his writer girlfriend leslie <UNK> who are <UNK> <UNK> in the hotel while investigating the legend of a local witch <UNK> <UNK> it seems that a long ago witch hunt resulted in her suicide and she was with child at the time unaware of the danger jane has recently <UNK> of the <UNK> dramatic death and jane's little brother tommy michael <UNK> has been more directly visited by her spooky black clad spirit which he calls 'the lady in <UNK> the <UNK> time at the island <UNK> begins quietly enough unknown to them however the lady in black has already <UNK> the captain of their hired boat george stevens before long the isolation and cold begin to affect everyone and it is during this period of <UNK> and tension that the lady in black begins her reign of terror she plans to avenge her own fate by <UNK> jane and <UNK> her companions and her unborn child each of her other victims <UNK> an aspect of her vengeful curse greed lust and the blood of a virgin as the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild she <UNK> them one by one in gruesome horrifying ways the island location is effectively scary and the <UNK> is very creepy and <UNK> shot it's such a colorful film that it reminds me of <UNK> <UNK> work the lighting is excellent and the set decoration is perfectly spooky the soundtrack is very effective and unique the horror effects are extreme terrifying and unforgettable the cinematography is great and it is this that brings us back to linda blair the creative team behind this film shoots her like a horror star should be shot lots of dramatic push ins lingering close ups that subtly detail jane's possession and moments that are reminiscent of other great horror films there are hidden <UNK> to rosemary's baby <UNK> ladder the shining black sunday and of course the exorcist she does a great job and absolutely steals the show with her moody and understated performance that isn't to say that the rest of the cast disappoints catherine <UNK> is sexy and very good and veteran performer annie ross is memorable as jane's bitchy mother rose <UNK> gives it his best but he is not essentially a film star and his television persona gets in the way of his performance blair and young michael <UNK> have a wonderful chemistry together the film is otherwise so violent and creepy in a good way that it desperately needs their warmth blair also played a mother in <UNK> monster makers and her <UNK> scenes in that film have the same tender feeling to them lastly <UNK> <UNK> in one of her last roles plays a great witch and she has the most amazing voice and accent along with blair she was also perfectly cast but it's <UNK> movie all the way jane brooks also seems to have some psychic ability and this aspect of the film <UNK> back to exorcist ii the <UNK> i think <UNK> is up there with the exorcist exorcist ii hell night and summer of fear as <UNK> best genre work to date
<START> i agree that mary <UNK> secretary is one of the only good things about this film she is my favorite actress ever every role she plays is always done so well her character is sly sarcastic clever light hearted funny and cunning she really pulls this role off well and you get a good feel for what her character is all about br br the rest of the movie is pretty bad the music is the most entertaining thing left one of the characters has this really strange <UNK> radio that she brings with her while she wears her tight <UNK> <UNK> tank top br br one thing that was a little intriguing about the story was the idea that someone hires these three college aged kids to <UNK> up an old abandoned theater he gives them the keys and says go at it that would be really fun and i wish someone would give me that chance imagine going into an old abandoned theater with two other people and you get to decide how to <UNK> it and fix it up you have total control over the whole building that would be so fun unfortunately the characters do not think of this as an exciting adventure they think of it as a big chore they walk around with long faces and fight with each other the whole time it's kind of a <UNK> but it's fun to think about the possibilities that these people aren't even excited about br br the movie does a pretty good job at making you feel helpless or a little <UNK> out by the theater itself however the acting besides <UNK> and possibly <UNK> the boss just because makes a really good money hungry fake <UNK> business man who never has any luck is really horrible and you just end up feeling <UNK> plus the random slapstick is a little tacky and kind of ruins the reality that the film tries to create br br watch this if you dig mary <UNK> funky 80's <UNK> keyboard style electronic beats and if you think having a giant spooky abandoned theater to yourself is at all intriguing
<START> in the new year's eve the sister of the salvation army edit <UNK> <UNK> asks her mother and her colleague maria lisa to call david <UNK> victor to visit her in her <UNK> meanwhile the alcoholic david is telling to two other <UNK> in the cemetery the legend of the phantom coach and his in <UNK> with the legend the last <UNK> to die in the turn of the new year becomes the soul collector gathering souls in his coach when david <UNK> to visit edit his friends have an argument with him they fight and david dies when the arrives he <UNK> his friend georges <UNK> who died in the end of the last year george <UNK> parts of david's obnoxious life and in flashbacks he shows how mean and selfish david was br br is an impressive and stylish silent movie with magnificent special effects for a <UNK> movie the characters are very well developed however the story is dated and there is a weird and unexplained situation when sister edit tells that she loves david <UNK> why should a <UNK> woman love such a despicable man that wasted his life <UNK> other people despite being <UNK> dated in the present days it gives a beautiful message of faith and redemption in the end my vote is nine br br title brazil a <UNK> the phantom coach
<START> i was a little worried about actors and acting in italy then le and toni came it was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen <UNK> has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years the movie is not completely perfect but <UNK> will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie toni please keep on acting in movies you're for sure the coolest actor around today and not just in italy his performance deserves international <UNK> i rate this movie 9 10
<START> i thought nick look at the gritty streets of new jersey where car are at an all time high was both thought provoking and entertaining this is just as good as movies like <UNK> n the hood or menace ii society or above the <UNK> i thought the actors and the scenarios were suitable it had a gritty realistic feel to it and was very atmospheric whether on purpose or by raw coincidence i liked this movie a lot an underrated gem i found on tv and glad i caught it go watch this movie if you get a shot if they don't have a dvd they should release one well done nick <UNK> imdb rating 5 9 my rating 9 10
<START> not everyone likes this movie it is still one of the best you have to be thinking movies about <UNK> ever made the fact that it doesn't have mtv era jump cuts or gore every seven minutes is irrelevant also speaking as someone who actually knows <UNK> the spoiler warning portion of the film where the <UNK> exchange their old bodies for those of <UNK> children it has some genuinely scary scenes the section where second spoiler alert martin <UNK> the <UNK> is almost hyper real in that it uses very few special effects a hallmark of this film was seldom given a big budget but was often effective it worked in this case too
<START> as most of you i've watch a lot of great movies in between those we often either <UNK> or <UNK> also find those movies that are so pointless that we think of reasons as to why anyone would make it this is exactly what i can say for dead man's bounty br br the very least i can do is try to warn some of you if you enjoy being entertained by a motion picture because of the story acting and intensity than you might want to chose something else now it's not all bad in fact if all you want is creative film editing and unique angles along with original music <UNK> than you might think it's ok as someone that values movie plots acting and being entertained by a film the truth is i thought this movie was so terrible beyond words i could easily find a spot for it on my list of worst movies seen in a while br br as for having val kilmer in this the truth is he was casted probably as a favor to the director as a fan of some of <UNK> films i can't understand what his motive for this was the movie seems part western part romance in the end i'm sure most of you can agree with me that it simply is a rude waste of our time in case you haven't seen this movie my recommendation would be to avoid it completely
<START> <UNK> pictures movies is not a fitting word for them really are somewhat <UNK> their <UNK> visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class tv commercials but unfortunately <UNK> pictures are feature films with the <UNK> of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours in this they fail miserably their <UNK> but rather soft and <UNK> than steamy erotic qualities non <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> is a remake of a film by <UNK> visconti with the same title and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> granger in the lead the original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around <UNK> during the italian wars of independence <UNK> moved the action from the 19th into the 20th century 1945 to be exact so there are <UNK> <UNK> men in black shirts german uniforms or the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> but it is just window dressing the historic context is completely <UNK> br br anna plays the attractive <UNK> woman who falls for the amoral ss guy who always puts on too much <UNK> she is an attractive versatile well trained italian actress and clearly above the material her wide range of facial expressions <UNK> boredom loathing delight fear hate and ecstasy are the best reason to watch this picture and worth two stars she <UNK> this basically trashy stuff with an astonishing amount of dignity i wish some really good parts come along for her she really deserves it
<START> before watching this film at a screening attended by the director herself we were informed this had won the short film prize at the film <UNK> surely this result will give filmmakers hope anyone can do better than this br br how anyone cannot notice the <UNK> rip off of <UNK> <UNK> in this i'll never know the film is pure drivel the acting cardboard the dialogue ridiculous the ending just flat the only of comfort we enjoyed after seeing this rubbish was to <UNK> comment on how dreadful it was in front of the director yes that was mean but <UNK> br br at least irish film making can't sink any lower
<START> wow this is anti christian bias big time this is based on a stephen king novel and he written this kind of bias before and then hollywood <UNK> it even more in this film we see a <UNK> minister and a catholic priest both act like fools and be <UNK> at the same time of course the devil has taken over the town so maybe his influence is into these guys too but they are typical hollywood portrayals they never show a minister who talks and acts like billy graham or your local minister or priest and another given they make the satan character the most interesting of the film br br max von <UNK> plays the devil and makes him a likable guy ironically von <UNK> has played a number of these roles after portraying jesus in the 1964 film the greatest story ever told you wonder why actors are so screwed up they don't know if they are god satan or anyone in between br br ed harris who played a lot of unlikeable roles up until the last few years is appropriately cast in this story he and the rest of the mean spirited characters in this film do not make it fun to watch br br from what i've heard king's book is even darker and more sick than this hate filled movie but better constructed frankly who cares king and hollywood deserve each other
<START> i can never <UNK> why people take time to review movies that they have not understood fully i know people will read <UNK> reviews on these pages of this film and it will keep them from seeking copies of this quite forgotten late <UNK> style but 1932 movie which should probably be referred to as <UNK> as that is the name on the main titles br br myrna loy best known as a comic actress in countless <UNK> roles shows herself to be miscast in all of them she was a true dramatic actress something that i did not know before watching this film which <UNK> all of her famous roles she is exciting and moving here two things she never was opposite the <UNK> and <UNK> william powell i'm still rather in shock over how good she was br br <UNK> sharp <UNK> the first three strip technicolor feature is more familiar but this one is far better artistically and an adaptation it is also very poignant as an expression of a film style that was about to die you cannot take my word for it you must see it
<START> i was excited about this movie after reading other reviews what a disappointment there are so many ways that this movie is bad the computer graphics were lacking to say the least i found the acting stiff and unbelievable watch the sand as the lost e <UNK> what an original name are found where did all the tracks come from i immediately recognized portions similar to other movies ie alien pitch black come on one huge ship to transport one prisoner and what is with the prisoner does he speak can he speak i kept waiting for something to tie the bits of the story together but it never came if this movie was made on a low budget it shows the only part of the movie i liked was when it finally ended i don't mean that i liked the ending i didn't i just liked the fact that it was over a trip to the dentist would have been more enjoyable in my opinion don't waste your time on this one
<START> well horror this ain't but a terrible low low budget <UNK> <UNK> of the worst kind sort of and therefore quite charming and funny to watch at least on my tv set a cross between pete walker <UNK> gordon lewis and say damn i give up just can't come up with any <UNK> <UNK> for this trashy movie everything is <UNK> wrong that i just have to <UNK> it in my film collection alongside with death in <UNK> <UNK> blue <UNK> and the good bad ugly right people with some small talent for adding gory <UNK> or sexy happenings to film they buy other people should pick this film up immediately sure is a fat <UNK> ol' <UNK> waiting here oh
<START> ghost son is <UNK> <UNK> best film and at the same time also his worst i suppose that statement requires some slight <UNK> it's his best because it's well directed ambitious accessible and very stylish but his worst because it's a dull unoriginal movie and undeniably a huge letdown to all the real fans of <UNK> past efforts let's face it many fans myself certainly included wouldn't have been interested in this film judging by the plot the famous names attached to it and even the boring sounding title the only motivation here was <UNK> <UNK> who brought us large amounts of convoluted <UNK> and fun splatter films in the past ghost son is a bit of his comeback film alongside the <UNK> and although the latter definitely isn't a good film it at least lives up to his <UNK> lines of expectations with excessive amounts of sleaze blood and <UNK> ghost son is a weak and <UNK> soft horror film even talking in terms of mainstream ghost stories the emphasis lies too much on sentimentality and this badly affects the already limited number of horrific <UNK> atmospheric moments the basic premise might feature one or two potentially good ideas but the film is overall dull and far too clichéd john hannah and laura star as a happy couple living on a remote ranch in south africa and <UNK> horses for a living the joy and happiness couldn't possibly improve so naturally something tragic is bound to happen and it does mark dies in a car accident but the <UNK> <UNK> remains at the ranch where she's in constant contact with <UNK> spirit she even gets pregnant with his child but shortly after baby <UNK> birth mysterious events begin to occur it seems as if <UNK> restless and selfish ghost the baby and uses him to encourage <UNK> into committing suicide with all the focus on the <UNK> relationship many of the events and sub plots are underdeveloped and or remains unexplained like the whole background of the youthful maid there's too little action and the only real fright moments are too obviously borrowed from classic films such as the exorcist and rosemary's baby <UNK> green goo self moving purely talking in terms of horrific entertainment ghost son is a painful misfire but it has to be said it's a beautiful and enchanting looking failure the cinematography is extremely elegant and many camera angles are truly inventive and suggestive the moody score sometimes even manages to create an ominous atmosphere even though there's nothing of any significance happening on screen there are several beautiful images of the south african <UNK> to admire but if that interests you i suppose you're better off watching national <UNK> instead not much to recommend here fans of atmosphere driven ghost stories have much better <UNK> to choose from and die hard <UNK> fanatics are advised to re watch demons macabre or blade in the dark
<START> we have given this film one star for awful however it really depends on how you look at it we are currently watching this on channel 5 at 3 <UNK> and we haven't stopped laughing so perhaps we could give it a 10 just for the entertainment value right from the outset with the thoughts of the stalker being <UNK> in comic fashion we were laughing is it me or does that chick from <UNK> landing look like one of the characters from the dark crystal br br i'm not going to spoil it for you however you would have to be pretty stupid not to see it coming i don't think its clever enough for double <UNK> br br this has to be the worst best film we have ever seen if we'd been playing the <UNK> the <UNK> drinking game then we be wasted by now
<START> seeing laurel without hardy in a film seems strange yet it's entertaining all the same it's a well done parody of what became a classic silent film and it showcases <UNK> talents very well while his pictures with oliver hardy were great these early solo efforts give you an idea of how skilled he was at his craft and how great he might have been had he continued in the tradition of keaton and chaplin as an individual star on his own the dance sequence with his real life wife in the <UNK> scene is the best part of the picture and has some pretty funny bits to go with <UNK> excellent dance steps and the <UNK> climax is a gem as even the bull takes a <UNK> and i like the irony in the scene where he's buried in hats and comes up wearing his familiar laurel and hardy <UNK> hat as much as i love the laurel and hardy team and feel that there was never a funnier comedy duo on screen during their prime it's nice to see them on their own once in a while check out the fighting that hardy made with the duke as another fine example <UNK>
<START> this movie was strange mainly because the plot was so incoherent the title refers to a vicious wind which <UNK> the surface of the earth almost when it blows but this seemed to have nothing whatsoever to do with what was going on the movie seems to be an extremely poor rip off of <UNK> ie rogue <UNK> being chased by bounty hunter or ruthless cop in this luke skywalker turns in a surprisingly good performance as <UNK> mentioned rogue cop nothing seems to be resolved at the end of the movie we never find out anything of any substance about the <UNK> or what his intentions are there is one <UNK> scene where bill paxton who has kidnapped the <UNK> plays one particular song in his cardboard airplane for no particular reason the song is called shape of things by the this happens again in a later scene where the same song is played for no apparent reason does this song have any relevance to the movie don't think so
<START> do a title search on randolph scott and trail street is the one film missing from the list you've seen one of 4 films scott made at rko during his prime <UNK> the others are always easy to get liberal kansas is just <UNK> of dodge city and is a <UNK> <UNK> about to explode between the trail riders who drive the into trail street the town's main street and the <UNK> <UNK> who feed our it'll take a strong man like bat masterson to step between the two groups and bring the town to order more i won't say except that scott movies usually have just one pretty girl and this one has three randolph scott always played men you could look up to for their sense of honor courage level <UNK> and <UNK> to do the right thing fifty years ago parents could send their kids to a scott movie with confidence they'd learn positive values robert ryan co stars in this film playing a good guy for a change in real life ryan was one of the many world war ii <UNK> who starred in america's movies how sad what we get these days george clooney teaches our young that we ought sympathize with suicide <UNK> while steven spielberg teaches there is no moral difference between the olympic <UNK> murdered in 1972 in <UNK> and the palestinian terrorists who killed them hollywood 2005 <UNK> their moral <UNK> from too much cocaine and too much commitment to the wacky left i wonder how all this plays out in liberal kansas liberal after all was not a dirty word 150 years ago when the city was named
<START> i have seen nearly all the films of kurosawa and dozens of other japanese films as well compared to these other films this is a rather average to poor film the plot features two <UNK> brothers neither one of which i cared much for and it is very confusing keeping up with who is allied with who the music and cinematography is pretty good but the special effects at times are terrible rubber heads flying off with about the same realism as the average high school play on top of these complaints the ending of the movie completely destroys and <UNK> the entire picture it turns out that the end isn't true but was completely <UNK> what's the point of this then if you have seen this film understand that there are many better films out there so don't give up
<START> i am a big fan of <UNK> <UNK> and all the books in the series and i love the movie i was happy to see that they finished up with <UNK> moon i have been a long time fan of steve and was eager to see him in a serious role i personally think that steve has done an amazing job of re creating gus i can't think of another actor who would have been better he has the voice the mannerisms the <UNK> of word all down to a t granted no one could ever hold a candle to robert duvall as gus but i think that steve has done a pretty darn good job karl urban acts the same in all the movies he has been in so he has made a good match for <UNK> call as for the movie itself yeah it's a little corny but can you really beat <UNK> <UNK> no i don't think so
<START> when it comes to political movies i usually come out feeling empty they generally take up some <UNK> stance and you have a clear good vs bad story line as if it is some sort of batman movie br br but with it is the first movie i've seen that showed politics for what it is and the real issues of trying to rule a country of broken people who have known no other rule but violence there were no good or bad there were just interests and conflicts of interest this is the only political movie in my opinion that one can come out of it truly learning something especially for anyone with their eye on politics as a career this movie shows you you cannot rule on what you want for a country but what the country wants from you br br that's why i disagree with a lot of reviews that say everyone comes of bad i think they come of too idealistic the <UNK> want the perfect colony wants a perfect <UNK> <UNK> wants wealth and <UNK> america wants the perfect ally against communism russia wants the perfect <UNK> for communism and the they come off used and abused best example in the movie when tells his black troops your government <UNK> to you and it leaves them all in an <UNK> they are always being pulled and pushed into supporting this person or another br br this movie shows in politics a mistake can cost you <UNK> and this movie everyone makes mistake after mistake until it <UNK> and ends up destroying the country their intentions might be good or at least in the characters opinion but it's everyone's mistakes that lead to the downfall of <UNK> i don't think anyone is bad in this film i just think they want too much from people sick of giving and want to start taking br br overall it's not just the best political film it is a great film in general acting is fabulous as was perfect casting i really believe him script flawless editing perfect pace and production value higher than i expected for a central african film a must watch
<START> the <UNK> staring steven segal is a late 90's thriller action movie that is not really a thriller and not really an action movie rather it is steven segal playing steven segal by another name but this time he is a native american country doctor who kicks butt every now an again <UNK> the obvious plot line holes the movie itself is absolutely amazing in terms of the blatant disregard for character br br from a marketing standpoint i was left asking myself who in the world were they aiming at the bio thriller plot line is way off the mark for the middle america crowd and segal as <UNK> cowboy would never sell to anyone even if you deep fried him and put him between a cream <UNK> the whole movie is just way out there even for segal fans because it simply does not deliver on any level
<START> in the 3rd installment of left behind the makers did not care to put any kind of continuity into the plot although all weapons on the planet have been <UNK> by the united nations world war iii suddenly begins at the snap of a finger within a few split seconds the ex lover of one of the main protagonists moves from <UNK> <UNK> him to outright hatred to a melancholy confession of love without any trace of direction br br but foremost this film is really an irony free zone after the president of the united states accepts jesus as his <UNK> he immediately becomes a suicide <UNK> and blows up a <UNK> in the middle of the city <UNK> bin laden will be very jealous when he sees this film

<START> is there a fire fighter cliché that is not used in this film from the opening line i'm getting too old for this through the antics of the <UNK> to the <UNK> wife the loss of his best friend in the <UNK> to the final funeral for the fallen <UNK> this film looks and sounds like it was written by the marketing department at disney our studies show that audiences really like it when and then they stuck it in br br there is nothing original here any emotion we feel for these guys is brought in for our admiration and feelings for <UNK> br br go watch rescue me if you want to see real heroes everyday guys with flaws that think nothing of running into a burning building to save strangers
<START> the wizard of park was deeply responsible for many things we take for granted in 2007 even if he did not <UNK> them without rivals or <UNK> he gave birth to the electric light the <UNK> the motion picture camera the electric car <UNK> the electric power <UNK> possibly his most important but least <UNK> invention the pre <UNK> house and <UNK> to the <UNK> and <UNK> as well as the <UNK> tape machine and an early voting machine the total number of is over 1 000 far more than any other american <UNK> br br but edison was a ruthless business <UNK> he frequently had vast legal fights over the <UNK> of his <UNK> over rivals the best example is the <UNK> where he was one of seven or eight rivals with claims against alexander graham bell actually <UNK> invention here was not the central idea that bell and gray had come up with <UNK> of each other in <UNK> but an improvement on the sound quality of the phone <UNK> and <UNK> that bell did not develop still it was part of the huge <UNK> supreme court decision that was the longest u s supreme court decision a single volume of their reports written by chief justice <UNK> <UNK> which by the way killed the poor chief justice from <UNK> within weeks of <UNK> it br br in <UNK> edison found an equally ruthless <UNK> in the area of electric power for large cities this was george <UNK> of the <UNK> air break firm had gotten the assistance of a new <UNK> and former edison assistant <UNK> developed <UNK> current which was a rival system to <UNK> direct current <UNK> system was basically a straight circuit system of electricity system allowed the current to be switched from one circuit to another actually it was a better and more efficient system but edison was determined to break this rival by a publicity campaign br br it started with electric power lines edison early on had his lines put underground so that they would not be <UNK> by weather conditions but was forced to have his lines out in the open like <UNK> lines when there were several accidental deaths by <UNK> on lines in particular one incident where the <UNK> was burned alive in front of hundreds of horrified <UNK> in <UNK> business district edison started <UNK> that a c current was far more dangerous that d c br br one result of all this was edison helping some <UNK> <UNK> with getting a c <UNK> and for an electric chair edison himself always denied that he invented the electric chair but he helped several lesser figures along the way for the complete story read mark edison the electric chair new york walker company 2003 br br edison experiment himself with cats and dogs experiments he was glad to show the public in the long run despite <UNK> in the invention of a new method of execution edison failed to <UNK> the public support of <UNK> current but he never stopped trying br br in <UNK> he had an opportunity to combine his campaign against and a c with his invention of the motion picture camera he <UNK> in putting down a well known public elephant <UNK> who had killed several men he did so by <UNK> the poor beast with a c but the entire killing is on film and one can view it to this day it is a pitiful looking film whatever poor <UNK> had done it was a poor beast not a <UNK> murderer the moment we see the explosions of electricity sparks that show the death of the elephant we are aware it will soon be over but the sudden collapse of <UNK> is still an unpleasant sight to view the film leaves a bad flavor in the mouths of modern movie audiences yet sad to say it probably made a profit for edison his description of the film in his <UNK> of films shows real pride in his accomplishment here in <UNK> it may have been exciting entertainment for many americans watching it one is glad that more people are appalled by it today sometimes one can sense the human race has improved a little bit
<START> after a long hard night being <UNK> away at the <UNK> in i needed a pick me up my throat hurt my <UNK> was empty and i ended up <UNK> to a drug addict at a bus stop trying to sell me some <UNK> today i watched red <UNK> and i can honestly say that i felt much better last night than i do right now <UNK> <UNK> leads a bunch of ass kicking warriors in various <UNK> and <UNK> to recover a green rock from some evil queen whose motives are never fully explained yep it's that good br br red <UNK> isn't in a genre known for great films until peter jackson came along with a certain oscar winning trilogy in fact the best swords and <UNK> film i could think of before lord of the rings was george <UNK> kiddie friendly <UNK> perhaps in view of this one should go a little easy on this film but i can't it's poorly written badly acted with the exception of paul smith who's just average and dreadfully put together the film is as convincing as an episode of the <UNK> with costumes and scenery seemingly lifted straight outta considering the comic book source material it is easy to forgive the various plot inconsistencies why <UNK> insists on saving the most annoying kid in this world or that one is <UNK> his personality seems to flick from <UNK> brat to polite gentleman at the flick of a switch <UNK> displays less charisma than a field full of <UNK> and just goes through the motions a perfect actor for his breakthrough role in the terminator br br it's simple to kick a film when you're down but the fact remains that this is not a good film by any stretch of the imagination when <UNK> <UNK> the death of her sister and <UNK> <UNK> places his hand on her shoulder to comfort her and then <UNK> out in that distinctive <UNK> accent she's dead then you know you're in for a rough ride a few smiles were raised at inappropriate points such as the <UNK> of a temple who when sent <UNK> to their deaths in a hole in the ground seemed to enjoy the experience at least judging from the <UNK> <UNK> that seemed to echo around the place if you have to watch an eighties fantasy film that wasn't porn watch <UNK> but never take that as a <UNK> <UNK> for the real thing take yourself to your local <UNK> and show peter jackson what a great job he did with lord of the rings trust me 11 oscars really does mean it's a great film unlike bloody titanic
<START> worst movie i have ever seen 90 minutes of excruciating film making all the ingredients to make this movie a true work of crap bad acting bad directing bad storytelling bad makeup bad dialogue bad effects and bad reasoning behind certain actions taken by the characters it also threw in a terrible naked shot of a dumb blond and a breast shot of a stupid asian girl and both attempts were just scary since these girls are ugly some good horror movies came out of the 80s but this could never be considered one of them kevin <UNK> also committed one of the greatest sins in storytelling he introduced characters at the end of the movie an old man and old woman i would vote for it below a 1 out of 10 but the voting system doesn't work that way apparently right from the title sequence i knew it would suck and i would return my dvd but best buy doesn't <UNK> dvds or products as they call it or so my <UNK> says i have the <UNK> horror and that was truly god awful but i still feel that night of the demons an obvious evil dead rip off was far worse than <UNK> horror this is just like the howling how in the hell could sequels get <UNK> out of this <UNK> cow save your money and get the texas chainsaw massacre just don't get any of its sequels though or the evil dead or dawn of the dead night of the demons is a very very very bad investment every second of it was just <UNK> excruciating pain for the audience because the whole movie all around was horrible do yourself a favor don't see it you'll be saving some brain cells
<START> an in name only sequel to john carpenter's vampires this movie takes place in thailand and involves a <UNK> of bad vampires who enjoy killing people and a <UNK> of good vampires who do not while it's an interesting idea to set a vampire film in thailand the writers don't seem to do a lot with the exotic locale this film could just as easily have been set in los angeles which brings me to my next point which is that this seems a lot like blade <UNK> we've got the rock soundtrack the martial art battle scenes a dance club <UNK> and of course lots of sharp objects going through vampires what we don't have is the budget and talent yes the hero is a good martial arts fighter too bad his acting wasn't as good and there's plenty of decent wire work and tons of <UNK> up fight sequences maybe too many the problem is they just don't have the same impact as the ones in any of the blade films perhaps it's just that the film has a been there seen that feel to it br br however for me the biggest problem was that the filmmakers didn't take enough time to establish the relationship between the lead played by the buff and bland colin and his girlfriend she gets <UNK> at the very beginning of the flick after a whiny exchange with her boyfriend we have no <UNK> interest in her <UNK> at this point and no reason to believe that her boyfriend would be willing to risk his neck to save her now that's a major <UNK> when that's the major thrust of the plot br br in the end you could do worse than waste 85 minutes of your time with this but i can think of a lot better things to do with your time like renting any of the blade movies
<START> just saw baby blue marine again after 30 years i still find it a pleasant and romantic film which catches a time which has been lost forever the innocence and <UNK> of a time now long gone is <UNK> captured in this small film the acting is above average and richard <UNK> brief appearance as a shell shocked <UNK> marine war hero holds a keen interest for any film buff or gere fan jan micheal vincent is in his prime and looks and acts like the all american boy the late bruno <UNK> who was billed as b <UNK> jr has a <UNK> role as pop a peace loving marine <UNK> reject dreaming of getting back home to his wife if you're looking for sex drugs or rock and roll this movie is not for you if you're looking for action and adventure the same applies however if you want to <UNK> a time in america of innocence honor romance and love then baby blue marine is a movie for you
<START> adult version of the classic lewis <UNK> tale is much better than you might expect here alice is a <UNK> <UNK> who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image made at the time when adult films were creative <UNK> with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs its an naughty little tale for adults if you're wondering whether or not my recommendation is a good one or not consider that the film was pretty much only available in its non hardcore version for the better part of the last three decades simply because the film stands up with out the sex which is how i first saw the film years ago on cable tv the relatively recent home video release on dvd put back the sex in horribly grainy inserted clips which makes it clear the <UNK> of the shots was the best choice all around if you're an open minded adult with a taste for something <UNK> i can <UNK> recommend this little film as a nice <UNK>
<START> i recently had to watch this for a project in a <UNK> class and thought it was absolutely the worst movie i have ever had to sit through it was like bad a bad <UNK> movie with all the good bits taken out bad acting the fake documentary set up nonsensical plot and <UNK> direction all combine to make a terrible terrible film br br the female characters are basically only there to be sex objects consider this exchange he's hot he has a girlfriend do you have a girlfriend no girl takes boys hand and leads him behind some <UNK> boy comes out and sits next to other boy girl off did you hit that no i didn't want to take my pants off you're stupid another girl shows up when the boys are going to beverly hills gets in the <UNK> with one of the boys and when they get pulled over by a cop you see the car <UNK> up and down br br a homosexual <UNK> a trigger happy clint eastwood look alike and what seems to be a mask all add to the <UNK> one of the boys gets caught by a cop no one cares one of the boys gets shot no one cares br br someone said the dialogue was mostly improvised and it shows just awful i would never recommend this film to anyone
<START> my friends and i have watched this so many time i have lost count this is worth seeing for those in the right frame of mind meaning that this is not so much a good horror film as a film to lampoon for its funny quotes and bad effects this film is best watched with other like minded individuals so you have someone to laugh with br br you'll laugh as greg leaps and <UNK> around the lab <UNK> his pet rabbit while his <UNK> shifts from right to left on his back greg stop <UNK> <UNK> dr brandon you'll laugh as j g <UNK> gives hand <UNK> to direct greg to the other side of the operating table while his hand is in the shot and you'll probably chuckle when you realize that the final woman has none of the features he used to <UNK> her with
<START> what a horrible movie this movie was so out of order and so hard to follow it was so hard to follow and was just confusing the whole time i was watching it i was wishing it would end i felt like i wasted <UNK> of my life that i will never get back save your money and don't rent this movie i now see why sarah michelle <UNK> was barely in the movie the first movie was great but this was just sucked i would never recommend this movie to anyone save your money and watch the trailer because that is about the only thing that is worth seeing with this movie this movie had no real story to it either i am still wondering what i watched
<START> i felt compelled to comment on this film because it's listed as the fourth lowest rated sci film of all time on the imdb what sure this movie is crappy but it's hilarious it's not awful on an ed wood level it's more surreal and uneven br br there are some classic moments in the film the brain surgery is gross and great and even <UNK> when you consider that the film was rated pg <UNK> chasing after his <UNK> before getting <UNK> acid dumped on his face mine speeches at the beginning of the film before <UNK> <UNK> was but another weak nation struggling to break free from centuries of <UNK> <UNK> also has some great lines no <UNK> no you want these keys don't you my it is absolutely wrong that this is the 4th lowest rated sci film on the imdb because it is entertaining no matter how bad a film is if it still manages to be weird quirky unsettling or entertaining it has merit and doesn't deserve to be dumped on and <UNK> i won't defend most of al <UNK> films but this one along with dracula vs frankenstein and blood of ghastly horror are entertaining enough to make up for their awfulness
<START> this is my first awful rating ever on imdb and i couldn't think of a more deserving film to honor it with i hoped for entertaining trash and found trash of the saddest <UNK> kind i found a film which no one can possibly have cared a bit about including its creator br br hell ride directed written by and starring larry friend of <UNK> bishop has a simple plot about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys two bands of <UNK> and a gruesome murder in 1976 which has yet to be <UNK> larry seems <UNK> determined not to tell this story focusing instead of putting his <UNK> strangely <UNK> main character into situations where he can <UNK> women who pretend to like it he also has a dialog containing enough horrible fire <UNK> <UNK> to put one off the word fire for life br br dennis hopper escapes complete <UNK> others are not so lucky sometimes they hit the road on their <UNK> making one feel even more sorry for michael madsen since his high handles seems to add insult to the injury of having to appear in this film there is plenty of <UNK> enhanced nudity but fairly little action and no humor whatsoever making one wonder just what kind of an audience they had in mind br br my guess is that most people who watch this film including fans of trashy 60s biker movies will feel cheated do yourself a favor and <UNK> the real stuff instead
<START> the hero john is going after some drug dealers who kidnaps girls for some reason on his journey he uses karate and kung fu moves and i don't believe he got hit a single time during the movie this is crap
<START> honestly i didn't really have high expectations for this movie but at the same time i was hopeful having it be directing by albert <UNK> one of the more well known b movie <UNK> didn't exactly raise my hopes i mean how many albert <UNK> flicks rank that highly yeah exactly but still the movie advertised a decent cast rob lowe burt reynolds pre <UNK> stardom ice t and mario van <UNK> br br it all amounts to <UNK> however as the movie is so boring and moves so slowly that the energy just seemed to drain right out of me the longer it went on it runs over 90 minutes but it's telling a story that could have been told in 30 minutes flat i don't know what <UNK> was going for here i mean the movie <UNK> artsy like style but it's a <UNK> at times and maybe i'm an idiot for expecting more from <UNK> this time around here he seemed to actually have a budget and a potentially great cast for the material but it's all wasted crazy six isn't much of an action film it's not much of anything really br br i guess what's the saddest here is the fact that i found the end credits the most entertaining part of the movie the music score is actually half decent with some smooth female <UNK> too but the rest is a complete waste and the less said the better avoid
<START> for all that has been said about the subject matter and the controversy that surrounded it please do not overlook what i feel to be the most important part of the film the <UNK> struggles of everyone to keep their pride through their trials whether dealing with self <UNK> male <UNK> a sexual <UNK> or even life itself everybody is human
<START> this movie has no plot it was supposed to be that a guy moves in with his grandma and everyone thinks hes a loser and he has to redeem himself but what happens after everyone finds out who he's living with they have a big pot party at <UNK> house the climax of the movie didn't even relate to the rest of it that whole plot was introduced within minutes of the movie's end i can see how it could have related to the supposed story that <UNK> <UNK> skills redeem him but that just wasn't there br br however the movie was funny as hell and clearly relied heavily on the jokes br br her <UNK> <UNK> like the great depression he just sucked his first <UNK> yeah for 13 hours it's for you i think it's the devil
<START> awkward disaster <UNK> has a team of <UNK> coming across the <UNK> s s <UNK> hoping to <UNK> it before it goes under for good irwin allen's sequel to his 1972 blockbuster the <UNK> adventure arrived in theaters seven years later never mind that nobody cared anymore why give us such a shoddy production filled with dim characters and miscast actors only to trash the memory of your biggest hit one might end up feeling really sorry for michael caine sally field peter boyle jack warden karl malden and shirley jones were it not for their lost at sea expressions good for a few stray laughs there's a moment when <UNK> jones is tempted into taking some <UNK> just for herself and she <UNK> starts <UNK> her <UNK> that is an <UNK> hoot the film was a career for all concerned most especially allen who never quite <UNK> from this from
<START> <UNK> and her three <UNK> are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler edgar with his eyes on a big inheritance decides to <UNK> them and get them out of the picture how can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the <UNK> streets of paris only by meeting the <UNK> alley cat a rough diamond with romance in his heart after they get a taste of the wide dangerous world he <UNK> them home and edgar gets his just <UNK> at the wrong end of a horse as always it's really the voices rather than the animation that are the heart of the disney magic phil harris is brilliant as eva <UNK> as <UNK> is well eva <UNK> but perhaps the most memorable turns are by pat and george lindsay who turn the old <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> into a couple of bumbling southern fried <UNK> their scenes with edgar and the musical numbers with <UNK> cat and his cool dude band are classic most striking about seeing the <UNK> now is how deeply disney's style of animation has changed since this was at the cutting edge in 1970 perhaps the nostalgic dated feel are just a result of being <UNK> down in belle <UNK> paris but the <UNK> are a pity and the animation and overall pace much less frenetic sometimes a relief than in more recent efforts such as <UNK>
<START> i cannot believe i actually sat through the whole of this movie it was absolutely awful and totally cringe worthy and yet i sat through it thinking it had to get better it didn't and i have wasted 2 hours of my life will smith is much better in action movies i loved him in i robot enemy of the state and independence day and i don't think he can really be expected to carry off an entire movie as the romantic lead in the way that cary grant could then again the script was <UNK> awful and the dialogue was so cheesy br br i disliked everyone except for <UNK> character and even that i found was done with a heavy hand if you want to watch a modern feel good romantic comedy watch something like how to lose a guy in ten days or when harry met sally the 40 year old virgin left me with a smile on my face i even preferred music and lyrics above this and yes i know it's cheesy but at least it didn't take itself seriously and was sweet i also disliked the main female lead and wasn't convinced of the chemistry between her and will smith's character br br in all i think there were two scenes that i liked and definitely not the ending which was nauseating and unconvincing <UNK> calling sarah when she hadn't given him her number was quite sweet and no sorry that's the only thing i liked about the entire film don't waste your time
<START> this movie needs to come out on dvd cause that's the only way i will buy it i thought it was <UNK> funny because there was no real plot to it it was not suppose to be an oscar winning film i appreciate those films cary <UNK> was a very cute robin hood i can't even think of my favorite part of the movie because they are all pretty good anyways peace out
<START> another pretentious film from <UNK> if la of the same at least its quality was superior mainly thanks to the great performance of <UNK> de but carmen is boring and full of topics <UNK> brunette with a <UNK> in the <UNK> poor man dragged to madness due to passion <UNK> <UNK> gangs br br obviously paz vega is a pretty woman but about its talent <UNK> more doubts and role is so stupid that results almost incredible the script is weak and and <UNK> character influences the entire film with these ingredients the result could not be good br br not the worst film i've seen but a complete failure in my opinion
<START> some possible spoilers br br of course this film could not be expected to be as good as the original remakes rarely are but this remake of one of hitchcock's greatest films psycho could have been a lot better br br first of all whoever cast the movie must have been psycho i mean vince vaughn as norman bates what where they thinking unlike the harmless almost <UNK> bates that anthony <UNK> was able to portray vaughn looks like he would could be a murderer in efforts to make his bates seem innocent vaughn ends up acting gay many of the other actors didn't seem to fit their parts either including <UNK> moore who just didn't seem to fit in the film br br on top of the atrocious casting the cinematography is notably <UNK> despite the fact that they remade the film scene for scene the one thing they added were random shots of object such as clouds or a nude woman in between the shots of characters being murdered these shots seemed to be irrelevant to the plot in anyway and in turn made no sense br br overall this psycho remake which could been a decent picture instead turned out to be a complete waste of time
<START> seriously where is al <UNK> oscar nomination for this one is it that we take him for granted at this point in his career pacino here is extraordinary he gives a complex heartbreaking performance as <UNK> the jewish money <UNK> the movie as a whole was quite great with beautiful shots of <UNK> to look at and a pitch perfect score to listen to the other actors all do a fine job as well but the real reason to see this is pacino i have seen all the nominated oscar performances of 2004 and i must say that pacino was <UNK> blame it on the anti <UNK> associated with the play the lack of <UNK> by the studio the late release date with no major push or most likely all of the above in my mind the best performances of the year belong to jamie foxx in ray don cheadle in hotel <UNK> and al pacino in the <UNK> of <UNK>
<START> was inspired by events on the track during ww2 when australian <UNK> <UNK> and ultimately stopped a push by 10 000 japanese soldiers to move and capture <UNK> what they really mean is that the movie is set in this time period but is fiction and everything that happens is just a <UNK> of standard scenes from other war films the first hour is just one cliché after another some of the scenes are simply there to be able to draw us into a feeling that this conflict was horrific beyond compare when there appears to be little evidence of this both sides fought hard to control the track and no mercy was shown by either side both sides suffered from <UNK> and the <UNK> was a great <UNK> in this conflict as the japanese got closer to <UNK> their supply line grew and this ultimately led to their downfall on the other hand as the <UNK> <UNK> closer to <UNK> their supply line <UNK> some of the scenes appear to be straight out of the <UNK> on standard scenes to include in any war film the film was misguided and <UNK> the youth of the production team at a time when australia could have done with a great film about one of <UNK> best moments the film is a shallow disappointment
<START> and generally speaking you will eventually have to research this little gem when describing i changed my sex or <UNK> or glenda as it is better known i must echo the thoughts of andrew smith who so hit the nail on the head when he wrote if you haven't seen any of ed <UNK> other movies this one is a completely <UNK> experience if you have seen any of ed <UNK> movies this is still completely <UNK> the film is both hilarious and tragic yet it moves with a strange rhythm of its own that leaves one in no doubt that its author knows and means every word he is saying during its running length wood bless him had some of the ambitions as a director wanting to promote peace understanding and even acceptance in the 1950s of all times when tim burton <UNK> a viewing of <UNK> or glenda by studio <UNK> for his biopic he showed the <UNK> laughing and telling each other that this had to be a put on more than fifty years later there are still people fighting just to be given the kind of respect that the normal take for granted so i say it most certainly is not br br no the real comedy in <UNK> or glenda is the sheer <UNK> wood displays in <UNK> his message directors frequently use stock footage when they can find some that suits their purposes and can be edited to fit with their own footage ed wood used stock footage <UNK> and tim <UNK> biopic celebrated the fact with a scene in which wood as played by johnny <UNK> <UNK> that he could make an entire film out of stock footage sadly the real ed wood died before he had a chance but <UNK> or glenda is the closest he ever came the imdb states that twenty percent of this sixty something minute film is stock footage and it is never difficult to guess which footage footage of busy <UNK> planes flying <UNK> poor lightning effects soldiers doing their thing they're all used in a <UNK> manner sometimes repeatedly and they often only have a loose connection to the story wood is trying to tell had wood been able to sit back and think about what he is trying to do for a while there is no telling what kind of heights he could have achieved br br wood himself appears in the film as the titular character a confused <UNK> who <UNK> himself as a woman named glenda aside from the daring manner in which he attempts to make his point wood makes one hideous woman having found myself out on the <UNK> of a society that thinks i am disabled and need to be <UNK> myself i honestly found myself hoping for the best outcome for <UNK> character in order to make his point however wood weaves in short stories of two other <UNK> one of them takes the extreme step of enduring a sex change in order to become a woman the other finds himself so <UNK> that he fears being arrested again so much he commits suicide the scary thing about this film is that if you edited out the <UNK> and <UNK> such <UNK> as my position on the <UNK> spectrum or such things as <UNK> very little of the film would even need to be changed that is how little society has learned since ed wood was a boy br br the other significant personality in <UNK> or glenda is bela lugosi whom wood <UNK> into the film <UNK> <UNK> upon <UNK> motives but the accepted theory is that wood wanted to help revive <UNK> career and would do anything in order to achieve this with the exception of taking his time to carefully <UNK> a good film that is in <UNK> or glenda wood makes usage of lugosi that was best described in flying <UNK> over hollywood as bizarre lugosi plays a character billed as the scientist but comes off more as an <UNK> puppet master people who have not seen ed wood films before the biopic will think tim burton made up the beware of the big green dragon that sits on your <UNK> speech if anything burton was being restrained about which bizarre speech to use in depicting wood ian dialogue nothing can prepare you for seeing the speeches in their original context not even hilarious <UNK> during plan 9 from outer space br br <UNK> types will also note the presence of <UNK> fuller <UNK> girlfriend at the time again burton her reaction to seeing the script for the first time whereas the film portrays her as being accepting and forward thinking i cannot help but feel that <UNK> portrayal is more accurate as fuller looks extremely uncomfortable in her role she only appears for about fifteen minutes but her delivery seems so mechanical so lifeless that she somehow manages to seem less talented than her cast mates if such a thing is possible whether <UNK> direction was better focused in this case than usual is hard to determine but if the ability of the support cast to leave the stars with the obvious exception of bela in the dust is any guide then it should come as no surprise that fuller would only appear in a very small role within one other wood film that she went on to write a number of hit songs tells you she made the right decision to stay behind the camera while wood would appear before the camera again it was never as more than a cameo a walk on or a bit part br br i gave <UNK> or glenda a one out of ten i generally only give this rating to films that are so bad they become entertaining as a result bold and well <UNK> as it was <UNK> or glenda fits that description to a t
<START> before seeing the sneak preview today of angels demons i <UNK> my mind of any <UNK> that might hold me back from enjoying it the enormous amount of hatred towards dan brown the fact that it was written by dan brown and because dan <UNK> name is slapped on all of the posters i went in with an open mind and expected the worse but instead what i got was a 2 and a half hour roman cat and mouse game with forrest <UNK> and that is by all means good entertainment value br br the movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself <UNK> robert <UNK> hanks <UNK> off to rome after the sudden death and the re election through <UNK> <UNK> all of this is the patrick <UNK> <UNK> however he soon learns of a new threat one that involves a secret <UNK> making its presence known an anti matter time bomb that <UNK> city is now targeted with and the kidnapping of four <UNK> <UNK> using his <UNK> and trust me you'll be hearing a lot from it is given the task of finding and <UNK> them using the mysterious path of <UNK> <UNK> him on the quest is scientist who is also the co creator of the anti matter br br the movie itself runs at an uneven pace one minute <UNK> and the swiss guard are <UNK> to save a <UNK> <UNK> the next minute he <UNK> you with pointless information about every random object he passes evidently <UNK> the <UNK> much anticipated action thriller sequences down it makes for an interesting read on paper but on screen it can go either way br br the character's are <UNK> written onto the big screen ewan <UNK> does a convincing performance as the quiet but <UNK> patrick <UNK> famous accent included tom hanks is slightly more <UNK> intellectually and physically since his last performance in the mediocre da <UNK> code plays commander <UNK> the straight faced leader of the swiss guard unfortunately neither his nor performance are worthwhile ones and instead of playing a part in the story they are just kicked aside as <UNK> br br however angels demons <UNK> what could never a thrilling fast paced movie filled with satisfying explosions beautiful <UNK> of st <UNK> square and including many of the <UNK> and a <UNK> bomb counting down the midnight hour ron howard does a decent job at directing this second <UNK> adventure this time taking in much criticism and almost completely <UNK> the boring dialogue for tense chases almost br br while <UNK> might call it a national treasure 3 with a much larger threat there is still enough <UNK> suspense thriller eye candy and brilliant still shots of rome to breathe in fans of the book might feel differently towards the movies <UNK> changes but considering the amount of <UNK> and <UNK> it <UNK> a d does exceedingly well at keeping the viewer locked on to the screen this time rather than on their sleepy shoulder br br a good book to movie adaption that will both appeal and entertain br br 7 4 10
<START> i'm not really sure what to make of this movie especially after seeing a great film like la <UNK> unfortunately i saw this in german during an antonioni film festival at the <UNK> film museum so i didn't get to hear great voice he is supposed to tie together four stories about couples in italy however as good an actor as he is <UNK> cannot rescue the most ridiculous of the four stories portrayed here a woman who comes up to him at a <UNK> <UNK> near a shop she owns and <UNK> out about how she killed her father nearby then the two of them go home have sex and he leaves it seems as if antonioni lost the subtlety had in earlier films like the passenger when dealing with sex and replaced it with blatant nudity br br however nonsensical the storyline is the film features two things that make it watchable eye and ear candy the actors and actresses are all beautiful people and the cinematography is marvelous scenes in old italian cities <UNK> with a bit in a tall apartment building <UNK> a city reminiscent of la <UNK> br br the ear candy however is what really makes the film worth watching <UNK> and brian <UNK> on your blue room and beach sequence both of which set the mood perfectly in the film the songs are available on passengers original <UNK> 1
<START> i had noticed this movie had been on <UNK> a lot lately so this morning i decided to watch it i had just finished the which is a great movie and i thought this looked good as well from the description the cable had <UNK> this film was awful it's slow the pacing is horrible it feels as tho it lasts 4 hours there's no real plot to speak of how can anyone say anything good about this movie <UNK> is good but he always is the other two characters work well but there's no real story to support any of it after 2 hours and you sitting there wondering what on earth is going on where on earth is the plot it ends with a surprise that frankly just made me sick don't bother with this one
<START> how did they get that cinematic shot of the car <UNK> with the back end of the semi and then roy sits up great looks like the dvd is <UNK> for may of 2006 about time watch this on a large screen or film revival in a theater if possible in order to fully appreciate the full aspect ratio my other favorites in this category are original italian job with michael caine <UNK> with steve mcqueen to live and die in la with the <UNK> guy when he was young french connection with gene hackman <UNK> with robert deniro <UNK> point with barry newman enemy of the state with hackman again what are your favorites
<START> oh boy this movie is so mediocre i don't really know what exactly to write about it br br i think it's easier to write what it's not br br it's not very entertaining it's not original and there's not one character in the whole movie i cared about br br kind of reminds me of a certain reality tv show on mtv but without any interesting people it just drags on and on and i could hardly wait for it to end the only thing that kept me from switching it off was jennifer <UNK> c br br i thought a long time about this movie to find one good thing to say about it what i liked was the reminder not to judge a person by the first impression you get as holly did when she accused nicole which earns it a score of 2 out of 10 instead of a 1
<START> for many years i thought i was the only person on the planet who had seen <UNK> and i am so glad to learn that i am not the only person who discovered this sleeper somewhere in their movie going <UNK> loosely based on the <UNK> play <UNK> follows an architect the late john <UNK> in one of his best performances bored with his work and his <UNK> marriage to real life <UNK> gene who decides to chuck it all say the hell with the rat race and go live on an island with his daughter molly <UNK> in her film debut and new girlfriend <UNK> a <UNK> susan sarandon even though paul <UNK> is credited as director <UNK> hand is all over this film the long scenes filmed without cutting the <UNK> feel to the dialogue the self indulgent storytelling style this is definitely his show from beginning to end and if you're not a fan of his work the film will seem <UNK> long and dull but if you are a fan there are <UNK> to be had <UNK> is surrounded by a first rate cast his scenes with rowlands <UNK> with intensity and his surprising chemistry with sarandon is a stark contrast to his scenes with rowlands <UNK> shines in her film debut and there is a scene stealing performance by the late <UNK> julia as <UNK> <UNK> on the island julia stops the show in one scene dancing with a flock of sheep accompanied by <UNK> minnelli singing new york new york this film is sad and tragic and funny and intense yes it's a little long and disjointed and it works a little too hard at being different there's even a curtain call at the end of the film but it never fails to hold the attention of those who like something a little different in their <UNK>
<START> i first saw this film when i was about 6 ish my grandma thought it'd be a nice <UNK> film to entertain me and keep me occupied however every time i watched it i had nightmares the same night yes it <UNK> as a kids' film but even now i find it really dark in places particularly the haunting music that is played each time the guardian angel woman is on the screen and her rather hypnotic eyes and voice the actual baddies of the film ie the sharks mr etc didn't scare me at all i just always found the whole film rather creepy and dark this is obviously something i can appreciate now that i'm 21 years old but speaking from experience there is no way i would show it to my kids
<START> this is going to be my first review on imdb and i'm glad that the standard rating is 1 out of 10 because then i don't have to change anything br br first there are awful movies movies you can make a laughter out of like island city battlefield earth or conan the <UNK> that is totally acceptable they makes a great party <UNK> then there are the worst movie ever i cannot believe how utterly crappy this steaming pile of dog turd was br br i found it on a second hand store on vhs and bought it quickly because i like sci fi terminator post apocalypse and stuff like that everything on the box art was very promising then i loaded in the tape quickly when i got home and the first thing that i noticed was what there was maybe 10 minutes or more of switching between present clips and flashbacks in a very annoying blue effect with sounds that makes you <UNK> and it just continues over and over then some acting kicks in and you wonder why you were ever born in a world where this abomination of mankind actually exists and then i realized there are actually two <UNK> i didn't think about it first but the title says 3 in it and i was horrified but as i actually in great pain and agony watch it to the end i thought nothing could ever make me feel worse about myself and this universe but then a little text showed up saying next and nemesis 4 no please no
<START> the film <UNK> the here and now horror of rendition with a multi cast <UNK> global account of all involved no one gets off lightly because we see the <UNK> of the players as they <UNK> out their own slice of the worldwide game <UNK> hatred and misery on their enemies and themselves in equal measure br br the interplay between the sympathetic <UNK> <UNK> played in <UNK> style by peter <UNK> and the real washington power <UNK> is <UNK> meanwhile out in the field new cia man jake <UNK> goes through a sea change in his attitude to the <UNK> new found <UNK> with torture sudden though his <UNK> of what he initially <UNK> <UNK> is one has to ask why on earth would anyone who calls him or herself <UNK> stand and watch anyone be <UNK> and abused in this way the film has few heroes perhaps <UNK> flawed and <UNK> cia man is the exception and a necessary <UNK> to make the film offer a <UNK> of hope br br the sad fact of course is that this film isn't fiction at all but a wake up call to those with a shred of decency left in them the awful truth is that we in the uk and usa have lost the moral plot and this film shows how low we are prepared to go all this in the name of freedom there's a wonderful line in the script that says that torture is a sure way to <UNK> the numbers of our enemies this is already happening in real life and we should listen to the message that this film delivers and start using our might and money much more intelligently the message seems to be that any of us who claim that rendition torture and the abuse of basic human rights are necessary to protect our way of life are as wrong headed and stupid as the <UNK> and suicide <UNK> br br all praise to the sensibilities of a talented south african director with a eye on the gross <UNK> of how power is <UNK> and a cast of <UNK> mainstream actors from the us and beyond oh and by the way the film has a <UNK> in its tail with the ending a clever and thought provoking surprise which i won't give away br br i saw the film in an early london preview so it has not yet been widely written up but i'm glad to say that the tide of less than glowing reviews seems to be turning the bbc review has been very strongly in support and they and i suspect that much of the negative comments come from those who see the world through the simple <UNK> of hollywood where the good guys and the bad guys are cardboard cut outs hence the reason that many of the truly great films of the year are increasingly indie and or non us <UNK>
<START> i was lucky enough to see the horror classics dvd version of this film before it was mysteriously removed from the 4 film dvd and replaced with something else the picture and sound quality of the film on that edition was a nightmare in itself yet that version is still superior to the one with the <UNK> dvd treatment the reason was stated in brad interview segments on the special edition dvd he had noted what i first found so striking about this film this being the use of music at moments of <UNK> in the film but leaving the moments of activity in silence thus giving the horror scenes a stronger feel the problem with this <UNK> is it carries the extra film score used to fill in these intentional gaps in score complained of this and made it clear that the filler music was not his the music actually sounded a lot like howard <UNK> work for <UNK> sad for me that i am also a major fan of that film and have to associate the two br br the film itself managed to add some interesting realistic elements to the genre horror film a group of friends go up on a mountain one of them inherited on the mountain they are confronted with a family with a nightmarish secret the movie moves along at a great pace in fact every time i have seen it i still find myself shocked to see 45 minutes had passed before things started really going wrong for the <UNK> br br while the horror classics version is filled with many gaps the fact that there is no score accompanying the horror scenes is what makes this film intelligent and even superior to most slasher films i have ever seen the director jeff had made some unique horror films previous to this one making this one the most mainstream and yet very different to the mainstream at the same time it is a good fun film with surprising acting performances to boot the new up dvd version is worth a rent the now <UNK> item horror classics version now <UNK> is worth the hunt
<START> best cinematography i have ever the year the movie was made i was absolutely amazed and thoroughly impressed with the amount of attention dedicated to the scenes and with what appears to be authenticity though i am not particularly a western movie every single scene is given the <UNK> detail and it is haunting there is a sincere connection with nature at times i am overwhelmed with the amount of action passing through the scenes but i am never bored i feel as though i am truly <UNK> into a time machine and looking back into the old west i recommend this movie to anyone who is studying set design location planning and for that matter photography in general it can be a <UNK> movie to experience with regards to the visuals considering this era of digital touch up that we now experience
<START> this show is pretty alright and fun to watch its a great disney channel shows and sometimes entertaining br br i really enjoyed the first season but i hated the second and third seasons this show has completely changed around in the first season it was more about science and animals all that is gone now in the season and third season its more about her life and dating ever since that gay kid ben came along this show has sucked the writers took a perfectly good kid show and changed it to a crappy teen comedy disney took a turn for the worse i cant stand to watch the <UNK> episodes anymore they're all garbage
<START> in brooklyn the nightclub dancer rusty parker rita hayworth has a simple but happy life dancing in the <UNK> owned by her boyfriend danny gene kelly rusty danny and genius phil <UNK> have a ritual on friday nights they order <UNK> in a bar trying to find a pearl the life of rusty changes when she <UNK> and wins a contest to be the cover page of the vanity magazine she is invited to work in a huge theater in broadway whose owner <UNK> her she loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new life style missing the love of danny and her old friends <UNK> is a delightful romantic comedy very naive and having magnificent parts such as the beauty and talented rita hayworth dancing singing and acting gene kelly specially in two scenes dancing with himself and with rusty and genius on the street the songs and the choreography of the dances are also <UNK> danny the character of gene kelly is almost nasty with his <UNK> behavior rita hayworth surprised me with her talent i found her amazing in <UNK> but she is stunning in <UNK> in <UNK> with the information on the cover of the vhs <UNK> was the first musical where the songs were part of the plot giving continuity to the story instead of just being in the movie my sixteen years old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent gene kelly festival and they loved <UNK> therefore i dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to the old generations my vote is nine br br title brazil
<START> spoilers spoilers i loved the set up and consistently laughed throughout the entire movie the acting was great with my favorite part being <UNK> kevin kline attempts to be a <UNK> man the <UNK> and parents did a great job as a supporting cast spoiler warning the acting of his conservative family's acceptance and attempts to be polite were heartwarming and believable my only problem with the end was the fact that howard was actually gay the movie is set up as a be who you want to be but the movie actually does the opposite <UNK> logic behind his discovery is the fact that he loves barbra <UNK> movies and enjoys dancing to music his mannerisms and tastes appear to be gay and it isn't until it is pointed out to him that he realizes it rather than setting howard free it <UNK> holes him oh he likes to dance to music than he must be gay his confession at the marriage felt like a <UNK> down to <UNK> wishes in the end the movie becomes a gay rights movie which was not the original course it almost becomes bland with the rest i believe the movie would had been ultimately better had howard been straight it would have been <UNK> to the message
<START> black water is a movie that in a way surprised me and definitely <UNK> my original expectations black water is truly a very well structured unpredictable thrilling well directed and well creepy movie the plot is actually somewhat original and will definitely keep you intrigued with it one thing i love about this movie is the direction because mainly on how it <UNK> my original expectations my original expectations of black water was that it was a <UNK> made acted directed paced and boring movie it really wasn't well the acting is nothing to praise because there were times were i feel they didn't show enough emotions and there are some lines that feel just so scripted however i love the direction because all of it's shots seem predictable but <UNK> like when watching it say the camera gets a slow shot of the water and it goes quite you're like the <UNK> about to attack however the <UNK> attacks are very unpredictable which was bad for me who doesn't handle films like this all to greatly and this does make you jump plus i just love that it's one of those horror movies that don't rely on the sudden big sound blast to make you jump but instead the actual movie i also like how the story is about people who are trapped in these trees it made it seem very real and definitely kept your eyes on the screen i must say i didn't think the opening 20 so minutes were done well and i think they made the boat a little <UNK> than it would have been in real life plus i didn't like how they tried their absolute best to make the characters situation seem entirely hopeless when it really wasn't also again i just don't think some of the characters actions were realistic for example i wouldn't have gone anywhere near the water knowing their was a crocodile in it let alone a killer one however these problems really <UNK> that major and i was still able to enjoy the film overall as far as movies go i've seen better but as far as animal attack horror films a genre i get easily <UNK> at it's one of the better ones you'll see and sure it's not perfect but that doesn't mean it's not worth a shot
<START> tip have it read to you <UNK> how br br 1 copy and <UNK> this to <UNK> not word 2 go to start all programs <UNK> narrator br br having your <UNK> <UNK> br br when jonathan ross started his career he was on a show call the last resort now a days he is the first resort to host anything and anything tv award shows that half the time he is up for nominations in comic relief chat shows <UNK> shows game shows charity shows <UNK> just when you at you wits end and think you can find salvation in the <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of good old j r hits you like a <UNK> train going none stop from texas to downtown n y that has lost a hour and is trying to make it up br br about this show br br its a normal chat show format with j r as host and a house band that of four gay men ha ha ha <UNK> my <UNK> sides and season one had andy davis but he left or was fired to give way to <UNK> ego br br ross will more less use his guests as props and you really don't hear them speak because of his its my ball and i'll take it home attitude you also see that the bigger the guest the more he is willing to lie and suck up to them to get in with the big boys like the weak kid at school who hangs round with the bully br br however when a small reality t v star comes on he'll happily <UNK> them asking personal questions about the past and telling them about their lack of talent to get the laughs sometimes he will under <UNK> the popularity of a guest say something to <UNK> them and then when the audience act shocked he will quickly turn and start making himself the fall guy the best example of this was when life on mars star john came on and he said how does someone like you get work your ok looking but not hollywood good looking bare in mind the hugh jackman and <UNK> <UNK> was in the green room he was really only trying to suck up to them before they were even on the couch when the audience acted shock ross quickly said what i'm bit light headed from wearing that <UNK> i don't know what i'm saying if he don't have any low forms of tv life on he'll just dig at the four gay men on the piano with jokes more out of date than his fashion br br its very much a different story when a hollywood a <UNK> or big tv star comes on the show in that he'll tell them stories to humor them when some actor explains that he was in a support band then <UNK> ross will say something like wow well he ever i go to see a band i was try to look interested for the support band to make them feel as though they are wanted with an <UNK> message being please like me i was probably one of the people that <UNK> you when you was in your band top this off with an audience of ross fans so hooked on every bad old joke and it really makes for a poor show br br your better off watching us chat shows instead they are more scripted but not anywhere near as hard to watch
<START> it's hard to decide what to say about this one it isn't totally one hundred percent bad although the movie in a movie is <UNK> bad meant to be campy but missing by a mile i'm pretty sure that this is intentional however danny aiello is perfectly adequate here and more or less nails his pathetic character <UNK> cannon was good in a small role was impressive as the latest twenty something girlfriend and linda <UNK> had a brave topless scene that she pulled off very well br br so it's not totally bad but i don't believe that this one <UNK> its goals all in all it's probably worth passing on
<START> i have to say that i haven't expected that this movie to be this good usually the eastern cinema presents the communist past in 90 of the films however this film surpasses the romanian cinema being worthy of some more <UNK> br br the acting is <UNK> and not exaggerated the plot is simple yet complex as it presents the life in the romanian <UNK> the sound amazed me the directing was good and what more can i say br br this crash of eastern europe was drawn me into the film living each moment of it i have even felt a desire coming out of me a desire for adventure after seeing it br br watch it you will definitely enjoy it br br 7 10
<START> for a country that has produced some of the world's finest <UNK> and has such a rich musical <UNK> it has always been a source of <UNK> to me why so much of <UNK> home grown cinema has been so appalling perhaps because by its very nature those talented in the field of irish cinema have been quick to abandon their native shore for careers in britain or america colin farrell is a recent case in point and that the really successful irish directors that have continued to work in ireland and with irish subjects have made their films with international money and an eye on the international market i am thinking particularly of jim sheridan and neil jordan who alternate between films with an irish setting and projects filmed abroad br br however is very much an irish film even if two of its principal actors are english it's certainly well made of its kind and might have <UNK> the trend that irish films aren't really very good <UNK> <UNK> i went down written by the brilliant young playwright <UNK> <UNK> is a crucial exception unfortunately this tale of <UNK> set in a <UNK> irish town presumably in the north of ireland judging by the accents mid <UNK> bible belt if you ask me and presumably in the recent past the fifties the sixties is so over the top that it really is quite ridiculous br br nothing in the film rings true and you can't help feeling it's writer has been strongly influenced by <UNK> <UNK> and that the whole thing might have made more sense had it been set in the american bible belt and not in ireland where even the most extreme <UNK> <UNK> was never quite as loony as this it's all meant be to be grim in a grand <UNK> kind of way and it certainly is though i was more prone to <UNK> than at the right <UNK> matthew antics he has the <UNK> accent off pat and there is nothing wrong with his acting or indeed that of daniel <UNK> as his brother gerard as his father or eva as <UNK> wife but the script is so <UNK> derivative that good acting can do nothing to save the film so rather than a step up the ladder for irish cinema is i'm afraid just another nail in its coffin
<START> the <UNK> is undoubtedly a classic australian tv series well defined characters tight scripts varied and interesting locales great guest stars and a <UNK> ambiance all combined to make this series a special one br br sadly andrew <UNK> has passed on <UNK> from germany does not appear unfortunately to have enjoyed small screen success in his native country the abc has repeated the series many times yet a dvd release is yet to happen br br the series is one which is timeless it is as likely to strike a <UNK> <UNK> with viewers today as it did in its own day come on abc release the <UNK> on dvd
<START> i am and have been a serious collector of christmas related movies tv shows holidays <UNK> etc for over twenty five years please <UNK> my warning and do not be <UNK> by sterling reviews media hype about this movie this is not a movie as we have come to know them and is certainly not for children the fact that this was produced for a major tv network is was no surprise considering their level of operation at this time what is hard for me to believe is that the jim <UNK> organization <UNK> so low to become involved in this travesty of christmas i wish there had been reviews for me to read that would warned me before i wasted my hard earned money on this piece of trash
<START> why is it that canada can turn out decent to good movies in every genre other then action i caught dragon hunt on tv the other day and it was like a train wreck i just could not change the channel it's sheer stupidity <UNK> my <UNK> its pretty telling that the cast imdb credits with this monstrosity apparently never worked again br br bad acting bad writing bad narration bad music bad hair bad cinematography it just goes on and on the movie really has nothing to recommend it if you're looking for bad action films to enjoy by laughing out there are a <UNK> of other films that won't require you to <UNK> out your <UNK> afterwards br br i hope this film didn't get money from the government for <UNK> otherwise i'm never paying <UNK> again
<START> <UNK> of the board is a ridiculously stupid film from the popular comic <UNK> top also seen on the 1 <UNK> collect commercials he plays a surfing <UNK> who comes upon a man who has a flat tire top helps him out and a few days later discovers the guy's died and has given his company to the comedian even if someone else was in <UNK> role it still would have been bad the jokes which are constantly <UNK> throughout are terrible and the idea of a romantic plot twist should have been <UNK> do not watch
<START> after seeing this piece of crap you will know why the drive on the left side of the street this movie is an absolute no <UNK> the jokes if this is the right word for it are mostly sub standard about 98 and do miss any punch line at all save the money and get drunk you might enjoy this movie being totally wasted perhaps
<START> emotionally insecure tom russo <UNK> felt reads the secret diary of his sexy wife <UNK> and is <UNK> to discover that the love of his life has apparently been sleeping with every bloke she meets this shocking revelation sends poor tom off his rocker and he proceeds to <UNK> bloody revenge on the men who he believes have been his old lady br br in my experience really really bad films can often be as much fun as really good ones and no film featuring a <UNK> by <UNK> enhanced ceiling fan should ever be considered completely worthless but even though killing spree very occasionally manages to entertain with its <UNK> and cheap and cheerful gore i found that the terrible direction awful production values ugly cinematography <UNK> sound dreadful lighting mind numbingly tedious and <UNK> narrative which includes a really dumb plot twist that is <UNK> from the beginning plus a pointless zombie finale nasty <UNK> score inane dialogue and thoroughly amateurish acting all served to make this effort from writer director tom ritter a virtually <UNK> experience
<START> the <UNK> on the box <UNK> 100 trapped passengers 3 000 <UNK> <UNK> you almost have to admire that degree of no chance in hell we're ever going to deliver on this promise <UNK> i could admire the more so if they made movies that well you know were good or at the very least worth a damn haha and it's what i like about <UNK> movies they are garbage you put them in a toilet and then you <UNK> it worth the price if you are a fan of cheesy movies it may become a cult classic among many fans the gore scenes are there's not much i can say it's a z flick that parody the new movie with samuel l jackson hell it may be better so who knows
<START> a sci fi network original not the best not far from being the worst an <UNK> richard <UNK> stumbles onto a key that can open a <UNK> to a parallel earth that has been taken over by mutant <UNK> the <UNK> have been controlled by a super sized alien queen for the past thirty years she has already eaten up the population of this parallel world that resembles chicago minus inhabitants guess what now she must find another world to feed on the <UNK> leads a four man team that reluctantly finds themselves with the task of saving the world the finale confrontation is probably the best part of the whole movie the cast also features richard colin fox kate <UNK> jason jones and david newman one would have thought that the sci fi network could have spent more money on special effects
<START> for real though this game is where it's at i'm 20 years old and that's basically where it started for me 4 bit graphics was fabulous i hope you all remember this game with as much <UNK> as i do that <UNK> is a real
<START> strike force or the <UNK> is a fun action movie that doesn't it take itself too seriously william forsythe stars as simon who is looking for a missing daughter of a wealthy client he meets up with erika <UNK> who is also looking for someone her sister but there are evil bad guys <UNK> the most evil of them all is <UNK> andrew <UNK> <UNK> likes to kill people so now simon and have to team up to bring down the villains the whole cast is great with <UNK> stealing the movie there are also cameos by ed <UNK> and burt reynolds if you are looking for a good action film watch this and have a good time
<START> if you need that instant buzz that only late 60s early 70s euro sex movies can give off then look no further for you have just stumbled across the mother <UNK> subsequent tv director exercise in psychedelic porn of the soft core variety may not generally be considered as a classic of its kind but it knocks many better known titles from the likes of <UNK> jess franco and joe <UNK> for a loop <UNK> <UNK> sure was hip to this way before anyone else when he picked up this <UNK> twisted little number for us distribution through his company gorgeous cinematography <UNK> compositions may <UNK> cries of from those who swear by shoddy skin flicks shot in someone's backyard hey as far as i'm concerned it's their loss for this is one thrill ride of a movie with twists so well twisted that you may not even believe them after you have actually witnessed them on screen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as the gone to seed <UNK> from lucio <UNK> house by the cemetery has never looked more exquisite than she does here subtly portraying the innocent <UNK> held hostage by mad <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with all the art house favorites to his name you wonder whether he has the good humor to mention this one on his c v as their initially violent <UNK> turns to s m <UNK> love story nothing is what it seems however in this sick and imaginative gem of a movie with several truly erotic moments achieved with surprisingly minimal nudity i for one was completely <UNK> and enchanted by the way chose to suggest <UNK> sex during one scene i'll let you find that one out for yourselves and <UNK> clad boogie to an <UNK> <UNK> 60s tune should have become iconic in a way similar to the image of sylvia <UNK> <UNK> in that wicker chair in her <UNK> days you may not know this film just yet but trust me once seen you'll never forget it
<START> sometimes i think that somewhere in the lifetime <UNK> office complex there is a room where the writer's hang out with a large wheel on the wall sort of like the big six ones in <UNK> the latter have a lot of spots where you win even money and fewer for higher amounts until there are perhaps a couple which pay bigger bucks br br but i picture the <UNK> wheel having about six different genres on its wheel with two of them appearing the most labeled the psychotic neighbor or the <UNK> with a hidden past or secret or both lifetime movies have a few repetitive story lines and these two seem to be the most <UNK> br br the <UNK> category can have a <UNK> of long standing but some person appears or an event occurs exposing that the good wife was once a hooker one of the couple was involved in some <UNK> act long ago or that something else in one of the background in different than presumed etc etc or as in this flick one of them has entered the marriage with the most <UNK> of aims br br one constant in all of their genres is that the husband or other males are usually clueless vacuous and slow to have any idea what in the hell is going until the climax or at best very late in the proceedings unless the male is the <UNK> not the case here br br whether the <UNK> <UNK> might be the neighbor or as in this offering the wife it is always fascinating how easily successfully and effortlessly they proceed with their <UNK> deeds they manipulate many of the others <UNK> them as necessary assume various poses and <UNK> more <UNK> than you can count with <UNK> success until just before the end br br the lead actor here like many in this <UNK> movies is an old hand i noticed that another film in which he starred was titled the perfect neighbor br br finally the vengeful perfect wife in this flick <UNK> those in her path with more expertise and ease than the most experienced and competent button man in don <UNK> family could <UNK> and i couldn't help but imagine that jack <UNK> character <UNK> as good as it gets with his massive <UNK> <UNK> could provide <UNK> to the anti heroine to assist in dealing with he obsession which was the basis of this <UNK>
<START> first of all i really can't understand how some people enjoyed this movie it's the worst thing i have ever seen even the actors seem to be bored and i think that says it all br br however i have to give my applause to the opening credits creators that team seems to have a really good future that's why i recommend the big studios to watch only the opening credits and one or two special effects sequences if they're watched outside this movie it almost looks like a good movie br br better luck or judgment next time for the producers of this this this thing
<START> the story was disjointed the acting was not of any you can more of a serial pilot than an actual movie i wanted to like this movie but just could not find anything to like about it whatever it was that made the lost boys so likable was obviously absent here <UNK> it tried hard plot <UNK> were clumsily placed amidst what could have been an episode of <UNK> creek with dark clothes and the story arc was going nowhere soon very disappointing for me the end scenes were special effects driven <UNK> and how the villain of the story planned his whole scheme who was he or she trying to kid talk about naive stick with films of this kind of genre from the eighties when they had more of an idea
<START> the film starts with promise because there is more interaction between <UNK> and <UNK> but as the film progresses the two boys have fewer scenes together this slows the pace considerably <UNK> <UNK> thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes when he is left behind on the <UNK> his fear and <UNK> are <UNK> and his tears are truly heartbreaking when he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not watching a children's birthday party through a <UNK> fence is another moving moment as another reviewer mentioned i was also worried about the big dog <UNK> on chicken bones once <UNK> and <UNK> are in marshall home <UNK> tends to interact mainly with the adults and the chemistry of the children is essentially lost br br the old south <UNK> <UNK> type setting really doesn't do much for the plot except allow the children to be out of doors a great deal ralph morgan is the most engaging adult but then the other roles really don't have much substance to them louise <UNK> manages some funny moments with a <UNK> soldier towards the end br br the villains aren't really villainous enough and the lovers not intense enough yet i do think it's worth viewing if you're an our gang <UNK> if for no other reason that the odd curiosity of the whole piece i give it seven stars because while not a great movie it kept me engaged the whole time and curious as to what would happen next
<START> the movie was actually not that bad especially plot wise but the and hairy actor they chose for the leading role was a little <UNK> in the acting department i would have chosen someone else the idea of going to america was very ingenious and the main character questioning everything that he'd ever known made him somewhat likable but not very much so when there's a <UNK> blob for a leading actor br br the storyline was interesting it brings about the question of how the subject of <UNK> will be handled in the future certainly <UNK> wouldn't be allowed for the purposes in the movie but it's still a valid argument even for today <UNK> are still people right br br the movie wasn't particularly special but it still is a lot better than some of the cheese released during the 70s let us not forget the giant spider invasion i give it a 4 since it didn't totally stink but the mst3k version makes this movie a 10 i still like dr super mario you'll like this movie but it won't be your favorite
<START> this is clive <UNK> masterpiece in my opinion the movie has a great storyline and some amazing make up and effects the one thing i would love to see happen is a sequel the movie was set up for a sequel and with improved technology the second movie could be incredible david <UNK> must appear in a sequel as well as craig <UNK> but this particular movie was a great original creative and entertaining idea and i could watch it over and over again <UNK> was perfect in this movie and <UNK> added an interesting spice to the film
<START> may have known what he was doing when he made but the rest of us can just sit back in and confusion trying to figure out what that purpose might have been br br the <UNK> plot involves a young african singer who's planning on leaving her unemployed husband to find work in the city but far more of the screen time is taken up with what the <UNK> for the film describe as a mock trial against key financial <UNK> dealing with the overwhelming economic <UNK> of africa that's all well and good i suppose but when the arguments and ideas are put forth in as <UNK> and <UNK> a way as they are here they lose both force and impact put another way if the director had found the means to actually <UNK> issues such as the <UNK> effect of <UNK> on the african people and the problem of african debt into anything even remotely resembling a compelling storyline the film might have achieved the intellectual and emotional <UNK> it now so clearly lacks br br the topics the movie is dealing with may be relevant and important but trying to pass off what amounts to two hours worth of <UNK> as an actual honest to god movie is not likely to garner much of an audience for one's message
<START> i happened to leave hbo on last night following six feet under what ran next has left me speechless what an incredible piece of work i don't just recommend this i <UNK> that you see this it's better than anything hollywood could ever ruin i just hope they never get their hands on it
<START> hi there i watched the first part when it came out and i don't remember having left such a bad impression on me as this one br br first the animation is choppy wooden not worked on lacks i understand the drawing style was to be of some kind but it could be done with the usual disney <UNK> see tarzan to see what i mean if i didn't see the disney <UNK> in the beginning i would never say it was a disney movie br br second the plot was more like a pc game style like a good old quest not that it was bad but it lacked a story that <UNK> the viewer to the characters and their goals it was at least the film was meant for children but this was <UNK> to childish at times br br third the music i would say it was <UNK> but it just fits the whole scene with the plot and animation br br overall i think this was some kind of an amusement just by the way kind of project by several apprentice animators just to fill in the count for disney movies sorry to hear that from myself a big disney lover
<START> it's a bit unnerving when a studio <UNK> to screen a film for the press before it goes into wide release that many movies suck is no surprise but when a studio itself admits as much ahead of time the process of movie going becomes a passion play of sorts consider it an early christmas gift from hollywood then that <UNK> <UNK> isn't nearly the <UNK> to taste and decency one might expect given the above though ultimately overwhelmed by its flaws it at least has sort of an idea with which to toy around too bad director <UNK> <UNK> seems to have little clue how to <UNK> it all br br it's the future there's been a plague there is a <UNK> and there are rebels the latter are known as the and far from being a cult of <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they're into attempts to <UNK> the former called the regime the regime is occasionally mean to the <UNK> which is more than <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and her pals can stand through some sort of <UNK> virtual reality technology the receive orders from their dear leader frances a mystical <UNK> type who appears to have been cross <UNK> with a <UNK> it falls to <UNK> to <UNK> on some form fitting futuristic <UNK> get ups to carry out the high orders which are of course some version of destroy the regime having years earlier watched her sister get <UNK> by the she needs little convincing br br not surprisingly things get complicated the might not be quite what they seem and <UNK> herself might have an unexpected history with them though occasionally muddled the film's central <UNK> of which i won't reveal more contains some neat notions about the nature of human existence and survival there's room for much more examination of which the film doesn't take advantage but the ideas are there at least the big problems of <UNK> <UNK> are technical <UNK> has made the <UNK> decision to film nearly all the action so close that we can rarely follow what's going on to make matters worse it's edited in a <UNK> of jump cuts that leave us completely lost the result is some serious <UNK> <UNK> that takes over the film <UNK> <UNK> 's aesthetic is one of <UNK> costume oddly <UNK> architecture and <UNK> characters much of the action occurs in <UNK> open spaces that beg for some <UNK> long shots that might convey the grace and <UNK> implied by the above instead we get split seconds of flying limbs breaking glass and accompanying sound effects br br there is a pretty good movie trying to get out of the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> put this stuff in the hands of the <UNK> brothers say and the results could be quite different as it is though i felt like <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> pushing me away from a movie i wanted to enjoy this film is <UNK> to its own strengths like a <UNK> poker player dealt a royal <UNK> it somehow finds a way to lose in spite of its potential
<START> this movie is so cool it told me to enjoy every moment in life to its i think that bonnie hunt jerry maguire writes well and i am so happy that she gave aging actors opportunity to have such big roles in the movie that is really neat in a society that <UNK> wealth health and youth it was nice to see a movie about normal people the movie reminded me a lot of while you were sleeping which i really love if you don't like this movie you should work on your sensitivity skills br br favorite quotes <UNK> <UNK> i'm just saying for safety don't <UNK> your legs because then you definitely won't let it go too far grace <UNK> <UNK> it's a first date <UNK> <UNK> i married a first date i'm sure you plan on being level headed but once you're in the moment the male brain seems i don't know everything they say suddenly seems brilliant hairy legs are your only link to reality favorite scenes <UNK> good will hunting riding her bike all the scenes in the garden the conversation and <UNK> among the grandpa and friends in the restaurant please do not miss this movie it will warm up your heart
<START> if i could rate it a zero i would coming from someone who likes shock exploitation films of the time and waters overall i must say this is useless br br it does nothing serves nothing an idiot with a camera and a urge to prove his <UNK> by against social standards is all this comes off as br br its entirely amateur both in principle and execution it doesn't have a point its for the sake of disgusting obscene with the wit of a <UNK> its useless br br someone said waters was probably <UNK> over all the bad press and disgust others gave with this film but why if i made a short film depicting a man in a bathroom taking a sh t for ten minutes straight surely it would receive the same but why would i be proud or chuckle at that br br would it be because i am so <UNK> that i have to resort to this so i can say ha take that censors and mainstream im so rebellious ill do whatever i want and film it no br br waters shouldn't be proud of this mess fans of waters shouldn't watch it its useless that is without any use br br its doesn't even fit under the <UNK> of art for arts sake br br to like or defend this movie is to defend something that was designed <UNK> as being anti culture to be pushed for the mainstream audience in modern terms this film is the hot topic of films br br useless and <UNK> a <UNK> film that demands it be acknowledged as rebellion
<START> i finished watching mandy lane about an hour ago and felt the urge to come straight home and get up here to warn anyone that's about to spend money on the dvd don't br br the supporting characters are shallow the failure of acting is higher than that of matthew <UNK> movies and up until the end twist the plot is everything but obvious in nine out of ten you can see the next scene coming 5 minutes before it starts the whole movie is more or less without motive or message and the half way revealing of the murderer just plain out kills what little interest you might have left at that point what could have saved this shallow tedious movie is some decent splatter or at least gore worthy of the genre slasher it fails there as well br br if you need a background movie to a party that you can jump in and out of without missing anything i recommend buying all the boys love mandy lane br br if you're looking to sit down and actually concentrate your eyes on the screen for more than 15 seconds i don't
<START> <UNK> succeeds in this beautifully done film the pace matches the story the direction is superb and the casting acting is perfect the only draw back are one or two slight editing errors i love film and i am a <UNK> <UNK>
