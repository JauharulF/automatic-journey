<START> what a shocker for starters i couldn't stand the constant screaming and <UNK> <UNK> all the time it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying the jerky camera movements were also annoying the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot and then there's the ending i'm still not really sure what to make of it i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid br br the case had a couple of those little award winner nominations symbols on it so i figured it couldn't be too bad i was wrong if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf
<START> what i find remarkable about this terrific film is that altman the crazy and wild guy that he is took the novel that cold day in the park and the sandy dennis character was originally a male in the book he was a mentally whacked out isolated gay who looked out of his apartment window when he spotted the hustler it is strange that altman fans aren't aware of how clever he was to change the sex of the main character thereby avoiding the <UNK> erotic <UNK> of gay life in the 60's and actually making <UNK> <UNK> kind of madness work even better in the <UNK> if you see the film again it will be evident how <UNK> the altman mind works
<START> one of the worst movies i've ever seen yes i know i'm not the target audience target audience is females either college age or middle aged or any aged i guess i'm none of these so the makers don't mind if i don't like it but that won't excuse the fact that the dialogue and the plot are horrible the main character <UNK> goes on a journey to europe to find out what happened to her sister faith who committed suicide <UNK> is an inane character that i hope no one <UNK> with faith is also a character with very little believability wolf is the only person who seems to be somewhat reasonable as i said the dialogue is boring and uninteresting the plot does completely stupid things at times the absolute worst is that <UNK> and <UNK> father is an artist but his paintings are completely dreadful there is nothing new interesting or refreshing in this movie if your a guy you will pray for the ending if your a chick you might be able to sit through it but you will be <UNK>
<START> this movie illustrates like no other the state of the australian film industry and everything that's holding it back br br awesome talent outstanding performances particularly by victoria hill but a let down in practically every other way br br an adaptation of sorts it brought nothing new to <UNK> no setting it in present day australia is not enough and essentially completely failed to justify its existence apart from let's face it completely unnecessarily paying homage to the original work if there's one body of work that has been done and done and done and done it's shakespeare's so any adaptation if it's not to be a self indulgent and pointless exercise needs to at least bring some new interpretation to the work br br and that's what this <UNK> fails to do as it was done this film has no contemporary relevance whatsoever it's the same piece that we have seen countless too many times before except with guns and in different outfits br br apart from the fundamental <UNK> no other way to put it of keeping the original <UNK> dialogue one of the more moments of the movie is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end during which i completely tuned out even though i was looking at the screen i never thought i had a short attention span but there you go br br i suppose the movie succeeds on its own very limited terms but as australia continues to produce world class acting talent its movie makers need to stop being proud of <UNK> on limited terms and actually set high enough standards to show that they respect for the kind of acting talent they work with br br a shame an absolute shame
<START> on top of the fact that is a complete <UNK> bag and his cons are unimaginative his schemes require way to much <UNK> to make any of his <UNK> worth while without giving away any spoilers as if it matters with this piece of crap his cons are such a <UNK> because it takes the effort of days and days of planning and the use of multiple <UNK> and an entire camera crew etc just to <UNK> someone into a service that would cost less than a hundred bucks in addition if you read in the credits they re stage some of the phone calls etc because they don't pan out the whole concept of this show is <UNK> because all of his cons have the cost in both the crew and the effort of ten times the actual cost of the service he is trying to get for free what is the con
<START> while i agree completely with below about mary <UNK> <UNK> a milk bag out on tv the rest of the show is fantastic phil <UNK> was great in a way teaching the <UNK> the ins and outs <UNK> a nut but in a good way you never know what self humor he's going to come up with next as for the game play it's entertaining filled with witty banter and great for any <UNK> that may have even a passing an interest in the game too bad it isn't on anymore i just checked the schedule all the way to august and it doesn't appear to be <UNK> for any time in the future bad bravo you deserve a beating
<START> <UNK> and we all thought joan crawford was the horror <UNK> <UNK> well laura hope as mom in this <UNK> 4 character film delivers and cops the goods in this cracker of a marital <UNK> <UNK> the silver <UNK> is a genuinely sensational pre code drama from rko made in 1932 released in from a <UNK> play so astonishing frank and honest is each startling verbal exchange between one son's wife along with the other's fiancé as these two younger girls together go to war <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the clearly incestuous of mom towards her hunky <UNK> son played by <UNK> joel and her younger son <UNK> by delicate and beautiful 25 year old actor eric <UNK> i would think this film played to many howling <UNK> audiences in huge theaters in 1933 and offers viewers even in 2005 a very <UNK> melodrama <UNK> by <UNK> dialog not afraid to call mother exactly as she is this film would have been impossible to make after the censorship code came in after 1934 other viewer comments on the imdb support my reaction and you will find almost everyone lucky enough to see and tape the silver <UNK> will agree it is an unforgettable and <UNK> script in a superbly produced film it would have played like the virginia wolf of 1932 laura hope must have <UNK> the sound stage at rko for this role of a lifetime even more than her <UNK> turn in <UNK> irene dunne is as gorgeous and casual and believable as ever fighting for her husband yet again and it is well worth seeing the <UNK> made in <UNK> as a companion piece to the silver <UNK> joel is certainly in the same league as cary grant and randolph scott in the handsome and lovable stakes i had never seen eric <UNK> in a real acting role before he played the leg <UNK> in the hospital horror scene in <UNK> and here he is startling and youthful with an excellent role as robert the younger and more sensitive son some verbal <UNK> <UNK> at him again would not get past the code office if made later this is a really good film and if the viewer <UNK> some of the of its time and <UNK> in for a <UNK> match of <UNK> <UNK> for a 1932 movie you will be well rewarded at first i thought some of the throat <UNK> melodrama of mother was dated until i realized it was a set up of the excellent screenplay to make the viewer laugh at her as though she is a weak little old lady not but nor are the other two women in this <UNK> play on film hence the fantastic <UNK> dialog that ocean liner seen in reel one is the <UNK> the monster ship the us won from the germans in <UNK> that was so huge and <UNK> that <UNK> were nervous <UNK> trying to <UNK> with it upon the atlantic it is infamous for <UNK> <UNK> up a <UNK> wave in a storm and shot over the <UNK> at such an angle the spine along the bottom <UNK> and the ship split <UNK> between the it <UNK> to <UNK> with <UNK> steel <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> holes and mentally <UNK> crew and passengers it was <UNK> in <UNK> after being cursed and plagued with horror mechanical problems all its existence not such a war prize after all br br anyway the dialog in the silver <UNK> is enough excitement for one night <UNK> mother the doctor said there was nothing wrong with you in fact he said it would take a stick of dynamite to kill you
<START> there is little more that i would like to say about this movie than it really can touch your heart if you let it sure it's surrounded by all the stereotypical hollywood stuff but i found myself actually <UNK> in this movie and very interested in the outcome i'd recommend it to all you <UNK> out there in a second
<START> this movie was astonishing how good it was the plot is extraordinary and the acting spectacular at first i thought this wasn't going to be that great because of a summary but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie it struck me that i was dead wrong i literally cried about four or five times in this movie and despite this i must've watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week no the song scenes were not as awesome as they could've been but the plot is what really gets you american or i would recommend this to anyone and i have now i guarantee that after seeing this one you'll get the best out of it and its plot i hope you feel the same and write a rave review too
<START> i could have liked this if i didn't like diane <UNK> br br didn't really capture <UNK> unique visual aesthetic as stanley kubrick did in the <UNK> with the twin girls in the <UNK> a direct homage to one of <UNK> most famous photos and one with haunting qualities none of this movies images have and certainly none of her character <UNK> <UNK> thin and jewish not <UNK> queen kidman or life save some very superficial similarities she was a fashion who later photographed freaks and <UNK> among many things this film focused on the freak as her symbol for artistic and personal <UNK> in a really shallow and predictable fashion outside of that it might have been an interesting movie about middle class fetish but i was too annoyed to care br br perhaps if <UNK> name had been left off this might have been less annoying but had it not had her name in the title there would have been nothing to make me interested in seeing in this in the first place a letdown from secretary
<START> ever went on youtube well the definite question to that is yes do you see the <UNK> of and <UNK> <UNK> no definite answer br br many people think is a dull and idiotic program and others think it's the best program on the face of the earth i have seen many of the loads of reviews <UNK> in the head and some giving it a <UNK> of <UNK> in my opinion is for the <UNK> but the show is just awful br br if you did not read the last review here are reasons 1 8 1 <UNK> 2 <UNK> up drama 3 everything is silly <UNK> truck for example 4 <UNK> thinks she's nice but she's mean 5 anyone over the drinking age is stupid 6 sam is <UNK> but strong 7 no real companies 8 mean teachers br br 9 the just look on the to understand what i mean 10 the also <UNK> personal information 11 almost every famous thing is insulted insults the japanese race <UNK> and man to name a few 12 there are too many jokes <UNK> obsession of meat freddy's computer pulling his shirt off etc 13 the video games based off the show suck 14 freddy has a lack of <UNK> why it's getting unoriginal 15 the show is targeted towards a female audience i also hate shows directed to a male audiences too so i prefer to be for both <UNK> 16 the words and no 17 the <UNK> of laugh tracks br br part 3 coming in early spring just in time for spring break
<START> this was one of the most <UNK> meaningless and non peaceful of the films i have ever seen the representation of the other of the <UNK> was racist <UNK> and unfair for one the song played on e car radio when pulled up alongside a very right wing israeli driver was i put a spell on you by <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> style is quite <UNK> but it was released on an israeli <UNK> cd and i have even heard it on the radio in israel many israeli songs as well as architecture <UNK> and <UNK> are influenced by <UNK> culture and there is no reason an israeli jew would be offended or <UNK> by a nearby car playing that song the way e s appears so calm and <UNK> with his <UNK> and cool <UNK> via a long still shot is meant to force the viewer into seeing the jew as <UNK> and racist and e s as noble and br br i have traveled all over israel and i have never seen an <UNK> poster since service is mandatory but in the film not only is there a <UNK> poster but it depicts a stereotypical image of an arab terrorist and the words want to shoot this is an extremely inaccurate depiction of the mentality of the majority of <UNK> as well as israeli soldiers and such an <UNK> wouldn't even exist on a random israeli highway in including it the director aims to convince the audience that israel is a society of anti arab <UNK> hell bent on murder br br the ninja scene was gratuitous and needlessly violent a hollywood style action scene involving israeli soldiers shooting <UNK> would be just as <UNK> in an israeli directed film as the ninja scene should have been but for some reason images of an unrealistic non comic and violent scenario manage to <UNK> applause from the audience since the director has <UNK> the israeli side so much beforehand that any shot of israeli soldiers being killed would be welcome the director shows absolutely no attempt at building bridges portraying the other as human or working towards peace violence is made to be the only solution this is <UNK> by scenes of exploding tanks falling guard towers and other random acts of destruction one of my best friends serves in the israeli military and the targets in firing <UNK> are never arab women dressed in black or any other quasi <UNK> on <UNK> soldiers at <UNK> are <UNK> not to fire at the head of an approaching palestinian unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger the method according to my friend is to provide a warning shout fire into the air or around the area and then if all else fails shoot in the leg and then <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> a woman in the head as shown in the film is not the proper <UNK> br br besides these inaccuracies the directing style was also poor <UNK> became <UNK> and no longer captivating symbols such as the balloon with drawn on it are forced outside any plot structure or effective <UNK> in the setting the balloon is <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and it is created for no reason by e s the <UNK> being checked for <UNK> by israeli soldiers followed by subsequent israeli <UNK> flying past the <UNK> is an overly overt claim of an israeli double standard by the director the attempt by the director to show life in <UNK> as dreary and pointless is done with <UNK> showing the routines of random people over and over again even with a slight change each time and <UNK> that not one member of the cast ever smiles and is <UNK> in dialogue almost screams out the purpose of such scenes the <UNK> of life without allowing much room for personal interpretation by <UNK> one section of the movie daily life in <UNK> with the second section the <UNK> between and israel the director subtly blames this <UNK> on israel but never provides any direct evidence as to why such blame can be properly <UNK> br br i spent hours trying to figure out why music ended abruptly and began abruptly and why many modern fashion show like and metal action tracks were included in the score i still cannot come up with an answer i felt that the music was out of place in this film the contrast between more silent scenes and intense scenes was actually annoying and not affecting or thought provoking i can understand if the director intended for the music to provide some comic aspect to certain scenes but i found that there was nothing comic to be found in israeli soldiers shooting at targets or fighting a ninja or a woman having to suffer another walk through a <UNK> albeit <UNK> in fact i was tempted to close my ears during intense scenes and annoyed by the lack of a score during quiet scenes whatever the director's intent it provided only an <UNK> throughout the film br br this film has no legitimate political message because it provides an inaccurate and extreme representation of the other and <UNK> to actually address any issues it is a propaganda film because the director <UNK> various symbols styles and scenes to draw sympathy for the palestinian side while displaying the israeli side as cruel and <UNK> without exception the vibrant atmosphere of an action packed hollywood scene or of intense music is displayed in every act of violence by <UNK> against <UNK> such that the almost inevitably positive and thrilled feelings the music and cinematography <UNK> from the audience are directed to one side there is no thought reflection or <UNK> of the understanding of the conflict by the audience emotions are simply pulled to one side and kept there in a good vs bad cliché scenario i believe this film lacked the depth quality and power of other palestinian films such as paradise now and wedding in the <UNK>
<START> my husband dragged me to this film as i had no interest in seeing some anime cartoon i was absolutely delighted by the simple story and amazing animation in a digital world where effects are computer generated it was refreshing to see gorgeous imaginative hand drawn animation the world of and is a vivid <UNK> <UNK> with minimal reality i haven't seen animation like this since i was a child and it is wonderful to see it endure and succeed br br the actors <UNK> the voices in the english version were fabulous the length of the movie was perfect especially for children who tend to get <UNK> in films overall a delightful experience worth the very expensive ticket <UNK> we have nowadays
<START> <UNK> <UNK> time to kill by is a bit of a strange film but it's good in it's own way br br i won't bother with a summary of the plot most that i've read gives the wrong impression and makes me believe that most people who wrote those didn't really understand the film and you need to understand it to some level even if you cannot describe for yourself what it's actually about this film is strange in a once upon a time in america way only shorter br br many <UNK> stars whatever that may mean have played in lesser known italian productions it's known that many actors who are past their prime or slowly rising to it do this cage was not yet a real star when this was made i'm not a fan of him he's very good in some roles raising arizona bringing out the dead and weak when he plays the hero i don't really know what to think of him in this one but he sure doesn't portray the typical hero main character this film could have done without him but the fact that he starred may be the only reason this one ever made it to dvd br br the supporting cast is good not one of them looks fake and they act as if they are really there solid support br br i have seen 3 films by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and this one and i think he is one of the greater directors of this time unfortunately nobody knows him this movie was his last in a long time a break of 19 years i think that this movie might have failed at the office but from the way it is done i think that for it was a personal project that he really liked br br the production is great it's always enough the dusty army camps the cities and the magnificent landscape all play a great part it all feels very real in some scenes you can almost feel the heat the sound itself is nothing special but the music by <UNK> <UNK> is very good it's not a piece that you will <UNK> when in the shower but it sure works great br br so this movie looks feels and sounds just right it doesn't serve the lessons learned from it on a golden <UNK> but that may be the biggest difference between hollywood and euro cinema all around it might sound strange to give it an 8 and not recommend it to people but that is what i do if you are looking for action avoid this one if you are looking for a well made apocalypse now in a different time and setting but with a bit of similar journey into a <UNK> of <UNK> sorry if this sound corny but i don't know what else to call it you just might enjoy this one a lot
<START> i agree with most of mr <UNK> comments and i just want to ad a couple of <UNK> this film the <UNK> is criminally neglected in its current form for that matter so is <UNK> the <UNK> isn't a bonus feature it's tacked on as a chapter in <UNK> even though it's made very clear that this is a separate movie it should have been treated as such by the <UNK> and while i m at it <UNK> needs some of that same respect and cleaning up as well i got the feeling the decision to put the <UNK> on there went something like this br br dude a we just transferred <UNK> to dvd but it comes up about 20 minutes short we need to put something on there that won't cost much money can you believe film critics want to be paid to talk about films dude b not to worry i have this little animation <UNK> that's been sitting in my <UNK> just go ahead and throw it on as an additional chapter dude a you're awesome dude b the <UNK> of the <UNK> is great and there's no need for me to repeat what mr <UNK> done so well however this thing needs some major cleaning and <UNK> especially the audio the plot comes through in the dialogue and in my copy there were so many <UNK> pops and places where the sound just dropped right off i would have had no idea what the dog was going after without having read the box no amount of volume was going to make the words more understandable it just brought up the and made the <UNK> and pops <UNK> br br bottom line is <UNK> films need to be put into a <UNK> collection <UNK> up up liner notes and the whole nine <UNK> in other words they need to be 9 out of 10 for the movie not the product which would get only a 5
<START> 8 points for take on probably what really kinda maybe more what it was like back then american indians probably stole more than killed who really knows nice slower odd pursuit means it has a pace and interesting and unique thankfully not another mindless shoot em up i thought this would suck at first i wound up getting wrapped up nice treasure good job i have hopes nobody <UNK> this film when the entire movie unfolds you have many unique twists impossible to determine what will be next the characters are human and have either honor or not passion or not forgiveness or not wound up loving the white horse the indian sheen even the damned desert all good
<START> interesting and short television movie describes some of the <UNK> surrounding jay <UNK> replacing carson as host of the tonight show film is currently very <UNK> given the public drama surrounding conan o'brien and jay leno br br the film does a good job of <UNK> <UNK> interest in the events and showing some of the concerns of the particularly of the nbc executives the portrayal of was particularly compelling and interesting i thought br br still many of the characters were only very briefly <UNK> or touched upon and some of the acting seemed <UNK> nevertheless an interesting story
<START> the murder of the red in <UNK> was a long way from one of the most horrendous things ever done in the scottish war of independence and fights and killing in <UNK> wasn't unusual at all not that much later robert wife daughter two of his sisters were captured during a fight in a church in which people were killed and comparing it to the massacre of <UNK> in which the english slaughtered at least <UNK> non <UNK> some yes in <UNK> is ridiculous br br that said this is not a well made movie it is slightly <UNK> to the absolutely ridiculous <UNK> representation of robert bruce in braveheart whatever bruce was it wasn't a <UNK> br br too bad that they didn't do a better job of this because someone should make a really good movie of a war that is so amazing that it sounds like something someone made up going from complete defeat at the battle of to a secret return from hiding to a long <UNK> war to this isn't it though poorly made and to a large extent poorly written and acted too bad
<START> i like the film it´s the best pirate movie i watched <UNK> forget silly errol flynn stuff and pirates of the <UNK> this movie is wonderful <UNK> i compare it with johnny guitar at the sea side but 3 years earlier two women fighting for a man where mad love might lead one br br the character of the female anti heroine anne <UNK> is superb acting without compromise like a child lost alone on her search for a own female identity in a real world <UNK> a quite strange movie hero not a funny pirate as most of her companions in this genre not making jokes all the time fighting for the poor and good and only killing the stupid spanish or british soldiers or better sly <UNK> but <UNK> murdering all the poor prisoners of war after she captured a ship look careful at this at the start of the movie <UNK> primitive she <UNK> even read she is and she an alcoholic she <UNK> all her friends as consequence of her <UNK> and <UNK> wearing <UNK> most of the film this film shows a pirate hero a little bit as he or in this case she but there has been a female anne <UNK> anne might have been in brutal reality br br the film is quite short and the story is told in a breathtaking manner certainly a film from the 1950s has no exciting special effects for present time viewers the ships swim very obvious in a bath tube but this real drama about love that kills trust betrayal revenge hatred and sacrifice drives one crazy maybe anne is even supposed to be <UNK> and jesus from <UNK> in one person being betrayed by her friend the french as jesus after being disappointed by the friend delivering him to a death penalty as <UNK> than getting <UNK> about this like <UNK> who commits suicide according to the <UNK> of matthew and in the end <UNK> herself for the rescue of the beloved enemy as jesus but even if you are not interested in this philosophical questions of guilt and <UNK> the film brings a lot of cheap action as sword fights and burning plastic ships for a very short one and a half hour
<START> i kind of like <UNK> so i was curious br br but watching a home production with somebody <UNK> friends and family with a decent camera and a sound guy just isn't good film making br br writing direction acting and editing is abysmal at best but i sat through half of it and why br br this film gives perfect examples of what not to do it is a film <UNK> dream of what to avoid at every stage of the process <UNK> it into film school all over the joint br br so <UNK> <UNK> now i know jackass is for real cause you ain't looking to win an oscar dude
<START> i watched this out of curiosity i enjoyed stargate <UNK> and i've watched many of the other tv shows and movies that the principal characters have worked on br br my expectations weren't high so i was surprised to be so <UNK> disappointed br br the acting throughout is appalling and the script is worse br br zero research into the bad science that is <UNK> throughout the movie or into martial arts which several cast members engage in throughout the movie despite clearly having no martial arts training <UNK> <UNK> does not a warrior make training makes the already implausible plot even less credible the same weapon carried by michael <UNK> when shot at the side of a mountain causes extreme damage but when shot <UNK> at the wall made of wicker creates a small fireworks effect without <UNK> the wicker structure ok i suppose michael <UNK> fans will be <UNK> to seeing that in stargate <UNK> where a staff weapon creates either a surface burn on a main character or <UNK> a hole in a section of castle wall as required but still a bad cgi snake <UNK> eats one of the faithful in the way a dog would eat snakes just don't behave like that br br the basic premise of an <UNK> warrior cult on a distant planet is silly at best <UNK> societies have always been based on a lack of understanding that men are required in the process of <UNK> the species for instance the who didn't figure out the role of men in sexual <UNK> until the <UNK> century at which time the balance of power moved from the women to the men they carry technological weapons and demonstrate some knowledge of science particularly of medicine so the idea that a <UNK> society could exist with this level of scientific knowledge is based purely on the original author's wet dream of course the few references to stellar science made in this movie demonstrate that the author knew nothing about that either except for a few <UNK> that he must have heard in other movies still it could have been done better like in 1965 for instance which showed <UNK> society with a certain <UNK> far more <UNK> and even after 45 years it seems <UNK> than this <UNK> exercise in stupidity <UNK> a few women around in <UNK> <UNK> and spitting out their lines like a kiddie looking for a fight in a nightclub come on then i'll do ya style seems to be over <UNK> the <UNK> of a <UNK> culture br br the cultural references are so simple <UNK> <UNK> the snake <UNK> pretty much sums it all up even the <UNK> hamlet shows more cultural variation br br there is nothing clever thought provoking interesting visually exciting or remotely entertaining about this movie the soundtrack is of similar quality br br i can only assume that the few overly <UNK> positive reviews this movie has received are from <UNK> michael <UNK> fans who will give a thumbs up to anything he's involved in don't be fooled low budgets are not a reason for a film to fail cheap b movies can be brilliant this isn't one of them and there's no reason to <UNK> this movie on yourself
<START> fans of euro horror flicks video dvd store movie madness has a whole section devoted to this genre can't afford to miss sergio <UNK> gut <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> called in the united states here's the <UNK> some <UNK> survivors land on an <UNK> <UNK> island in the island is inhabited by a <UNK> a scientist joseph <UNK> and his daughter barbara bach sure enough it turns out that the <UNK> is making the scientist create a race of fish men and while the fish men remain calm as long as they can drink their <UNK> they get nasty otherwise br br this movie is sort of a mixture of genres euro horror <UNK> voodoo and maybe a little bit of the island of dr <UNK> but it's mostly an excuse to have the fish men <UNK> <UNK> ya gotta love that i wouldn't be surprised if the euro horror genre gave quentin tarantino some of his ideas for <UNK> after all the european horror directors have no <UNK> about what they show this is one that you're sure to like br br so joseph <UNK> is the only cast member from an alfred hitchcock movie i mean shadow of a doubt who later co starred with <UNK> <UNK> soon to be wife and audrey <UNK> ex by whom i mean mel <UNK> in an italian horror flick the things that we see in life
<START> a lot of people are <UNK> this film for the presence of paris hilton but this is not a fair reason to object to the movie the reality is that paris has a fairly minimal part she spends the vast majority of the movie off screen the film also makes fun of her on several occasions usually involving a camera and at least once in night vision for those who enjoy paris stage presence this may be a movie to see at home when its released on video because at the screening i was at we all laughed at her <UNK> through the movie and she is portrayed as a woman of questionable values br br the movie itself was pretty good unlike the recent <UNK> of weak horror flicks it has everything a good horror should a creepy villain excessive violence acts which make that average person cringe this movie hit all the <UNK> it is definitely worth a watch
<START> there are a limited number of fans for movies in the world that would love a particular genre to go to the depths that this crew has done to bring to life something that the very writer of the original film had up to this point never achieved this is a wonderful exploration of the real dedication and love it takes to reach towards a potentially very successful cult film br br originally with the <UNK> from alex cox this crew began producing the sequel of one of his movies in absolute true punk fashion their goal simply being to fully capture the atmosphere as it should be for a complete tribute to the original <UNK> man film br br this is a great tale of dedication and the <UNK> that can occur along the path to wonderful movie making a truly entertaining tale and a guaranteed learning experience for the viewer
<START> low budget mystery a shot <UNK> out of the dark and a woman is seen running from that direction a young architect jimmy <UNK> chick chandler discovers a dead body that goes missing the woman in a hurry mary june clyde is linked to the death scene but it is <UNK> that has to try and solve the case to avoid serious suspicion suspects are six shop owners in the <UNK> of the crime scene all the atmosphere of film noir but not quite the real thing this flick <UNK> just enough to be a decent low budget mystery drama and is a nice little escape other players include george <UNK> michael <UNK> wallace and rebel randall
<START> even though i saw this film when i was very young i already knew the story of wild the thief taker and shepherd who <UNK> escaped from <UNK> prison br br apart from the liberty taken right at the end the film more or less <UNK> follows the true story the temptation to bend the facts which is the hallmark of so many so called historical films is <UNK> in this film and the film makers must be praised for that br br of the performances there is <UNK> a poor performance and tommy steele is <UNK> cast also good is stanley baker as the thief taker and alan is good as always br br because the film sticks to the facts it makes it suitable to be watched by all the family
<START> red dust is both well acted and well made but what the movie is about i think will bore many viewers as it did to me there was a film that was out earlier called in my country with sam jackson and it was not that well received and both films were about nearly the same exact thing i do think red dust was better because of the more interesting performances especially by future oscar winner but the plot is just to lacking it starts off pretty strong but then the film hits the viewers with countless un interesting court room sessions this could have been a great film if the writing was not so lacking but see if for the performances
<START> first i have to say that i really love <UNK> <UNK> and have always had respect for <UNK> <UNK> but nothing could save this train wreck of a movie <UNK> does not even appear till much later in the movie and the acting from everyone is just terrible the script is all over the place the dialog is wooden the action is laughable and the plot could be summed up on a dirty cocktail <UNK> i really wanted to find something redeeming in this movie but found myself holding my hands over my eyes shaking my head and repeating over and over to myself oh <UNK> why why if you are a fan of <UNK> or <UNK> please don't watch this movie it will only make you sad for them
<START> this movie was disappointing for at least one of two reasons the suspense created disappeared because of horrible acting or lack of direction from the director i don't know it was like a tasty bubble <UNK> that seemed to run out of flavor yet you continue to chew on it because it once <UNK> great like most thrillers the <UNK> had promise yet failed to deliver when it had me bright eyed and ready to turn the volume down i was watching the movie alone in the dark this so called thriller simply came apart like it was made of <UNK> <UNK> into something else it simply ran out of gas and left me staring at a made for tv like style movie with one exception it was probably rated r
<START> my only problem with the curse of the were rabbit is that the movie does not take the time to properly introduce wallace and <UNK> to those not familiar with <UNK> short films strangely a close <UNK> manages to do this with a lot less time to spare still i loved seeing the boys back in action and loved all the new characters human and otherwise i especially loved ralph <UNK> voice as the scheming victor <UNK> it is also interesting to see the series on the large screen the <UNK> with the clay characters really stands out it's a hoot and great for the whole family i buy very few dvds but i have every wallace and <UNK> and will happily add this one
<START> it's very true that this film defies convention by not spelling out the plot for the viewer while some may have a problem with having to figure it out for themselves i embrace for its <UNK> there is a plot it's just that it may not be immediately accessible to a lazy viewer this is a film that invites numerous interpretations as all great art does however this film is also very entertaining making it a rare film experience it's simultaneously provocative and fun
<START> like most sports movies which have come out in the past this movie is similar in respects that it is based on fact what sets this movie apart is that its about a <UNK> team a sport that not too many americans are familiar with set that aside this movie is very rewarding piece of film noir it reminds me of we are marshall but with a smaller budget and an independent movie feel its a fine effort by director ryan little to bring us a story about a rebellious teen played by sean <UNK> never back down as rick <UNK> that finds himself in an odd place both on and off the field despite a few plot lines holes this film has heart rewarding each of its viewers with good characters that we can identify with also good performances by supporting actors gary cole as coach larry <UNK> <UNK> as coach <UNK> dad i felt myself go through a lot of different emotions watching movie in the end i was left with a feeling of faith in mankind a hope for the future for my children especially if there are <UNK> out there like
<START> wow what exciting visual effects i also loved the costumes and artwork the circus and <UNK> feel to the film was sublime it just required the need for the viewer to worry about the fate of our protagonist as she is trapped in her imagination there is never a sense of peril unlike say david lynch's films which haunt every time this also draws attention to which age group this film is aimed at who would this engage br br <UNK> is obviously going to draw comparisons with <UNK> with the teen angst fantasy theme but unfortunately it doesn't really come close to delivering the same <UNK> essence the ill mother theme is never fully explained and certainly not something that you care about while <UNK> up the eye candy br br not <UNK> awful a la the cell nor as <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> a forgettable but good looking fantasy
<START> this is a very odd movie for harold lloyd at least in regard to the sweet character he played in movies throughout the 1920s and 30s instead of a nice guy he and <UNK> are con men out to rob everyone blind in a particularly successful con <UNK> pretends to have lost a very valuable ring and a bit later harold finds it as a <UNK> is also looking for the ring the ring of course is a cheap one dropped and then found by harold but the greed of the <UNK> is so great he convinces harold to say nothing and sell him the valuable ring and then they run away to enjoy their luck again and again they find until they meet up with a woman who herself is a con woman working with a guy doing fake she <UNK> a nifty con and takes all the money they stole and has a cop standing by to make sure they give her the money br br as luck would have it the two con men stumble into the <UNK> shady business when no one is home soon the lady returns and <UNK> with their minds releasing a lot of dirty tricks to <UNK> them for their wicked ways br br all around this is a completely odd and contrived film but it is also exceedingly funny as the jokes work very well and lloyd and <UNK> make an excellent team plus while creepy and strange i liked seeing <UNK> dressed like a lady
<START> i was talked into seeing this by a girlfriend john was a good guy sweet sensitive and looks great with no shirt on i thought it was a love story about both of them but it was mainly about his reactions to her letters <UNK> was a likable character at the start of the movie but once she dumped him i lost respect for her she said it <UNK> her apart being away from him and it was hard he was the one a million miles away he was killing people and the only contact he got was through her letters she didn't have it hard she had family money and he had a tour of duty i was so frustrated at the ending when he <UNK> her he was too much of a sweetheart i would have waited the 3 years and welcomed him home with open arms
<START> so some people might argue that this can't possible be the worst movie ever made and no it's not i have seen movies with weaker plots worse acting and so on br br so why do i hate this movie <UNK> <UNK> well it's basically about a man who gets kidnapped for many years and when he comes out he tries to find out who did it and why to get revenge the problem i have with this movie has nothing to do with gore or horror but br br major spoilers stop reading if you don't want to know br br our main character basically gets tricked into having sex with his own daughter and he wants to cut out his own tongue so his enemy won't tell her because she didn't know it is so <UNK> as he <UNK> on his knees like a dog in total <UNK> and why did he deserve this because many years ago he saw a brother and a sister have a tender moment in the wrong way he went on and told some people and as a result she commits suicide and <UNK> it's the brother who put our main character through all this just for that i have wondered maybe i hate this movie so much because i think his punishment is way too harsh maybe because i feel this movie doesn't <UNK> incest but somehow <UNK> it with love maybe it's because i expected something else br br end of spoilers br br believe me nobody deserves what happens to our main character in the end and i'm very serious you know how some movies just go under your skin and stay there well i felt <UNK> dirty after watching this movie and i really wish i'd never seen it it stayed with me for days and some might ask well isn't that the purpose of a good movie the ability to affect us in such ways yes it can be but this movie not only made me sick it made me feel <UNK>
<START> two redeeming qualities of this film were the <UNK> and a storyline that was hard to resist however the script the direction and some scenes were just awful i kept asking myself why such a good cast would have produced such a bad movie my only conclusion was that these actors must believe in the charity which <UNK> the plot of the movie but knew the movie was filled with flaws br br this film could have been so much better and reached a larger audience <UNK> what makes me think this is that with all of the problems of the film some scenes being painfully bad to watch i still wanted to see how the obvious conclusion would resolve itself
<START> this is a road movie at least the movie is in yellow i think that suggests a road movie i can't say much positive about the delivery it's bad acting certainly their english camera looks like it is done by a kid there's a bomb with counter and suddenly a beetle is falling from the sky since it was so cliche we actually the whole time and that was the most fun of the movie this movie should be released in america but i'm not sure you should go because that might suggest that is the quality we produce the explosions look boring basically everything is over the top everything is just too much the yellow quality the sound the babe etc find all the cliche part in other movies put them together and you have the delivery
<START> after seeing the dvd release of the blues brothers and their mention of <UNK> on <UNK> bio my boyfriend and i were hungry for more information on john belushi i had heard of <UNK> but didn't know too much about it and found it way in the back of the local rental store i understand that dan <UNK> was really p ed over this movie and i thought it was because it didn't portray them in a good light but that had nothing to do with it br br the movie starts out okay until they wheel in john's body to the <UNK> when he wakes up on the <UNK> table and decides to run for it then begins the utter <UNK> of this movie john is subjected to viewing his life and all of the turmoil he created with angel a puerto <UNK> cab driver with a wicked sense of humor <UNK> him to criticism and attempting to try to get him to cross over br br the two actors who portray john and dan look nothing even remotely close to the real actors let alone anyone else related for that matter i e <UNK> michaels making it difficult to really try to concentrate on them and how they were in real life but that is the tip of the iceberg br br i believe this was supposed to be an artsy film john constantly being tormented by drugs i e the <UNK> soap in the bathroom being cocaine in such a way that was also difficult to follow the flashbacks are choppy also making it difficult to understand br br probably the most tasteless scene was when john is literally forced to <UNK> his <UNK> and is in pain while they remove his heart to <UNK> it saying that it was <UNK> large due to drug use <UNK> yeah we get the point without the grotesque portrayal br br there are very few other actors we know of in the movie where's carrie fisher for instance they were incredibly close and jim belushi would have been a great person to show it looks very cheaply made we felt it looked as if the graphics were from the early 80s or late 70s it felt as if it was filmed in about a week and all in all didn't show the side to john at all i felt i knew a little bit more about him from watching episodes of saturday night live br br on one last note bob <UNK> comes across <UNK> by placing himself in the movie arguing with john about writing his life story for someone who was supposed to be very <UNK> concerning the bust on <UNK> his <UNK> of person could match any writer in the national <UNK> and therefore losing my interest in any of his work from this point forward br br skip this movie if you want to see more on john watch his movies see clips of dan <UNK> talking about him or hope someone has the taste to make another movie on john that goes along the lines of man on the moon which is ultimately what we were expecting i guess this was a moral kind of movie you know don't do drugs but i guess the creators of this film didn't understand that his death made a number of people like carrie fisher stop doing drugs altogether for that reason
<START> ok so my summary line is a cheap trick but the movie is full of them and it gets <UNK> praised so br br i caught this one on tv uncut as tv here shows all movies that's for you americans who might say i didn't like it because i saw a cut tv version fortunately that's only an us thing and had no idea about what it was i switched on caught the last minutes of a show and the movie began within a minute i was begging it was a comedy given the particularly ridiculous clichéd beginning yes it's a bad movie within the movie i know but what a way to try to keep the viewer interested i don't even know why i didn't switch channels and yes in fact the movie turned out to be a comedy albeit an unintentional one br br <UNK> is pretty enough but gosh what a dreadful performance while casting a <UNK> in the role is smart enough she doesn't talk so bye bye language <UNK> yet sorry <UNK> baby playing mute doesn't mean <UNK> <UNK> marx her acting is unintentionally funny in many moments just look at her when she draws an x in the air while stalked by the killer he wants to kill you it's no time to play zorro we get plenty of running upstairs stuff passing for tension as in the worst slashers and things like pulling a carpet and a bad guy shots the other ugh will hollywood ever learn yet the best worst pearl is having a guy <UNK> in a <UNK> and well i have never seen anyone being <UNK> to death in a <UNK> but i'm sure you can't see the blue cartoon <UNK> in real life do you and how about immediately <UNK> a mean looking guy because he says he's a cop and not asking him to show you his <UNK> ok so he turns out to be a real cop but still not asking for the <UNK> makes no sense plot wise we could always think the <UNK> might be phony or he might be a crooked cop screen writing 101 and how about the big twist don't tell me you didn't see that coming from 200 miles away br br i feel sorry for poor old alec guinness and his useless stock footage cameo now i think about this what's the point in giving him a mystery guest star credit in the end titles the movie's over there's no mystery anymore and everybody and their brother have identified guinness even non movie buffs will recognize the old guy from <UNK> <UNK> yet better off this way so we can pretend it's not the late great actor br br people keep comparing this to of all people hitchcock i suppose it has to be john hitchcock the <UNK> as the late sir alfred would feel embarrassed out of watching this let alone making it and this gets a 6 8 10 it's bottom 100 material but then we're talking a rating system that allows 'the lord of the rings the return of the <UNK> to appear as the third best movie ever made check top 100 so br br 2 10
<START> ron hall pulls a triple threat as he writes directs and stars in <UNK> derek washington hall is your clichéd cop on a mission who finds himself up to his neck in some nasty vampire action <UNK> away his <UNK> he <UNK> for the last vampire <UNK> no not buffy to take back the streets and <UNK> the <UNK> back to the grave br br <UNK> is a horrible film it rips off so many other films can you say blade that it never even attempts to establish it's own identity the script is non existent the action is horrible who says a <UNK> budget <UNK> creativity there is nothing even remotely interesting here you will get nothing out of this except a headache stay away at all costs
<START> i am a big fan of horror movies and know a lot of info on serial killers obviously the director of this one refused to research the film he was creating because half of the movie was fictional more than that the character of ed <UNK> was portrayed in the wrong light i did not rent the movie to worry about the deputy and his girlfriend <UNK> i rented it to watch ed <UNK> and his legendary story this movie was awful the only reason i gave it a 2 out of 10 is because the gore wasn't too bad acting horrible actors sub par movie waste of time br br a big upset all around but i wont give up my search for a good horror movie
<START> ultra <UNK> soundtrack <UNK> tries really hard very <UNK> script that flashes between past and present cheap editing saw the boom twice don't bother ultra <UNK> soundtrack <UNK> tries really hard very <UNK> script that flashes between past and present cheap editing saw the boom twice don't bother ultra <UNK> soundtrack <UNK> tries really hard very <UNK> script that flashes between past and present cheap editing saw the boom twice don't bother ultra <UNK> soundtrack <UNK> tries really hard very <UNK> script that flashes between past and present cheap editing saw the boom twice don't bother
<START> this movie is trash because out of many reasons it is based on mark book which is also trash let me must say that mark is a racist pig that is just looking for another way to get himself into the spotlight and others that right this type of trash belong in jail for the movie itself being based on the book was horrible as well the only reason that this murder case became such a big book and movie was because the guy is related thru his aunts marriage to the kennedy family and it is ridiculous that people still believe that this family somehow has the ability to make and cover up murders they are just a family and middle america needs to get over the obsession this poor guy and his family have been <UNK> by the police for years they couldn't get tommy so they went after micheal its amazing that he went to jail with all the evidence that supports that he didn't do it besides the facts that the <UNK> of limitations among other things should have kept this trial from being brought back after twenty years for the love of god don't watch this garbage
<START> i was stan in the movie dreams come true stan was the friend that worked at the factory with the main character and ended getting his arm <UNK> in the <UNK> and got carried out screaming where was the <UNK> the acting in this movie was for the most part pretty poor with mostly local actors from the fox valley <UNK> i saw the movie on the big screen it played 2 nights in 3 theaters and was something special to see yourself on the big screen i may be bias but overall i enjoyed it also the soundtrack was the band <UNK> who later became garbage my brother steve charlton was also in the movie he played the man who comes to the door on <UNK> to talk with the police
<START> i saw fame when it first came out it deals with the high school class of 1980 which was <UNK> my year of <UNK> i saw the movie in the summer between high school and college and being a performer myself it holds a special place in my heart br br the biggest criticisms of fame usually have to do with continuity and there are definitely some story lines that either are not completed or don't make sense however those problems are more than made up for by the passion and emotion of the characters and the incredible music br br i saw it again recently and was surprised that i still loved it as much as i did the first time fame is often compared to <UNK> which i don't think is fair although <UNK> has some great music and jennifer <UNK> is gorgeous i think fame is vastly superior in the development of its characters and the complexity of its stories for anyone who truly loves the arts this is a must see movie
<START> i've been studying brazilian cinema since 2004 when i stumbled onto de <UNK> city of god let me tell you something this movie is probably as good or better than city of god br br the acting cinematography and music <UNK> make this movie a unique experience i have not been to brazil yet but this movie presents the harsh reality that is <UNK> before the citizens of <UNK> <UNK> br br i recommend this movie if you enjoy good cinema this movie is disturbing and you may feel a bit <UNK> after watching it br br something you want to watch but nothing you want to go to sleep on
<START> if it is true that the movie only cost <UNK> to make it explains a lot but it doesn't explain why it has no real plot <UNK> through the movie i honestly didn't care if they made it out or not i just wanted to finish the movie and go to bed the ending was really dumb and made me wish i would have just shut the movie off and gone to bed early pretty good acting considering there wasn't much to go with if you enjoy really bad movies with horrible lighting even for a cave and bad camera work even for a cave then you'll really like this movie by the way if the boy's plane crashed in 1980 when he was about 10 years old or so how could he have forgotten how to speak and built up so much anger wouldn't he have wanted to get help from the first people he had seen even if it was 14 years later
<START> that's how burt reynolds describes this film which happens to be his best ever he plays tom <UNK> a vice detective who's on the trail of an international mobster <UNK> <UNK> and the man he's <UNK> to be the next <UNK> of georgia earl <UNK> in the novel by william <UNK> the story is more complex because the guy's running for president this is a very long movie that feels more like three hours instead of two the filming in downtown <UNK> and the <UNK> hotel sets the mood just right for the story reynolds doesn't do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy films he's very serious here especially in the beginning of the movie because he gets for a <UNK> bust that goes wrong at times though the movie plays more like a <UNK> drama than a crime film with burt trying to get close to the <UNK> woman only towards the end of the film does the violence get <UNK> up that leads to the bang bang climax just like the great jazz score in dirty harry by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> machine features an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars including <UNK> baker julie london <UNK> <UNK> buddy de franco the manhattan transfer doc sarah <UNK> and joe williams al handles the score with magic this movie has become one of the best crime dramas ever check it out br br score 8 out of 10 stars
<START> i wish they would just make a special section in the video rental stores for movies like this the section would read movies for lonely older men who like to watch young girls being naughty and wearing fetish clothes i guess <UNK> <UNK> after <UNK> <UNK> now this is establishing herself as the queen of the dirty old man genre
<START> unfortunately i've never seen the full version of this movie i did see the <UNK> minute version twice back in the 1950s even more directed than is the norm with <UNK> <UNK> this is a wonderfully out of the ordinary piece <UNK> with sweeping tracking shots through over and into <UNK> atmospheric sets beautifully lit too by photographer <UNK> thomas black jack is nothing if not a delight <UNK> this imaginative visual style is a script that allows a <UNK> of our favorite actors including <UNK> <UNK> and marcel some brilliantly bizarre full blooded characterizations george sanders gives a polished performance whilst an eccentric who turns out to be a rival <UNK> is admirably played by <UNK> <UNK> also realizing the most from her role patricia <UNK> the film was made on locations in spain in 1949
<START> this movie is about a group of four friends who wreck a car while driving they build a <UNK> to get though the night and wait for help to pass the time they tell each other scary stories to tell about it would ruin the movie so rent and enjoy it br br i will say it starts out a little slow but each tale get better and better this movie stars some of today's <UNK> actors christine taylor the brady bunch movies james <UNK> disturbing behavior and ron <UNK> office space so you can see there are big name stars just not the really big ones go rent or buy it <UNK> this movie is awesome
<START> take a look at those faces alongside the entrance to the jail they're not the faces of hollywood extras somebody in production was really smart to take filming to <UNK> <UNK> because you can't get that kind of authenticity from a studio <UNK> scope out the narrow dusty roads the frozen earth beneath and the <UNK> trees just barely hanging on no wonder those faces look hard and <UNK> they're just <UNK> the <UNK> from which they spring old man lucas <UNK> better fear for his life but then he springs from that same hard earth br br the movie works because it tells a good story that neither <UNK> nor and even has some suspense old man lucas is not very likable he's a victim and we sympathize but he's also <UNK> and <UNK> wisely the script refuses to <UNK> him up that way we're forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice on even the less sympathetic the script also wisely avoids dealing directly with racism since that tends to become preachy and less effective instead we're shown how easily prejudice can convict an innocent man and <UNK> him to a horrible death so it's through our common instinct to see justice done that the effects of racism are exposed a much more effective <UNK> it also makes the actions of the sheriff and the lawyer more understandable since they are otherwise part of the jim crow system br br note how the movie doesn't attack <UNK> it's <UNK> that old man lucas would want to mix with whites anyway and there's no hint that even lawyer stevens brian wants to cross the color line except to see justice done no the possibility of <UNK> lies in the future as <UNK> by the kid <UNK> whose head is not yet filled with notions he's not exactly friends with lucas but he has <UNK> the common humanity of being <UNK> after falling into the frozen creek the last line of dialogue also shows him <UNK> with his uncle the lawyer instead of his more <UNK> parents the dinner table scene is important and easily overlooked the lawyer might not join a future civil rights march but the kid might that's the movie's realistically hopeful side br br there was a bunch of <UNK> themed movies during this brief 3 year period 1949 <UNK> the well no way out home of the brave lost boundaries even <UNK> detached mgm got into the mix with this little gem unfortunately the mccarthy in hollywood put an end to problem films that might not serve cold war ends even so each of these is worth catching up with not only because they're good movies but because even with the passage of 60 years and jim crow they're still relevant
<START> a ridiculous badly acted mini cooper <UNK> includes cameos from <UNK> <UNK> etc br br absolutely nothing worth <UNK> here particularly bad are donald sutherland the music score scene transitions etc an embarrassing production br br hey they should pay you for watching this one
<START> i'm always interested to see neglected movies that appear to have good <UNK> but in this case the film's neglect appears justified evidently based on some actual incidents during wwii the film just doesn't connect with the viewer for some reason that it is not quite clear to me one very likely reason is that in the print i saw on tcm anyway none of the scenes where the germans talked among themselves were given titles this interesting directorial concept to let the non german speaking viewer just guess from context what the germans are saying to each other is in my book an utter flop and helps to lock the viewer out also the way the movie begins just dropping us into a very confused situation without much setup is <UNK> brian keith is pretty good here but the <UNK> of the great escape and <UNK> 17 will not be challenged by this flick
<START> once upon a time <UNK> russell made a few halfway decent movies so i keep hoping that one of her efforts from the past decade or two will merit a rating of at least 6 or 7 out of 10 however dark world is just the latest in a string of <UNK> the first 90 minutes are very hard to watch the lines are delivered by the lead actors as if they are being read at a first rehearsal or even a casting session in which the actors are doing it for the sake of their agents but do not really want the parts for which they are <UNK> reading the sets and props seem off somehow what kind of a police department would allow a detective to have a whole living room wall <UNK> full of case file <UNK> the screen is constantly <UNK> with meaningless time and which appear with no rhyme or reason now if the scriptwriter were standing here after the lights go up from a film fest screening they no doubt would crow about how all these shortcomings are really clever clues to the plot turning <UNK> <UNK> in this final five minutes well for those audience members whose only other movie experiences are tv the movie and <UNK> dude they might be <UNK> into <UNK> their heads in <UNK> but it is hard to believe that anyone who has seen 10 or more movies in their life and is not a close friend or relative of a dark world cast or crew member could fall for such a lame despite what the d v d box might lead you to believe this movie has about as much resemblance to sunset <UNK> dead narrator device or hitchcock <UNK> protagonist device as a <UNK> jim <UNK> bottle with <UNK> has to booze
<START> the movie starts in mexico where a girl has been cursed she <UNK> on snakes thru green <UNK> and her friend tries all these crazy spells to lift the curse he does nothing but <UNK> horrible language that does nothing so they decide to cross the border get on the train to make their way to l a to see his uncle to lift the curse comic hilarity ensues this movie has the same snakes over and over it has garden snakes and <UNK> that will never bite they all make the sound of <UNK> which makes no sense the whole movie has some funny lines some weak effects but most important a great ending that leaves you like <UNK> <UNK> what the heck just happened the whole movie is about a 1 but the ending is a 10 so by my crazy <UNK> it gets a 3 overall when blockbuster has nothing else you want grab this for mindless entertainment
<START> time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent the plot has a gangster falling for a <UNK> who wants to help the down on his luck <UNK> she loves there are of course complications the problem with the film for me is that it hasn't aged well performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes seeming so over the top as to be laughable one late exchange where carol lombard throws someone out of her room had me howling with its sing song delivery there are other times when the film becomes static a sign of the limitations of the <UNK> its not a bad film its just that the technical limitations of the film get in the way of real enjoyment normally i'm <UNK> but this time out i just couldn't go with the flow then again the copy i saw was absolutely horrible worth a shot in a <UNK> mood and to be reminded that robert armstrong actually did more than play carl <UNK> in king kong
<START> this movie was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects scenes where father is <UNK> in his bed and his glimpses of a native are signs of bad acting and poor imagination nothing seems to fit the story jumps from scene to scene the <UNK> writing leaves no fact to the imagination and leaves no room for suspense the lady doctor at one point states that she thinks the town is going to explode soon from all the crazy happenings there was in fact nothing in the movie to make that line relevant from the terrible job the movie had done i would have never known that there were any tensions in the village if you are into cheesy movies go ahead and rent this but if you want to see this done right check out exorcist the beginning
<START> one of the worst movies i've ever seen when i was trying to watch this i had <UNK> and i was pretty open minded for any brainless entertainment unfortunately this was too much how so many totally <UNK> actors can be in one movie this movie makes porn look like european art movie cast just speaks out their lines without any emotions special thanks to charlie baldwin soon to be ex wife who talks about her divorce like the rest of us talk about the weather just horrible and funny br br with lots of booze and friends this might just make it as a background entertainment and few laughs just like ed wood movies the plot is a joke and soundtrack straight from some <UNK> soap opera br br hopefully nobody paid to see this movie br br
<START> like several other reviewers here i'm surprised to see many negative reviews on this film dan <UNK> previous effort was the groundbreaking <UNK> of 1979 because it and <UNK> <UNK> introduced the <UNK> approach of or <UNK> <UNK> in art direction for these kinds of features doesn't mean that this was the only way to produce them br br rather than dismiss out of hand as a sort of schlock and primitive exploitation feature it's important to recognize that the film draws upon the traditions of british horror and science fiction specifically hammer and american international features like <UNK> specifically and the <UNK> 1967 doctor who and 'the day of the 1963 if not the works of <UNK> anderson <UNK> and <UNK> but none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized writer <UNK> genre <UNK> appreciation for <UNK> of <UNK> 1966 and <UNK> the terror from beyond <UNK> 1958 the immediate sources for <UNK> 1979 br br granted this film has some <UNK> elements but perhaps it's worth comparing this film to its more immediate peers <UNK> <UNK> american werewolf in <UNK> and 'the company of 1984 other 80's films that share a <UNK> while they adapt those stories to the 80's <UNK> all three films drew on earlier <UNK> of the same but <UNK> <UNK> up their themes because they could and at the same time they recognized the tongue in cheek humorous aspects of their projects br br neil <UNK> played to many of the <UNK> floating around at the during the <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> its theme as a <UNK> of <UNK> film it's called artistic license and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the latter day <UNK> inherent in the <UNK> franchise 'i know what you did last and <UNK> but these teen targeted films seem to be part of a box office trend whereas the 80's films like belong a <UNK> of british sci fi even if this one was written by an american br br in many ways this film holds up much better than latter day disaster and alien invasion flicks <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in that the don't <UNK> in gun battles and <UNK> at the opposite end of the pole it is unfortunate that steven soderbergh and james cameron didn't examine and more closely before they remade br br the goal of this film was fun not or stupidity br br 7 10
<START> this is my first film i'll confess we chose it mainly because we knew this had the <UNK> <UNK> of antonio <UNK> in gay sex scenes br br unfortunately that is about all that this film has to recommend it i consider myself a fairly sophisticated viewer i like european films art films and i am generally able to recognize a quality film even if it is not to my particular taste br br but this film was a complete blank to me the plot was ridiculous the characters lifeless the box called it a hilarious comedy but i didn't laugh once <UNK> and <UNK> constructed with a lot of pointless dialogue i don't get this at all it seems like an amateurish effort can someone <UNK> me
<START> i caught this one on cable and i was very surprised steady direction and some good performances accent a <UNK> and very engaging story this one will keep you up all night thinking about what was real and what wasn't check out jason scott lee in the lou diamond phillips role
<START> this movie shows me that americans have no knowledge about the situation in the sad <UNK> brother war please if you want to see <UNK> movies with this theme watch <UNK> and you will see that nobody is bad and nobody is good in this land of tears and <UNK>
<START> yes this movie is obviously trying to be a conan the barbarian and what <UNK> me is that this is a sequel the people <UNK> another one the first part of the flick is a flashback showing the original from what i saw it doesn't look worth checking out and apparently <UNK> always kills a huge puppet in his movies well now <UNK> lives at the ends of the earth with his mute sidekick <UNK> a girl seeks his help as this evil dude has her father in his custody let me just say this bad guy is extremely patient as the old guy constantly insults the <UNK> and just <UNK> on endlessly the bad guy waits to the very end of the movie and finally <UNK> the old guy around leaving you to wonder what took him so long to snap meanwhile <UNK> and his sidekick and the gal go through one adventure after another they fight <UNK> invisible soldiers don't ask rent a thugs and people who worship snakes <UNK> also battles a giant snake puppet and hang <UNK> again don't ask all the while you will be thinking that conan would kick butt
<START> the only reason i gave this episode of masters of horror a 2 instead of a 1 is because the two lead actors are good and it wasn't shot on vhs the story the dialog and the plot are ridiculous br br talking driving zombies who come back to vote and <UNK> the political tide against the war give me a break what next zombies who come back to go maybe zombies who come back to host <UNK> shows br br i never supported the iraq war but i do support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces and <UNK> was <UNK> in that it <UNK> the true horror of war br br with zombies being mass produced in today's market this is the <UNK> of zombie related entertainment how <UNK> made it onto masters of horror is beyond me
<START> people say that this film is a <UNK> teen horror <UNK> well it's a horror movie with a teenage girl in it what do you expect it's a good film i counted 3 actual screams in the audience whilst the film was on and it was a very <UNK> scary film i wasn't bored in the film at any point and i was even on the edge of my seat at one point the only thing that was slightly bad was that it was a tiny bit slow in getting into the actual storyline but this all led up to why she was where she was and why what happened happened the acting was good the scenery was good and the storyline was good too i hope to see a <UNK> a stranger calls <UNK> in a few months good film
<START> apparently bernard <UNK> ad <UNK> nearly all of his lines if you can sit through the oh my daddy bit without then you really need to get in touch with your inner child trust me i'm a <UNK> year old bloke
<START> i know it's not original but what the hey what else can be said about it i feel <UNK> silly just paying any attention at all to from hell it came the movie makes the important political and social issue of <UNK> from atmospheric atomic <UNK> seem a matter for joking and <UNK> not the concern and alarm being raised by scientists all over the world at the time
<START> when this was first aired on masterpiece theatre it had a profound effect on me it's beautifully filmed and acted i immediately read the book by mary <UNK> and it remains one of my all time favorites janet <UNK> is wonderful as and i fully expected her to become a regular on the british drama scene i guess she chose to focus on the british stage instead br br i was hoping that with the american success of janet <UNK> years later with <UNK> this film would again become available to us alas it has not yet been released on dvd if anyone out there is listening please make this available again
<START> felix in hollywood is a great film the version i viewed was very well restored which is sometimes a problem with these silent era animated films it has some of hollywood's most famous stars making cameo animated appearances a must for any silent film or animation <UNK>
<START> 'the <UNK> of is one of shakespeare's better known plays and is still regularly performed in the theatre incredibly however this film would seem to be the first ever english language version made for the cinema rather than television there were a number of versions made in britain or america during the early days of the cinema but these were all <UNK> br br the reason for this neglect of the play may be connected with <UNK> about the <UNK> alleged anti <UNK> a subject which has been even more sensitive since the rise to power of the nazis in 1933 this may explain why all previous versions were made during the silent era in <UNK> or <UNK> it would have been easier to portray <UNK> as a straightforward villain than it would be today yet in my view the film is not anti <UNK> at all it should be remembered that during shakespeare's lifetime there was no settled jewish community in england the jews had been <UNK> by edward i in the late 13th century and were not <UNK> to return until the time of <UNK> some forty years after shakespeare's death as far as we know shakespeare never <UNK> abroad so it seems quite possible that he himself never knew any jews personally or experienced the effects of anti <UNK> at first hand the play is not simply about the jewish question but is among other things an analysis of the <UNK> effects of religious prejudice it may in fact be a <UNK> examination of the mutual <UNK> between <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> england something of which shakespeare certainly would have had first hand experience and an appeal for greater tolerance between them br br then as now traditional anti <UNK> stereotypes had always depicted jews as <UNK> but principal sin is not <UNK> if it were he would certainly have accepted offer to pay him six thousand twice the amount borrowed by antonio rather sin is anger and the root of his anger is the way in which he and his fellow jews are treated by the christians of <UNK> not only are jews in general regarded as second class citizens but jewish such as <UNK> are particular targets for abuse even though the services they provide are necessary to the <UNK> economy the play shows the <UNK> effects of prejudice not only do views of this sort corrupt the christians who hold them they can also corrupt the jews who suffer abuse <UNK> is out of all <UNK> to the <UNK> he has suffered by spitting on him and calling him a dog antonio behaves like a <UNK> <UNK> but and <UNK> are not generally regarded as crimes deserving of the death penalty moreover <UNK> seeks to revenge himself on antonio not merely for the <UNK> <UNK> that antonio has done towards him but also for all the <UNK> real and imaginary that he has suffered at the hands of the christian community such as his daughter's marriage to <UNK> br br it is to the credit of the film's director michael <UNK> and of its star al pacino that they understand all these issues <UNK> <UNK> has initially a sort of angry dignity about him that gradually gives way to <UNK> rage and finally after his <UNK> in the trial scene by reasoning to pathos we see clearly that he has been the <UNK> of his own destruction but we can still <UNK> with him in my view none of <UNK> performances that i have seen have ever <UNK> those he gave in the first two <UNK> films not of a <UNK> for which he won an oscar and certainly not <UNK> <UNK> but 'the <UNK> of <UNK> is the one that comes closest to those <UNK> the other acting performance that stood out was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> speaking her lines with great clarity and simplicity and bringing out the intelligence and <UNK> that make her character more than simply a romantic heroine i was less impressed with jeremy antonio who seemed too passive antonio is a complex character part loyal friend part melancholy <UNK> part religious <UNK> and part <UNK> <UNK> although <UNK> captured the first two of those aspects it was difficult to his antonio either spitting on someone of a different faith or his all on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br interpretation of the play was attacked by the film critic of the who although he admired <UNK> performance disliked the period setting and <UNK> that shakespeare needs to be placed in a contemporary setting if it is to have for a modern audience <UNK> a recent stage production which set the action in <UNK> germany i would disagree profoundly with this approach the theatre and the cinema are quite different media and while there have been some striking <UNK> approaches to shakespeare in the cinema <UNK> <UNK> comes to mind a <UNK> approach is often the best one i preferred for example <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> the idea that we can only appreciate shakespeare in a modern <UNK> is sheer intellectual <UNK> we are not prepared to make the effort to see our greatest writer in the context of the <UNK> society that produced him but rather prefer him dressed up as an <UNK> <UNK> century man br br traditional approach not only <UNK> us to appreciate that <UNK> and <UNK> are age old universal problems but also makes for a visually striking film in the play the scenes set in <UNK> itself are <UNK> by <UNK> action those set in country house at <UNK> are happier and more peaceful in the film the <UNK> exterior scenes were shot on location against a backdrop of misty <UNK> grey <UNK> similar to the look achieved in <UNK> look <UNK> the <UNK> interiors with faces <UNK> lit against a dark background were reminiscent of the <UNK> effects of a <UNK> painting i suspect this was quite deliberate as <UNK> was a contemporary of shakespeare by contrast to dark or misty <UNK> the <UNK> scenes shot in an enchanting villa on an island in a lake were <UNK> by sunshine or peaceful <UNK> br br this is one of the best shakespeare adaptations of recent years an intelligent and visually attractive look at a complex play 8 10 br br a couple of errors we see a black <UNK> on the water in front of house these birds are natives of australia and were not introduced to europe until well after the date when the film is set also the portrait of in the <UNK> <UNK> is painted in the style of the <UNK> <UNK> who was active about a century before that date <UNK> collins may be reminiscent of a <UNK> beauty but it seems unlikely that a late <UNK> century <UNK> lady would have had herself painted in the manner of late <UNK> century <UNK>
<START> how important is the director anyway in this film made in the politically <UNK> times of the late 60s where questions of social organization were prime conflicts asks that question by making a movie that turns the camera away from the action and only begs to reveal the director william <UNK> it is an important work as it shows like no other movie shows the difficulties in <UNK> <UNK> and setting the scene it reveals the role of the crew something most directors frankly would like to disappear completely and that the <UNK> of is essential for <UNK> disbelief and it also puts into consideration the role of performance and scripting and how they match don't match reality and what that has to say about how the director ultimately influences reality if at all br br the documentary or pseudo documentary or fictional narrative <UNK> you prefer via your interpretations of the themes has its brain in the over educated over intellectual crew its guts in the lost performers struggling to understand the vague and ambiguous directions and its heart in the director who stands in as the desire to portray to represent to express without any idea how to do any of those things or why he wants to do it it's a film that <UNK> repeats <UNK> just to see if they can become more than <UNK> it's a film that sometimes shows the multiple shots simultaneously just to leave the editing to the audience and also reveal how <UNK> different shots change perspective br br it's an important work and something that everyone interested in the industry and process of film making should watch and understand it like many experimental films has no real mass audience appeal it's not for them it's for the industry and its for the 60s asking what to do with a group effort medium that still relies on a single voice and author br br <UNK>
<START> a kinda remake of planes trains and <UNK> in a lot of ways i think i think it's such a bad and sad coincidence that both john candy and chris <UNK> left us when they still had a lot of stuff to do god bless them both i think the plots of 2 movies are really similar road <UNK> of two different <UNK> of characters and a lot of unlucky consequences because of the this movie can not be planes trains and <UNK> but its a really entertaining movie especially with the great performance of chris <UNK> the missing part in this movie is the <UNK> stuff if we compare it with candy martin classic but i think its better this way
<START> i was pleasantly surprised with this one it's actually quite interesting and engaging the cast is strong even dan <UNK> brooke <UNK> has come into her own as an actress black and white must have really set her free 'cause i have never seen her in this much command playing a conventional character if <UNK> right could be a medium size hit
<START> when the italians and miles <UNK> work together nothing can go wrong as ever miles is great as the almost as great <UNK> the most lovable barbarian of all times totally lives up to the first movie
<START> i thought this was a very good movie someone said it was <UNK> so they couldn't watch it i think if you realize its rated r then you will be prepared for the nudity and drug use it is a good story and the acting is amazing just can't be a <UNK> to appreciate it its basically about a mom who does drugs and wants to get clean so she calls a very wealthy old friend and he moves them to his estate and crazy things happen i guess it is a drama i am just so sick of people who don't like movies because of <UNK> or nudity that is the world we live in you obviously aren't comfortable with yourself if you can't see things like this movie and it's rated r so that should tell you from the beginning that its not all <UNK> happy <UNK> i liked it i think you will too
<START> some spoilers a soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it when charlotte and <UNK> get close to <UNK> is a beautiful low key truly erotic scene i also loved the music score and the soft muted cinematography i'm not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being <UNK> originally in <UNK> form the <UNK> describing the action in sections is quite annoying my biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction of a and her life of course she has to be shown as a what else <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any <UNK> <UNK> in the world moreover she's always shown with two days growth of beard for some bizarre reason as if to emphasize how <UNK> her life is and she's waiting to get gender surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her <UNK> in truth the character resembles a drag queen not someone in the midst of <UNK> br br these are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really aren't connected to the film's of surgery is a way of people who are going through transition not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least at the very least why not have the character played by someone who really is i thought the male actor portraying <UNK> was okay but no better than that much better was the woman portraying charlotte a very complex character full of energy self loathing desire and <UNK> if she was so fascinated by someone with female energy a charlotte could go out to a women's bar in two seconds and find it yes she was drawn to <UNK> but more as an abstract idea of someone with male female characteristics a gentle touch but with a good punch not as a unique person yes what a soap says about love is often lovely and moving but that doesn't mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the process br br this film also proves that danes are lousy dancers for such a promising premise better executed in a film like different for girls the final film is a letdown
<START> the cast is admirably chosen and well balanced this cinematography is excellent the music is delightful as all of burt music is and is appropriate to the plot line making a musical version of <UNK> tale is a welcome change from a plodding re make we see seasoned actors who add real depth to the emotional content and significance of each scene i cannot agree with the critics who overlooked this <UNK> gem of a film it is a treasure of the silver screen find it if you can and let its magic carry you beyond the <UNK> of daily <UNK> inspiring you to find your own lost horizon
<START> i find it almost touching how star trek fans try desperately to like this film in spite of its unbelievable number of flaws br br to begin with none of the familiar characters are really in character so to speak <UNK> is depicted as a bumbling instead of the competent engineer he was in the original series <UNK> gods i can't even think about what they did to her character all of her dialog was painful to listen to mccoy seemed like a neurotic <UNK> to kirk instead of his trusted friend spock well let's just say that leonard <UNK> was terribly wasted he was given bad dialog i do not believe you have <UNK> the gravity of your situation captain gravity get it get it and made almost into a <UNK> kirk oh man don't get me started william shatner is a hammy actor to begin with so to allow him to direct really is to invite disaster which is what we got br br the plot is beyond ridiculous giving spock a brother is a pretty desperate story line and unnecessarily soap but hey let's go with it the search for god again a weak plot basis you don't think so ok let's go with that too so assuming that the two aforementioned plot elements are sound what's wrong with the script well for one thing it <UNK> way too much the enterprise for example is yet again not working properly are we to assume that <UNK> would send a grossly ship with a <UNK> crew into a potentially dangerous situation just because they want james kirk to handle the situation if that's the case then why not put him on a better ship as an <UNK> adding to that the crew is grossly incompetent <UNK> has the ship in pieces and apparently is enough to <UNK> his head knocking himself into <UNK> while there are <UNK> on board no one seem to notice the <UNK> ship at a crucial moment despite the fact that the <UNK> are clearly showing the ship in weapons range and the crew all seem way too familiar with each other in other words there is no sense of discipline if this is the <UNK> of <UNK> then it's a wonder that the <UNK> hadn't already <UNK> the <UNK> br br as to the personal struggles with pain it was crap lawrence is a competent actor but even he couldn't save this turkey in short no one could of all the people involved i imagine leonard <UNK> is the most embarrassed by it i hope he is anyway br br thank god the original cast didn't bow out on this <UNK>
<START> this may be the most tension filled movie i have ever seen br br in fact it's so nerve <UNK> i haven't been able to watch it again after viewing it two years ago but i will since i have the dvd there were a couple of scenes in here that are almost too much to watch so if you've got problems and need to escape for an hour and half this film will get your mind off anything else br br the russian actress <UNK> did a super job in facial expressions alone which she had to do since her character in here is a mute she plays a cute and wholesome makeup artist for a sleazy filmmaker after the day's shooting is done and <UNK> is about to leave she hears something she takes a <UNK> into the room where they were filming and discovers they are now shooting a snuff film and actually killing someone <UNK> is discovered and she runs for her life as the killers go searching for her in this big warehouse type building br br there are two extended scenes in which our heroine is running for her life and both of them will wear you out the first i described above the second scene the climactic one goes on too long and isn't as well done as the first in fact the film should have been <UNK> a bit but overall since it's so good at keeping our attention then it served its purpose as entertainment
<START> i finally managed to see this movie after so many years of <UNK> br br i was so curious to see if this movie it is as bad as some people say br br and my opinion is that this movie it wasn't bad at all on the contrary it was amazing br br i enjoyed every second from it from the beginning until the end br br the actors were great they sent me the feeling that i was living the story at the same time as the movie was playing br br the landscapes were so beautiful were the film was shot and it did <UNK> me also the music was extraordinary and i have nothing br br to <UNK> br br i think that the plot was very original i don't think that i saw a movie like this br br it is a shame that it isn't recognized all over the world to bad for those who didn't get the chance to see it i give this movie 10 10
<START> <UNK> gave it a 3 one point each for fonda stanwyck and the supporting cast br br never saw this one before am watching it right now and it has just gotten to the part where henry fonda is carrying <UNK> over the <UNK> if i continue watching it will be just to see if fonda and stanwyck will be able to pull this one out of the <UNK> br br but after reading the other viewer comments i'm not very optimistic br br the opening <UNK> scenes were enough to put me off my lunch the voice overs were obviously done in a sound studio and the editing between the exterior shots and the closeups was horrendous i do not know that much about the technology of that era but i can't believe there wasn't something they could do to make it more believable br br my second gasp of disbelief was when fonda wiped out and i imagine due to the extreme <UNK> of travel he is <UNK> head first into the snow up to his <UNK> stanwyck pulls him out with obvious staged difficulty and i imagine because she is such an experienced doctor does not react at all to his apparently unconscious state and limp <UNK> br br look i'm completely capable of <UNK> my disbelief but i couldn't get over the fact that she had just <UNK> a man with a possible head injury and that he might be <UNK> for life not my idea of big <UNK> br br so as i finish this comment we have just seen <UNK> first jealous <UNK> and dr hunt is off to perform an i'm not sure which i hate more the script the background music or the story i'm done game over click
<START> unbelievable great cast fair acting interesting plot br br but this movie has such graphic <UNK> that are not tense or giving thrills just pure disturbing br br spoiler br br everyone could see coming the freak returns to his <UNK> and that robert englund was acting was he like an idiot <UNK> your daughter to sleep with a football player but him trying to kill an idiot and liking is alright br br the policeman who's daughter was kidnapped anyone felt he was a cop and not an actor not me this movie drags on and on with an ending that we see in other horror movies if the returns were alright a part 2 could be made bad really bad stuff might give creeps some inspiration
<START> i love documentaries the andy goldsworthy doc was great i looked forward to this one but was very disappointed i knew of <UNK> and was intrigued by the idea of his lonely death in a penn station men's room there must be a story here i <UNK> believed the only story here is of sadly <UNK> women who had affairs with an ugly little famous married man in the absence of anything like an explanation for this guy's horrible behavior we're given endlessly repeated clips of <UNK> walking around and painfully long supposedly <UNK> shots of his soulless buildings actually some of the buildings are interesting but the thrust of the film asks us to think about the guy himself the overwrought soundtrack references an emotional <UNK> that is entirely absent from the film <UNK> apparent gifts do not excuse his behavior or <UNK> his <UNK> this film seems to want to give <UNK> the great free pass and thus make the director and his mother sympathetic figures i don't buy it
<START> the second episode of the new lost gives you just what its fans were lacking a fair amount of riveting action from the very first scene you keep seeing brand new features you weren't expecting to encounter it's the best proof that the series its 4th season is still alive and kicking hard br br although the producers don't <UNK> us with some more flash <UNK> this time the return to flashbacks is more than satisfying as it brings some shocking facts the flashbacks introduce a few fresh characters and the familiar ones turn out to be connected in a surprising way br br the fresh characters dominate the whole episode and i can't say it does any harm their scenario parts and their actors both do extremely well providing us with a <UNK> feel right after the episode you'll realize that the show really needed people just like that and here they are br br confirmed dead is full of gripping action and greatly written dialogues i'm sure i'll quote the best scenes of the episode for the long time they're just that good that they remain on the mind the episode is entertaining smart and <UNK> you like lost you have to watch it my vote is ten
<START> if you are planning to schedule your program for a film festival do not be <UNK> by what it says in the <UNK> this is a complete waste of time and energy i have watched <UNK> i have seen <UNK> and admired them but this isn't <UNK> this is not supposed to be at all didn't they ever think about the reputation of human race while taking this picture after we become <UNK> by global warming these will be the of our civilization what if the aliens <UNK> this as an example of our intellectual capital with all due respect to the effort put in this maybe it would be a good idea to <UNK> all the copies of this film or whatever it is
<START> good drama movie about a child custody case with great performances by all the actors a good example of what an excellent script can do to <UNK> a simple story to a much higher quality the screenplay was just average though and this is what kept the movie from the list of the all time best dramas still the great acting makes this movie a good one to see if you are a fan of court dramas or a big fan of the lead actors the movie really should have been a tad longer though for more excellence but that would really be <UNK>
<START> during the roberts <UNK> i was beginning to think this was an ed wood production however what rolls out here is some pretty hard hitting stuff the story of crime and corruption in a southern town is told using a cast <UNK> from hollywood's poverty row and this makes the movie all the more realistic there are no punches pulled here and at times the film is reminiscent of the well 1951 the black and white <UNK> gives a <UNK> like quality for certain younger viewers will be reminded of the blair witch project but this one is based on real events
<START> well i wouldn't want to lecture anybody but i do feel the urge to say some things i consider important about this beautiful film i saw it for the first time in 1976 i was 14 and then one more time a year later that was it the rest of it was the pink <UNK> of <UNK> john's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart how deep a week ago my cousin gave me a vhs copy as a present no dvd's yet boy was i surprised <UNK> have always <UNK> that deep childhood and adolescent experiences of beauty love god <UNK> <UNK> stay with you forever since they occur mostly at the <UNK> level no intellect yet they define your <UNK> like a <UNK> would do with a stone if sometimes we didn't tend to forget how right they are perhaps we would do better in understanding the meaning of every minute of every decision of every turning point of our lives br br so i confess i feel nostalgia but the fascinating part of this is watching the film again and through this trip back in time <UNK> that understanding of why we people from the 60's grew up as we did the spirit of those times is all here a <UNK> created far from the official world of <UNK> and economic success make love not war the beautiful pop <UNK> the poetry of the lyrics a totally romantic view of adolescent rebellion with the awakening of sexuality carefully wrapped in tender and <UNK> love these two lonely spirits still full of childhood innocence growing together as they learn mutual commitment and turning into adults br br i showed the film to a group of school youngsters and they <UNK> with such simplistic and cynical comments regarding it as <UNK> and foolish guys be serious cinema is an art and as art it reflects not only human emotions but historical moments and this is exactly what friends does in a <UNK> way it reflects an <UNK> idea of rebellion and new beginning we all <UNK> about when we were 15 i'm now a musician and i feel some of us artists for that matter still dream about it how else could we live that's friends that's brother sun sister moon that's hair those were the times still alien to aids alien to explicit and vulgar <UNK> in pop songs with no melody to pornography presented as sexuality to this <UNK> new world order growing after september <UNK> br br what a heart warming experience to see paul and michelle again <UNK> and <UNK> exploring the new fantasies of their romantic world what a trip back to the very core of our hearts to paris to <UNK> john at his best to that urban scenario surrounded by 2 <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> what a fresh air from the peaceful <UNK> in surrounded by fishing <UNK> and wild horses they made us who we are as did <UNK> in spain in france peter paul and mary joan <UNK> <UNK> king the beatles the early <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gandhi the <UNK> of elvis br br people still hoping get this picture start with innocence and grow from there you'll find out what it's all about and from there you'll have a solid and more truthful foundation some ideals to look for in life a way to handle personal and world affairs we need so much of this today give yourselves the chance and maybe someday the time of <UNK> will end i have an extra vhs copy br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> hong kong the 1920s a young man from poor <UNK> dreams of being a hero and spends most of his time training and learning about kung fu and <UNK> much against his father's will he helps a servant girl escape from a ruthless businessman whose <UNK> then come after them and <UNK> the young man's <UNK> <UNK> restaurant the uncle turns out to be an old <UNK> <UNK> assassin who now helps the young guy become <UNK> in martial arts it's all out karate kid style with wash the <UNK> instead of wax on wax off the kung fu villain is the ruthless <UNK> son who has a trademark <UNK> style that looks cool although it is quite silly and surely completely unrealistic br br but the story which develops over time has an epic feel good characterization great kung fu and is generally very entertaining the young hero is very sympathetic and provides a good protagonist to root for the romance dimension remains undeveloped though which is a bit disappointing otherwise a great movie br br my rating 8 out of 10
<START> anyone can make a movie these days budget production value or experienced crew don't have to stop the self described director from realizing their dream these days br br respect for the craft of film making or even just respect for any film aesthetic are no longer <UNK> for actually <UNK> a film br br director bill must have thought he struck gold when <UNK> gate decided to market his original film as a sequel to a film he had nothing to do with br br i personally find <UNK> gate far far more in error than in regard to dark <UNK> 2 being made available to the public <UNK> <UNK> marketing of this film should be <UNK> by the state attorney <UNK> office and <UNK> officers should be in <UNK> acid and <UNK> for their utter disregard for film film making and good sense br br as for the film itself it's not even worth commenting on
<START> i thought choke had potential but i thought it could have been a much better film it had some interesting twists and turns but some of them seemed kind of pointless when showing background on the two main characters some of that really seemed to go awry most of it was sort of useless and didn't help the movie at all this was also not dennis <UNK> finest hour however the main saving grace of this movie for me was michael madsen his performance was excellent in this movie he almost makes mr blonde look like a nice guy all in all it was watchable still i was left thinking some things could have been done differently these things would have made the movie much better in my opinion
<START> this parody is cleverly done from the songs express yourself becomes expose yourself like a <UNK> is now party in my pants and <UNK> is now vague to the fake interviews of the cast of the show this movie is hilarious remember madonna saying she didn't know about the rain season in asia in this one she doesn't know about the <UNK> season it is a precious jewel they got a lot of money on that spoof and it pays off highly recommended
<START> this is 1 hour and 24 minutes of pure boredom br br in this <UNK> movie even the gun baldwin uses hk sucks it was sent to <UNK> by armed forces worldwide in the mid eighties and is now only used by terrorists bank robbers and military <UNK> br br if i had known this movie was this bad i would rather watch 10 episodes of <UNK> saving the planet br br no groove no drive and no feel watch the channel  it's more <UNK> than this sorry excuse for a movie this movie doesn't deserve a on the scale better luck next time baldwin until then i'll sit here watch my <UNK> grow  that is far more <UNK> than
<START> some of the reviewers of this film were extremely generous with praise i personally was disappointed because due to those reviews i was optimistic as the opening credits began to roll br br the all too familiar story line goes like this <UNK> boy and his father live out in <UNK> swamp local boys <UNK> and torment him local boys start oh sorry i mean victor cabin on fire with him in it dad attempts to rescue his son <UNK> known as eddie <UNK> meets the elephant man but accidentally puts a <UNK> through the kid's head instead victor becomes a murderous ghost who <UNK> down <UNK> who enter his <UNK> <UNK> scary br br one thing i appreciated about <UNK> was that it never took itself seriously and some of the gags even made me laugh the thing is i've grown tired of the hollywood polished b horror slap sticks i like to laugh and i enjoy a good scare but this film didn't deliver a solid dose of either as for <UNK> being the next michael jason or freddy <UNK> has a better chance
<START> for some inexplicable reason <UNK> movies often seemed to come in for <UNK> from certain quarters although they were rarely box office <UNK> it's one of life's great mysteries to me because his films have always had a <UNK> <UNK> factor about them for me but this film is not only not bad it's an exceedingly good and clever comedy to those who may be <UNK> by <UNK> crude or cruel humour don't see this film there's nothing in it like that and you'll be wasting your time br br i've only seen this film once on the television i've waited ever since to see it again and that's been quite a few years you'd think the idea of an arrogant millionaire businessman heading off to win the war against the nazis with his own small private army of <UNK> employees would be boring wouldn't you well only jerry lewis would dare try such a plot for an out and out comedy and it works i have to say brilliantly br br i think that as with 'the nutty <UNK> and most of his other films this movie is <UNK> to his comic genius both in concept and execution i think buddy love might have said you know true comedy can not only make a six year old hysterical it'll do that for his dad too maybe a few nutty nazis <UNK> with and a limp would dislike this movie honestly if you only see one more comedy in your life see this one be careful though you might die laughing and i'm not joking
<START> early 80's creature feature concerns a long abandoned gold mine that some <UNK> <UNK> are determined to check out naturally they find no gold down there but one very hungry monster that <UNK> along in search of prey br br while i have to be honest and admit i found it dull at first i personally prefer the <UNK> similar the <UNK> it actually grew on me as it went along now the characters aren't too interesting nor the actors either the closest to an interesting character is morgan played by keith hurt in any event female lead <UNK> is quite good looking and <UNK> makes his <UNK> jerk an easy person to hate the writer played by effects man mark wears thin quickly br br it begins in a <UNK> predictable enough way with a <UNK> set piece in which two victims are claimed to get things off to an acceptable start the monster itself is intriguing for its design as you can imagine it gets revealed a bit at a time until late in the game and for being the product of stop motion animation when this process was no longer used very much director <UNK> anne phillips directing under the <UNK> of david michael <UNK> and crew deserve some credit for their creation of atmosphere they manage to make the film look quite claustrophobic and gloomy and their use of lighting works well the film does build in intensity towards a pretty good ending suffice it to say they do the best they can on their low budget br br an obscure little item worth looking into for die hard horror buffs br br 7 10
<START> i was fortunate to attend the london <UNK> of this film while i am not at all a fan of british drama i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made i was in tears by the end of the film every scene was mesmerizing the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive br br i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character br br alert i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance end spoiler br br <UNK> knightley did a great job and <UNK> beauty and innocence from the screen but it was <UNK> <UNK> performance that was truly oscar worthy br br i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards
<START> when i was very young my mother had a series of four looney tunes <UNK> <UNK> shorts on tape and i watched them all several times a <UNK> <UNK> was one of these shorts and i was truly shocked to read in another comment that it had been banned when i was young i probably did not even understand the black beauty gag to begin with still this is probably why it was banned though until i watched this on a video site i did not even remember the gag upon viewing the video i did remember certain shots in particular the <UNK> of hat and eyes becoming as the <UNK> him in the lake i was not bothered by the gag that was most likely the reason the gag was banned instead i was <UNK> with childhood memories of watching this short because of how much i liked this short as a child i rate it 7 out of 10
<START> rare and <UNK> are the moments in film making when greatness stands as a defining <UNK> for the rest of the industry to measure themselves against and for us to <UNK> in that glorious moment br br some stories <UNK> their time and <UNK> to the <UNK> reaches of a classic and the stuff of legends throw in the <UNK> skills of an ensemble cast of <UNK> who are at the very top of their game br br where has all the originality gone it is here as this story and it's cast through a plot and story that will not only <UNK> but also entertain even the most seasoned of shakespearean action love story <UNK> br br i cannot begin to imagine where the writers <UNK> up this extraordinary tale where do geniuses get this kind of inspiration i now have hope for mankind knowing that this kind of talent still exists gives me hope that we will make it to the stars and beyond perhaps to the very gates of heaven br br i have like others before me <UNK> of greatness though i did not write this movie i did see it and because of this movie's noble greatness i feel as if i have been <UNK> to a higher level of being a higher level of spiritual <UNK> br br it is no wonder this kind of glory <UNK> most of us what would become of our world if we all could <UNK> this level of <UNK> we would probably be consumed in a white fire of super <UNK> glory as we <UNK> into <UNK> dimensional spiritual beings capable of <UNK> creative power br br the most important thing to know with all your heart and the very essence of your being is that is nothing like what i have been talking about is the <UNK> of all i mentioned it could very well destroy our world for as some reviewers rate a movie on a star system i e 1 through 5 stars or even zero stars i'm going to rate a black hole br br i am willing to <UNK> money to a cause that will put a stop to these kinds of atrocities that as of late seem to be running <UNK> at box <UNK> i'm not even <UNK> to the use of nuclear weapons it must stop how much more of this can we take before aliens from outer space come down here and blow up our planet because we have so many stupid crass vulgar unimaginative and <UNK> movies <UNK> out of hollywood i'm not even going to <UNK> this movie by mentioning anyone's name that starred or produced it i'm not even going to waste my time describing the story since we've seen it a <UNK> <UNK> times and all of the past versions were at least a <UNK> <UNK> times better br br by the way my head nearly <UNK> during this movie but with supreme <UNK> effort and lots o luck i survived to warn the public you have been warned
<START> each guy <UNK> tyler meets loses their head over her not of course without some small <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> is at her beautiful best with matt dillon tops among the <UNK> interesting initial premise to tell story from perspective of each <UNK> <UNK> into sitcom style finale not unlike blame it on <UNK> with which it has more than a few similarities worth watching nonetheless
<START> i had a bad feeling when i saw the cheap title work it only took a couple of scenes to confirm that this movie is a real stinker the only enjoyment i got out of this was to laugh at the technical flaws example the background car sounds audio just disappears during the scene with danny and dog in <UNK> car production shows a total lack of imagination example slow motion machine gun fire repeats many times sandra <UNK> plays essentially a bit part completely unnecessary to the plot to say that this movie actually has a plot is doing more justice to the writing than it deserves the <UNK> computer <UNK> is kind of interesting this film was released in 1982 not 1987 as the imdb <UNK> <UNK> and then current high tech was an <UNK> screen on a 4 8 <UNK> pc with <UNK> drives maybe the pc was the real star of the movie at least it was interesting br br we got this on dvd for a couple of bucks in the bargain bin at <UNK> as the other reviewer notes we paid too much
<START> jason connery is not an actor he is the son of an actor his <UNK> is the worst i have ever seen oh yes he murders king <UNK> but he also kills william shakespeare his wife is even worse please give me <UNK> version on dvd so i can forget this monster jon <UNK> orson welles laurence olivier there you have actors
<START> from the beginning of the film i found myself laughing trying to keep quiet so i did not wake anyone in the house this didn't continue so much throughout the rest of the film i didn't find everything completely laugh out loud funny but still i found certain things quite funny at the beginning i had to hold in laughter when he drops the very <UNK> looking hand <UNK> down his <UNK> then there are scenes where you will just smile like when the <UNK> falls through a roof into <UNK> apartment i can see that being quite funny but in todays days and time that has been done quite a lot it didn't feel original though at the time i'm sure it was i loved <UNK> bursts of raging german with the nice subtle english translation br br the final scene is wildly discussed because well it's absolutely true and so very intelligently constructed though the film is sixty eight years old the final scene is still relevant today if this doesn't show how great a writer chaplin is then i don't know what will the acting in this scene in particular was quite good the <UNK> <UNK> the message perfectly and makes you realise the serious nature of the film at the same time enjoying the humorous side br br another element about this film is the fact that this was such a brave film that almost feels ahead of it's time of course chaplin did not know what was going to happen after 1940 he was not aware of the holocaust obviously he's also gone on record as to saying if he had of known he would not of made this film the fact this film is so anti hitler is interesting it's more interesting that it wasn't anti germany which would be very easy to have done back in those times chaplin could of easily made this a propaganda film but instead did something more he made an honest film br br i recommend anyone remotely interested in this film to see it as well those who has studied or is studying hitler and wwii to watch this film it's entertaining to say the least it doesn't have an annoying out dated feel that some films of the time did unlike most comedies this film actually has a message it tries to bring to you watch this film you will be better off for having seen it
<START> 1st movie comment ever i'll start with saying come on wasn't that bad was it no it that bad actually i laughed and <UNK> enough times through the movie so i cannot say with hand on my heart that it was rubbish br br it's completely different this and epic movie epic movie sucked bad <UNK> how so people would ask i'll tell you how this movie is not as nearly as pointless not to mention that the stupid and i say stupid because it is but being stupid makes it funny stuff that happens around and with the characters is actually enjoyable in this movie not the best around but hey what would you expect look at the poster some people said it was stupid i find that when writing a comment one should be more objective my own opinion but yeah of course it was stupid it's a movie about stupid look i'm not telling you to go and watch the movie now or else you missed the event of the century what i am telling is that if you happen to see the movie somewhere please don't <UNK> your eyes on the opening credits see what it's all about who knows you might like it a bit br br i give it 4 10 for not being so bad and making me laugh and some unexpectedly good sex related jokes
<START> i was stunned by this film i have been renting <UNK> films <UNK> them and this film showed me the climax and <UNK> of his 50 years of directing what an eye for setting color and detail i have never seen such visual beauty and poetry filmed before i had to stop after the first story and hold back the tears yes beauty moves me like it moved <UNK> to write <UNK> on a <UNK> this movie is made for the mature emotionally and intellectually audience those hoping to see physical action and soap opera will be disappointed i will have to see this film several times before i can truly appreciate it and judge it this film should be required viewing for all <UNK> and directors br br possibly a truly great film on the order of <UNK> dreams
<START> what happened to <UNK> <UNK> in the 1940s and marilyn monroe in the <UNK> also seemed to take place for modern day actress michelle pfeiffer in the '80s her remarkable good looks got in the way of her being taken seriously as an accomplished superbly talented actress anyone looking for <UNK> of dramatic abilities need look no further than her work in <UNK> frankie and johnny or love field a personal favorite of mine those looking to see what a splendid comedic actress she can be when given the right part should check out <UNK> married to the mob in this one she plays angela <UNK> the widow of a recently <UNK> mob hit man who moves from her <UNK> tacky long island home to start a new life for herself and her son while being pursued by mob boss dean <UNK> and fbi man matthew <UNK> while this movie has lots going for it a very amusing script offbeat characters sudden sharp turns to unexpected violence as in director jonathan <UNK> previous effort something wild and hilarious yet menacing performances by <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as his jealous wife from hell michelle steals the show easily notice how perfectly she nails <UNK> long island italian accent and the many fine mannerisms that she brings to the role to really flesh out this <UNK> and surprisingly bright character once upon a time long ago oscars were handed out to actresses for comedic roles such as this one had this film been made 60 years ago michelle been a
<START> the success of the original french <UNK> series i've only watched the first which wasn't too bad considering led to a <UNK> of <UNK> the italian counterpart which even changed the race of its heroine was clearly less polished and more exploitative <UNK> more and more into <UNK> as the series went along incredibly there were 16 black <UNK> films in total with the heroine even having the spelling of her name changed to avoid <UNK> issues still laura <UNK> the titular object of desire became almost as much of an icon as the original <UNK> sylvia <UNK> although personally she's too skinny for my tastes here she's even billed as <UNK> rather than with her real name with the director likewise becoming albert thomas br br in itself the film offers little of interest as a matter of fact one would do best to approach it as a <UNK> with some decent footage of the african <UNK> with respect to the sex scenes i don't know how complete the version i watched was but while there was a lot of nudity none of it was very explicit or even <UNK> the scene that came closest perhaps was when <UNK> who works as a photographer and her companion <UNK> <UNK> turn the camera on each other naturally sans clothes in the middle of the jungle the film also features an artist made up to look like <UNK> <UNK> but mercifully perhaps his scenes do not take much of the running time the score by <UNK> is typically bland 70s pop and really nothing to write home about
<START> my only reason <UNK> to this site was for the opportunity to write a comment to this movie i felt that i had to get rid of some of my anger by writing it off me br br the movie must be just about the worst film i ever seen i really do believe that the script may have seen to been able to become a pretty good movie or at least ok but somewhere on the line something happened what makes it even more odd is the fact that the cast appears to be quite alright on paper put to practice both script and the cast fails to deliver there are to much action it happens to much things and you can't help wonder why it happens and then the cast the actors make such a poor effort that you almost start to cry br br if you have to much time at hand i would say you can see it if not don't
<START> this movie is the final straw as two dedicated fans of the romantic comedy this movie has finally made us realise that nothing good has come out of this genre since love actually there was nothing good about the film whatsoever it was an <UNK> to love death and everything in between including horses and <UNK> there was absolutely no chemistry between the characters this movie took the spark out of nicholas sparks diane lane cannot act to save her life she was unconvincing in her laugh cry and dance and she needs a better <UNK> there is no reason to watch this movie save yourself the romantic comedy is officially dead
<START> a great suspenseful thriller the acting is first rate and the plot keeps you guessing this well performed and directed movie is based on a true story and well worth while joe penny is cast extremely well and ann gillian is convincing as the and terrified sister joe again prove he's acting ability is amazing and the ending well done it s worth watching i hope they repeat it soon on any channel i will definitely record it for penny and gillian fans it's worth your time rent it if you can better still try to buy it i going to perfect early nineties thriller watch this br br movie it's great
<START> despite its age this film <UNK> its <UNK> charm and attraction and is a fine surviving example of early british cinema it has an underlying air of <UNK> interspersed with <UNK> of humour which are not out of place and serve to demonstrate the assured direction production values involved so many episodic type films are disjointed and <UNK> but this is not one of them the standard of acting helps a great deal and the various <UNK> characters come across as interesting and believable all in all this long forgotten little gem is well worth anyone's attention in spite of the one jarring note in the film which surprisingly escaped the <UNK> attention
<START> i'm sorry but i don't understand how the studio <UNK> away with this the movie is just not worth it maybe as a theater play but certainly not as a movie and why do they call it a thriller the acting is good but i expect anything less from these perfect actors robert redford plays very well and willem dafoe is convincing enough as the <UNK> bad guy helen <UNK> can play almost any role and always still looks beautiful to me i'm also a fan of her british detectives still they just can't save this <UNK> so boring movie i'm sorry i hope we don't get to many movies anymore from this director jan cause he obviously doesn't now the meaning of the words <UNK> and thriller
<START> <UNK> morally <UNK> military doctor lieutenant claude de ross solid <UNK> <UNK> and several other <UNK> survivors wash <UNK> on a remote <UNK> island that's <UNK> with an iron fist by the ruthless and sadistic edmund superbly played to the deliciously slimy <UNK> by richard johnson who lives on the island with the <UNK> amanda martin a <UNK> <UNK> performance by the ravishing barbara bach and her unhinged rogue <UNK> father professor ernest martin a <UNK> <UNK> portrayal by joseph <UNK> moreover de ross discovers that professor martin has control over a dangerous race of <UNK> who are being exploited as slave labor by director co writer sergio martino relates the lively and absorbing story at a constant snappy pace offers a <UNK> <UNK> of the lush and remote <UNK> setting does an expert job of creating and maintaining a creepy and mysterious atmosphere in the spooky opening third further <UNK> things up with a nice line in dry humor and stages the <UNK> action loaded climax with considerable rip roaring <UNK> while the central premise is obviously inspired by the island of dr <UNK> the story nonetheless is given a great deal of <UNK> and intrigue because of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of such diverse elements as voodoo the lost underwater city of atlantis a rousing <UNK> <UNK> climactic <UNK> <UNK> buried treasure <UNK> genetic experiments and even some exciting <UNK> between de ross and during the thrilling conclusion into an altogether dynamic imaginative and often immensely entertaining whole the sound acting by the <UNK> cast qualifies as another substantial plus <UNK> makes for a likable hero johnson <UNK> his <UNK> villain part with <UNK> lip <UNK> <UNK> bach rates as a quite <UNK> damsel in distress plus there are neat supporting <UNK> by <UNK> cunningham as sinister voodoo <UNK> franco as the <UNK> jose and <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> peter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> widescreen cinematography delivers a wealth of striking visuals while <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> score hits the funky spot the <UNK> <UNK> creatures are pretty <UNK> looking too an extremely fun flick
<START> i wouldn't call myself a big fan of the genre inventive silliness so i might not be the best audience for this show although being a critic i do have a sense for what i personally like and dislike this being the later br br lack of humor is a big <UNK> when it comes to comedy things can be catchy cool and <UNK> for about 4 minutes and after that you start getting bored unless its the <UNK> animation from a couple of years ago this is the exact opposite with a stiff script and all <UNK> voice overs its just plain silly and very very boring to be subjected to unfortunately since it did have a big market ahead of itself and a lot of potential br br a waste of time
<START> unless you're interested in seeing 2 hours worth of <UNK> mountain footage featuring hysterical characters lots of <UNK> and cheap 70s gore not much of it either i would advise to avoid this movie it is long <UNK> overlong and has a rather annoying amateurish feel to it masterpiece no an average thriller shot in an average fashion in a gorgeous italian landscape br br i'm a huge fan of slow paced 1970 movies when there is a plot to delight and entertain you in this case it didn't work out for me the plot is trite <UNK> with superficial and stereotypical characters backed by hilarious angry <UNK> and your typical italian widow dressed all in black <UNK> br br if you are not <UNK> and familiar with the italy country side the movie might be worth seeing as the scenery itself is spectacular and rather breathtaking this movie isn't however nothing out of the ordinary there are much better italian horror flicks than this not much else than a yawn fest 5 10
<START> i just saw this movie last night and after reading all the reviews i expected a good emotional sports film what i got was something clichéd and boring yes i thought it was boring i saw the all star getting hurt long before the game i figured maybe they'd wait for him to collapse until ya know the game before the big one but i guess the first game is good enough br br the <UNK> relationships were also very clichéd with the <UNK> drunk father i will say <UNK> impressed me however and the boy who wants to stay and help his <UNK> mother br br i especially liked the random girls melissa and maria who were in the movie for all of 5 minutes and placed there simply to get the football boys some action off the field i thought ok now how does this work into the plot again maybe i missed the point beyond well they play football in a town that loves it so the girls throw themselves at their feet point br br the sports action had some good points but most of it was so rushed i think the first game lasted longer than the montage of the entire <UNK> and i wasn't so sure about the continuity of the <UNK> down clock in the final game br br i guess i could see this movie winning the <UNK> for best sports film if it was the only one released honestly though i found it to be a boring movie full of people <UNK> obsessed with the for a better football film see remember the <UNK>
<START> this era was not just the dawn of sound in cartoons but of a cartoon character which would go down in history as the world's most famous mouse yes mickey makes his debut here in this <UNK> tale of life on board a <UNK> the animation is good for it's time and the plot though a little simple is quite jolly a true classic and if you ever manage to get it on video you won't regret it
<START> so many early british sound films that i've seen on video suffer from either poor print transfer quality or poor sound or both fortunately i was able to obtain a copy of this movie on a video of excellent quality <UNK> me to focus on the story itself br br and an excellent story it was at first sight the passengers on the ill <UNK> bus looked like a pretty boring lot except for the always lovely jessie <UNK> but as the film went back to show each <UNK> story on the day before the accident i discovered that the cast contrary to initial appearance was a talented group of performers <UNK> directed so as to bring a real <UNK> to their distinctive characterizations br br viewers may have different <UNK> as to which two passengers are going to meet a tragic end and which ones will survive but the movie holds your interest as it keeps you guessing this film deserves a much wider audience a real gem of early british cinema
<START> note i only saw approximately the last half of this movie so feel free to take my review with whatever grain of salt you <UNK> appropriate that being said seeing what i saw was more than enough to make me quite convinced that a one star rating for this is enough br br in short it's a dismal plot slaughter of the wonderful <UNK> <UNK> christmas vacation with chevy chase only it doesn't have chevy chase in it and it takes place in a generic <UNK> island essentially with no connection to christmas at all br br ol' chevy probably didn't want in because the plot is that devoid of actual fun instead they got the <UNK> cousin eddie who again was great in the original but in this he is just over the top and an extremely poor basis for any movie considering the plot and acting the attempts at humor are generic to a degree where even contemporary television comedy <UNK> it and considering that this is supposed to be comedy i doubt i need to say more br br this is not to be seen for its qualities for it has none but for it's <UNK> and again how hollywood is <UNK> it's life's blood of the past in the pursuit of a quick buck br br i think i'll watch the original before the upcoming christmas season just to try to regain my childhood innocence from a lost time when motion pictures were more than just high budget but mindless garbage
<START> i <UNK> t expecting much with harlem nights but i <UNK> t expecting it to be as bad as it was without doubt the worst aspect is the obscene language it really is awful the amount there is in this film and before anyone <UNK> me of being a <UNK> let me point out two things br br 1 amongst my <UNK> films i would include platoon raging bull while my favourite movie of all time is apocalypse now br br 2 my all time favourite american television show is the hbo prison drama oz br br so you see films and television shows with massive amounts of swearing don t normally bother me but the problem i had with harlem nights is to do with the fact it s supposed to be a comedy but it seems the production team came to the conclusion that an audience laugh <UNK> someone especially if that someone is black says a rude word and decided to funny situations with swearing all the way through the film hoping to get a laugh well i thought i d never start laughing and i <UNK> t
<START> still funny after all these years midnight madness is good entertainment for all ages it introduces michael j fox as a typical 15 year old trouble maker and are by far the funniest characters in it and leon is perfectly cast as a <UNK> game master the budding romance between adam and the girl couldn't have been any <UNK>
<START> if any movie ever made italians look bad this is it br br duke mitchell what an a hole duke mitchell i s t on your grave seeing as practically every person <UNK> down in this film by the cowardly <UNK> is either black or of some other racial or ethnic minority it's hard not to become convinced that the guy ultimately owes his <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> but he doesn't shoot the little black kid in the elevator in the opening sequence so that means he can't be all bad right wrong typical sentimental tripe br br while i do understand why some people might be struck by and even to a certain extent admire the film's <UNK> totally un pc <UNK> it's certainly <UNK> of its own <UNK> and sense of self involvement but this doesn't change the fact that the main character <UNK> and by <UNK> duke mitchell is thoroughly <UNK> human being who earns not one <UNK> of empathy or interest especially given that duke mitchell is such a complete bore as a performer but what do you expect from a guy whose main claim to fame apart from this dog t d of a movie was being a second rate dean martin <UNK>
<START> this movie <UNK> the story of john belushi based of his biography wrote by bob <UNK> all of movie is <UNK> on flashback without a <UNK> order where after the death of john belushi we see one angel <UNK> belushi during few points of his life michael in the character of john belushi is enough credible but entirely devoid of the <UNK> force of belushi and his play stay only a pale animation the director on more not succeed to give on the story that for who not knows the book is very confused but the worse is that they have featured bob <UNK> that spoke with belushi before he died for this negative points the movie is only a would be attempt to <UNK> the controversial story of john belushi my rate is 4
<START> once again <UNK> talent is mostly wasted on this shock value 1984 thriller which uncut is far more disturbing than most of what is out even today the fact that the evil that men do is very disturbing in its verbal and visual depictions of torture is not the problem it is the shameless <UNK> in which it is presented interestingly this film seems to <UNK> that latter part of <UNK> career in which he has tortured many of his fans with the same predictable and <UNK> plots one hopes this fine actor will rise again
<START> i just went to see this movie with a friend i quickly looked and read a short synopsis and thought it sounded interesting we came out the movies not feeling very sure if we liked it not br br the acting was good enough and connection with characters was ok the main character i thought acted a lot like someone like van <UNK> yes it was pretty entertaining br br but the plot i felt like it was used from other movies the script was a bit weak i'm not sure why every time something bad happens the main character says oh my god every time br br the special effects worked well but sorry for this spoiler the main monster at the main climax reminded me a lot of the out of lord of the rings br br overall the movie was ok but i felt like it's been done already go and see buy all means but don't expect too much
<START> mel brooks really <UNK> himself with this hilarious stand up of the robin hood story the cast is perfect and cary <UNK> does a fine job at his role in my personal opinion besides the fact that i'm a cary <UNK> fan this movie is the best and funniest i've ever seen it will have you laughing every time you see it
<START> this is what porn used to be this is a true classic i mean it is an x rated musical based on an actual book there is a real plot to it and how many x rated movies can <UNK> that these days this belongs in an <UNK> short list of true pornographic movie classics including does dallas deep throat and behind the green door i think the problem with pornographic movies these days is that it's all about the pornographic and not about the movie alice in wonderland has graphic depictions of sex sure but it is actually telling a story at the same time not one of the typical oh mr police man don't write me a ticket plots this takes it another step further and makes it a musical fabulous if you want to see an example of good porn this is one of the best

<START> talk radio is my favorite oliver stone movie though he has made many great ones including <UNK> <UNK> natural born killers and platoon but i like the <UNK> of talk radio a cinematic <UNK> of eric <UNK> stage play that was based on a real life account of a dallas talk show host working with ace cinematographer robert richardson stone turns what could have been a very set bound exercise into a visually <UNK> <UNK> battle that presents a radio station as an <UNK> of war <UNK> is devastating as tortured on air of abuse barry and conveys the conflicted destructive nature of his character with conviction and a generous dose of self loathing alec baldwin as his <UNK> male boss strikes the perfect note as a man driven nuts by a guy whose he helped <UNK> ellen greene is fantastic as <UNK> sweet ex wife who ends up becoming another target of his vicious personal <UNK> stone and <UNK> fill every frame with interest and every line of dialog with sweet poison and cutting ambiguity john c <UNK> as <UNK> long suffering <UNK> technical producer <UNK> turns in a hilarious sharp performance as does the great michael <UNK> the film is a flawless underrated masterpiece of superb writing awesome acting and brutal <UNK> direction the stewart <UNK> score is brilliant too
<START> the gig is a tight funny and poignant little movie about a group of friends that have gathered together on a regular basis to play for fun the group unexpectedly lands a real paying job in <UNK> <UNK> a gig br br they travel to <UNK> ny for a two week gig at a summer resort minus one member who <UNK> out due to <UNK> cancer at the last minute they hire a professional to take his place things get <UNK> as an over the hill frankie <UNK> type attempts a comeback at the resort and tries to <UNK> the group as his band br br the attitude the professional bass player gave the guys <UNK> true by <UNK> up to play the two week gig they were taking bread out of the mouths of someone who needed the job to feed his or her family while pop rock rap country and western and r b stars make money off of albums jazz musicians have to travel abroad to make a living almost nobody gets rich the guys living their dream also cost others a needed <UNK> br br i believe that almost everyone who can play a musical <UNK> with some <UNK> dreams about playing a paying gig one time or another woody allen and kevin bacon are two popular examples of this amateur to professional <UNK> i especially recommend this movie to anyone who has ever played music <UNK> my mom who was a musician loved it
<START> holy crap the beginning picked up where the first one left off good start then it goes downhill from there you it looked like as if you were watching tv and you keep on switching between this teenage soap opera a predator movie and some crappy detective show the characters that are introduced in the first ten minutes don't have anything to do with each other until the final 45 minutes or so the characters of the teenage soap opera and the actual alien story br br then for the end the producers were quickly running out of money and decided to end the movie so they decided to drop a <UNK> on the city br br p s what the crap is the deal with the cameras being so <UNK> in you can't tell what's going on seriously movie makers do a good job with fight scenes and make it to where we can see the fight
<START> nothing is sacred just ask ernie these days everybody has a video camera and a movie is hardly out before the spoofs start flying quickly written and shot and often posted directly to the internet spoofs are hot these days and we go out of our way to make sure filmmakers don't get off on their own self importance 25 years ago when the first star wars was made it was a different world filmmaking was the <UNK> of a <UNK> few and spoofs were very rare then god gave us <UNK> wars it was shot to look cheap or was it just cheap and the audio was obviously recorded after the fact does that take away from the experience heck no that's what makes it so great it was raw and <UNK> and hit relentlessly on some of the more pretentious moments of the original movie from <UNK> waving around a <UNK> instead of a <UNK> i did that when i was young to the <UNK> monster to <UNK> ben <UNK> just a little headache remark this film short is as much a part of the phenomenon as any of the actual star wars films rent it buy it borrow it from a friend and may the farce be with you always
<START> is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from peter <UNK> but from the swedish cinema industry itself it is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before christmas in december 1945 which it does very well almost the whole plot takes place on a train non stop to berlin on the train is a mix of <UNK> nuns <UNK> <UNK> murderers <UNK> and the failure literature critic played by the in sweden famous actor <UNK> the leading role is the type of person that although his intentions are for the best seems to drag everyone near him in a extremely funny way into disaster and to a living hell especially for a from the <UNK> war <UNK> wounded soldier played by the extremely funny comedian robert on the train is also a doctor who <UNK> on his wife with his mistress they have together planned to murder the doctors wife that is also travelling with the same train without any knowledge about her husbands intentions will the wife of the doctor <UNK> the plans to murder her and will everyone else survive the unlucky fellow
<START> this is the best television series for children and adults ever john hurt is a great actor with many excellent performances over many years but he was born to play the <UNK> the scripts for almost every episode are superb pieces of <UNK> and the productions run the gamut of the emotions being alternately funny sad happy exciting and always <UNK> beautiful it is hard to pick a best episode from so many excellent <UNK> but the soldier and death with its timeless pathos is <UNK> it is a series to watch with your children over and over again
<START> unlike http www imdb com title this movie provides no background information we are shown a <UNK> of the fall of his mock process and execution but unless one studied the revolution quite <UNK> it is difficult to understand where characters come from <UNK> and thus to appreciate them for what they are and joe could be the same person to the viewer for example <UNK> were close friends since their youth and this explains how <UNK> acts those who know the facts though will easily <UNK> themselves and appreciate this good movie with actors delivering solid acting no useless subplots and good <UNK> of the times and are the best characters but all do a good job even the <UNK> saint just portrayed as sort of psychopath was a period of <UNK> whose importance hasn't been fully documented and that for the most part were driven by ambition greed and the <UNK> of personal <UNK> fed to ignorant sans as the next <UNK> step against <UNK>
<START> this film has a decidedly weird setting taking place in a school that's really old to begin with but it certainly doesn't look like any <UNK> medical school environment very gothic and atmospheric as for the film itself well ok the premise is a bit far fetched but hey that's why we watch movies isn't it and it's less far fetched than some of the garbage that's out these days that's for sure medical students are <UNK> with <UNK> death as in allowing themselves to be briefly dead so they can experience what the <UNK> is like it's kind of nice in some cases till parts of it come back with the voyager and start <UNK> in their <UNK> lives i hadn't seen this film in years till i got it on dvd and i have to say that i'd forgotten just how good it was and it struck me that julia roberts looks truly beautiful in this film not like actresses of today that are supposedly gorgeous but are dressed and made up like cheap <UNK> <UNK> the good old days anyway this is a great flick perhaps not for <UNK> christians but many others may enjoy it 8 out of 10 stars
<START> good animation nice character design and a light hearted story make no enjoyable to watch br br after my first viewing i thought that this anime was pretty good but but was much better on for a second watch br br this is because it is done out of <UNK> order and once you re watch it in correct order you notice connections you didn't see before or it may be that you see a second meaning to some events you didn't notice before you may want to read the original novels not manga by before after seeing this the anime is very good at <UNK> every detail in the stories it shows br br however there are some short stories from the book that are not animated but are <UNK> to <UNK> w wishes attached shown in episode 14 overall this anime is actually very good once after brief of the plot reading the book <UNK> upon it as well it is a nice break from the <UNK> jump anime that seem to be taking over
<START> a young couple father ben solid charles <UNK> wife <UNK> the lovely <UNK> and their daughter the cute of i <UNK> mama fame find themselves trapped in a small california desert town populated by hysterical <UNK> worse yet there's a <UNK> satanic cult that's been <UNK> little children for their own diabolical purposes director bernard working from an offbeat and inspired script by william welch and l q jones devil times five director sean <UNK> came up with the bizarre story relates the <UNK> oddball plot at a slow yet steady pace and <UNK> creates a creepy edgy mysterious <UNK> atmosphere martin delivers a wonderfully wicked and <UNK> performance as doc <UNK> who's the <UNK> sinister leader of the evil <UNK> the top rate cast of excellent character actors qualifies as a substantial asset jones as gruff no nonsense sheriff moore as friendly local toby and charles robinson as a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> priest jack john arthur <UNK> bright polished widescreen cinematography jamie <UNK> spooky score and the wild rousing climactic black mass ritual are all likewise up to speed the idea of having toys come to murderous life is simply ingenious the opening scene with a toy tank coming real and <UNK> a family in their car is truly <UNK> nice <UNK> ambiguous ending too a <UNK> <UNK> and under appreciated winner
<START> nothing dull about this movie which is held together by fully realized characters with some depth to them even the <UNK> <UNK> have body language <UNK> performance is brilliant all will want and need a henry <UNK> as he must have been <UNK> is maybe <UNK> and <UNK> than anne <UNK> but she plays the part as written a victim caught in the jaws of a big huge baby br br cinematography is gorgeous in the <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> lubitsch lets these characters breathe and reveal their corruption down to the <UNK> of he takes his time which can try the patience of an audience <UNK> to being carried away by action but the time is worth spending slow your <UNK> and watch this minor miracle of german silent film
<START> this was very funny even if it fell apart a little at the end does not go overboard with homage after to hitchcock owen danny <UNK> was lucky he had strangers on a train playing at the local cinema so the movie flat out tells you that that was the inspiration br br <UNK> is very funny but also a little sad he has no friends and all he wants to do is write and have someone like his writing his teacher billy crystal is going through some serious writers block of his own and his wife has stolen his book and made it her own success which also has him frustrated a great deal br br best parts are the book <UNK> by mr one hundred girls i'd like to <UNK> and all scenes with anne <UNK> who is so horrible that even mother <UNK> would have wanted to kill her too
<START> this awful effort just goes to show what happens when you not only use computers to generate the effects but also let them <UNK> the plot and write the script someone somewhere has obviously come up with a new bit of <UNK> that asks a few questions then <UNK> out four hours of loosely connected clichés lousy dialogue and a collection of stock characters that you end up wishing had all drowned in the first five minutes br br tom <UNK> took the prize for worst performance saying that he was wooden would be an insult to trees it's hard to fault robert <UNK> in almost anything he does but the odds were <UNK> against even him in this one especially since he was for some <UNK> reason required to adopt a <UNK> london accent br br a complete <UNK>
<START> being <UNK> myself i take interest in the history of <UNK> it has been our only colony for many years <UNK> was a <UNK> but not a colony and it is part of our country's history nowadays it seems to be very popular to say that all that the <UNK> did to <UNK> was wrong especially in the 19th century i'm not saying that bad things didn't happen of course they did but back then this wasn't <UNK> do you really think the french or the brits were that much <UNK> in their <UNK> no they weren't it was <UNK> at the time for our king leopold ii to use <UNK> as a way to gain personal wealth it was his private property it didn't belong to the state then and he tried to make the most out of it of course gruesome things like hands being chopped off happened and yes to todays standards that's <UNK> but in those days it was common practice and it has to be said all this didn't happen anymore during the last decades i know several people who have lived an worked in <UNK> for many years before the <UNK> of independence it's true that they had several black servants but they are very nice people and i really can't imagine they ever treated them bad for as far as i know they have always treated them with a lot of respect however i'm not saying all <UNK> did in fact if they weren't that old now almost all about 80 years old now they would love to return to <UNK> br br the good thing about this movie is that it gives an historically accurate vision on what happened during the last years of <UNK> and the first years of independence the story isn't as black and white perhaps not the best words in this context but how else to explain what i mean as i feared it would be it doesn't say that all the <UNK> did was wrong and all the did was good it shows perfectly how the in their rush of getting independent from the <UNK> didn't mind to accept help from the russians as well as the americans who both had more eye for the raw <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rubber and getting the in their political <UNK> and weren't all that interested in their independence it does not only give a good idea of how became more powerful but also how played a double role it shows the <UNK> reaction on some of our <UNK> being <UNK> threatened and even murdered my father was one of the who were send to <UNK> to rescue the <UNK> it gives a good idea of the political problems encountered as the <UNK> didn't want to be part of the republic the role that the <UNK> had in the murder on it all gets it's part in this movie br br the story seems to be very accurate and the characters really look and act like the real ones this movie has been able to give a very good idea of what life in <UNK> in the late fifties and early sixties was like and should be seen by everybody who is interested in the history of the country but it should also be shown in history classes especially in <UNK> because it's a part of our history that should never be forgotten i give it a 7 5 10 perhaps even an 8 10
<START> to sum this movie up it is <UNK> carrying his <UNK> over into the realm of comedic farce the predictable result is that he is constantly stepping on all the jokes by <UNK> on surrounding them with blood <UNK> violence and extremely hateful characters there is also evidence of his continuing efforts to insult and <UNK> everything in sight but then to apologize for it with weak gestures to the pc basically the movie just doesn't work its plot is beyond contrived the characters are one dimensional cliches there is no <UNK> or development of anything and the comedy where it is not totally out of place is the worst kind of high concept drivel br br morgan freeman and <UNK> <UNK> are completely wasted on characters that seem like parodies of studio driven audience <UNK> no matter what make them likeable neutral and <UNK> and full of moral <UNK> <UNK> glover is in here just long enough to convince you that he doesn't belong in movies anymore chris rock actually has negative chemistry with fellow <UNK> freeman it's as if they are acting in different rooms even when they are two <UNK> away from each other in effect chris rock seems like a digital insert at least he isn't as annoying as jar jar br br <UNK> 15 minutes may well be up by now it's already looking like he's <UNK> his welcome
<START> unlike most people who've commented i was born after the last <UNK> mccoy episode and so couldn't have compared the two centuries of doctor who at first i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher <UNK> took control of the <UNK> and the <UNK> of the series i have since then seen old episodes of doctor who and some where great but like the doctor the series needed to <UNK> to continue the 21st century doctor who's are great i thought martha was great almost a match for the doctor and if jack's appearance is anything to go by she's going to be brilliant when she cameos in series 4 or 5 br br speaking of jack the spin of <UNK> is also brilliant and you should watch both of these <UNK> though this is definitely more suitable for kids however if you insist that this isn't the same and just isn't doctor who please just stay in your basement br br 10 10
<START> very straight not happy with the movie br br the main center of the movie is the story where the lady is the mother of all the <UNK> and all the things br br if they can more explain that how this is happening and all the stuff then it was quite a fun and more rating for this movie br br the end was very short and sudden till now actor of the movie was to save her then at last he told sorry now we are late oh crap br br what was the story and how this all this thing happen i think they can put all these <UNK> so the end user like us will be satisfied that yes we are happy with the movie br br any way but nice idea and nice try so i will say 4 or max 4 5
<START> sonny chiba as everyone knows is the man in this film he portrays <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1994 a real martial artist who fought over 50 <UNK> with his bare won interesting him up anyway chiba only kills one bull in the film but it's a memorable scene and as the liner notes say right up there with the zombie vs shark scene in zombi the film also offers up loads of hand to hand combat and a decent plot to boot though i don't believe all of it is true this film is the first of the <UNK> trilogy chiba made and is recommended for fans of martial arts action finally three neat little <UNK> part of the opening theme was used in kill bill volume 1 <UNK> himself appears in the opening sequences and that is because he trained chiba in real life for five years
<START> the motion picture association of america has seen fit to advise potential viewers and this is particularly useful to parents and <UNK> that this film which is <UNK> titled <UNK> is given a r rating the r rating has specific information which allows any person who not knowing anything about a film to know something about what this film provides the r was <UNK> for sexual content including nudity and perverse dialog language crude sense of humor and drug use there is no reward in viewing such a film though it would be useful to know if this could be removed as a possibility at all i would as this reviewer remove such a possibility this is a film <UNK> merely a 1 was not the equal to a number as it did not qualify as a film to be counted in fact such as this purpose is with this film so should such a purpose be with this films place at all this is a <UNK> and <UNK> that should of been given a much <UNK> interpretation because at no point is conduct or language suitable for viewing and this kind of film may wish for a <UNK> rather than a <UNK> definition as to its content it is suggested <UNK> that the <UNK> definition would allow it is <UNK> put forth a criminal charge it may any way <UNK> of its rating this is a <UNK> world which would damage any persons viewing this film as its purpose is to commit an offense it is an offense and it is offensive in its purpose there is no sense of humor in the film but a <UNK> and indifferent purpose as to its <UNK> <UNK> without <UNK> this is a do not see list and perhaps not entirely necessary to say to any adults considering but to any whose interests concern the environment to which there children grow up in do not allow nor provide any young person the viewing of this film it is <UNK> society often sends the wrong message when these kinds of problems are in the public <UNK> let this not be one of those times
<START> as you can see i've <UNK> 2 comments about this show since 1991 and no <UNK> have still not made it available for general release br br however i recently <UNK> <UNK> to see if there was any way of getting hold of a copy and this was their <UNK> br br unfortunately there are no plans for this programme to be released on dvd video you can however purchase copies from our viewers <UNK> <UNK> their email address is viewers <UNK> <UNK> com br br hope you all now get the chance to enjoy this classic short comedy again br br
<START> this educational show focused on emotions interactions and relationships it was produced at <UNK> abc <UNK> and <UNK> in 90 <UNK> <UNK> this past week detroit public tv had a 1 1 2 hour clip show as part of their <UNK> drive wow the memories that <UNK> while i remembered the show there were segments that i'd forgotten about but remembered instantly a soon as they'd begin hot <UNK> holy detective <UNK> and the <UNK> in his face br br for more on the public television special do a search for hot <UNK> <UNK> concert
<START> looking at the ratings you would assume this is a classic but yet again its just another example of poor independent film makers trying to drum up interest in their movie they aren't even being smart about it 10 10 in the votes i guess that to buck the <UNK> and <UNK> all the 1 <UNK> it will get is this better than any decent zombie movie no br br acting corny and rubbish br br sound effects cheap and nasty if it wasn't for where the actors looked you wouldn't know where it was coming from br br cinematography these people act like they have borrowed their <UNK> camera right after watching the matrix less is more but more from this team is absolutely <UNK> br br zombies are rubbish as well i don't doubt most of these people will never be heard from again and it will be for good reason i hope zombies eat their eyes as this was 90 minutes of <UNK> that i wont get back br br and <UNK> ratings just makes it a million times worse br br one reviewer said it was one of the best horror movies he has seen in the last 30 years i can only assume that his recent <UNK> transplant was a success then br br watch the trailer as thats a warning as to how bad this film is
<START> i use imdb very much mainly reading comments of other people about movies <UNK> or not seen <UNK> thought it was time to write a few words about this movie that changed my life and the way i look a movie i think i have seen it at least a dozen times since <UNK> <UNK> when i saw it in the theatre for the first time br br i feel <UNK> is one of the best directors of all time and i think this is his best one it was his last one i was very sad the day i knew he has died because sure we lost the chance to get something more from him br br red is just the best <UNK> performance by <UNK> <UNK> cinematography by if you <UNK> seen it look for it if you have just come back to it br br red just a masterpiece please forgive my poor english reader
<START> i recently attended sundance as i have often done in years past and was treated to the small pleasures of the edgy little <UNK> the <UNK> of dark comedies and the now predictable <UNK> of <UNK> but then i saw mark and michael and i remembered why i so fell in love with the movies in the first place <UNK> across the screen with <UNK> daring and <UNK> back to the <UNK> early work of <UNK> <UNK> and the existential landscapes of antonioni it's an impossible film to easily explain which is one of its many strengths suffice it to say it's an adult fairy tale with many carefully layered levels of meaning it <UNK> my imagination and cast an <UNK> shadow over all the other films i saw this year it is a work of <UNK> <UNK> and a sophistication of writing not seen in most american movies i plan to <UNK> this film several times when it comes to my theater for it is a <UNK> piece of magic and mystery a haunting work where one can <UNK> the <UNK> of montana in search of angels and the very nature of heaven and earth the cast performs this piece with striking conviction particularly james woods and nick nolte who remind us of the nerve and daring displayed throughout the course of their careers maybe will help us find a new wave of american cinema where excellence in craft and writing become more the norm than the exception see it when it comes your way and take your friends for the questions will be many and the thoughts and feelings <UNK> by seeing will <UNK> memories of great movie once seen in your past and now hopefully may be returning with the <UNK> of the polish brothers
<START> first off mexican werewolf in <UNK> title is misleading as many others have pointed out it is actually about el which is a similar creature to a werewolf but by no means the same br br the production and editing just plain suck when it was over i probably wouldn't be able to give a very accurate description of what exactly the looked like for whenever it was in a scene despite one or two exceptions the camera turned all shaky and you could only see the <UNK> face clearly the special effects were laughably bad but that has to be expected from a low budget horror movie br br along with the terrible production comes the bad actors now a couple give fairly plausible performances erika fay and <UNK> hughes but then there were the bad actors everybody else who seemed to have no emotions whatsoever when people died then there's the absolutely terrible actor sara who gives one of the 2 worst performances i've ever seen in a movie i mean my god she was <UNK> bad br br the plot was very simple basically a is in a small <UNK> town killing off local residents and a group of teens look to stop it however even with the plot being this simple a few plot holes managed to <UNK> through br br anyways horrible movie however if you are looking for a movie to make fun of and laugh at with your friends one night this would be a pretty good one my friends and i had a good time watching this probably the 2nd worst movie i've ever seen 1 10 awful
<START> wonderful songs <UNK> animation and authentic live action make this a classic adaptation of a classic tale a nice british feel which sets it apart and above from the standard <UNK> sweet disney cartoons
<START> rabbit fever is a <UNK> collection of sketches each one of them <UNK> on a female personal device that was made popular by a single 1998 episode of sex and the city the latter half of 1998 rather than the early episodes which were all directed by women from opening <UNK> that make rabbit fever sound like a soft porn movie we are treated to a sea of predictable sketches with real and imaginary characters in a world run amok with women's addiction to <UNK> pleasure br br men as <UNK> <UNK> rather <UNK> explains have invented a gadget for women that makes men superfluous in the bedroom the rabbit <UNK> which some <UNK> suggest accounts for about a quarter of all <UNK> sales is so called because of little rabbit like long ears which <UNK> to <UNK> the <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> inside the <UNK> <UNK> the inside of the <UNK> the film interviews characters that attend <UNK> anonymous to help overcome their <UNK> as well as known people such as tom <UNK> posing as a professor or richard <UNK> amid scenes of <UNK> being banned on aircraft saying he would like to provide free <UNK> to his first class air travel passengers and ultimately to all of them br br the main weakness of the film is that the idea is not enough to sustain 85 minutes of cinema the sketches don't have the writing skills of say a charlotte church or ricky <UNK> to make them funny enough and while it might make <UNK> late night tv doesn't have a hook to get people to <UNK> up in public at <UNK> to watch masturbation jokes br br lines like it's been nearly a week since you used your rabbit how are you <UNK> wear rather thin after five minutes the film is based on the idea that the mere mention of the word will get a laugh and another one and another one frantic midnight drives to buy <UNK> might be amusing in real life but here they look rather <UNK> and the special <UNK> delivery service its welcome br br strangely the <UNK> gave it an 18 <UNK> in spite of zero violence hardly any explicit sex and sexual references that are less than any late night comedy show the company <UNK> the decision but the <UNK> didn't <UNK> at first sight this seems <UNK> on their part and their <UNK> advice now simply says contains frequent strong sex references one might think that youngsters would find masturbation jokes funnier than the most desperate of <UNK> night parties and the topic one worthy of debate but rabbit fever does not even have the saving grace of a balanced approach to its subject matter br br the best part is probably the rabbit song by who play a band called <UNK> in the film for those who have <UNK> off and <UNK> up at the end credits there is a bonus scene at the end of them to <UNK> them that they haven't missed anything
<START> just to correct something in a previous review here i don't believe this film is only for people who know london it's a case of a very specific situation being used to make universal comments jack says in an introduction to the published script that it was meant to be about characters who by going though this <UNK> knowledge test gain some measure of self knowledge br br i think it's one of the most perfectly written dramas i've seen technically it's <UNK> <UNK> at conveying quite complex details but it's also <UNK> in how it involves you at the start you know no more about this london knowledge test than the main characters but you get <UNK> up right along with them until it's important to you you become tremendously proud of those characters who succeed and you are crushed for those who don't especially one whose downfall without giving anything anyway will make your hands fly to your face br br also just as a point of fact <UNK> <UNK> character mr burgess is called the vampire not dracula you don't need to know this i'm not saying it's crucial but it's a measure of the drama once you've seen this you will want everyone to and you will about its every detail br br i hope you get to see it br br william
<START> bride of <UNK> is one of the better horror movies to come out in the past ten years and could be one of the best horror films of the 90's br br spoilers br br <UNK> girlfriend <UNK> jennifer <UNK> manages to find his <UNK> remains after being sucked into the fan at the end of part 3 and brings him to life in her trailer park her neighbor jessie nick and his girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are being tormented by her uncle john ritter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when he refuses to marry her so she buys a doll for him to play with <UNK> kills <UNK> and then <UNK> her soul into the doll she got him in order for them to be placed back into human bodies they have to travel to new jersey to retrieve an <UNK> to do so jessie sees this as an opportunity to escape from ritter and they set out on the journey but not before ritter is killed by <UNK> and <UNK> along the way several bizarre incidents force them to stop at a bed and breakfast when several more people are killed they call up their best friend gordon to <UNK> out the situation they convince him neither one of them are the killers as the police have began to solve the crimes he finds <UNK> body in a <UNK> in the back of the van thinking he has been set up he confronts them about it <UNK> and <UNK> then turn real to prove they did it which gets killed the group steals a <UNK> home and arrives at the cemetery jessie and <UNK> get <UNK> and <UNK> to turn on each other giving them enough to escape <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and forces her to get his <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> their <UNK> which gives jessie and <UNK> enough time to kill the both of them as the police arrive and <UNK> them of the crimes br br the good news i have to give the most amount of props to the fx department as <UNK> and <UNK> as dolls look completely convincing the scenes with them together are the movies main highlights including a hilarious conversation where <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on how serial killers in the 90's work that being said the amount of one liners in this movie that are actually funny is incredible <UNK> gets the most of them but <UNK> cracks a few gems as well it is actually funnier than what hollywood calls comedies these days the gore is <UNK> and shockingly realistic several deaths in this movie are actually original and creative turning ritter into a new form of <UNK> was a totally brilliant scene the couple was a nice death scene as well for teenage love the pairing of and <UNK> works great they have a great chemistry together and actually behave like a normal couple i also have to admit that the first time i saw this movie i did jump during certain scenes and that shows what an incredible job director <UNK> did he learned enough apparently to do the same thing with freddy vs jason he knows how to stage set ups and pay offs and here he shows some great skills that have a hong kong influenced look and style he could be the next great horror director if he keeps filling up his resume with films like those two nice soundtrack too like freddy vs jason br br the bad news for fans of cheesy movies this will be a great find however this film has a high cheese factor that may prevent the serious horror movie fan from having a good time enjoying this film the film knows it is a cheesy movie and <UNK> in it making a serious fan turned off because of things like the one liners it isn't all that bad of a movie but it has to be watched in the mind frame that it is a cheesy movie and that the cheesiness of certain scenes add to the movie not to take it away remove yourself from that state of mind and you may find yourself enjoying this movie br br the final verdict fans of cheesy movies and the other child's play movies will find a lot to like about this movie for serious horror fans take a look at it but keep in mind that it isn't a serious movie and that the cheesiness is supposed to be there and you might find yourself liking it br br rated r graphic violence graphic language brief nudity on a doll a shadowy puppet sex scene some drug use and numerous drug references
<START> forget the lousy acting that can be forgiven in this sort of film or even the terrible unnatural dialog and illogical events if my subtitles actually reflected what was said far worse is the blatant absence of a <UNK> or experienced director who maybe took a holiday with the editor while the film was being made watching the film it feels completely out of date even though it was <UNK> made 7 years ago a computer virus as a <UNK> to the <UNK> lol a <UNK> up ghost images <UNK> on pictures he look over there is that is that a face zoom in on face <UNK> sound breaks off next scene scenes and sequences are poorly edited and as a result don't flow at all you'll be watching a girl finding a corpse still hanging from the <UNK> in one scene and then literally 10 seconds later seeing her again at some place apparently <UNK> smiling and going about br br apart from the many problems i have with the movie in terms of production value it is also painfully long and repetitive and thus utterly boring br br i recommend in <UNK> an oriental <UNK> horror movie done well
<START> 1 <UNK> <UNK> is in the movie ten minutes altogether including when he's serving <UNK> drinks to his boss 2 a lot of street thugs looking like <UNK> <UNK> get instantly <UNK> by the asian superhero who talks like an illegal alien just out of the back of a <UNK> truck 3 thug let this to me shirt off gay model like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he's dead on the floor with his neck <UNK> <UNK> or balls broken 4 cheap semi sex scenes where the white broad come out of nowhere <UNK> the asian superhero 5 norton former c action movies star does nothing but pose as an eccentric trendy weapon <UNK> who <UNK> white <UNK> girls hand picked at a night club where they willingly follow some idiot posing as a millionaire <UNK> at them you <UNK> what you <UNK> 6 yes the local police captain is involved and yes the first butchered cop is the former <UNK> <UNK> of the super hero 7 action scenes are fake like a <UNK> <UNK> chinese tries some spinning kick b skinny leg of chinese to the throat of <UNK> thug c finishing death move to his head too much like walker texas ranger fake action 8 end titles finally br br utter rubbish those people are good enough only to be stand ins or body <UNK> in other c movies and be credited at most <UNK> as stunt crew provided by the county prison
<START> i've seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it br br the conversations between and her mother plus and matthew are very touching the community is shown very <UNK> and as as it usually is br br although certain things could have done with a bit more explanation if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in the first place the scenes following matthew being found in his car would be more understandable br br luckily <UNK> releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understand br br i would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in london and is not longer available to see i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it
<START> the person making <UNK> in this movie was so realistic that person must have been trained so well if i were buying <UNK> from the store featured in this fine romantic comedy i would demand to be served by the guy who trained the person who played the guy selling <UNK>
<START> i disagree 100 with the reviewer who <UNK> 100 with the reviewer who gave this short movie an f grade <UNK> in heavily on political propaganda only <UNK> joe <UNK> lack of ability to pull another howling out of his bag of tricks the masters of horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly horrifying tales save for this episode br br despite gaining acclaim from those who wish to promote it's political <UNK> <UNK> is the least effective episode of <UNK> season one unlike the rest of the series <UNK> entry is a parody of the genre falling short of both horror and humor in it's ham <UNK> delivery of a hackneyed political point br br <UNK> can really only be blamed for pulling this stinker off the shelf as it wasn't his creation the zombie sub genre is very popular this decade and among the crop of predictable george romero <UNK> and vacuous fantasies are a number of works designed to push political or <UNK> messages such works are not written by or intended for true horror fans maybe <UNK> really isn't a a master of horror either what has he been up to since the howling after all br br if you want a lame anti war zombie flick with a few pop culture references passed off as humor <UNK> may be just your thing if you are a horror fan looking for something masterful pick up most any other episode of the series my personal favorite was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> based loosely on a classic comic short by the team of bruce jones and truly creepy
<START> ok everybody agreed on what was the best season the first and killing off <UNK> was a bad also killing off others was bad blame the directors and writers for it bad boys but i still think this is the best scifi series ever sorry guys i can't help it i see that the quality of the series was after the first season still it's easy to accept liam as the new main character if you are over <UNK> he is really mysterious the thing that shocked me most was when <UNK> was written out of the story and how that was something she didn't deserve and what do we get some blonde chick called <UNK> with absolutely no character but these stay mysterious and you stay wondering about true plans till the end true <UNK> the conversations between and are sometimes brilliant br br i understand that when you jump in on an episode from the <UNK> 4th or <UNK> season you may not understand this show but when you watch from the beginning you just cant break loose br br the acting is great the special fx are marvellous the music is beautiful and the plot intriguing gotta see this guys
<START> this is a wonderful thriller i watched many times and never can get enough of it's all about the obsessive love 5 people have for <UNK> in paris un lucky <UNK> false identities the music makes it really gripping there are hardly any flaws in the characters just the end is not very credible but a definite must see still
<START> this is a film people either love it or despise it it seems me i despise it the film comes from the same context as lindsay <UNK> oh lucky man but while that is a masterpiece this is just horrible br br both films take <UNK> unfinished novel america for their inspiration and general ideal america is a surreal story of a <UNK> travels through the country <UNK> uses the this character as a pure <UNK> one who does not change over the course of the journey although the book is about 300 pages and still seems only a quarter finished so we'll never know allowing <UNK> to concentrate and comment on the absurd surreal situations and surroundings oh lucky man follows this same <UNK> to show britain through the eyes of malcolm mcdowell and weekend does the same for france br br both films are also hugely <UNK> using various tricks and techniques to point up the fact that this is not real this is etc but the difference comes where oh lucky man uses the constructed film to convey the absurdity of life and the class system weekend uses the constructed film to <UNK> us to death with <UNK> <UNK> because godard goes further than anderson in his <UNK> principles we end up with two principle characters in which we have no investment at all we're forced to spend 90 minutes with them yet we couldn't care less about them deliberately so but in doing this godard leaves us with a film that is entirely about his own message which in the first half of the film is provided through relentless and overbearing symbolism and in the second half through a series of long speeches directed to camera combined with unpleasant and unnecessary scenes such as the really horrible pig <UNK> far worse than any of the off camera violence of the car crashes br br the end result is like listening to a student political <UNK> <UNK> on and on and on about his views whilst repeatedly kicking you in the head so that you get the message the problem with <UNK> is if you alienate the audience too much then you've <UNK> them from what you are trying to convey which always seemed self evident to me br br the parts that really stick in the for this movie though is the contrast between the extremely sexually explicit verbal description of the <UNK> at the start and the off screen comical rape in the middle which even if it could be viewed as <UNK> completely destroys the film's faith in itself and it's characters what little of it existed in the first place it's so french with a capital f it hurts br br watch oh lucky man instead that is a work of genius weekend is a work of <UNK> br br two stars and only for the traffic jam scene and the piano scene which are just hints at genius although they actually make the end result more frustrating and unsatisfying as without them this is a bad film by the worst most pretentious director in the world with them well it's obvious that this is a damn good technical director making the most intellectually pretentious film in the world somehow that's far worse
<START> as a <UNK> resident i'd like to see the who were <UNK> down the electricity plants to raise the <UNK> get some jail time too br br i thought the movie was pretty good and has some very informative pieces while they stuck to how <UNK> rose and crashed i found it really interesting however when the movie focused on it's anti bush <UNK> it made me wonder if they were really being accurate br br it's fine to point out any connection the <UNK> had to <UNK> but the monster was created while <UNK> was president the <UNK> energy crisis happened under <UNK> watch both were in office during <UNK> but neither are held <UNK> in any way rather many minutes are spent on how bush was friends with lay so what lay played golf with <UNK> and spent the night in the lincoln bedroom why are <UNK> given such a free pass in this film i think most politicians are a waste of our <UNK> money so i'm not partial to either party but i hate feeling like i'm subject to someone's political agenda when i watch a documentary yes politicians deserve some blame but i really doubt that the only guilty one's have <UNK> after their names i found no value in portraying the <UNK> as kay lovers when <UNK> received just as much <UNK> campaign money as <UNK> did like i said it <UNK> the rest of the film for me because it makes me suspicious of the rest of the facts they lay out
<START> as has already been noted the short film every sunday 1936 could be considered the first music video this was a happy accident resulting from <UNK> need to <UNK> out a variety of short films for exhibit with its feature length material they had a couple fresh young singing talents judy garland and deanna durbin available and essentially slapped together a blend of music styles in a kind of norman <UNK> concert in the park setting br br who would have <UNK> at the time that they would capture the best collection of images since <UNK> <UNK> steps sequence br br it's sunday with some <UNK> folks sitting around a small wooden band shell in the park while a tired looking ensemble play <UNK> events unfold and the next sunday judy and deanna save the day the operatic deanna sings <UNK> <UNK> the kiss and garland follows with the <UNK> <UNK> with a swing the climax nicely <UNK> the two styles into a <UNK> of <UNK> br br a must see br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> this movie is proof you can't just go to a and read <UNK> of films and pick one and give it a try br br while i'll give 'em great credit for having produced a film with halfway decent special effects on such a low budget and at least a halfway decent script and story line unfortunately it was only just that halfway decent br br if you like movies where things aren't all neatly wrapped up and don't mind low budget effects you might like this film honestly it wasn't really my cup of tea i should've just gone to bed rather than spend my time watching br br for a better science fiction movie produced on an even lower budget have a look at <UNK>
<START> i watched the longer version and could not take my eyes off the screen minutes passed and yet it seemed like only an hour had gone by the characters were very believable and entertaining and the photography was excellent the story pulled me in and held my attention i will definitely watch this again and again this true story telling at it's best not <UNK> usual cheap thrills and skin deep <UNK> i've seen a quite a lot of reviews on this movie most seem to pan the film or give it faint praise basically it's a great film that received unfairly harsh reviews watch it for yourself with an open mind if you like westerns historic period pieces albeit historically inaccurate you'll enjoy the movie superb 10 10
<START> the movie heart of darkness is an insult to the book by joseph conrad to be quite honest the movie made me want to fall asleep on the other hand the book was definitely extraordinary i feel that the movie left out several key elements and missed some of the main points from the book in addition the actors were boring and lacked originality and enthusiasm br br the book while not an adventure story or easy to understand is full of hidden meaning and interesting twists in the plot the book though very confusing and complex is astonishing when you do finally understand it you feel as if you have actually learned something the <UNK> or short story had several key ideas like <UNK> and <UNK> which the movie left out in addition several key scenes were changed which in return affected the entire plot many of the scenes seemed to be very choppy in the sense that they did not fit together in summary the movie seemed to be a bad interpretation of the book br br i would only recommend watching this movie if you cannot picture or understand the book but otherwise i would skip this one it was dreadful and in complete <UNK> if you have never read the book then definitely do not watch the movie because you need the basic information from the book to understand the movie the movie was a horrible spin off of an outstanding and detailed book
<START> the mario series is back and in my opinion better than ever galaxy is the most creative mario yet even more so than super mario 64 the controls are great some of the best for the <UNK> beautiful <UNK> design as well the levels are very big and the good old bosses are back there is tons to explore in this game definitely a high level of replay value i only have 2 complaints 1 the story is a little to similar to mario 64 and 2 the difficulty isn't very high though it does require some patience mario fans the game you've been waiting for casual <UNK> this game is more than worth the buy 9 8 out of 10
<START> i consider myself a huge horror movie fan one night i wanted to just rent some newer horror movies to make fun of then i rented milo i was so surprised by this movie it scared the hell outta me that's not something i can say very often usually halloween only scares me br br two other friends watched it with me and were left with a disturbed feeling a good feeling if you ask me after watching a horror movie if you are <UNK> then what's the point br br this movie was original it didn't follow the normal <UNK> of a horror movie that's why movies like valentine bombed for me br br of course many are left with unanswered questions as most horror movies do it is worth the rent though
<START> warning spoilers br br lord knows i have seen some bad movies in my time and this one makes me just as angry this is an insult to people who are looking for a bad movie the story involves a <UNK> who discovers her boyfriend badly acted by otherwise great robert wagner is a murder thief and just an overall <UNK> face after the <UNK> takes off he sends guided <UNK> to destroy the <UNK> so while the <UNK> is traveling at the speed of light our hero played with utter stupidity george kennedy opens the window in the <UNK> then sticks his hand out the window to fire at the missile i'm no rocket scientist but it seems his hand would at least get a wind burn then towards the final climax when the <UNK> is headed for certain disaster and everyone will die a passenger turns to his <UNK> and <UNK> marriage a priest just happens to be sitting in the next row and proceeds to marry them as the planes is crashing i'm not making this up wow the guy who wrote the script must have been <UNK> <UNK> for a week
<START> after seeing the <UNK> special edition in a two pack with the fox in the <UNK> i decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites br br the <UNK> is a classic definitely it might not be a five star classic but it is a fun film and makes a good <UNK> entertainment it is somewhat a light <UNK> from the darker more serious disney classics the <UNK> tries to be a light hearted musical comedy and i think it just about succeeds br br the storyline doesn't really make much sense and i don't think the plot is particularly strong but it is certainly not weak the animation and backgrounds are a bit <UNK> in places typical of disney's 70s films but it does have a <UNK> old fashioned charm about it br br the <UNK> strongest points are the characters the music and the humour the music is very memorable try getting wants to be a <UNK> out your head in a hurry the songs are written by the <UNK> brothers who also did the music for the jungle book there was one song called <UNK> never felt <UNK> that was going to be in the film but sadly didn't make it into the final feature it is a shame because i think it would have fit in very well br br the characters are unforgettable thomas is voiced by phil harris and is basically <UNK> in a <UNK> form eva <UNK> gives <UNK> this warm and <UNK> feel and the voices actually sound like children and not an actor imitating the voice of a child the secondary characters are here by the dozen and yet you still end up understanding their personalities edgar the butler plays a similar role to cruella de <UNK> but he's more comical than scary often ending up in funny situations even though he's the bad guy he's still lovable all the same br br the two british <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> really had me cracking up along with their crazy and drunk uncle i also like the dogs who tend to argue over who is 'the leader ' i could go on but i won't spoil it but i can tell you the <UNK> is funny and will entertain everyone without having to resort to <UNK> toilet humour br br the bottom line the <UNK> might not be disney's <UNK> achievement or even their strongest film from the 70s that award is a tie between the <UNK> and the many adventures of the <UNK> but it is an enjoyable romp and is sure to entertain if you are looking for a dazzling work of art you might be better off watching <UNK> but if you want a fun night in the <UNK> is the way to go it is a charming and lovable film and it's impossible to dislike enjoy and besides it's good to have a film where cats aren't seen as the villains
<START> the film was disappointing i saw it on broadway with <UNK> peters and she was outstanding maybe as she herself on to the end of her musical career her of lands her in role that she <UNK> re <UNK> and as her own <UNK> singing is always <UNK> always flat and lacking to show her ability as an actress to be entertaining this performance was dying for a stronger lead and a stronger cast so that the others would be memorable in <UNK> absence another criticism she smiles directly into the camera every time she start singing i know it is musical theater but please leave some grace cannot perform like <UNK> or streisand might in a <UNK> tour out of character and out of context
<START> just saw the movie it's actually pretty good the left me an impression of either yet another one man show turned film <UNK> la <UNK> de nice or an expensive stupid french comedy surprisingly it's neither secret agent <UNK> <UNK> is stupid but at least he sort of knows it whereas i've always found that james bond was stupid but acted like a smart <UNK> dialogue is witty with a lot of tongue in cheek humour that one would expect from a british rather than a french movie the women and the music are beautiful a refreshing trip into the past when the bad guys were ex nazis or soviet <UNK> cars were shiny and france had <UNK>
<START> this multi <UNK> thriller kept my attention throughout it is disturbing and informative to see how perverse human behavior can be it is also <UNK> as to what past wounds can <UNK> present behavior no one save sandra <UNK> partner is very likable however all are believable sandra did an excellent job her character cassie comes alive with all her pain and fear and <UNK> she is a survivor and so her life experience finally brings her to a healing moment i enjoyed this movie very much tom <UNK>
<START> this is a pretty obscure dumb horror movie set in the 1970s <UNK> it is really stupid and lame for the first half then it actually starts to get good for the last half there is a scene with the hero running to save his friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing i don't know it is mesmerizing i was impressed with the night time scenes because it actually looked like night unlike most low budget horror films where it still looks like daytime i feel like the director was really talented but was working with a <UNK> budget and a tough schedule there are a few scenes towards the end the one mentioned above and also the end credits that are extremely cool this movie could have been a genuine classic if it left its scooby doo conventions behind and went straight for the throat i was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be i couldn't take my eyes off of it and i had to ask myself why
<START> low rent version of ashley <UNK> double <UNK> sutherland is too professional to be bad but what was fonda thinking the penelope ann miller curse continues think about it when has she ever been in a good movie other than other people's money and i'm not saying she's bad but all of her movies fail in some way
<START> i mention that there may be a spoiler here just to be <UNK> because of what i discuss although i don't really think i am giving away anything important any <UNK> are really <UNK> to this film's success or a viewer's ability to enjoy it br br while not without some very minor flaws this is a beautiful and very moving film about friendship time <UNK> and the choices people make about their lives yet at the same time it is also a very humorous film with small mostly understated bits of comedy woven in throughout for much of the film it progresses at a fairly <UNK> pace but it does not seem slow at all since the film draws one into it and into the lives of the characters and at first it is mostly rather light hearted some have commented that much of the film seems slow but it is such a wonderful portrayal of the lives of such sympathetic characters that one could watch it almost endlessly as it progresses the film becomes more emotional and moving up to the very end and the progression is handled wonderfully br br eventually some of the characters decide to rob a bank and although it is perhaps somewhat hard to believe that is beside the point it is a wonderful addition to <UNK> the love that these friends have for each other while at the same time it accents the humour and adds a little more irony to the film and although hardly original to have a bunch of old guys rob a bank the context and details are quite original and they do it wonderfully making it really quite funny as well such as when if i remember correctly <UNK> his <UNK> to disguise the fact he's old br br as i said most of the other comedy is rather low key but still very humorous so i was constantly <UNK> throughout br br the actors are probably the real key to this film they <UNK> the characters with deep personality and sympathy and portray them with great care and warmth there are some small <UNK> or tiny details of the characters' personalities which are pulled off smoothly and beautifully of course the film is about the personalities of these very characters and how they care for and interact with one another it succeeds so well because of them and if lesser actors had the roles the movie could well have failed br br is not without sadness but that simply provides the full range of emotions and provides a more powerful experience in fact the film is so moving and filled with so much love from such rich characters that it is in the end a very heart warming satisfying and even happy film despite its sadness i could watch it over and over
<START> a tough sell british playwright ronald <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> stage drama into loud <UNK> film about wwii shakespearean theatrical <UNK> <UNK> with an aged <UNK> brilliant but <UNK> star at the end of his <UNK> the actor's <UNK> assistant works <UNK> to get his master <UNK> and <UNK> for a production of king <UNK> during an air raid yet both men are losing their grip on their <UNK> situation based on the <UNK> years of actor donald whose <UNK> was ronald <UNK> this acclaimed production would seem to be a welcome <UNK> for scenery chewing <UNK> unfortunately albert finney at this point in his career not at all elderly seems too <UNK> and quick thinking to play the actor finney and oscar nominated director peter <UNK> cannot <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> in a way that makes sense to us so that in one scene he's stopping a train with the commanding echo of his voice and in the next he's curiously falling apart with such a wreck of a human being in the midst of failing health and <UNK> one would assume a dedicated assistant would go to great <UNK> to protect his boss and his future yet servant tom <UNK> and <UNK> and finney to carry on rather than rest who played this part on stage and was nominated for an oscar alongside finney for best actor is far more <UNK> to his role and eventually his <UNK> <UNK> and confusion achieve the only real feeling in the film these two thankfully do not peck at each other's heads and <UNK> <UNK> is careful not to fall into a love hate pattern which could possibly be perceived in the film's first act but without a <UNK> of servant vs celebrity there's nothing much to behold in this portrait except for the <UNK> of <UNK> the hint at what once was 1 2 from
<START> i saw this movie partly because of the sheer number of good reviews at netflix and from it i <UNK> a valuable lesson not a lesson about ethnic diversity however the lesson i learned is don't trust reviews br br yes racism sucks and people are complicated but the people who actually need to see this movie are going to be the ones who are the least drawn to it and least affected by it if they do see it the only reason that i can think of for the number of good reviews is that it's being reviewed by people who aren't used to thinking or who've seen their first thought provoking movie and somehow think that <UNK> invented the concept in fact he basically made this film which should be called racism for <UNK> as emotionally wrenching as possible seemingly to give people who don't spend a lot of time thinking the impression that they've discovered some fundamental truth that's never been covered in a film before <UNK> and the art of motorcycle it's not an after school special for the <UNK> masses cut into bite sized overwrought ham <UNK> pieces to make it easier to swallow without too much <UNK> br br it's as if they portrayed everyone as being the worst possible extreme simply to make us happy that we're such good people because we don't identify with the characters let's face it people nobody <UNK> with these characters because they're all cardboard <UNK> and stereotypes or predictably reverse stereotypes it's well acted even if the dialog is atrocious and cleverly executed so much that you don't think to ask where's the <UNK> until you can tell the film is <UNK> down the <UNK> car scene was well executed like much of the movie but went nowhere in the end br br the messages are very heavy handed and from the behind the scenes <UNK> the producers were clearly watching a different movie because there is very little to laugh about in this movie even during the intended funny parts i have to stress that this is not entertainment more like a high school diversity lesson call it the blood on the highway of racism they could even show this in high schools if it weren't for the side nude shot of jennifer <UNK> br br in this film everyone's a jerk and everyone learns a lesson except for michael <UNK> who gets the best role but the most predictable storyline br br this is a bad film with bad writing and good actors an ugly cartoon crafted by paul <UNK> for people who can't handle anything but the bold <UNK> in storytelling a picture painted with <UNK> br br crash is a depressing little nothing that <UNK> emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things
<START> i have always loved the muppets though most children's entertainment then wasn't that likable the <UNK> was the <UNK> are very very funny they are probably the most likable children's characters ever br br not only did the muppets have their own show they also have starred in many films from the <UNK> christmas carol to the <UNK> treasure island the first <UNK> movie the muppet movie was also like the show and the other films excellent br br the muppet movie is about how they all got started <UNK> the frog used to live in a swamp until one day a movie executive tells him that there are <UNK> for <UNK> in hollywood so <UNK> takes off for hollywood along the way he runs into lots of people such as <UNK> bear <UNK> the great and miss <UNK> also an evil man is trying to capture <UNK> br br all of the muppet films are highly enjoyable i mean they are all very funny this film has many film appearances such as steve martin mel brooks elliot <UNK> carol kane richard <UNK> and orson welles the muppet films are all very enjoyable i hear that jason <UNK> is going to star in one soon i can't wait to see it
<START> everything about this movie was bad the acting was bad and the plot was bad and were is all the blood and gore that was in demons which is a good movie and it was not scary at all my brother said that this movie was bad but i had to give it a chance since the first movie was very good when the movie was over i understand why my brother thought this movie was bad the only plus in this movie was the music by the <UNK> and the cult but this is a movie and the music soundtrack is not the most important thing and i saw that it has been released four sequels after this film i haven't seen none of them but can they be as awful as this one i have no plans to see them but maybe i will see them some time
<START> i thought i'd witnessed every <UNK> the crime gangster flick had to offer but the <UNK> <UNK> combination pull off some genuine thrills and surprises here thanks to the <UNK> <UNK> direction by <UNK> the atmospheric photography by lee <UNK> plus remarkably sharp film editing and flawless special effects brilliant acting helps too coop gives one of his most convincing performances as the <UNK> <UNK> turned <UNK> the sort of character progression he was to repeat in other roles such as sergeant york miss sidney <UNK> center in her first major role is also an eye opener the principals receive great support from paul lukas gibson and stanley fields as the <UNK> and even from robert hard as nails detective the movie has obviously been realized on an extensive budget which is brilliantly <UNK> in its realistic crowd filled sets
<START> my friend recommended this movie to me is should have known not to watch it because my friend is kind of a video game nerd but the name and the cover made it look good for some reason i was so wrong i mean first of all what is up with their suits and the acting it seems like they got the people off barney except for ben kingsley and why was he even in this movie did he think it was a comedy but i have to say the special effects were pretty good but that was like the only good thing in it i mean seriously the movie is worse than pearl harbor and thats actually an understatement everyone must have thought oh i am getting paid so it doesn't matter if its the worst movie in the world i would understand why someone would make this kind of movie if they were directing acting producing writing and getting their hopeless life best friend to do filming and editing probably one of the worst sci fi movies ever one truly <UNK> up film
<START> the very few reviews i could find online of really do not do it justice i read them all before <UNK> the dvd but for some reason i ordered it anyway i <UNK> it almost immediately but the order had already gone through so i couldn't <UNK> it i'm very glad now that i couldn't it's an extraordinary movie br br i won't give a synopsis of the plot because other reviewers have already done that but i will say that i don't understand comments that it's bleak shocking weird <UNK> depressing or pornographic it is certainly very unusual which i suppose could make it seem weird to some people but the other criticisms must reflect the <UNK> own issues because i didn't see any of that in the movie i just watched i'm not attracted to boys so the nudity didn't seem pornographic at all to me it's just a kid trying to figure out who he is with no help at all from the irresponsible adults in his life and it's sweden not <UNK> so topless women are no big deal br br but what surprised me most is how positive the movie is in its depiction of this <UNK> lost kid who goes on a sort of odyssey through all sorts of strange experiences looking for and ultimately finding himself it's fascinating thoroughly original and deeply satisfying br br i'm not at all surprised that won three major awards for best film direction and actor but i'm absolutely <UNK> that the actor who won was not <UNK> the kid whose <UNK> performance as <UNK> must be one of the most remarkable ever filmed but in the relatively insignificant role of <UNK> mother's sleazy boyfriend i don't understand that at all but it doesn't alter the fact that this is a great movie
<START> i do not understand why anyone would waste their time or money on utter trash like this don't get me wrong i love a good western notice i said good this is just trash br br the acting is horrible val kilmer must know someone or <UNK> a favor or something for them just to use his face and name in this ridiculous piece of crap br br to those of you who enjoyed this movie i am making a list of you're names to ensure i do not watch anything you suggest our tastes are definitely different yet it is your right to voice your opinion no matter how far off base it is br br i gave this movie a 2 just in case they do throw out all of the one's and not count them just bad in all
<START> <UNK> feast for me is about healing the <UNK> between spirit and body in <UNK> christianity this <UNK> community in remote <UNK> is missing an adequate appreciation of all of god's gifts in creation they have taken the <UNK> of st paul to an extreme and stress the life of the spirit not the life of the flesh both elderly sisters in their youth were frightened by the lure of love and the <UNK> of life outside their simple village they and their <UNK> <UNK> to the narrow biblical interpretation of their former leader and the <UNK> father the aging <UNK> has become <UNK> and <UNK> and the sisters don't know what to do enter <UNK> a french stranger and someone to whom they can show kindness they have no way of knowing that she will ultimately return their kindness and give <UNK> <UNK> to their dry dusty <UNK> <UNK> will give everything she has and in the process will teach the sisters and their flock about grace about sacrifice about how sensual experience as in the bread and wine of the can change lives and about why true art moves us so deeply when they can forgive each other and themselves they can focus on god's love that unfolds before them in a <UNK> way in the present as a minister and an artist i can't recommend a movie more highly true art and true grace
<START> wow here comes another straight to video scarecrow movie to keep the cinematic <UNK> happy if the cheap looking opening credits don't tell you you're in for quite a ride then the <UNK> tragic writing sure will br br a <UNK> kid gets tied on to a legendary scarecrow as part of his <UNK> onto the baseball team then the scarecrow goes nuts and starts <UNK> people need i say more this movie consists greatly of cheap effects that makes it look like it was edited with <UNK> note that spooky color <UNK> and actors who apparently weren't good enough to show up on some late night <UNK> special actually thats not fair as the actors didn't have much room to work around the abysmal script parts of this movie really seem like parody especially when one character picks up his guitar and starts playing the worst song ever conceived by humans with the worst lip <UNK> ever performed to go along with it the gore here is also a major disappointment in most b movies such as this there is a thick <UNK> of cheap gore fx to make up for what the story and acting lacks here the stuff is so cheap that it's not even fun this movie actually makes jack frost 2 look like lots of fun in comparison br br if you think this movie is the worst one you've ever seen then you probably haven't gotten deep into the world of straight to video b horror regardless this movie will cause you a great deal of mental anguish no matter what your background
<START> a horrendous film ill conceived and crude the acting of anne <UNK> and vince <UNK> is so inferior to that of <UNK> and leigh in the original version they have to be seen to be believed there was no reason to make this picture which only highlights how accomplished and brilliant hitchcock was and how <UNK> also there's a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the film that isn't there in the first film hitchcock's psycho was scary and shocking but one could genuinely feel for all concerned even the pitiful norman bates there were moments of pathos irony and <UNK> humor the remake doesn't have one of the best things about hitchcock's film was its incredible and <UNK> depth and sense of nuance of when to cut away and when to show something on whether to use a close up or long shot on whether to make an actor sympathetic and when to make him frightening and so forth the remake has none of these qualities and doesn't even try for them it's an idiotic exercise that i'm amazed even got released
<START> over 21 the film version of the ruth gordon play which detailed her experiences trying to keep the marriage together with <UNK> <UNK> after he'd gone in the service provides irene dunne with one of her better later roles on the big screen it's also in keeping with what was then an upbeat spirit in america about how we would not screw up the peace as we did in the first world war and <UNK> the <UNK> of yet another global conflict br br the play ruth gordon wrote and starred in herself ran for <UNK> performances in 1944 on broadway and was confined simply to the <UNK> that gordon and harvey <UNK> who was the male lead had on a training base if you look on the broadway credits list it says that the production was by george s kaufman as opposed to being directed by him i'm not sure of the distinction but i can imagine that with a wit and will as strong as <UNK> it must have been an interesting period putting the production together before opening night br br when columbia bought the screen rights sidney <UNK> had to do some considerable script <UNK> to move the action beyond the <UNK> the film bears very little trace of its stage origins br br alexander knox plays the husband and charles coburn the <UNK> of both dunne and knox who are writers knox has <UNK> to not only editor but featured <UNK> his words and thoughts help sell the paper and coburn is in a <UNK> but knox feels he has to get into the war the <UNK> event of his time in order to speak <UNK> on the kind of post war world he wants this was not an <UNK> theme in those years br br irene dunne has some good comic moments the kind she used to have when she was appearing opposite cary grant in fact <UNK> <UNK> directed both of them in my favorite wife a few years earlier coburn is his usual <UNK> old water buffalo of a boss who ultimately has a good heart br br over 21 was an optimistic picture which sad to say wasn't accurate about what the allies and i mean all of them could bring to the peace <UNK> to create a better world still hopefully a new generation will get it right
<START> stay alive has a very similar story to some asian horror films which include technology on the story some of this asian horror films are one missed call <UNK> and pulse so the idea of stay alive is very clichéd and obvious but the filmmakers behind it did not know how to put something new or interesting to the clichés in stay alive this film is totally crap but a very big crap all the elements of stay alive belong to the worst class of films shallow characters nothing of suspense stupid which makes laugh and light violence it's easy to note that the is incapable to create something original or disturbing i do not wanna loose more time writing about this pathetic film i just give you an advice do not see this film i really hated it
<START> i viewed my <UNK> last night for the first time in at least ten years i found the work itself and the performances just as gripping as they were in my memory george of course was the master of the role of <UNK> there is never a touch of <UNK> in his determination to <UNK> vengeance on those he believes caused his wife's death and his daughter's disappearance at least not until the end when he discovers that his <UNK> for revenge has led him to murder his wife angela lansbury on the other hand creates a more complex portrayal as mrs <UNK> she understood that <UNK> wanted that role to be something of a comic counterpart to <UNK> and even brings some <UNK> into her <UNK> of <UNK> and her <UNK> of the boy <UNK> for those with long memories this performance takes one back to her debut performances in the picture of <UNK> grey and <UNK> long before murder she wrote only a year ago i saw the musical at <UNK> opera of chicago with current opera superstar as <UNK> others have commented on the operatic quality of the score my conclusion is that <UNK> works better with actors who can at least handle the vocal lines than with opera performers who have limited acting skills as a final note i <UNK> the performer who portrayed <UNK> with his mixed <UNK> and confusion about what is going on around him it seemed appropriate that he had virtually the last word
<START> in my opinion this movie is not good i hardly find a good thing to say about it but still i would like to explain before i conclude it is just another bad movie br br i decided to watch it because <UNK> <UNK> is starring in it and that was the main reason i watched it till the end i like action movies and i understand that such movies are built on the action rather than the story i know they don't go into details when it comes to the credibility of the story and the events but even that does not explain why some scenes just because they lack the sense of reality look ridiculous br br at the beginning the movie looks quite promising a tough good looking <UNK> and his not so tough but smart and funny partner must do a job which turns out a bit different than they expected the story takes place on a cruise ship a disaster happens the ship is turned over and only a few are left alive during their struggle to survive they have to escape a shark a professional killer and the rising water br br furthermore the movie is quite violent the main weapon beside the disaster which already took out most of the passengers is the gun which is successfully used in many cases i personally missed a good man to man or woman to woman if you prefer fight family fun i don't think so br br all in all i think this movie was shot in a hurry without a real vision what it is trying to say made of the usual action movie tricks with a bit of something called love and without a real meaning it just results in a bad movie
<START> hollywood has made a lot of strange movies over the years but none stranger than this why this movie got made i will never know nor how paramount could have thought it would sell any tickets in <UNK> it is the strangest mix of genres i have seen in a long time a movie that truly does not know whether it is trying to be a serious war drama or a <UNK> <UNK> comedy br br it tells the story of a british spy trying to get a poison gas formula out of germany in the days just before <UNK> ii began ray <UNK> a fine actor is stuck playing the part like an <UNK> from monty python all very exaggerated english <UNK> school dialogue in germany he meets a gypsy marlene <UNK> who helps him to travel under cover as of course another gypsy she plays her part like the typical <UNK> <UNK> gypsy caricature as do the other <UNK> in the movie but there are also nazis who are not funny at all and then <UNK> finds he is starting to think like a gypsy and that is not treated as a joke sometimes the music is for a light comedy sometimes for a drama every time the nazis show up the film score plays wagner which is funny by itself br br this movie could have been a comedy or it could have taken the plight of the <UNK> seriously and done a serious job of showing how the nazis treated them both are hinted at in this movie but neither pursued what we are left with is a truly strange <UNK> mash of genres that must have embarrassed everyone except the director involved br br bizarre
<START> this is a movie about people receiving a love letter nobody knows who sent in and nobody knows who it is for a good cast headed up by kate <UNK> tom <UNK> and ellen <UNK> this however is a completely dopey plot as an example the <UNK> character one of the leading citizens of a small town in new england takes up with an immature college student who works in her <UNK> during the summer she chooses him instead of tom <UNK> the town <UNK> who is crazy about her if that isn't the epitome of stupidity i don't know what is just an example of how dopey this movie is watching kate <UNK> <UNK> is a pleasure but you immediately realize that she has never a day in her life another obviously dopey part of a dopey movie
<START> key west for too short a time was <UNK> tv for my family i'd stop by red <UNK> and pick up a party <UNK> for the night it was on the irony of the situation was that i was working for a fox <UNK> at the time and every one at the station was <UNK> at them not <UNK> the show everyone in that cast was excellent fisher stevens perfect who couldn't fail to identify with an <UNK> who dreams of being a writer in key west jennifer <UNK> was always remarkable and she is one heck of a texas player you can still find the pilot episode on youtube wish they'd post the <UNK> one that episode alone should have won an emmy as well as the rest of the cast
<START> a group of people goes deep into the jungle for various reasons and finally find a lost city where apparently king <UNK> <UNK> are and a race of super <UNK> now you know you're in trouble when you put fine actors like <UNK> and <UNK> in one movie that stars a talking gorilla and that is just the beginning okay what else br br for an action adventure movie the film is well lacking just that the first hour of the movie they aren't even in the jungle just trying to get there with subplot after subplot something about a local military regime whatever and when they finally do it's just no fun anymore br br the effects of the movie are only so and so and really bad compared to the earlier jurassic park movie br br now the ending the father not caring for the death of his son but just interested in the <UNK> uh huh only in the movies folks only in the movies br br a complete waste of talent this jurassic park <UNK> er adaptation 2 10
<START> russell t davies has been <UNK> with re creating a slice of my childhood hiding behind the <UNK> watching scary monsters battle with dr who he and his crew are clearly all true <UNK> of the original series br br in much the same way as the star trek movies used their budget to make the gene original concept far more believable russell t davies has both money and the <UNK> of excellent cgi to create the best monsters ever i am sure that this series was made with a budget that anticipated both <UNK> and dvd sales and it really feels as if no expense was <UNK> br br the accompanying series dr who <UNK> shows the work that goes into each episode which is a really useful behind the scenes insight interviews with the cast and writers help <UNK> the story from each characters perspective and are far more useful than simply watching the whole programme over again br br how does david tenant rank in the <UNK> of his <UNK> predecessors time will tell but tonight seeing <UNK> <UNK> play alongside <UNK> who was the doctor's companion in the 1970's confirm that she has both the acting ability screen presence and script to be the no 1
<START> best years of our lives is a film that slipped under my radar for years i had heard about it but never had the opportunity to watch it thanks to tcm on demand i was able to watch it uncut and commercial free br br what surprised me about this film was how quickly it was made after the war the film frankly deals with the people who were wounded in the war both physically and mentally it manages neatly to <UNK> nearly all the <UNK> of war experience within three characters br br we have the air force officer who was a veteran of the early european bombing campaign because of the horrific rate amongst the <UNK> of the <UNK> the air force at that time had a reputation for <UNK> out officers who quickly rose through the ranks such was case with this fellow who went from a <UNK> <UNK> jerk in <UNK> life to a captain and <UNK> of his b 17 he also suffers from <UNK> called battle <UNK> at the time br br we have the army non com who served in the pacific and suffered through the horrors of that campaign his story is opposite that of the air force fellow in that he goes from a <UNK> job as a <UNK> to a <UNK> <UNK> in the army and rises to the rank of sergeant from the <UNK> on his <UNK> it is clear that he is the highest level of sergeant yet he is still on the front line br br finally we have the navy <UNK> who is part of the <UNK> support staff <UNK> referred to as rear <UNK> by the <UNK> on the line ironically he suffers the worst physical wounds when working as a mechanic below <UNK> on a navy ship his ship is struck presumably by a <UNK> and is sunk with loss of 400 lives he is pulled from the water but his badly burned hands are <UNK> and replaced with <UNK> <UNK> br br tells the story of how these three meet on a transport plane they have <UNK> for home and how they <UNK> into <UNK> society br br what impressed me most about this film is that despite the obvious issues that face the three protagonists it never <UNK> into melodrama the navy kid played by an actual <UNK> is placed into situations where we might feel sorry for him yet the script never lets us feel that emotion the army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic and the story points that out but never <UNK> on it the air force captain struggles with the loss of status when he is forced to return to the drug store he <UNK> <UNK> in now bought out by a large chain and take a <UNK> job to support his <UNK> and <UNK> wife br br the script allows plenty of opportunities for all these characters to come to some dramatic climax regarding their <UNK> but it neatly avoids that but for the overly dramatic score the director has <UNK> around <UNK> the obvious br br in one scene that well represents the entire movie the daughter of the army sergeant <UNK> march is having a discussion with her father and mother regarding the air force captain despite his marriage they have fallen in love and she is determined to break up the marriage which is obviously troubled now we've seen thousands of scenes typical of this where the father <UNK> <UNK> and the daughter ends up running away to her room in tears <UNK> the door and falling on the bed later mom shows up <UNK> daughter and offers words of <UNK> wisdom and everybody lives happily ever after br br in this scene plays out completely differently than the cliché i have described above sure the conversation gets <UNK> but all parties are reasonable and there is a serious and timeless discussion of the nature of relationships that has some of the best dialog i have seen br br ultimately is a highly satisfying film with honest performances from the entire cast technically it is well shot the editing and cinematography frame but never <UNK> the gripping narrative despite the score which is cliché and over dramatic i give this film the highest rating that it clearly deserves
<START> the movie has taken a little <UNK> for playing fast and loose with the facts but it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the feeling br br as keith richards remarks in paul <UNK> movie about holly there's some buddy holly in almost all rock made since his day the tragedy that took him is dealt with gently and the rest of the movie <UNK> the joy of a great music career and a <UNK> body of music br br gary busey does a remarkable energetic portrayal of holly and his performances hint that he really gets into the music as a long time holly fan and rocker so do i
<START> my mother took me to this movie at the drive in when i was around seven years old which is thirty years ago she had no idea a family movie would be so violent my <UNK> memory was of the boy's father's face of pain as he was stabbed in the stomach and killed this image haunted me for weeks i had learned that i lived in a world where a person might stab my father at anytime how could i stop them how could my father protect himself you must realise that this stabbing is not fantasy to a seven year old it is as real as witnessing an actual event and has no place in a child's innocent mind it is sad that we still do not understand the impact that bringing violence into the lives of our children has both on our children and our society if only parents would protect their children from images of violence with the same <UNK> that they protect them from images of nudity and sex
<START> the evil below starts on 'the <UNK> of san sebastian as the <UNK> century treasure ship the el <UNK> sinks in a violent <UNK> jump to 'the <UNK> of san sebastian present <UNK> where two <UNK> are exploring the beautiful underwater <UNK> that are rich in <UNK> the come across the <UNK> wreck of the el <UNK> explore it but are attacked killed by something that looks like a vicious <UNK> captain max cash wayne crawford owns runs a boat for hire named the which <UNK> for tourists who want to fish dive generally explore the islands sarah <UNK> june <UNK> is an art teacher who <UNK> for treasure as a <UNK> well we all have to do something to pass the time right she hires max his scantily clad assistant tracy <UNK> able so she can try to locate the el <UNK> get rich talk of <UNK> treasure <UNK> some of the more <UNK> members of the local community as they dodge the criminals thugs it is brought to max <UNK> attention that the el <UNK> has a sinister past a past that supposedly still leaves it's supernatural legacy behind even now br br directed by jean claude <UNK> according to the imdb with a little help from star crawford although the version i saw only listed <UNK> i thought the evil below had some potential is a bit different but unfortunately that's not enough to save it from sinking to the bottom of the sea like a stone the script by arthur payne starts off ok with the two <UNK> being killed by some sort of sea creature but this opening is never referred to again the creature is never seen again there are no more supernatural killings the evil below then suffers from a serious <UNK> case of identity crisis it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be as it <UNK> bits pieces of various genres in there from underwater adventure horror action thriller crime it even has time to throw in a little murder mystery religious nonsense as well as a result the evil below feels very <UNK> <UNK> since the best scene in the entire film is the opening sequence i found myself sat there becoming more more frustrated at the lack of any consistent horror as it went downhill rapidly the fact we never see the sea creature thing again the evil below is dull slow <UNK> predictable silly lacks any sort of charm or intelligence in short the evil below doesn't do anything right that a good film should br br director <UNK> fails to <UNK> things up although he obviously shot plenty of underwater <UNK> material as at times i thought i was watching a national <UNK> documentary with all the shots of fish <UNK> the <UNK> in general forget about any gore some blood <UNK> water blood <UNK> is about as gory as it gets i'm afraid br br technically the evil below is very basic it's bland totally forgettable apart from nice underwater photography of fish this is point shoot stuff as a whole the production values are very low even the place where this was shot doesn't look very sunny or appealing the acting is poor but then again did you expect anything else br br the evil below is a poor film it's basic story is all over the place it can't decide what it wants to be as a result it ends up being a mess add that to the low production values the fact there's no gore here absolutely minimal horror content you have a film that is probably best avoided unless your absolutely desperate even then surely there are better ways to spend 90 plus minutes of your life
<START> this was a fantastically funny film why won't they show it again tim <UNK> was superb as were all the players direction was inspired and some of the gags were <UNK> the pitch had me on the floor show it again <UNK> so i can video it
<START> really for a short film that looks high budget this is just a candy <UNK> piece of <UNK> p it tries so hard to be hollywood but even hollywood stories have an okay story sometimes money wasted on an effort to be hollywood waste of almost a half hour of any viewers time for the short film buff look elsewhere
<START> another b movie for teenagers based mainly on cgi effects industrial soundtrack and some medieval imagery it's a <UNK> that the legend for beowulf is used in such uninspired manner i am a fan of christopher <UNK> but i have to admit that he is getting worse as an actor and his movies too rent it if you are teenager only
<START> the production values for this film make it fall short of hollywood blockbuster status and the script makes it fall short of cult status what is left is a tired formulaic attempt at the disaster movie genre that will disappear with the <UNK> tide br br a decent cast are either miss cast or cannot be bothered the beautiful <UNK> <UNK> is unable to bring any <UNK> to the role of police <UNK> <UNK> who wears the most irritating matching <UNK> <UNK> above her <UNK> br br plays the <UNK> part of director of the <UNK> <UNK> with all the conviction of a <UNK> candy <UNK> her canadian <UNK> and accent were presumably <UNK> in to appeal to a <UNK> audience it and she fails her initial appearance in a tight fitting pink <UNK> suit as she arrives at work is <UNK> br br the part of the <UNK> old <UNK> who was right is played by tom as though he is acting in his sleep and the various plot twists that are designed to his son played by robert <UNK> struggle to get any response from him br br <UNK> looks determined to commit ritual <UNK> <UNK> for his <UNK> as met office director or for his acting or both and only david <UNK> emerges with some credit for his role as deputy <UNK> br br there was enough in the story and the cast and the effects to have produced a decent effort alas that did not happen
<START> after another raid in an empty village the chief of the <UNK> <UNK> the explanation of his <UNK> that fear gives wings to the <UNK> and believes that fear actually makes the villagers fly they decide to chase the champion of fear in to learn how to fly and make them <UNK> warriors meanwhile the nephew of is sent from to the village to become a man and <UNK> and are assigned to train the <UNK> the stupid son of <UNK> <UNK> to a conversation of the coward with <UNK> and and kidnaps him while returning to the <UNK> village meets <UNK> the daughter of and they fall in love for each other but the <UNK> and ambitious plan to marry his son <UNK> with <UNK> and become powerful in the end <UNK> realizes that it is not fear that gives wings it is love br br when i was a teenager <UNK> was my favorite comic book and i read all the and stories this feature film shows all the original elements and humor of the comics in a delicious and wonderful animation the romance of and the gorgeous <UNK> is delightful and the situations <UNK> and get involved are hilarious my vote is ten br br title brazil e <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK>
<START> i think this film has to be one of the most moving and heartbreaking films of recent times br br the film basically starts off with a suicide in a school toilet u don't see who it is then from there it goes to the beginning of the day and we get to know 6 characters and they are going through some pretty heavy things anyway eventually one of them will commit suicide br br i've been teaching physical education in schools for 8 years now and never in a film have i seen such an accurate portrayal of what <UNK> goes on in school life br br the film is shot beautifully and sounds incredible br br the ending is so shocking and so what one would not expect it is something that will haunt me for days to come br br this is definitely one to watch br br i think the fact that the director writer was in school only a few years ago is a major <UNK> factor to the raw honesty expressed in the film br br the film is shot in two separate if you will firstly there is the smooth observation style where we get to know the characters in their school environment as they go through their drama but the stunning part of the film is in the interview sections where we get to know the characters back stories and their deepest darkest thoughts br br you keep wondering who is it going to be who commits suicide and as the drama unfolds you keep changing your mind until <UNK> it hits you in the face in the final five minutes i am all over the place in my writing but i've just seen it at a media screening in australia and i am still in a bit of shock br br it's one of the best australian films i have seen in recent years
<START> i saw this with high expectations come on it is akshay kumar govinda and <UNK> <UNK> who are all amazing at their comedy i was really hoping for a laugh riot sadly that is not what i got at all br br unfortunately nothing in this movie really made me laugh out loud there were times when i <UNK> at one or two things but nothing really made me laugh in short it was badly attempted comedy and in a way a bit of a <UNK> <UNK> wannabe br br out of the three main guys i think <UNK> role was the most powerful it wasn't the biggest role but it certainly stood out more than govinda or akshay their performances were okay i guess nothing special just mediocre though govinda stole the <UNK> from akshay in more than a few scenes lara <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> also make appearances in this film and both of them were pretty bad <UNK> role did not move me or make me laugh and <UNK> character just got on my nerves the music seems to be the only good thing about <UNK> <UNK> my favourite song is <UNK> bin followed by which i really liked <UNK> and the title song <UNK> <UNK> are also worth a listen br br you either will like it or you won't and judging by the poor comedy and lack of direction i don't think you will
<START> some films are designed to just entertain you others to make you laugh or cry or <UNK> others like this aim to <UNK> to make you think and to make you angry i was angry during this film not at the film but at the fact that it was true that america the free does torture in the illogical view that it is doing it for the greater good the torture scenes in this movie were harrowing the indifference of people was shattering the film was compelling in its argument and showed just how wrong it is to torture people of course now that makes me a bleeding liberal <UNK> shoved on people by others who shut their minds to the facts that this does happen and should not people who don't realise that as the movie said for every person tortured you get ten or one hundred people rise up to perform acts of vengeance you get an ever increasing cycle of violence this film did not make me hate america although i can see how it could do but it made me hate the way that america has <UNK> in its post 9 11 world there is a significant quote in the film just after we have learned that 19 people have died and <UNK> five were injured in the bomb scene the quote is one american is dead that makes the difference you cannot kill an american america can kill thousands but you cannot kill a single american or they will do whatever it takes including torture to <UNK> justice this is the american way apparently call me a liberal call me naive although i think the people who think torture is fine are naive call me <UNK> call me anything you like but this film is a brilliant example of what is wrong in america and the west today i wish this film would be shown to all school students at a minimum this film will stay with me a long time part of me wishes i could forget it because i wish this type of thing never happened but i know it does the other part of me wishes i would never forget because we need to remember these shameful events to prevent them from happening again whatever happens to me this film will be with me for a long time and i will be telling everyone i know to watch it not to be entertained but to be <UNK> because sometimes we all need to be <UNK>
<START> i agree with one <UNK> who says that it's really impossible to review <UNK> or glenda <UNK> if one does so the film on its merits would have to be rated as fairly terrible given the hilarious convoluted dialog the generally mediocre to poor acting by the cast as well as the zero production values yet such an <UNK> does not capture the absolutely riveting experience of watching this film as it unfolds it isn't the fact that the subject of the film is <UNK> and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the 1950s it's not even the <UNK> for tolerance of people who embrace alternate life choices that <UNK> except as an historic <UNK> br br no what makes <UNK> or glenda still a fascinating film after 50 years is that ed wood laid his psyche bare in a way that so called auteur directors like hitchcock or godard despite their vastly superior talents never did in <UNK> or glenda wood isn't afraid to reveal his own deeply conflicted feelings about being a <UNK> despite the <UNK> for tolerance for it through out the film indeed the conclusion of the film suggest that ed <UNK> <UNK> character will be able to kill his glenda female counterpart by <UNK> the feelings of love and affection <UNK> has for his feminine counterpart to his future wife barbara the psychiatrist even <UNK> <UNK> and barbara that as <UNK> makes that psychic <UNK> glenda will disappear so while wood could <UNK> for tolerance of <UNK> in general he wasn't so sure of <UNK> it for himself br br moreover wood wasn't afraid of throwing everything else that crossed his mind on the screen he did it with whatever stock footage he could get his hands on if it didn't <UNK> so what what the viewer saw in <UNK> or glenda especially was ed <UNK> imaginative world in all of its fundamental <UNK> br br the only comment i wish to add to my comment above is that my two star rating is based solely on the objective <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the first paragraph the oddly effect the film has despite its technically atrocious qualities i don't think can be rated
<START> contains spoiler information watch this director's other film earth at some point it's a better film but this one isn't bad just different br br a rare feminist point of view from an indian filmmaker tradition <UNK> duty secrets and the portrayal of strict sex roles make this an engaging and <UNK> dynamic film viewing experience all of the married characters lack the fire of the marriage bed with their respective <UNK> one husband is <UNK> and commits a form of spiritual adultery by giving all of his love honor time and respect to his religious <UNK> guru his wife is lonely and <UNK> for <UNK> and <UNK> which she eventually finds with her <UNK> lesbian sister in law who comes to live in their house with her <UNK> husband this <UNK> husband is openly in love with his chinese mistress but was forced into marriage with a <UNK> to him lesbian they only have sex once when his closet lesbian wife loses her virginity br br a servant lives in the house and he eventually reveals the secret that the two women are lovers another significant character is the elderly <UNK> who is unable to speak or care for herself due to a stroke however she uses a <UNK> bell to communicate her needs as well as her <UNK> with the family members she lets them know through her bell or by <UNK> her fist that she knows what's going on in the house and how much she <UNK> br br in the end the truth about everybody comes out and the two female lovers end up running away together but not before there is an emotional scene between the <UNK> addicted husband and his <UNK> straight wife her <UNK> catches on fire and at first we think she is going to die however we see the two women united in the very last scene of the movie br br the writer director of this film challenges her <UNK> traditions but she shows us individual human beings who are trapped by their culture and gender we come to really care about the characters and we don't see them as stereotypes each on surprises us with their humanity <UNK> <UNK> anger and spirit
<START> beautifully filmed mind <UNK> exploration of gypsy culture in the context of their music travel across a continent experiencing the amazing musical styles of various groups of gypsy peoples it is sort of misleading to say this movie is not narrated it is masterfully narrated by the music itself the <UNK> <UNK> and lyrics tell a story much better than a narrator would have see this film
<START> i kid you not yes who's that girl has the distinction for being one in a string of <UNK> films that bombed but i actually liked this movie more than desperately seeking susan in susan <UNK> character is <UNK> to being second <UNK> to <UNK> arquette and is not given much to work with no <UNK> to <UNK> but in madonna plays this zany outrageous character only done in an 80s style while it may seem cheesy today this is actually one of <UNK> best and one of her most underrated films br br madonna plays <UNK> <UNK> an ex con who is sent to the <UNK> for a crime she didn't commit she's being released from jail after four years of good behavior <UNK> dunne who is also a very underrated actor plays a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from jail to take her to the bus station of course when these two get together that's when the madness happens sir john mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of manhattan with a <UNK> on his roof br br this movie parodies everything rich people the sleazy characters who live in harlem and totally destroy rolls <UNK> the gay cops who follow madonna and dunne around town and <UNK> stuck up <UNK> wendy who has <UNK> slept with every cab driver in new york city played by <UNK> morris who was <UNK> girlfriend caroline in sixteen <UNK> hilarious plus dunne is also in charge of a rare breed of <UNK> reminiscent of bringing up baby plus madonna had a great <UNK> blonde 80s look back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack throw this all into the mix and you have the <UNK> of br br madonna is the queen of deadpan acting there are times in the movie where she says a line totally straight and surprisingly it turns out to be funny that's how some of the best comedy should be played straight madonna should have done more comedy and it was a shame that she did not choose to do so later on she became much more controversial and got into more of the dark sexually charged roles in the notorious movies body of evidence and dangerous game br br some people say madonna cannot act and that is fine people are entitled to their opinion but i believe the real problem is that people cannot see the difference between madonna playing a character on film instead they still see only madonna and that is main reason why she is given more respect for her music than for her movies it's still a fun screwball comedy of the 80s not for everyone i'm sure some of you will dislike it so i would recommend it mainly for madonna fans but you never know you might be surprised and like it br br interesting note one of <UNK> friends from her early 80s new york club days <UNK> who plays <UNK> was a member in the bands kid <UNK> and the and <UNK> band
<START> i just attended a preview screening of this film a masterpiece of documentary film making it was not totally absorbed with its subject the film becomes incapable of <UNK> any sort of critical commentary with regard to ms faye <UNK> and sappy the only redeeming quality of the film was its use of puppets in an attempt albeit a failed one to structure some kind of narrative but the <UNK> experience occurred as the closing credits rolled the audience rose and <UNK> like <UNK> to flame americans in the 21st century are still drawn to the narrative of the misunderstood monster is getting rather tired
<START> it is a shame that the gershwin family and <UNK> estate has pulled this great movie from the viewing thereby <UNK> the public from seeing some of the most wonderful actors and performances ever packed into one motion picture br br it is also true that the singing voices for sidney <UNK> and dorothy <UNK> were dubbed for this movie and that is used as one of the reasons that the <UNK> do not want this movie ever released again br br for in spite the flaws in the movie and the creative differences between the <UNK> and the this film has some of the most remarkable performances ever committed to the screen sammy davis jr and pearl <UNK> are especially deserving praise br br this film was the great independent producer samuel <UNK> song it was also ironically the <UNK> greatest shame br br finally it is a loss to the wonderful black actors who appeared in it for we can no longer see them at their best
<START> i liked this movie many people refer to it as sabrina the teenage feminist they do that with a lot of movies that melissa joan hart is in still she really surprised me in this movie because she was great in the part of mary who fights for justice when her roommate is raped you could tell that hart was extremely determined in this movie and it showed i also liked lisa dean ryan as <UNK> roommate she was very effective in making me feel sorry for her character after she was raped josh hopkins was good as the cocky and <UNK> rapist <UNK> <UNK> convincingly played his character the acting in this movie is better than in most tv movies in my opinion br br the movie was pretty predictable though also i expected more from the ending it was too abrupt the delivery could have been better but the performances and overall plot make up for these problems
<START> i found the story to be just enough of a thriller that the wonderful henry music didn't <UNK> me julie andrews was and i sure don't understand why this movie had problems at the box office when it came out because it just makes me happy at the end to have everybody singing and i do like happy ever after endings which i think you can say this movie has along with some traditional blake <UNK> humor
<START> the only way to truly understand and relate to the characters in this movie is to have experienced the situations your self to a lot of people this movie is almost mock <UNK> a sort of <UNK> of one weekend in our lives i have done about 85 percent of the things in this movie and witnessed the other 15 percent usually all in the same weekend for me and others i know it is nice to have this movie to look back on because other than a few pictures of people we sort of remember and nights that are <UNK> and <UNK> this movie is our generations studio <UNK> a piece to add to our <UNK> books to look back on and smile personally i'm glad those days are past but it is great to watch this movie and say i remember when thank you justin for making this mock biography of one weekend in my life
<START> this is probably the funniest thing i have ever seen from start to finish it was perfect in timing atmosphere punch lines background music fighting sequences and every other possible aspect you can think of to be absolutely honest i find this movie as funny as their sitcom bottom maybe even funnier i laughed constantly throughout the whole movie and can only recommend seeing this film however if you watch it without knowing or liking the type of comedy and has done before you might not think it's funny at all but i really can't understand those who dislike it this is humour folks people getting hit with <UNK> pans guys running around wearing red rubber <UNK> green vomit filling the <UNK> guys getting kicked in the b s and getting <UNK> in the eyes how can this not be funny 10 10
<START> okay i'll say it this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing that most people don't get is that this movie was intended to be bad and <UNK> i mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece just look at the scary <UNK> on the jacket of the movie and you'll find your answer instead like the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie turned out to be a side splitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects and it's all made to deliver laughter to us viewers it certainly worked for me br br for example anne to her troubled husband what makes you <UNK> so heavily darling br br if that <UNK> of dialogue doesn't make you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words in real life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully you'll see what's so damn funny about jack frost 2
<START> this film captures the short moments between a mother and son in rural russia as she lays dying br br i am so torn between being nice to the film or <UNK> it a test of patience on one hand the film is beautiful with the sparse dialog capturing the essence of their feelings there is really nothing to say because everything that needs to be said is conveyed beyond words the son shows so much care love and patience towards his mother that i think it is a celebration of <UNK> love towards one's family it also <UNK> reminds me that i could be in a situation like this stuck in a <UNK> place having to take care of a very ill person <UNK> i is cruel reality br br on the other hand <UNK> i moves really too slowly do i really need to watch a train passing by the horizon for over 1 minute with my previous experience of and i am so tempted to put <UNK> i among them as a total bore br br i guess one has to be in the right state of mind to appreciate this film i surely see the beauty of it but maybe i am not in the right state of mind
<START> the last american virgin along with fast times at <UNK> high is one the last great teen films ever made it is tender tale of envy and <UNK> love set in the early eighties much <UNK> by critics that it was a <UNK> banal attempt to recreate the magic of fast times at <UNK> high these same critics fail to recognize that the two films were actually filmed <UNK> during late 1981 and released at only slight <UNK> from one another either way the studios would never allow such a bold and <UNK> portrayal of the issues many male teenagers are confronted with as they reach their sexual maturity especially considering the heart wrenching discovery the protagonist gary is confronted with in the end american pie this is not the story revolves around a trio of male teenagers and their mostly <UNK> sexual <UNK> gary is the least successful of the group hence the <UNK> last american virgin secretly gary <UNK> after karen who is involved with rick his best friend rick and karen begin having sex and karen gets pregnant only to be dumped by rick who is not interested in the obvious responsibility which lies before him gary <UNK> into help karen which leads to the aforementioned unexpected conclusion overall as a film i find it was very successful as a comedy as a commentary on the sexual <UNK> of young men and a remarkable coming of age tale dealing with issues such as envy <UNK> love and abortion which are just as <UNK> today as they were over twenty years ago also it has one of the <UNK> ever made
<START> hitchcock is a great director ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch i admire <UNK> on a purely visual and technical level br br first the <UNK> hitchcock invented the notion of the <UNK> camera the curious eye that is able to <UNK> or search for information it isn't exactly a new visual <UNK> but it was revolutionary then br br secondly hitchcock pretty much <UNK> the thriller and chase movie he has an <UNK> style and is always thinking of the audience he gives them regular thrills regular <UNK> of humour and regular shocks in short he <UNK> the audience's base needs and plays them like a <UNK> br br unfortunately the base needs of a human being are mostly stupid food sex the thrill of danger and a little comedy <UNK> for all these needs on screen with the exception of food which judging from his size he <UNK> to off screen br br it's this <UNK> to the audience that <UNK> most of his films a second downside is that most of hitchcock's camera work and visual <UNK> are now common place what keeps his films watchable are the simple economy of his tales the intelligence of his camera work and his skill at <UNK> tense action set pieces br br so on to <UNK> this is a light hearted romp in the vein of the <UNK> steps it jumps from sequence to sequence until it concludes at the typical hitchcock final act set piece br br on an emotional level the relationship between the leads is not up to par with robert and madeleine <UNK> in the <UNK> steps hence the whole story lacks a certain energy the plot simply <UNK> on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes and new scenes only bring us <UNK> the end since it's not clear if the hook is the hero's escape from the police from the villains or his action to stop the plotted <UNK> br br there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws for example a guy with <UNK> <UNK> himself using a car fan belt etc why doesn't he just drive away in the car surely <UNK> aren't that <UNK> he's able to swim in them after all br br if you want a better hitchcock wartime propaganda flick from the 40's i would advise you watch foreign they are both silly chase movies with a catchy finale but foreign makes great use of <UNK> and <UNK> something spielberg rips off nicely in minority report br br 7 5 10 some good set pieces beyond that however there's nothing much to sink your teeth into
<START> strained and <UNK> especially in light of its rather dubious psychology but well paced and <UNK> lurid this <UNK> body count movie highlights the unusually hypnotic presence of <UNK> <UNK> as a young woman <UNK> possessed by jack the <UNK> thus allowing for some nasty gore effects amidst the <UNK> <UNK> it's all pretty standard stuff for hammer but is handled with a good deal of visual <UNK> even if the central relationship between <UNK> porter and <UNK> drives the narrative without ever being <UNK> explained
<START> so many people have taken shots at platoon and born on the fourth of july among other calling them <UNK> propaganda film now its my turn to take a political shot at a movie to me this movie is very <UNK> on certain religious beliefs and on its political views br br the acting and writing was a little to clichéd for my liking mel gibson seems to like to play in these unnecessary violent films and proves it once again by <UNK> up with his partner randall wallace for yet another one throughout this movie there was this garbage <UNK> just tell my family i love them or tell <UNK> to pray before <UNK> goes to bed lines the was so <UNK> with this garbage <UNK> lines that i felt like i had to vomit how about that scene were <UNK> wife goes to do her <UNK> and this no colors applies to what to put in the <UNK> machine its in the mid sixties was she some how stuck under a rock not <UNK> the racism around her another scene is were <UNK> daughter asks him what war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter br br the directing displayed this all perfectly the countless scenes of gibson and his family or soldiers praying i'm fine with showing that once or twice but after a while i wonder if the movie is trying to <UNK> something into my head how many scenes with the american flag at its finest hour were shot with the melodramatic music on the director also makes it seem like we won some sort of victory in vietnam what exactly was won their the cinematography was the worst of it with the <UNK> down scenes see the american flag in the distance scenes spread throughout i love america but movies like this seem to <UNK> every little thing we do br br this may seem like a rant and maybe it is but i cannot stand it when a movie like this makes people who are not religious are not so patriotic that they will agree with anything their country does look bad this movie to me is narrow minded and limited in so many aspects to me it says if your not christian your wrong would god or jesus want people to kill i don't think so to me this movie was offensive at first this movie was funny with the countless clichés and <UNK> scenes but then when i looked at what this movie was trying to say or not say it was really frustrating to watch i guess though it is my fault that i chose to watch this movie i hope no one takes this comment <UNK> because i am not <UNK> religion or <UNK> but some of the narrow minded people who are so into both and <UNK> everyone else br br if you want a real depiction of the vietnam war watch platoon born on the fourth of july apocalypse now the deer hunter or the killing fields even full metal jacket which i absolutely hated was a better depiction i have read a quote that in context says a true <UNK> does not go with everything the government or country does but questions it when its wrong a real <UNK> loves their country too much to see it do bad things
<START> <UNK> begins with some cool <UNK> music so i liked it immediately but as the film wore on i began to wonder if the music wasn't the best part we have some thieves pulling a jewel heist and when one does something wrong the alarm is <UNK> and the cops chase them and when the car turns around at a road block one of the thieves paul <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whoever he is here gets shot now it seems like he might die but with the help of a drunken doctor and his mad scientist friend and wife he is saved with a part of the brain of some nightclub owner called the <UNK> the <UNK> is unfortunate in that the gentlemen that kidnapped him lost their knife to remove is head so to add insult to injury or in this case death they remove his head using a train leaving the body for the authorities to find <UNK> once the brain transplant is complete naschy wants to <UNK> any woman that comes near him because he now has the mindset of his <UNK> well of course this is all pretty improbable and features medical equipment that looks to have been purchased at radio shack and overall it's pretty cheesy and sleazy but it has a good early 70's look and feel to it and the music is cool this isn't so much a horror movie but more a thriller with lots of thugs battling it out over <UNK> and babes and other thug type things but it's strangely entertaining in ways i can't begin to describe 7 out of 10
<START> is it a perfect movie no it is a weird adaptation from a sci fi book and it features vampires from space naked <UNK> and the british army <UNK> br br when i first saw this movie i was rather young and all i can remember is the feeling of awe for the movie and <UNK> may actually if it weren't for this gorgeous lady being naked the whole movie i probably wouldn't have rated it so high but given her sheer <UNK> i am now actually considering voting it up br br lucky for me i got reminded of the movie and watched it again now imagine <UNK> of the lost <UNK> or <UNK> special effects <UNK> <UNK> a rather decent sci fi story but with completely over the top performances i still enjoyed the movie tremendously as well as <UNK> may but it was a mixture of nostalgia comparing with the crap movies they make today and actually wanting more when it ended br br bottom line if you are a sci fi fan you are not allowed to miss this movie oh and did i mention <UNK> may is young beautiful and naked
<START> a horrible <UNK> mash of predictable story lines and toe <UNK> poor delivered pc clichés ad <UNK> races working together the heroine being smart as well pretty a guy <UNK> himself to save another life a father daughter relationship etc etc etc the movie looks like something created for network television and should have probably stayed there even the gifted tommy lee jones does not manage to salvage this bomb i urge you not to waste money or time on this cinematic ruin from the time when disaster movies <UNK> hollywood br br the two stars are given solely to the cgi people and the <UNK> <UNK> ability to get even one movie goer to sit through it
<START> like many situation comedies the war at home is getting better with each episode the characters are starting to become real and i believe them as a family i agree with many that the first few episodes were not that funny i thought the show would be canceled for sure but with the <UNK> of malcolm in the middle and arrested development war provides much needed live action comedy for fox on sunday nights and when compared with the rest of the sitcoms airing right now war is an even better choice br br its appeal at least for me lies in its real situations teenagers have sex not every parent likes how their kids are turning out parents fight and call each other names but rather than relying on being mean like many shows everything is nice in the end which is the number one rule of a good sitcom br br one <UNK> from the show is the narration during in between scenes the arrested development family guy style of flashbacks work well enough but the narration can be too much br br so anyone who needs something to watch on sunday nights should check out the war at home especially considering what is on the other major networks at that time
<START> after 30 minutes mostly fast <UNK> deleted it off my <UNK> the first <UNK> movie was self <UNK> fun the conversation between the <UNK> just before <UNK> blows them away off the <UNK> for example this film just <UNK> along waiting for someone to shoot it and put it out of your misery br br i can't imagine anyone who worked on this turkey being proud of it br br one was fun four just was awful don't bother even if the alternative is watching reruns of a <UNK> 700 club <UNK> <UNK> you'll at least get some good laughs there and the alien makeup is more believable grin
<START> this movie has one or two slightly interesting gags but they are not worth the wait after an unexplained argument between two guys picking up <UNK> in a drive in movie theatre we cut to a family leaving hollywood and driving driving driving driving their <UNK> van across the screen again and again as inane dialogue is voiced over at least i think it's inane the terrible song that <UNK> this montage is mixed so loud it <UNK> the dialogue at times almost <UNK> br br finally the <UNK> van arrives at night at a gas station where the family get out have another inane conversation before driving off the camera then pans across to reveal the actor we have just seen drive away he talks straight to camera and we realise he is the director of the movie we are watching which is about him and how he came to make the movie br br a nice idea which almost but not quite makes the previous sequences worth the pain br br as the movie unfolds he encounters the two characters we met picking <UNK> at the start of the movie and they all form a motion picture company br br all sorts of not very funny and clumsy comedy ensues as they put together a crew and attempt to raise the cash needed to start filming br br this movie was obviously put together on a shoe string and a promise and there is a nice little idea in here struggling to get out but the execution is so inept that the idea gets lost comedy is more than things just falling over and everyone talking or shouting at once so much of the dialogue here is <UNK> by several actors simultaneously robert altman can do this sort of thing well because he has a script <UNK> decent sound <UNK> and editing <UNK> everyone shouting at the one mike which by the sound of it was hidden in a <UNK> in the next room does not make for clarity
<START> this is a forgotten classic of a film and harmony <UNK> borrowed a ton from it for <UNK> <UNK> is good <UNK> edge is way way better its no secret that keanu reeves isn't the best actor whoever walked the earth no in fact he's a horrendous actor but he was born for some roles ted preston esquire from bill and ted and his role in this film he is perfect as a sort of good natured but very <UNK> and confused teenager then there's <UNK> glover i think his performance in this film is the best of his career he is phenomenal as the drugged out character then there's dennis hopper who is perfect as well this movie is simply amazing and if you haven't seen it run out and watch it today its brilliant one of the best portrayals of modern america i've seen
<START> i had seen this movie before but i could not remember it was this fantastic it has a fun plot madonna <UNK> around the city with etc causing a <UNK> and the music is just perfect and the happy ending that girl is a great choice for a like me in my opinion this could be even the best madonna movie i have ever seen 10 10
<START> an american boy goes to paris after his mother commits suicide becomes and artist and then discovers himself and returns to the states so he can make things right with his former friends br br i have to think that the people who are rating this movie so highly are all x files fans even though there are no aliens or serial killers in it don't be fooled this movie blows <UNK> br br the story is incoherent with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why when you do get an explanation it doesn't fit the story that went before it what it does is bore you for all the acting talent in the film it just isn't interesting i spent the whole movie wondering when sex addict duchovny was going to bang someone maybe he was doing it behind the scenes they should have filmed that instead br br what comes across is a story of a self obsessed artist worrying about minor incidents in his life and wanting to make them right somehow even though they didn't seem that wrong to begin with there aren't any particularly interesting or shocking revelations despite the mention of a big secret in the first few minutes it's just a guy thinking that his life is as interesting to you as it is to him it's not br br i saw in the trivia that duchovny claims he wrote the script in a week that's entirely believable the guy can act there's no doubt but writing and directing are obviously beyond his talents br br why hollywood keeps these self discovery stories is beyond me i discover myself in the shower every morning but i don't bother making a movie about it mine would probably be better than this one though at least there would be some nudity
<START> where would hollywood have been without march as robert <UNK> or dennis price as lord byron famous lovers in their day even an actor as normally as michael redgrave once brought some moody charm to a portrayal of w b <UNK> <UNK> lives are an endless source of inspiration br br but of all <UNK> it was dylan thomas the free loving <UNK> who enjoyed a <UNK> or two and <UNK> himself to death in new york at the age of <UNK> who was closest in spirit to the film industry during world war ii he produced scripts for british propaganda documentaries he even wrote the screenplay of a vapid melodrama called the three weird sisters in which three old <UNK> in a <UNK> village plot the murder of their rich half brother all that is now forgiven br br in john the edge of love thomas is played by the <UNK> actor matthew rhys it's not a full scale biopic the film covers four years in the <UNK> life during world war ii when he lived with two women his wife <UNK> <UNK> miller and a former lover vera phillips <UNK> knightley whom he met again by chance during the war it seems he loved them both the relationship of these extraordinary women to thomas and to each other is at the heart of absorbing film br br how it came to be made is a story almost as remarkable as that of the lovers themselves the film's producer is the <UNK> of vera phillips and william william a war hero played in the film by cillian murphy married vera while she was still in love with the poet was inspired to make the film when she discovered a book about her grandparents dylan thomas a farm two <UNK> and <UNK> by david thomas describing their <UNK> lives <UNK> macdonald who wrote the screenplay is the mother of knightley the part requires knightley to sing and her mother included songs especially for her surely no film with such family connections deserves to do other than succeed br br we begin in london during the <UNK> bombs are falling <UNK> are <UNK> and phillips is singing to crowds in an underground tube station in a pub by chance she meets thomas and discovers after all these years that he has a wife and child phillips and <UNK> form a friendship <UNK> by jealousy or <UNK> and are soon sharing <UNK> and <UNK> listening to thomas read his <UNK> <UNK> intimate secrets and smoking their heads off as everyone did in wartime <UNK> turns out to be more experienced in the ways of the world my first was <UNK> john he <UNK> me when i was 15 but it's the <UNK> and <UNK> phillips who <UNK> <UNK> deepest <UNK> and eventually <UNK> to his charms in the meantime she has reluctantly married who has seen her in the tube station and been instantly captivated by her beauty if not her singing br br it is an intense and strangely beautiful film though thomas himself may be its least impressive character he is best remembered for under milk wood his <UNK> radio play about a day in the life of the mythical <UNK> village of whose name <UNK> backwards was not something polite english teachers drew attention to i once had a <UNK> recording of richard burton reading the poem he appeared in a film of under milk wood in 1971 and i've never forgotten the <UNK> seductive quality of his voice the legendary charisma the <UNK> of the man is something i missed in performance thomas comes across as a strangely <UNK> even secondary figure compared with the women in his life br br in his previous film love is the devil explored the <UNK> life of painter francis bacon and his <UNK> relationship with his lover and model george <UNK> the edge of love seems to me a <UNK> and more satisfying film if you ask what insights it offers into the springs of <UNK> creative inspiration i would have to say but as an insight into his <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> and his general indifference to the feelings of others it is wonderfully sad and revealing br br thomas had a good war <UNK> and writing while other men including were being <UNK> by the horrors of battle in one scene near the end <UNK> behaviour towards his friends seems <UNK> <UNK> but this is not after all <UNK> film murphy gives us a magnificent study in doomed passion and the emotional of war miller is charming and pathetic as the wife and knightley looks almost too <UNK> delicate to be real as she did in pride and prejudice but this is probably her finest performance and in every respect the film is worthy of her
<START> fantastic russian wwii movie like most russian wwii movies the <UNK> is incredibly harrowing it's also dense in its symbolism the story follows two <UNK> and boris and <UNK> who go on a mission to search for food on their trip they are spotted by german soldiers who wound in turn kills one of the germans which leads to trouble for the two <UNK> and everyone else they later run into the greatest success of the film is its vivid sense of place russia is frozen and snowy and it's hard not to feel that cold go straight to your own bones keeps her shot close to the characters <UNK> every of their faces it was probably not the choice but the film is framed 1 33 1 which gives the film a sense of <UNK> while the entire film is quite an achievement i did feel that the first half was stronger than the second my main complaint about the movie is that it develops into a very <UNK> christian allegory by its climax i just don't think the symbolism adds much to the proceedings especially when i was already intrigued by the debate between the two <UNK> it's not quite fair i was <UNK> the pros and cons of their argument i began to lean toward the point of view of a certain character and then the director pops up and tells me that he's <UNK> despite some heavy <UNK> this is still a must see
<START> in the first twenty minutes we are swept away by several <UNK> portrayed emotions a <UNK> and overbearing mother has a violent argument with her live in old daughter a piano teacher and professor of music 's love for her <UNK> expressed in <UNK> critical <UNK> the joy that music can inspire both in the <UNK> and the performer within this short space of time our senses have been <UNK> convincingly with very real characters we are also swept away by <UNK> performed music and shown the difference between great and mediocre performance with a lot of attention to nuance such material alone would have been the basis for an outstanding film of <UNK> appeal but the trend in french cinema being what it is it goes deeper exploring the repressed sexuality of the teacher the expression of sexual freedom and subsequent breakdown within a context of passionate attraction and the inevitable cycle of real abuse we are drawn to her suffering and at least initially wonder how much suffering may be related to the accomplishment of genius particularly in the <UNK> she <UNK> the piano teacher contains graphic dialogue and depictions of sex and brutality in scenes that some people might rather not watch the scenes are essential to the <UNK> which the film seeks to raise and so can hardly be called gratuitous a great film it may be but mainstream viewing it is not
<START> one of those films that i happened across through the <UNK> collection and as usual <UNK> as a change of pace that turned out to be a great decision i was almost <UNK> by the quality of the film the story it told and the way it was told the almost <UNK> feel to the film with sparse dialogue and almost constant music just added a whole <UNK> level to the film this really is a superb film to spend some time with and enjoy
<START> please don't waste your money on this sorry excuse for a motion picture the only way i could see someone watching this is if they are a die hard fan of erika but you would be better off surfing the internet than to watch this piece of crap i would rather watch paint dry than go through watching this br br they lure you in with casper and erika and lead you to believe it is a sci fi dracula movie but it quickly works out to be a farce about van <UNK> great great you get the point <UNK> here ironically for one last show down between himself and dracula br br the movie also tries to make a political statement i believe when it appears that none of the characters in the future know who god is that they have not been taught about him and don't understand when they see a cross could have done a lot more with this idea it's a shame it turned out the way it did
<START> i usually enjoy underground movies and <UNK> but this is a bad joke i wonder how this can be called a movie all these people are and the filmmaker doesn't succeed in making them interesting at all they are not funny not tragic just plain stupid and boring br br may be i missed something but i won't watch it again to find out what anybody with a camcorder can do better than that br br i give it a 1 for the originality all the rest is crap
<START> mind you it's not supposed to be but it is as a wee <UNK> i watched this movie in the theatre being a huge wrestling and hulk hogan fan all i remember from the night is we were the only ones in the theater and that i didn't really like it very much i <UNK> the rest out and for good reason br br a poor film on par with the <UNK> like <UNK> and the no holds <UNK> is a movie set in the high stakes world of pro wrestling well maybe the stakes aren't all that high and quite frankly i feel dirty just calling these people professionals at anything and really except for the first scene there's no wrestling to speak of so i guess movie is about the <UNK> low stakes world of amateurish beating the c out of people sounds good right br br hulk hogan plays rip the champion of the <UNK> never let it be said that hulk hogan was <UNK> this and movies like thunder in paradise showed how he challenged himself with deep roles that really pushed the limits of his talents essentially he's playing himself but with a wardrobe that's more black and blue than the red and yellow he also has this hand gesture he does it's kinda like the <UNK> devil sign people make at rock <UNK> except you stick your thumb in the air and you <UNK> your <UNK> finger in my friend claimed that it was supposed to look like an r try and see for yourself if that looks like an r well then mars needs women but anyway br br kurt fuller with his overacting <UNK> obviously on the fritz plays a tv <UNK> with his slightly <UNK> heart set on getting rip who's bigger than elvis on his network he won't have any of it and <UNK> the office with a <UNK> hand gesture to no one but the camera and so the movie follows fuller trying to boost ratings and get back at rip he does so when he creates his brilliantly titled battle of the tough guys marketing genius this guy br br from the numerous hand gestures to the rather idiotic fight scenes all played as if wrestling is very real and deadly serious to the overacting to the far too frequent shots of hulk in nothing but <UNK> this movie has everything you'd ever want in a dumb movie it's <UNK> not too <UNK> on the mind violent and includes the phrase what's that smell <UNK> <UNK> br br a classic for all time
<START> i didn't know what to expect when i started watching this movie by the end of it i was pulling my <UNK> out this was one of the most pathetic movies of this year in fact in the last ten years david <UNK> should just give up his career as a director i am yet to come across one original script that david <UNK> has worked on this one was a complete bit y bit rip off <UNK> i have nothing against remakes as such but this one is just so lousy that it makes you even hate the original one which was pretty decent i fail to understand what actors like salman and govinda saw in this script i read somewhere that this was supposed to be <UNK> comeback vehicle if thats true then only god can save his career salman just <UNK> to the <UNK> govinda who i think is an actor of very high caliber was completely wasted <UNK> <UNK> and lara <UNK> had nothing to do apart form wearing designer clothes and smiling for no rhyme or reason please stay away form this one
<START> red <UNK> br br i loved <UNK> i think this director has made some awesome demented visions of the future this film however was boring pretentious crap the opening scene showed great promise for what the cover art and description promise a surreal live action style future noir i feel i got that with <UNK> br br with red <UNK> i was only driven to feel a uncomfortable to desire to what the hell the point was the film barely made sense to me and i could not care less about the people in it this would all be ok if the film was effective art while the opening scene looked interesting and the scene with the giant robot suit person holding the giant machine gun in the rain looked cool it did not watch the film worth watching br br thumbs down
<START> <UNK> 2 has a dreadful reputation due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly held classic people have <UNK> the film on a lot of grounds but they all ultimately <UNK> back to the fact that this is not <UNK> br br i would begin by saying that we should just take <UNK> out of the <UNK> and consider this film on its own merits but i think that would be unfair the movie does have a lot in common with its predecessor the class related themes of versus and the desire to fit in to a class above your own are as prevalent here as they were in the first movie the two things that are truly lacking here are bill murray and rodney <UNK> who are replaced with dan <UNK> and jackie mason respectively br br now i am not about to try and argue that <UNK> comes close to murray in the movie but jackie mason is an admirable <UNK> to <UNK> he comes off as a cross between <UNK> and arnold but without biting too heavily on either i wouldn't say that he is anywhere close to being as funny as <UNK> is in <UNK> but there is a whole lot more point to his character and his dilemma in the film br br chevy chase only pops up and handful of times in the movie which is another common complaint maybe these particular <UNK> didn't notice that he only popped up a few times in the first movie for my money his scenes here are a lot funnier if somewhat over directed br br while i'm on the subject it is really the over direction of this movie that brings it down it comes across as far more self conscious in its attempts to get a laugh many of the jokes are <UNK> and there's far too much of the <UNK> who seems to have taken on a far more <UNK> personality and a voice just in case we didn't grasp the idea that its meant to be funny br br characters are similarly <UNK> home particularly the smarmy <UNK> kids jackie mason rarely misses a beat and is consistently likable and very funny but we didn't need the tango sequence at all the director is clearly not of the same school of thought as harold <UNK> not to suggest that <UNK> was subtle but the jokes here are just a little <UNK> and most of them are unnecessarily <UNK> with a quirky music cue br br all things considered this is a fun goofy movie with something to say about class and identity that very few movies at the time were saying don't be put off by the <UNK> low rating on imdb check it out for yourself
<START> william who directed one of the most exciting silent films ever made <UNK> here returns to the <UNK> with another rip roaring story of dare devil <UNK> had been an air ace in world war one and no one knew like he did here they are stunt flying crashing exploding in the air and everything you can think of plus a fascinating glimpse of commercial air <UNK> in 1932 as well and there is a good strong story excellently played by the <UNK> richard the silent star who made several films with d w griffith sally and tom brown is a real such a relief to see a real woman with real fire and character instead of one of those <UNK> <UNK> who play in movies in today's hollywood and all look identical the story is a sad one played with genuine pathos and well directed towards the end of the film there are some extraordinarily thrilling scenes of danger and rescue and what must be the most ingenious blind landing in thick fog ever thought of i dare not give away the ingenious aspects of that particular episode the character played by is very like himself a truly wild hell <UNK> in the air anyone who likes early <UNK> would love this film and it's very rewarding for anyone who likes good solid entertainment love tears and non stop action all combined in a kind of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the first half of this movie was quite good it was interesting and suspenseful the second half was pretty bad the comic book revenge story came full circle and we see lots of comic nazi characters and some badly acted good guys blowing them away there's a lot of violence in this movie i'm not <UNK> about violence but i think it should at least have some purpose in a movie there was little purpose to the violence here except to create a genre film where we see lots of people getting <UNK> down with <UNK> we're somehow supposed to be amused by this br br i watched <UNK> dogs recently there was a movie where violence was employed effectively it was realistic within the world the movie created there were never any over the top sound effect it was a crime movie which played it straight <UNK> <UNK> should have played it straight but didn't i was rolling my eyes at how the violence was exaggerated with sound effects and extra bullets to the head and face br br none of the back story of any of the <UNK> is really explained either they're simply nazi hunters we don't really get to like any of them either because they're too busy cutting <UNK> off and shooting people in the face it's all about revenge and very little else br br there was 2 1 2 hours to work with here but few of the <UNK> were really examined in depth this seems like it was simply a revenge flick pure and simple we saw that in <UNK> last flick death proof which i didn't care for either it suffered the same problems the characters were almost <UNK> br br the first half again was pretty good i wanted to see the exploits of the <UNK> <UNK> across europe i was presented with a much <UNK> movie about the resistance movement plotting revenge against some comic book nazis when they all go to one movie premiere in france
<START> <UNK> <UNK> delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless mr bean who never goes far without his teddy bear the appeal of mr bean is largely his childish behavior and innocence we don't know if he came from the sky or another planet he is the kind of strange character that you can't make up quite easily he is often alone and used to it he has a hard time <UNK> through speech which might be why we only hear his <UNK> at times there are other characters who speak to him and he responds the character of mr bean is a mystery and still is he lives alone and does the <UNK> when he can do the sensible thing mr bean is rather an odd man out who does not mind it much he rather live a simple life with his yellow car and teddy bear and hopes to get to work on time
<START> non stop action and just about every <UNK> and <UNK> sci fi horror cliche can be found in this blatantly silly but fun big budget epic the pace never lets up especially in the shorter us version which <UNK> things up considerably
<START> attention possible spoilers br br this film is so lousy that it actually becomes funny the director has put in all the clichés that have ever plagued b series movies the stupid bimbo nice rack getting caught again and again by the bad guys chief villain <UNK> and revealing his plots before they happen so they can be ruined and who of course <UNK> killed the hero's father in an unclear past a side kick in the person of a policeman small bald and whose only <UNK> for the last battle another cliché is returning his baseball cap <UNK> backwards etc br br the film's end really tops it after the chief villain dies when the hero <UNK> jack or whatever throws him from the roof of a building ten stories high they walk out of the building which from the <UNK> looks three stories high only and very much like your regular city hall br br when they exit the building the side kick can't walk being that his right leg appears to be wounded how nobody can tell ten minutes earlier he fell down shot in his shoulder and his feet were fine there is no further explanation for the <UNK> mind of the viewer who would be curious to know such trivial things as where is the <UNK> body which should lay near the building and why is there no police or even curious folks gathered round the said body br br i could go on forever with the list why does another one of the bad guys claim to have invented martial arts when he gets his ass kicked in no time why do bad guys in general make silly movements when attacking why does the hero look so is there anyone really thinking yes these characters and this plot makes this a film to remember and the actors suck our hero and <UNK> of the day wears the same expression on his face the whole film that disgusted trying to be cocky <UNK> must be some <UNK> feat of him br br also thinking that until now 12 of the people having rated this film gave it a 10 makes me full of fear inside they might have been serious and then we're doomed
<START> i'm not sure this review contains spoilers but i'm playing it safe by <UNK> there might be regardless it's unlikely anyone will watch this film who isn't familiar with the book br br there's an old <UNK> about <UNK> and bringing forth a mouse <UNK> moon is such a mouse br br the novel focuses more on the indians than the americans in adapting it for tv and rightly <UNK> that the audience would be more interested in the whites than the <UNK> unfortunately there's little in the novel that we don't already know about gus <UNK> and their friends so the movie gives us mostly a <UNK> of what will occur in <UNK> <UNK> the indians who have their own story to tell are largely <UNK> to the background so much so that someone who hasn't read the novel will rightly wonder why it's titled <UNK> moon br br the novel has no overall story line or much of a point this could have been fixed in the movie by more strongly drawing the contrast between the indians losing their lands and way of life to the <UNK> americans who bring this opportunity was missed br br unlike <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> moon has few extended scenes that develop character or relationships at least among the americans the extended scenes with the indians have been largely removed or <UNK> and for a net four hour film it is remarkably episodic and choppy one gets the feeling the script was originally longer and cut to <UNK> the production costs br br the screenplay <UNK> mostly clichéd dialog and <UNK> coming from the author of the last picture show it's a <UNK> bad script and had the opportunity to fix problems with the story and characterizations but did not br br some of the best dialog from the novel is missing or altered for no obvious reason for example clara cassie shows her intense hatred of <UNK> jack by <UNK> gus for always running off to be with his <UNK> that <UNK> little revelation of <UNK> sexual <UNK> is gone then there's the scene where the <UNK> dense <UNK> warns maggie not to let jake <UNK> compromise her the exchange in the novel is shorter and <UNK> the film tones it down and doesn't portray <UNK> as quite the socially stupid emotionally frozen stone he is when i read that scene in the novel i wanted to punch <UNK> in the stomach or worse there are other changes some of them understandable <UNK> <UNK> are not cut off to do so would like have required expensive cgi but buffalo <UNK> has no <UNK> perhaps it was felt <UNK> to ask wes <UNK> to around such a huge <UNK> and buffalo character is <UNK> and <UNK> he is nowhere nearly as <UNK> violent as he was in the novels br br the only good thing about this near turkey is steve remarkable performance not so much as gus but as robert duvall playing gus it is uncanny he perfectly <UNK> <UNK> mannerisms and manner of speech without ever appearing deliberate or self conscious as was duvall he is wholly within the character and he actually shows us gus becoming more gus in the third part br br the best thing about <UNK> moon is that it won't spoil our affection for <UNK> <UNK> not just a great western but a great american film br br ps for those who think rachel <UNK> was over the top that's the way she was in the book
<START> cover girl is the best musical rita hayworth ever made ms hayworth will always be remembered for <UNK> however the next movie would be cover girl the story is great it is about a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and makes it big in show business she does it without the help of her talented dancer director boyfriend gene kelly mr kelly is given the chance to <UNK> the musical numbers the dances are spectacular it is fun to see phil <UNK> a comic do the musical numbers with ms hayworth and mr kelly br br the supporting cast is perfect lee <UNK> is given a chance to be an interesting third wheel the other boyfriend
<START> joe <UNK> might have made some other notable movies in his very long and very prolific career prolific of course by turns of making very cheap z grade movies in <UNK> big exploitation boom of the late 70s early 70s but porno holocaust isn't one of them or at least shouldn't be granted i should not expect much from a movie with such a title but i thought considering the back of the description that it might have some fun horror scenes with the horny mutant cannibal zombie turns out the zombie doesn't appear until more than halfway into the movie and at every turn we get instead a <UNK> sex scene as hardcore as one can imagine which is fine but it's not very enjoyable except in the most what the f is this <UNK> kind of way there's laughable dialog involving <UNK> <UNK> more from mail order japan than in paris hot slim women play and who have particular sexual hang ups letting the door be <UNK> to be raped and a <UNK> polar kind of enjoyment out of getting gang <UNK> br br it all leads up to the island where the main attraction is a guy who early on just spends an absolutely pathetic forget ludicrous amount of time just staring at the <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> of the shot on <UNK> island and once revealed has a face like one of the guards in <UNK> palace and has a sweet <UNK> for a main <UNK> but much dumber than anything before it is the relationship that develops between the monster and a dark skinned lady who has an <UNK> amount of time to escape but just sits there blank faced as the monster brings gifts and for what must be a <UNK> motivated exploitation move on the part of the filmmakers the monster only rapes and kills the white women and not her and it ends of course with a happy ending i use quotes of course out of a kind of shock that this could have any kind of legitimate ending at all br br bottom line this is not what you might expect as possibly being a bloody horror movie with plenty of tacky but cool looking italian monster zombies <UNK> human flesh if anything what violence is in the film is done on a shoe string a <UNK> hit to the face is immediately cut to the bloody aftermath which is like the aftermath of a <UNK> hitting someone so really the last part of the title is meant more for market sake yet even as a porno movie it has little to go on except as a reason for the cast and crew to get a paid vacation to the <UNK> as an interview with george <UNK> suggests this was just one of a few <UNK> made while on the island its got penny bought <UNK> camera work and similar actors filled with <UNK> about 3 4 of the whole time and with wretched lip <UNK> and music like <UNK> forced at gun point to make something snappy in a <UNK> and it's still a piece of celluloid dung all the same all of this could be an immense guilty pleasure but it isn't
<START> <UNK> comes to <UNK> despite a poor reception in the british press and state <UNK> british cinema written all over it i rather hoped that we'd get a bit of the <UNK> hard <UNK> london by the sea of graham greene br br it doesn't even <UNK> to this characters straight out of their clone <UNK> <UNK> trailers <UNK> guy <UNK> types the format looks more like a british tv series than a film <UNK> is a backdrop <UNK> wasted with plastic studio work br br i watched this film in pursuit of a good performance from <UNK> <UNK> she's a bit slick for this company her brand of big screen <UNK> more to blockbusters such as deep rising as for acting a role even the search continues circus is boring 3 10
<START> i don't want to write too much about the film but basically it's an action comedy with a little bit of romance thrown in about two men who come together in unlikely circumstances and become highway men together fantastic performance by robert and everybody else involved a brilliant who really makes you hate him some great comical lines actually laugh out loud amazing action and a great plot choice of music and ambiance all fantastic basically brilliantly directed and written i recommend this film to anyone who likes a good british movie or a good bit of action i don't know why the film never took off i thought it got no where near as much recognition as it deserved if for nothing else watch this film for one of the greatest <UNK> of all time not to give anything away but this one really <UNK> the heart beating
<START> in an earlier comment i mentioned how much i enjoyed this film better second time around i don't from that opinion strangely i can't find anyone else who did like it br br my mother was going to see it but several friends told her no way my sister and her family saw it and half the theatre walked out part way through br br my wife's suggestion is that <UNK> see the characters as just normal everyday americans and therefore it's not funny but hey most americans think all <UNK> are like crocodile <UNK> so it's nice to have the boot on the other foot for a change
<START> for a film by a first time director this is a simply amazing little film though i have to admit that it's a bit hard to watch and will probably offend the sensibilities of many who watch it as the film takes a definite stand in favor of <UNK> suicide however what i loved about the film is that i had no idea this is what the film was about until the film was more than half complete and by then i was already hooked br br in addition to the excellent way the subject was introduced i was amazed at the very professional style of the film with some of the best cinematography i've ever seen in a short film plus this camera work was combined so well with music and images that made the film just beautiful br br as i said this is a controversial film i myself struggle with what i think about this debate but the film managed to make a statement in such a <UNK> and intelligent way i really have to respect the team who made this film
<START> this film gave me probably the most pleasant surprise of any i've ever seen it was not a big budget production and its premise middle age amateur jazz musicians get an unexpected professional engagement at a <UNK> like resort seems rather modest what's not modest is the film's success this is a little slice of life movie that is most entertaining throughout director frank d <UNK> also wrote the script and it's full of interesting subplots and unexpected twists br br the actors are <UNK> who do a solid job the biggest revelation to me was <UNK> little he plays a professional musician who is hired to fill in for an <UNK> band member his attitude immediately <UNK> with the others while they see it as an opportunity for big fun and a once in a lifetime thing he sees it as his job and not a particularly interesting one this leads to conflict but when the group gets in trouble he <UNK> them through little who died too young really showed me he was a fine actor with this film br br this movie is a true sleeper the kind that a film fan always hopes to discover i recommend it <UNK>
<START> a short review without any spoilers follows br br i saw this movie yesterday at the cannes film festival my initial reaction is one of wonder and happiness i'm so happy films like this are being made in our age of blockbusters br br roy new movie you the living is nothing less than a complete masterpiece you the living is composed by some 50 vignettes filmed with a static camera i will not give away the content of the scenes here because i hate when people spoil even the smallest details but yes most of the scenes made the 1000 people in the claude <UNK> theatre absolutely <UNK> and amazed when the film was over we <UNK> for several minutes we had no other choice br br so what's the score with you the living <UNK> isn't afraid to take on the heavy questions history guilt the holocaust during ww2 are big subjects and these themes work very well together br br the images created are brilliant the depth sometimes surpasses songs from the second floor br br well sorry for this <UNK> <UNK> review look out for the flying house in the beginning folks br br 10 10 stars a masterpiece i never throw this grade out
<START> the phenomenon <UNK> schneider defies easy description or quick yet for the international audience not <UNK> to him one could say he's something like a crude mix of weird al <UNK> and andy kaufman adding a <UNK> for jazz music and 70s outfits while his stage performances already are eccentric his movie works are simply hilariously outrageous br br 00 schneider is in my opinion best movie he stars in the two leading roles police detective 00 schneider and murderer villain <UNK> and also in a precious smaller role as <UNK> dr br br in the opening scene we see how modern art loving <UNK> accidentally kills the circus clown <UNK> from whom he has bought a used <UNK> when a beloved <UNK> slips out of <UNK> hands <UNK> hitting upon reading about the incident in the newspaper 00 comes back from retirement to investigate the case with the support of his loyal sidekick lt who is played by an elderly actor bearing the same name they pick up <UNK> track quickly and <UNK> him at his <UNK> <UNK> mansion one of the movie's best scenes but initially fail to gather any proof the story winds through many turns with several scenes that don't always really contribute to the progress of the plot but are hilariously funny such as a <UNK> by 00 including the most unusual view on a running man's brief clad <UNK> in movie history a police department party during which gets into a row with the chief and has to be <UNK> and a visit at the already mentioned dr <UNK> then is finally caught attempting to escape to <UNK> de <UNK> on a plane br br always worth special mention is <UNK> who in this case plays <UNK> wife as he's usually appearing in drag performing women's roles in movies br br so all you folks out there looking for new laughs i strongly recommend this movie the catch you have to understand german as i doubt there's an english version around
<START> i'd heard of the case but hadn't really paid attention during the whole <UNK> of writing the book being arrested etc however this movie did an excellent job of <UNK> martha the brothers the murder mark involvement and the results of his investigation i especially liked the flashback scenes with martha talking about her last summer the actress who played her literally <UNK> with life and made it even more poignant that the real martha was probably like that it made martha seem like a real person rather than a victim i'd definitely recommend watching this
<START> i've read the positive comments on this movie i assume people who were in this movie must've come to this site to give it some good press because this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i always watch the whole film despite the quality or lack there of which explains why i watched this whole movie but i don't think i laughed even once during the duration of this film the jokes were mostly very bad but when the jokes had some promise the delivery was off if you liked it maybe you should lay off the <UNK> because you need to <UNK> the 5 or 6 brain cells you have left this movie had a poor script bad acting poor directing weak plot nothing of virtue and was not entertaining if you haven't seen this movie don't
<START> i enjoyed <UNK> les <UNK> du <UNK> and was therefore expecting this film to be of a similar standard well the first 10 minutes were ok but then it <UNK> into a rather pretentious journey of a young man looking for the essence of life a sad disappointment
<START> this film is bad not so bad it is good just bad it is however hilariously bad i watched it out of some morbid curiosity and never intend to watch it nor any other chuck norris film ever again if you have to choose between this film and death you should happily choose this film however as it is is a <UNK> in terrible film making hence the hilarity br br it is a constant depression to me as i <UNK> away at my desk job that some people get to be involved in movie making and decided to produce things such as this br br 1 out of 10 still better than starship troopers however
<START> given that dylan thomas is an icon of modern poetry i expected a movie that would be prone to a <UNK> of the subject on the contrary the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible a <UNK> a bad father a and a <UNK> and perhaps a coward of course one could argue that all those things are an advantage when some one is an artist and especially a poet since one of the purposes of art is to <UNK> the standards of conventional morality but still i do not thing that a positive role model could crop up from such a <UNK> of personality traits any way i found the other male hero of the story captain a more endearing character the two female roles were played by actresses and miller and were truly charming especially the first when she performed songs in slim outfit to inspire <UNK> <UNK> during ww2 another good point is the role that sexual jealousy plays even in relatively <UNK> that think that age old conventions can easily be <UNK> the atmosphere of the <UNK> was also convincing as well as the portrayal of the distinct <UNK> among people who have experienced war as opposed to those who talk about it <UNK> on it's possible political <UNK> i think one would recommend such a movie
<START> while its not the masterpiece that le <UNK> was i've accepted by now that jean pierre <UNK> was never able to top that classic i find le <UNK> to be much better than bob le i felt that bob le was an above average and influential b film but still a b film le <UNK> proves that as a filmmaker <UNK> improved as he continued john woo is a massive fan of <UNK> even though their film making style <UNK> while woo uses fast motion for <UNK> and an operatic sense of violence <UNK> has a <UNK> style that suits him very well he wasn't interested in creating quickly paced action films but more <UNK> crime thrillers in that department he was one of the best br br le <UNK> is still his best work mainly because it has more character development than this but on a technical level they're probably equal besides while le <UNK> had one great lead performance this has four <UNK> <UNK> is once again an ultra cool gangster on the <UNK> this man's silence is fascinating is superb as the police inspector on the case of the heist and escaped con he steals every scene he is in and proves that he was a skilled dramatic actor in france he is best known as a slapstick comedian in the mode of buster keaton <UNK> <UNK> is great also as the shaky and paranoid gun expert <UNK> maria a regular in spaghetti westerns is overshadowed by his three co stars but still does an adequate job br br once again <UNK> direction is superb taking equal influence from both american crime thrillers and the french new wave the man always seems to know the best shots and angles to choose this is more slowly paced than most caper flicks but it really pays off by the end le <UNK> is a bit short of being an absolute classic but is still one of the best heist flicks ever made tarantino must've seen this before making <UNK> dogs 8 10
<START> if you like horror or action watch this film <UNK> if the opening scene doesn't get your <UNK> <UNK> then someone should check your pulse great action excellent casting and top one liners this is the only film i have seen in a cinema where the crowd <UNK> each chop kick punch thrown not perfection but who cares when films can be this much fun its a pure rush of dark comic book action 9 10
<START> twins effect starring some of most popular stars provides one of the most enjoyable film experiences to come out of hk in sometime it has something for everyone action comedy horror romance and some drama this film can't be taken too seriously otherwise you'd go in <UNK> but if you leave your brain at the door and just watch the film for some fun you're bound to enjoy it br br great special effects excellent action cute twins cool hk actors fun film br br i'd recommend it to anyone
<START> the details in the big trail were so incredible that i felt that the movie was made at the time it represents i have never seen <UNK> that were so real they were big loaded with <UNK> and even felt as though they had been filled with details under the <UNK> covers that was never meant to be seen every <UNK> of dirt every scratch every <UNK> was there modern day computer technology could never recreate the scenes of the numerous <UNK> as they move across the land or circle to <UNK> off indians the <UNK> were all real individual vehicles each with its own real team of horses or br br the actors clothing could not have felt more genuine with the exception of john wayne's outfit and <UNK> <UNK> nice dress the clothes were very common looking <UNK> or dirty in an authentic looking way many of the actors and actresses were born before electricity and <UNK> <UNK> were common and they must have felt comfortable with the surroundings all the indians were real indians rather than white extras painted <UNK> br br women of the old west had to be <UNK> because there was a lot of work in every scene showing work done by the people of the <UNK> train women are shown <UNK> wood <UNK> <UNK> etc this realism was so natural looking that it did not come across as a statement on the role of women of the day rather than a fact of survival br br the plot of revenge and romance is played well nothing is <UNK> or <UNK> br br something was lost along the way in the 1930's in hollywood as much as i love the fake scenery and controlled environment of old movies the big trail manages to feel real above all else the more i see big budget movies of the silent era the more i like them i can think of few movies of the 1930's that i have seen that equal the <UNK> of the best of the <UNK> if there were home movies made in the days of <UNK> trains the big trail is what they would look like
<START> this is one of the best non english series i have seen it weaves interesting single and double episodes of crime solving together with a personal aspect that you just don't get in <UNK> the individual characters all have personal lives that combine well with their day job and occasionally <UNK> additionally the characters all manage to naturally <UNK> throughout the episodes br br the casting is superb and it was taped all over <UNK> giving a good example of the highlights that <UNK> country has to offer unfortunately only <UNK> episodes were made however they are top notch television here's hoping they consider making some more episodes of the same caliber
<START> i grew up with the <UNK> and <UNK> movies a because my dad grew up with them and both our last names are <UNK> so we owe the a bit of respect i didnt realize the <UNK> this movie and others of <UNK> gets it was a really <UNK> due it was funny cause <UNK> and <UNK> were always the same characters but it was <UNK> funny now what i like about jack and the is that even though the love story is totally boring and that one song the prince sings <UNK> but i like the angle they took on the love story the couple has to get married cause one kingdom is running out of money they meet in the jail cell and fall in love they both pretend not to be royal and they end up being the couple so happy ending i dont think that was the <UNK> version if it was they should have cut it out of this movie but i think it was <UNK> and i love it but watching it sucks lol also when the movie really kicks in with the giant <UNK> and <UNK> it is <UNK> funny when the giant is beating jack into the door and jack is screaming open the door open the door that stuff is really funny and that once joke where jack starts screaming prince prince and all those dogs jump him kinda <UNK> but really <UNK> i wish they would have al least tried to <UNK> it though i got that africa screams jack and the and i dont mind the quality cause when i had it on tape it was bad quality also so whatever i guess the <UNK> is mildly funny the middle is really really funny and the end is not funny in the least but i am 19 years old and when a movie made in <UNK> makes me laugh this hard it rocks this movie is really funny i love their style also the chapters suck also the part where jack is climbing the and they are all singing a song about what a <UNK> jack is and that he will be killed thats pretty funny
<START> if you make a suspense movie it is kind of important that the villain not be more sympathetic than the victim and this fails miserably it was so terrible and frustrating to watch that i was actually moved to register and comment ok so the husband is rich and cocky there are worse <UNK> and the <UNK> boy and wife display plenty the husband is a jerk because he um didn't <UNK> of the <UNK> boy physically <UNK> that woman the witch one which had absolutely nothing to do with the plot btw the <UNK> boy threatens the husband and repeatedly attempts to seduce the wife he then forces himself on her which the woman finds so hot she stops thinking rape and starts thinking she wants him uh huh the misogynistic <UNK> complex thoughts the director displays are just revolting it is one thing when a fine film like american psycho deliberately tries to get us to <UNK> with the villain but in survival island i felt like i was watching a movie about ted <UNK> but the director failed to make him unlikeable and instead made us hate his victims what was he thinking
<START> people need to give this show a chance the people who write bad reviews there are very few of them are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes one needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it all of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws they make mistakes but they are realistic mistakes which is an <UNK> thing to see on television today also for the most part the acting is superb lauren graham has been <UNK> of an emmy for six years now someone needs to give this woman the credit she deserves same goes for kelly bishop who plays emily <UNK> so perfectly also it's nice to see a show that can have a young girl at the center of it and not be filled with teen angst <UNK> is a smart girl which is also not seen a lot on television today if only other shows could capture the <UNK> of this show

<START> bring a box of <UNK> to this funny engaging and moving <UNK> the two leading actors give tour de force performances there was considerable debate afterward about whether they are really disabled they are not i appreciated that for once the filmmakers <UNK> to be politically incorrect by depicting people with severe physical <UNK> as fully developed people character flaws and all as a result their believability <UNK> us and makes us grow to like them and care about their conflicts the story structure is formulaic and many of the secondary characters are merely types but the two central characters are so riveting that it doesn't matter br br interesting the original title inside i'm dancing reflects the viewpoint of the character michael while the new title for usa release suggests that <UNK> is the central figure
<START> i originally saw this on its premiere in the uk i was <UNK> by it and it had me in tears all throughout its duration i taped it off the tv for but over the years it's worn out and tv never seem to show it therefore it was a joy to find out that true movies own the <UNK> and were showing it on their channels this time i taped it onto a dvd so i can enjoy it again and again br br <UNK> <UNK> played <UNK> by ann <UNK> discovers she has cancer and that it is <UNK> her husband has <UNK> and although he is loving he is an alcoholic and would be incapable of taking care of their children after she has gone therefore she has to find new homes for each of her children before she dies br br the acting is top notch the music beautiful and it has stood the test of time wonderfully it still makes me cry if you ever get the chance you would be silly to miss this it is a wonderful film a must see for everyone

<START> this is total <UNK> if you take the devil's rejects and suck all the good out of it and add a lot of twisted kinky bondage parts a few rape scenes and like one or two sincerely horrifying scenes and you'd get this movie people are calling this a ripoff of the <UNK> but i don't see that at all even the worst <UNK> <UNK> are still better than this the main problem on display here is that there's really nothing here besides a few of the director's <UNK> being <UNK> like circus <UNK> is all you need out of a movie shots of girls being abused and tied up <UNK> in fear well then rent this movie br br however i'd rather just watch a good movie which this is clearly not the sad thing is there are some really good thrills waiting to be <UNK> here but only a few for instance the suspense at the beginning before the bondage nonsense started pretty damn good if you ask me and the scene where the <UNK> kills the <UNK> girl can't remember names is chilling very brutal in a way challenging even the devil's rejects for <UNK> fury how come the rest of the movie can't be that good huh i really need to stop renting stupid crap like this closing message just let this <UNK> trash die and forget it forever not recommended
<START> jack <UNK> straightforward thriller about a guilt ridden ira <UNK> forced into one last job where have i heard that plot before gets a <UNK> treatment from cult director mike <UNK> mickey rourke with <UNK> red hair <UNK> all to the priest bob <UNK> of all people who accidentally witnessed the shooting the rules of the church keep father bob from talking but then rourke goes and falls in love with the <UNK> blind niece they bond at the church <UNK> what really that's the plot alan bates is around as the top dog mobster who's calling the shots literally and he seems to be the only actor who's on to the <UNK> tone <UNK> is aiming at bates is all set to do a sort of u k <UNK> honor but no one else including an effortlessly charismatic liam neeson in a supporting role has been informed
<START> if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it this film is actually quite entertaining it's got action adventure and romance and one of the premiere casting match ups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de <UNK> in the lead roles as evident on this board the picture doesn't pass <UNK> with <UNK> who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling to get beyond that one need only put aside the history book and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction i know i know that's hard to do when you consider <UNK> last stand at the little big horn and it's <UNK> in the history of post civil war america so i guess there's an <UNK> <UNK> with the picture no matter how you look at it br br there's a lot to take in here though for the <UNK> two hour plus run time <UNK> arrival at west point is probably the first head <UNK> riding up as he does in full military <UNK> the practical joke by sharp arthur kennedy putting him up in the <UNK> probably should have gotten them both in trouble br br ironically a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy as in <UNK> first meeting with <UNK> bacon and subsequent encounters that include tea reader <UNK> <UNK> i hadn't noticed it before in other films but <UNK> reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties <UNK> <UNK> so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been <UNK> <UNK> it up in a dress with that in mind the owl scene was a hoot too br br as for flynn it's interesting to note that a year earlier he portrayed j e b stuart opposite ronald <UNK> depiction of general <UNK> in santa <UNK> trail both <UNK> for the attention of none other than olivia de <UNK> in that film reagan put none of the arrogance and <UNK> into the character of <UNK> that history remembers while in <UNK> portrayal here it's more than evident but it doesn't come close to that of richard <UNK> take on the military hero in 1970's little big man let's just say that one was a bit over the top br br the better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which <UNK> <UNK> to maintain his good name and not <UNK> it away on a <UNK> business venture that and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before riding into the little big horn in which he <UNK> that hell or glory was entirely <UNK> on one's point of view earlier a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into <UNK> character when he stated you take glory with you when it's your time to go
<START> pavarotti and the entire cast are superb in this beautifully filmed opera by <UNK> <UNK> the world's finest composer of operas the soprano is particularly spectacular with her perfect pitch the title role is well <UNK> and well sung the entire production is as perfect as one could expect br br a masterpiece of cinematography br br
<START> a possible minor spoiler the first jurassic park was an effective but silly film that did it's job and was actually pretty good the sequel the lost world had a few decent moments but those were ruined by the lame end portion of the film which had a t rex running amok in san diego now in jurassic park iii what little story there was in the first one and the sequel has been thrown out the window and replaced by a mere 90 minutes of basically non stop action which would have worked had the film not been so poorly done br br sam <UNK> is back as dr grant who is given a <UNK> by a couple william h macy tea <UNK> to come with them to an island to help them find their son who's been lost for over 2 months but of course this island just happens to be populated by dinosaurs and of course the plane the are on just happens to crash leaving them stranded with a bunch of <UNK> after them br br this one was obviously intended as a thrill ride with no real story whatsoever but even on that level the movie doesn't deliver director joe <UNK> <UNK> somehow managed to take what little magic was left in the jurassic movies and squeeze the life right out of it br br the <UNK> look okay though by now they're just standard fair and not very scary the bottom line is it's not a very good film even as a thrill ride out of 4 stars
<START> i won't spoil it for you although you probably could care less if it was spoiled you'll know what i mean after you watch it poor story b rated movie quality typical horror stupid situations rare timing i should of known when they try to push a lot of hype in their advertising or even add quotes just tells me that the movie bombed big time and they are trying to pull in everyone just so they can break even with to cost of making this bomb i wish i could take back the time i spent watching this i was stupid and thought that there just had to be something great around the corner but i kept getting let down i don't usually waste my time adding comments to any movie in fact this is my second post i just felt maybe i could spare a few of you from wasting money on something that had a bunch of hype on it
<START> no one expects the star trek movies to be high art but the fans do expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes unfortunately this movie had a muddled implausible plot that just left me cringing this is by far the worst of the nine so far movies even the chance to watch the well known characters interact in another movie can't save this movie including the goofy scenes with kirk spock and mccoy at <UNK> br br i would say this movie is not worth a rental and hardly worth watching however for the true fan who needs to see all the movies renting this movie is about the only way you'll see it even the cable channels avoid this movie
<START> as well as being a portrayal of a lesbian love story fire is also a comic satire of middle class indian culture i find this is a quality which is little appreciated about the movie these two genres i e deep meaningful alternative love story and comic satire usually mix together just as well as oil and water do but <UNK> somehow manages to achieve the balance to near perfection the servant behaviour the family's treatment of him the <UNK> <UNK> constant <UNK> presence obsession with a <UNK> coming from a culture much like <UNK> these are things i can immediately identify as being typical they have been crying out to be pointed out and <UNK> while developing her primary subject matter <UNK> manages to achieve this secondary theme <UNK> in fact much of the humour in the film which provides essential relief from the heavy subjects of taboo lesbian love and gender issues <UNK> from this satire of the seemingly ordinary the film flows from the comic to the serious with great br br all in all brilliant use of symbolic devices <UNK> compared to <UNK> of legend and coming out of fire <UNK> and therefore pure the <UNK> desire of the young <UNK> to see the ocean finally achieved when she <UNK> freedom kudos to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the lighting crew and <UNK> <UNK> their very un hollywood like and un bollywood like talents made this movie special one criticism the first scenes seemed rather disjointed to me in that they did not flow into each other very well br br the verdict 9 on 10 nothing less for a movie with scenes so burned on my mind
<START> here's a spoof that's guaranteed to entertain folks in the iq range of homer simpson it's a cheap shot at every great superhero notably <UNK> and batman but it doesn't end there it gets <UNK> worse until it <UNK> into a pathetic ensemble of slapstick by the <UNK> br br for those interested in the plot you've only to watch <UNK> while under the influence of some heavy <UNK> what you get is <UNK> man  a boy wonder who loves the girl next door suddenly <UNK> some <UNK> super powers br br the rest of the script is as predictable as waking up in the morning and <UNK> your teeth but <UNK> take my word for it for kids this is somewhat amusing for adults it's a great film to drop the kids off for
<START> i was at the world <UNK> of this movie and have even met todd a couples times around town once at <UNK> garden todd isn't a bad guy he is just a small time film maker with little to no budget and big dreams br br as for the movie it is good if you like zombie films with very little plot and lots of blood and guts you get to see some kansas city locations and lots of raw meat what could be better look for the same 2 dozen people playing different zombies with just a change of clothes or hats you can have a good drinking game with this movie take a shot whenever you see the same zombie in a different shirt
<START> certain filmmakers can do no wrong in the eyes of national critics which is one reason you should never pay attention to them this film is a perfect example the critics like director eric rohmer br br this movie is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager pauline she's taking care of for the summer and the relationships they have with a few men it's talk talk talk and more talk br br for those looking at the cover and hoping to be <UNK> there are a few quick nude shots and a couple of swear words but otherwise this is a harmless french morality play a friend of mine <UNK> me this tape he thought he was getting some sexy french film and was disappointed i was just as disappointed because it also was so boring br br how this gets such great reviews is almost <UNK>
<START> ed wood rides again the fact that this movie was made should give any young br br aspiring film maker hope any screenplay you might have thought of using to br br line a or a <UNK> should now not seem that bad do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy <UNK> of <UNK> or <UNK> watching this br br movie made me realize that <UNK> vs python was not that bad after all it probably would have been better to do this movie in <UNK> as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film it is understandable why this director has so many <UNK> there is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of <UNK> then you can eat your way out of the <UNK> of cheese that <UNK> you <UNK> you to br br make your toward your tv <UNK> <UNK> of cheese that <UNK> it
<START> i think not i mean yeah if you compare this film to the godfather or maybe a little older film like casablanca or maybe even a little newer film like the english patient it doesn't have the camera work or the cinematography like these other films but that doesn't mean that this is a bad movie or does it i think the reason why this film is underrated is because a lot of people always compare it to other great oscar winning films you should never do that which makes it hard to understand the beauty and the realism in this movie in the categories best picture best actor in a leading role and best actress in a supporting role this film really deserved all of them the magnificent dustin hoffman gives us once again one of his best performances a couple of times in this movie i forgot that it wasn't his son because it was just so real i have never seen a film about relationships in different families where it was so easy for the actors to play that specific role but still so beautiful so dustin hoffman passes the test with flying colors in my opinion there are a few actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best <UNK> hepburn meryl streep jane fonda and ingrid bergman i can't help it i think she's great meryl streep even though she's in a supporting role is amazing and real and you just can't help but being drawn ed to her talent and the way she makes it hers and real wow that's all i can say justin henry was great considering his age his tears and his relationship with his mom and dad was beautiful so i say good job to cute little justin henry br br while i was watching this film for like the third time alone i couldn't stop crying i tried but i couldn't thank god i was alone this is probably the <UNK> film i have ever seen other films that were nominated for best picture was apocalypse now norma <UNK> breaking away and all that jazz i'm ashamed cause i haven't seen any of them but from what i've heard apocalypse now is great but when i heard about norma <UNK> i only thought of sally field i think that considering the other <UNK> this film deserved it's five oscars and that it'll continue to touch and make other people cry for a long time in the future just like it has for the past 28 years good job all the actors and actresses in this film for giving us great performances and memories from watching this film that we won't ever forget br br thanks for your time
<START> this is for different reasons a very very bad action movie first of all seagal is terribly out of shape he looks old and fat plays like he has to fulfill an annoying <UNK> and his fight scenes require creative editing or plain replacement secondly his <UNK> is a very weak villain this is about a smart and mean and <UNK> does not deliver so what about the action well the two parties <UNK> shoot at each other in different locations of the <UNK> jail they shoot wild and bad because compared to the amount of required <UNK> the <UNK> is rather low there is nothing to save this movie there is not a single good line and not a single good joke the little psychological <UNK> with one and judge <UNK> is ridiculous so what does it have well the usual bell <UNK> <UNK> moving in blue light and slow motion doors <UNK> with bullets and 1000 <UNK> lights shining through the holes characters jumping through the air while shooting loads of weapons coming from nowhere a long black coat containing a bold black guy and a thin wooden box containing 25 tons of gold the pain continues to the very last take a hopeless approach to <UNK> up the closing credits <UNK> don michael paul was writing and directing at least this mountain of boredom comes from just one simple mind
<START> the movie with its single set minimal cast and straightforward photography except for a couple of brief special effects reminds me of one of those old 60 minute <UNK> dramas so popular during tv's early years nonetheless the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow <UNK> <UNK> as she tries to deal with her semi psychotic <UNK> robert ryan before one of his mood <UNK> kills her and who better to play the troubled part than that great actor ryan he wasn't very versatile watching him <UNK> comedy is almost painful but no one was better at wounded <UNK> on dangerous ground or the psychic pain of this movie few actors could express as much with their eyes as this lean and <UNK> figure br br <UNK> problem is that she's locked up in her house with a man who is kind and gentle one moment and raging the next the suspense comes from her various <UNK> to keep him happy while trying to escape it's a nail <UNK> all the way this is not one of <UNK> many fine <UNK> parts that she was so good at instead it's a role many lesser actresses could have handled well enough my favorite scene is with ryan and <UNK> teenager margaret <UNK> <UNK> already having difficulty with his <UNK> and what others are saying about him then when <UNK> walks in and finds the attractive looking ryan <UNK> the floor she starts getting <UNK> <UNK> with her budding sexuality <UNK> trouble ryan abruptly <UNK> her off <UNK> is not his strong suit insulted <UNK> attacks his <UNK> by calling his work women's work that does it up to that point he's been <UNK> and professional with <UNK> trying to set himself on a normal path but <UNK> has hit his raw nerve now there's heck to pay as <UNK> <UNK> out the door leaving <UNK> to pay the price it's a riveting scene expertly done br br anyway this is one of the dozen or so films produced by <UNK> and her husband at a time when audiences were moving away from these little black and whites in favor of wide screen <UNK> too bad what a hugely talented figure she was both behind the camera and in front she deserves at least an <UNK> oscar from a movie industry to which she contributed so much
<START> captain <UNK> martin sheen has been sent on a classified mission into cambodia during the vietnam war to <UNK> colonel <UNK> marlon brando as he has gone completely insane and is no longer taking orders and since <UNK> is one of the most <UNK> men in the armed forces it is hard for capt <UNK> to understand how <UNK> <UNK> could go off the deep end as he has killing without <UNK> and taking the war into his own hands what possibly could have pushed this great man over the top through <UNK> long journey through the jungle to find his target he tries with some success to understand why but what will he decide to do once he finds him br br any movie that can start out with the <UNK> the end is a great movie in my book especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song apocalypse now does this perfectly i can't think of anything better for it to be set to the vietnam war and the insanity in the minds that it created an is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the jungle in vietnam the ultimate destination of which is murder through it's use of music and score alone we are thrown into a dark world of mystery violence and insanity a perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here br br an overall great cast with the exception of laurence fishburne of which sheen and brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread i just don't like fishburne ever since i found out he was cowboy curtis in <UNK> <UNK> my contempt and hatred for this man has <UNK> ten <UNK> i realize the <UNK> of this but i simply do not care we need to sick gary <UNK> on him brando is excellent as <UNK> <UNK> and i can't think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence sheen is also fun to watch as <UNK> and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general my favorite character in the movie has to be robert <UNK> lt colonel before this film i never <UNK> duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it's my favorite of his parts to date he simply nailed his character which is one of the best in the entire film as the <UNK> ho air <UNK> commander who loves to surf maybe a little over the top but still brilliant i also love the smell of <UNK> in the morning br br the plot is a fairly simple one and it doesn't take too much <UNK> to figure out what's going on <UNK> mission is to kill <UNK> plain and simple but it's the journey of the film that is really it's heart and also the dire situations of war itself in the <UNK> version we are forced to sit through the extended french plantation scene and the playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the film's entirety other than it makes it a longer journey i don't feel they take away anything though it's just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original through this journey the film points out the utter <UNK> and <UNK> of the war to the americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in it in fact that's the entire point on top of that the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like to go completely mad br br a big war movie lover this one is up there with platoon and the deer hunter all of them classics i sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as i have had to go back on what i've said all three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the vietnam war so to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointless even if after having most recently view an i think it's a tad better in the end apocalypse now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it's been given as a fellow reviewer has previously stated an is one of the most ambitious films ever made
<START> the reason why this movie isn't any better known and more appreciated to me seems because of its subject because of its controversial subject this movie never got a proper big release and still remains a fairly unknown one to this very day not that it's subject is that controversial now anymore though br br basically in essence it's a movie about a white man <UNK> a black man the friendship does not seem forced or unrealistic but the way it gets portrayed in this movie makes it all feel very real we see these different <UNK> in with each other as if it's just completely normal unfortunately of course back in those days it really wasn't regarded as anything normal seeing a black man talking to a white girl and just having fun with her as a friend must have been an hard thing to watch for instance for some proportions of its 1957 audience br br you can really understand why sidney <UNK> has always been and still is being respected so much by the hollywood society and the black community in general of course it's one of the reasons why he also received an <UNK> award at the <UNK> in 2002 in his movies he often fights against <UNK> and <UNK> issues with of course in the heat of the night as the best example of this a real role model that certainly has inspired many <UNK> american actors to this very day but on top of that he also was a great actor yes he is still alive but he has pretty much retired completely from movies now it seems since his last credited role is from 2001 br br this movie was martin directorial debut and he also wasn't given too much movie to spend on his movie the studios were probably also a bit reluctant mainly because of its concept and or because it was first movie or perhaps it was simply due to the fact that mgm just wasn't that big anymore and it had left its best days behind them ever since the <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sort of had the reputation of making not too great and cheap movies while in the early years before that it was really one of the biggest studios with lots of stars and acclaimed directors attached to it who made many award winning classic movies luckily for them their reputation is starting to change again and whenever the mgm <UNK> appears at a movie people are no longer expecting a lesser movie anymore br br anyway even with its restrained budget and limited resources they managed to make a great movie out of this one the movie is very simple with only a few characters and a simplistic plot in it the movie however still manages to capture you with its story and subjects without ever starting to become preachy or anything about it it makes the movie an effective one as well with its subjects br br really a movie that deserves to be seen br br 8 10
<START> this show is amazing i love each and every episode carrie is a <UNK> and doug is a lovable and at times a moron arthur <UNK> danny <UNK> and <UNK> boss add just a nice end touch to the show <UNK> up all of the funny pee in your pants moments in one of the seasons doug tries to get carrie drunk because she is <UNK> when she is drunk nice husband right carrie isn't much better when her boss needs a <UNK> driver to <UNK> in a small case at her job carrie <UNK> because she views doug as a <UNK> and doesn't want him to embarrass her so she hires friend instead wife of the year but who i believe to be funniest is yell at random arthur he is drop dead hilarious and angry hey you would be too if you had to live in a basement where the mold has a funny smell and makes you <UNK> this show is hilarious and if you haven't seen it yet then you haven't lived
<START> quite simply <UNK> is the single greatest <UNK> game to date the learning <UNK> is just about perfect and you'll still be playing it with your friends months on as the <UNK> mode is nothing short of exceptional br br the system for <UNK> <UNK> for once requires some degree of skill rather than simply knowing which buttons to press and the challenge of aztec on 00 agent level is astonishing br br all in all it's the best game i've ever played on the <UNK>
<START> this is a very noir kind of episode it begins with jim returning from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend the recently divorced karen mills pat daughter in law of john huston who knew a few things about noir film and her daughter when they arrive karen goes in the house while jim picks up her daughter from the back seat and carries her up to her room he then discovers karen has disappeared without a trace of course he calls dennis and when the police arrive they see no sign of karen but find her next door neighbor murdered in the <UNK> so of course that makes jim an immediate suspect br br this is a great little mystery and the first half of the story is shown by rocky asking jim to go over the story once again rocky suggests that by jim telling him the story he might remember a little detail that he didn't think was important at the time but now might lead to a clue as to what happened it's a really well written scene and <UNK> the transition of the rocky character from a <UNK> to a concerned parent it also goes a long way to show that rocky isn't just some clueless old man either as he says you come to me because i'm your father and i'm smarter than you this is one of those times where we see where jim got his <UNK> br br this episode also features an appearance by <UNK> lara parker who played <UNK> in the dark shadows series and went on to play laura <UNK> <UNK> wife in the incredible hulk series a few years later she looks terrific here br br this episode also marks the first mention of the <UNK> crime family a name that would keep popping up on the <UNK> files almost whenever they needed a mob family this time its vincent <UNK> who <UNK> helps <UNK> br br lt <UNK> tom <UNK> makes his first appearance on the series and dennis is quietly from a police lieutenant that he was on the earlier season one episodes to a police <UNK> i guess they figured it would be better to have dennis less powerful and add some conflict between jim and the police frankly they were right though i prefer the later lt <UNK> to lt <UNK> br br not a lot of the typical <UNK> humor in this episode but a good mystery with a lot of heart
<START> will <UNK> david <UNK> the fifth actor to play the role in the series stumbles onto another bizarre case this time involving vampires rather than the usual witches <UNK> demons he's at the hospital to check on his friend's son who got hurt in a hit and run when they wheel a girl who's been attacked by a <UNK> in he brings in <UNK> to help out with the case which revolves around a <UNK> vampire organization trying to get a business to go through to let them <UNK> own all the blood banks in the world or some such nonsense br br the plot of this movie pretty much takes a <UNK> to the nudity <UNK> sex scenes as is to be expected from this series i guess so complaining about the lack of good acting or compelling plot line or even convincing characters i suspect would fall on deaf ears if you're watching this film you don't care about such <UNK> and just want some <UNK> sadly on that front the film fails as well all the woman are attractive enough but the way the scenes are filmed are just atrocious making this more or less an exercise in <UNK> in every <UNK> way br br eye candy both <UNK> blair april show everything shows full frontal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> holmes only shows their breasts br br my grade d
<START> this might quite possibly be the worst movie i have ever seen i knew it was a b movie before watching it it was actually the reason for watching it but i'd never thought it could be this bad the title promises dracula in space and does deliver however the story makes no real use of the fact that casper van character is a <UNK> of van <UNK> and watch out for the ending of the movie it comes at you fast i've never seen an ending scream out and now we're over budget in a <UNK> fashion their resolution of the movie was rather comic though the story had so obviously painted itself into a corner if you feel you have to see it watch it with a friend who shares your love of b movies if i hadn't i wouldn't have made it to the end
<START> i'm surprised over the number of folks that have rated this entry as their favorite chan didn't they ever see at the opera or at treasure island the latter ironically written by john <UNK> who dropped the ball here this plot is a train wreck and <UNK> with pointless characters first viewers are required to recall the <UNK> details of steve played by <UNK> thug and <UNK> marc lawrence murder spree let's not forget he escaped a capital murder rap at the <UNK> with a lone policeman on his tail there's also a victim that was <UNK> out of a river 11 years earlier that no one ever seems concerned about then there's the suspension of disbelief required when all the characters are seemingly trapped in the wax museum although inspector manages to <UNK> his fat wet rear end inside through a window why is joan valerie as <UNK> assistant in this movie she can't even handle <UNK> properly i realize chan suffers the same boo boo but <UNK> he's <UNK> years old here and has less than 10 lines and her character's motivation is too weak to ever be adequately excuse me when i'm on a rant i write like ricky <UNK> the mary <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> character is written to as a eager wide eyed moron apparently existing only for the vapid romantic interest of lawyer tom <UNK> played by the <UNK> faced ted <UNK> why is willie <UNK> a character why couldn't henchman pulled the switch at 8 20 not a spoiler okay one wonders how with the iq of <UNK> he manages to dress himself or why he hadn't stepped in front of a bus years ago <UNK> himself is given a little more acting rope than usual a plus and the real kudos go to set designer thomas little and cinematographer <UNK> miller who created some genuinely spooky atmosphere but this entry has less logic than a <UNK> brothers film i'm still <UNK> by how a <UNK> can be used as a blow gun
<START> the best bit when the dull mobster nicholas <UNK> calls out to the runaway matthew <UNK> <UNK> come back <UNK> and when the older wise guy asks him what are you doing he <UNK> simply enjoying my time actually like me at the moment br br the most creepy part i've been wondering all the time of watching where did i see that girl before where where till i found out while the closing credits <UNK> my god she's elizabeth <UNK> from the fiasco but i just couldn't recognize her with her clothes on to tell you the truth i felt a brief <UNK> she's really cute and nice but maybe hollywood had no mercy at all br br the most sexy bit when <UNK> says do you mean the stuff which gives you a <UNK> br br the most dull thing the retarded assistant after a day and a night in the back of the car is still alive and healthy at the end moreover the mexican <UNK> took 3 bullets at the same car and he's not dead either br br the most ugly thing all of those murdered people as well as the numerous f ward to a boring extent br br the most beautiful thing the crazy clever script with all the funny characters and the <UNK> situations the acting looked sweet also especially from paul rodriguez who stole the show for as he had the best dialogue also br br the most disappointing thing although the direction didn't mess about the story's <UNK> at all but in the same time it didn't give it a unique touch a <UNK> signature some kind of insane hilarity like the one in the story itself however maybe the low production <UNK> it well and of course the easy tasteless music which could be like that because of cheap production too br br the most confusing part matthew <UNK> is a talented guy but what did he do exactly to be out of hollywood's a list of stars what could possibly be the thing he made or didn't make to end up in light independent <UNK> like the <UNK> br br the most absent scene where did jose the mexican <UNK> go at last i thought that we'll see him again at the end <UNK> once more as the surviving little criminal who in a brief gimmick like this could <UNK> the continuous disorder of such a world br br the most question i had after the end when we'll see the <UNK> 2 as i'm so eager to see that fine small comic <UNK> atmosphere again br br these were my own answers if you interested in giving answers of your own for this <UNK> please e mail me
<START> if you're looking for a not so serious mob movie with a female as the lead you're in the right place <UNK> has acted much better than this you can see she has <UNK> beyond this picture br br when i first picked this movie up i expected pfeiffer was poorly miscast however she plays her mob wife role to the <UNK> not a bad performance from baldwin either br br if you don't pay attention to the hair you might enjoy this movie but don't take it too seriously
<START> i caught this film late at night on hbo talk about wooden acting unbelievable plot et al very little going in its favor skip it
<START> do it yourself indie horror auteur todd sheets returns with another <UNK> atrocious <UNK> shot on video <UNK> that's basically just a feeble excuse to <UNK> around a lot of <UNK> blood and <UNK> guts as often as possible an evil demonic scarecrow <UNK> the dead as <UNK> <UNK> faced zombies so they can feast on the living a bunch of <UNK> college kids a trio of dangerous escaped <UNK> led by the vicious <UNK> byron <UNK> it up to an outrageous degree two equally savage <UNK> <UNK> and a trio of <UNK> sisters all have to do their best to survive this harrowing ordeal that's it for the needlessly muddled and convoluted plot but fortunately what this hilariously horrendous hoot lacks in narrative <UNK> plenty it more than <UNK> for with a pleasing <UNK> of <UNK> gore disgusting highlights include a woman having her fingers chopped off a fatal <UNK> to a young <UNK> <UNK> attempted <UNK> rape <UNK> and of course more repulsive eating than you can shake a pile of <UNK> intestines at moreover we've also got rough grainy cinematography that constantly <UNK> between washed out color and <UNK> black and white <UNK> staged fight scenes lousy acting from a uniformly pathetic no name cast jerry <UNK> in particular cops the top crummy <UNK> for his laughably abysmal <UNK> as slimy no count psycho criminal joe bob a grating head <UNK> <UNK> metal soundtrack and a generic <UNK> score let's not forget the ridiculous ending in which several of our survivors stumble across a few <UNK> of flesh eating <UNK> to use on the <UNK> undead <UNK> sure this flick is pure dreck but it has a certain <UNK> <UNK> quality to it that in turn makes it a great deal of so awful it's awesome grade z fun for hardcore <UNK> of bad fright fare
<START> i'm a huge fan of both emily watson breaking the waves and tom <UNK> normal and was amused to see them <UNK> by rupert everett in this shockingly rather minor movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more the too brief scenes in which he portrays a <UNK> infinitely entitled worthless son of a rich lord are spot on and entertaining but for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone the music was annoyingly movie of the week quality and the voice over jarring and totally unnecessary clearly the work of a first time director with a small budget who either lacked or didn't <UNK> <UNK> good advice too bad br br i can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end and vice versa so there is some sort of character arc at least in terms of perception for example <UNK> character while <UNK> honest to her husband about her feelings for another man began to <UNK> on me near the end particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions and later when she simply <UNK> that she would be moving back into their marital flat with no asking of <UNK> no apologies offered and i went from <UNK> control freak moral <UNK> character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change unlike his wife br br this movie <UNK> <UNK> from a <UNK> to a love story or steel <UNK> illness drama without <UNK> <UNK> me of the fact so i was left <UNK> guessing what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed was it the lord driving the car the <UNK> dog the scene where the lord visits <UNK> and relates how brave watson is the <UNK> nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc was ok until he started over the top <UNK> like a baby good god if you ask me she's just another <UNK> rich person with way too much time on her hands and so she drives her hard working well providing <UNK> crazy with unnecessary drama her <UNK> around was just another way to <UNK> her empty life the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above <UNK> br br look everyone would have been better off if <UNK> had just left her for his secretary who seemed to appreciate him for who he was instead he acted like an abused dog his open <UNK> for his wife's affection increasing with every kick she gives him i'm not anti pc or anything it just didn't ring true even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face the ending for me was and not the director's intention i am certain depressing the movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just don't belong together so i found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing i'm not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed is that asking too much br br my score 4 10
<START> not being a movie <UNK> i am not familiar with the names of leading directors <UNK> producers and the like but i can tell an outstanding movie when i see one br br the makers of this fine movie could well be now at the top of their fields or may well get there pretty soon i know that the actors are already there br br it takes talent closer to genius to show with such realism how a national tragedy like vietnam has <UNK> the everyday life of a typically average american family and make us see at close range why there are so many homeless vietnam veterans br br without getting into gratuitous scenes of gore and bloodshed it makes us understand why so many men had flashbacks of what they had been thru br br the dialog is particularly gripping and gives us an idea of what went on in so many families in the aftermath of vietnam br br i wish there were more good movies like this one not just about vietnam but about other social conditions as well
<START> what has <UNK> <UNK> done to himself once a hit director of films like <UNK> and is now making one bad film after another i was initially excited at the thought of <UNK> <UNK> returning to the action genre but that soon <UNK> out as a <UNK> <UNK> fan i thought i should at least give it a go but i left after an hour one reason for me leaving the film so early so the amount of bashing in the film this was not in previous venture br br a lot of directors have tried bashing but i did not expect it from <UNK> <UNK> another letdown was the music <UNK> have always had good music until now there is only one good song and that is <UNK> the performances are not <UNK> scratch not even from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shah <UNK> fare from once my favourite director
<START> the ma <UNK> <UNK> characters were highly popular and controversial the films that featured their <UNK> <UNK> the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to <UNK> its winning formula one obvious reference is 'the beverly <UNK> ' where the new home was bought with oil money not having been won in a contest you could even say the 1980s sitcom borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series still i wonder if betty macdonald the washington based author who created these characters didn't do more harm than good her portrayal of <UNK> characters makes them the butt of many jokes in terms of their alleged <UNK> and <UNK> the real life family that macdonald based the upon successfully <UNK> claiming they had been <UNK> and <UNK> with these less than <UNK> references sure it's comedy and the situations bring us a great many laughs and fun moments and political correctness as we know it today did not exist in the 1940s and 1950s but i think macdonald could've still written these characters more <UNK> and universal international could've had its <UNK> show them on screen with more dignity there's such a thing as good taste the more realistic moments are when the oldest son tom is ashamed of his rural <UNK> but learns to accept his parents and siblings for who they are for their part the have to realize that they don't exactly fit into a modern world that's not a joke that's a sober truth
<START> to identify this movie as a vampire movie would be technically correct simply because it will suck the life right out of you br br vampire effect is an insult to movie buffs everywhere the plot is almost non existent the make up is just plain awful and the acting is just not there br br i have to wonder if jackie chan <UNK> someone a huge favor to be convinced to appear in this film br br my wife picked up the movie at the rental store because it had a picture of jackie chan on the front as though he was playing the lead and thought that a good <UNK> flick would be fun to watch this movie was interesting to watch in the same way that you can't help staring at the car wreck when you drive by you realize very quickly the movie isn't going to get any better but you keep watching wonder just how bad it will get

<START> <UNK> is one of those films from the forties that is crying for a remake if for no other reason than maybe it's time it should be done as originally written the story on which the film is based is about the killing of a gay man but anti <UNK> was certainly a hot topic in the days of post world war ii with the holocaust fresh in everyone's mind br br in the lee <UNK> biography of robert mitchum edward the director was interviewed and and <UNK> said that the film could never have been made about a hate crime against gays at the time with the code firmly in place it could have been though because the character of robert ryan is such an equal opportunity <UNK> of everything that <UNK> from his societal <UNK> br br mitchum was told in no uncertain terms that he was in the film strictly for the ride robert young was cast as the washington <UNK> police homicide captain who catches the case and while mitchum was second billed he knew from the beginning the film would belong to ryan but he was <UNK> new star by <UNK> of his performances in the story of <UNK> joe and till the end of time so he was there for box office insurance <UNK> part was as a sergeant and friend of the original suspect in the case george cooper br br <UNK> is not a <UNK> even though we don't see the crime it becomes clear that <UNK> is the one who kills sam <UNK> the quintessential jewish <UNK> and it becomes clear to young and mitchum that ryan is the guilty party almost as fast as it does to the audience it becomes just a question of getting the evidence br br ryan earned one of several academy award nominations the film garnered his best supporting actor category though he lost to edmund <UNK> the film was <UNK> breakthrough role similarly gloria <UNK> was nominated for a brief part as a party girl for best supporting actress but she lost to <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> in fact <UNK> ran up against <UNK> <UNK> and lost for best picture and best director for to <UNK> kazan it's fifth nomination for best screenplay and <UNK> came up short again with the winner being miracle on <UNK> street br br gloria <UNK> also had her own problems on the set which <UNK> over from her personal life she was having big trouble with her then husband stanley who was an abusive husband he was hanging around the set causing ed a lot of problems fortunately <UNK> part was a small one in fact the whole film was shot in typical rko economy style in 20 days br br robert young has a particularly fine scene with william <UNK> a young kid from <UNK> in mitchum and <UNK> outfit who ryan constantly <UNK> young is most <UNK> in speaking about the <UNK> nature of hate and how it affected his family as irish <UNK> who came over in the <UNK> <UNK> years it was one of robert <UNK> best moments on screen in his long career br br as fine a film as <UNK> is it's time to be remade as a story about an anti gay hate crime especially with the real killing of barry from the last decade and the debate about gays in the military br br that's a film who's time has come and almost gone
<START> it's as if the stay <UNK> <UNK> man from <UNK> had been <UNK> in <UNK> body and is taking revenge upon a <UNK> pregnant wife if seeing an <UNK> <UNK> chase a very pregnant <UNK> <UNK> imagine the spine <UNK> thrills in that contest sounds good to you see this film seriously if <UNK> is what an <UNK> <UNK> looks like after six years in prison then hungry people everywhere should make a <UNK> line to a jail in <UNK> overall <UNK> assault rates 2 stars instead of 1 because mike mitchell as <UNK> is terrific mitchell burns up the screen as a <UNK> pilot until his plane is burned up itself by an enemy <UNK> the film loses what little <UNK> it had to begin with
<START> i've seen some bible based trash this one tops it all to make matters worse it lasts about three hours a horrible waste of time unless you want to match your kid's biblical knowledge against the <UNK> <UNK> do yourself a favor take a walk in the <UNK> instead since i am required to give you a ten line statement of why not to watch this movie let me just say there is absolutely no <UNK> quality to it god's conversations with <UNK> are ridiculous the whole thing has a <UNK> of let's make the biblical account look retarded the basic logic goes if they spent the money on a biblical film why not make it worthwhile since the basic logic is not met something is <UNK> the movie starts with a <UNK> about poetic <UNK> taken that is the understatement of the century poetic rape but then poetic would be an <UNK> favor
<START> when i began watching i thought i was watching some pro amateur documentary however i had never seen 3 4 of the footage they used they interviewed people saying that the fbi <UNK> all these things which sounded so far fetched but then followed in up with fbi video and <UNK> i was amazed the documentary followed up with the <UNK> investigation after the fire and after seeing the interview and video footage you will be shocked at how the <UNK> and attorney general turn their backs on <UNK> basically to cover up the <UNK> by the fbi if you start watching this you must finish it otherwise you will think it is propaganda of something like that
<START> <UNK> is a very interesting movie that is somewhat difficult to <UNK> psychological thriller is the most appropriate description i can think of the female protagonist alice discovers that she doesn't remember anything of the last three days the only clue she has is a torn photo of a hotel she is also haunted by a recurring very vivid dream about a science fiction movie that she believes she saw many years ago in her pursuit of the truth behind her <UNK> she doesn't trust anyone but little by little it becomes obvious that she has visited the town where the hotel is located before this is an exciting flick whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how the events will unfold and particularly how it will end the unusual loneliness of the main character and the of everyone else ensure that the good old paranoid feeling is present throughout the film whereas beautiful colors and some spectacularly filmed sequences make this a visually attractive movie as well the important part of the one and only everyone's all time favorite <UNK> obnoxious child star of italian horror is an extra bonus
<START> so funny is the perfect way to describe this 12 minutes spoof of the original star wars <UNK> wars is incredibly funny it is presented as the trailer of the space epic <UNK> wars the joke is this imagine star wars played by bad actors and incredibly bad special effects the characters include the <UNK> boy wonder <UNK> the ace <UNK> and <UNK> wise guy ham <UNK> <UNK> villain and a host of other fantastic characters it is impossible not to laugh as you watch this 12 minutes treasure it's stupid but it's fun you will laugh from the start to the end and you will feel the need to watch it again and again and again and again and you will laugh every time you see it br br 10 out of 10 the funniest 12 minutes ever made you will believe it lasted a minute
<START> this film is <UNK> along with <UNK> le <UNK> lo and both films leave a lot to be desired in the way of their dvd <UNK> first both films are very dark occasionally making it hard to see exactly what's happening second neither film has subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed film though <UNK> del does seem to have a better dub personally i always prefer subtitles but for the non <UNK> out there this isn't a problem these dvd problems however are not the fault of the original film makers just the indifferent package being <UNK> four decades later br br as for the film it's about the assassination of president garfield this is a major problem as van johnson looks about as much like garfield as judy garland in no way whatsoever does he look like garfield he's missing the beard has the wrong hair color and style and is just not even close in any way trust me on this i am an american history teacher and we are paid to know these sort of things the real life garfield was a civil war general and looked like the guys on the smith brothers <UNK> drop boxes plus using some other actor to provide the voice for johnson in the dubbing is just surreal never before or since has van johnson sounded quite so macho he was a fine actor but certainly not a convincing general or macho president br br in addition to the stupid casting president <UNK> death was in no way like this film it's obvious that the film makers are actually <UNK> in on the crazy <UNK> about <UNK> concerning the death of <UNK> not garfield garfield was shot in washington <UNK> not dallas by a lone <UNK> with severe mental problems not a group of men with <UNK> however according to most experts what actually killed garfield over two months later were incompetent doctors who and and to retrieve a bullet to no <UNK> and never bothered cleaning their hands or <UNK> in the process in other words like george washington who was basically killed by repeated <UNK> when suffering with <UNK> he died due to <UNK> in the movie they got nothing right whatsoever other than indeed president garfield was shot br br because the film bears almost no similarity to real history it's like a history lesson as taught from someone from another planet or someone with a severe brain injury why not also include ninjas fighting robots and the greek gods while you're at it aside from some decent acting and production values because the script is utter cow crap i don't recommend anyone watch it it's just a complete and utter mess
<START> gary <UNK> best performance in a nicely flowing biography since had a musical background he was able to do his own songs and it really works it's always good to see that fine actor don <UNK> one of the <UNK> and charlie martin smith as well br br an 8 out of 10 best performance gary busey thankfully mr busey was oscar nominated for this losing to jon voight in coming home a fairly low budget flick that doesn't disappoint with great songs by mr holly i hope this made plenty of <UNK> busey was never this popular again for varying reasons but thankfully he has this one great one on his resume
<START> you might think that a show about regular teens with <UNK> would be interesting but it's far from that take the concept for example the main character s have a big secret that they hide from they're peers it's just like hannah montana and that's so <UNK> next the acting is just average <UNK> <UNK> seems to be half asleep through many scenes lastly the jokes are either cliché or boring if they're not using they're colorful yet strange dialog to make us laugh they are throwing various props around the room i really wish this show would use more original and entertaining material in conclusion of <UNK> place is a disappointment
<START> it is one of the <UNK> of shakespeare that there can be no definitive performances no single performance can be but some can be wrong and this one is there are at least two things about hamlet which cannot be <UNK> with 1 his <UNK> and inability to take any kind of action for god's sake that is what makes the play last as long as it does if you had othello there instead of hamlet <UNK> would be dead by the end of act one any production has to try to explain why hamlet <UNK> why he is incapable of action 2 his sexual disgust his total <UNK> at the thought of what his mother and uncle get up to in bed fill him with an utter disgust for all things sexual and this means that any kind of relationship with <UNK> is impossible at the slightest hint of sex hamlet throws up so what does mel gibson give us <UNK> action man you could not get further from the character of hamlet if you tried there are lots of ways hamlet can be played but this isn't one of them what i don't understand is since they managed to get such good actors for the other parts <UNK> <UNK> and so on why couldn't they find one to play hamlet as well mark <UNK> in the part would have made this a great film this whoever he is completely let down the rest of the cast and lets face it hamlet without the prince really doesn't work
<START> the many comments made by others have been very informative and i join in their calls for the release of and <UNK> the 1959 film br br in my early teens i joined a record club and this album was one of the free ones i chose for joining i knew some of the voices were dubbed but only robert was acknowledged on the album recently my daughter purchased a cd from <UNK> i think the quality is excellent so i am confused about why it is available in europe by cbs records inc when i have had no luck in local stores br br actually i never saw the movie but for years have <UNK> with local video stores to get it now i know why it has never been available br br i add my voice to others who <UNK> with the <UNK> of the property and rights and that they agree to release it however <UNK> they perceive it to be the beauty of the music and story reached so many of us who would never have had the experience otherwise br br <UNK>
<START> ill conceived sequel the absurd idea of having the killer snowman on the rampage at an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather brings back the spirit of the psychopath returning thanks to a scientific experiment providing foreign elements which life to his <UNK> it's the best i could do to explain this preposterous concept br br i could go into depth about how he winds up at the island in order to <UNK> numerous tourists but i simply find no reason to bother because it'd all be so <UNK> anyway the filmmakers think it wise to kill off the pretty girls not ten minutes after their arrival i mean seriously why worry with even introducing them to us if we can't enjoy our eye candy no longer that this br br the snow <UNK> murder scene takes the cake ice <UNK> from the <UNK> sand so that a victim can fall on them oh and another girl is stabbed with a pair of <UNK> <UNK> br br look i get what's coming to me when i sit down to watch a killer snowman movie such a ridiculous supernatural slasher will either <UNK> your oh it's such a wonderfully cheesy horror movie or have you <UNK> why the hell you're wasting time with such nonsense jack frost has the power to freeze water then how were they able to melt him in the first film and causes the island resort to snow one sequence has jack <UNK> pool water <UNK> a swimming model under the sheet result being her drowning with nowhere to escape oh there's also a recreation of the tongue stuck to the icy pole bit from the christmas story dude br br i gotta hand it to the cast though they're real troopers for trying to make this wretched material entertaining christopher <UNK> perhaps <UNK> returns as sam to face his old nemesis as does <UNK> <UNK> as his wife the attempts at tongue in cheek humor for me at least fell flat but the cast soldiers <UNK> trying to make the most of a very difficult situation with spirited performances they do their best to rise above the pitiful premise and <UNK> dialogue br br a development occurs which <UNK> the danger towards those still around to face off with jack his <UNK> altered water <UNK> thanks to the introduced foreign elements allow him to <UNK> anti freeze and even worse he now can <UNK> through <UNK> jack <UNK> up what appear to be <UNK> which <UNK> to reveal little <UNK> with black eyes mouth and sharp teeth the killer snowman costume and little <UNK> puppets introduced later in the film might produce belly laughs if you are in the mood for such <UNK> but i personally found this junk rather hokey that's the purpose behind it i suppose cheap <UNK> from those willing to embrace this and unbearable the <UNK> <UNK> is an obvious homage to <UNK> where we get a bar scene where the little <UNK> are celebrating in number over <UNK> victims at the resort the weapon against them <UNK> it's explained that when jack went to kill sam in the first film both fell in a truck bed full of anti freeze an <UNK> <UNK> from jack's belly was <UNK> <UNK> chest when he pushed them out a window into the truck bed and i guess in their being being linked by the <UNK> jack inherited <UNK> banana <UNK> or so this is what we are led to believe and in doing so both <UNK> in a sense br br <UNK> such a film as this defies simple explanation it's a film with effects and plot so terrible one might find the presentation enjoyable because of it's many <UNK>
<START> remember greg the bunny it was this show that started on the independent film channel but got turned into a full blown sitcom on fox my cousin and i thought it was pretty funny beyond the <UNK> idea of puppets taking on tv pg material puppets who kill occurs in a similar universe where puppets live in the same world as people and like us take on jobs and lives of their own let's just say if you couldn't handle that then don't bother watching as this show is a profile of 4 puppets who fell out of <UNK> good <UNK> through drug abuse <UNK> and violent <UNK> only to end up in a half way house there's plenty of violence sex and bad language so it would never make its way to u s network tv as if <UNK> puppets weren't enough the fact that this takes place in canada makes it even more disturbing btw the government pays for this and i think any american television viewer would demand more demented cable tv fodder like this i don't know where you can get it in the u s beyond extra satellite tv but i'd advise you give it a try really funny stuff it <UNK> on the comedy network in canada
<START> this is one of the worst anime series i have ever seen when i watched the manga review in a magazine i thought it was maybe interesting but when i got the chapters i realized it was a complete stupidity br br ok the first 2 or 3 chapters are ok and the series have an standard but as the plot advances it becomes totally incoherent the series tries to show some mystical based upon the christian <UNK> but it's a total stupidity it features some demons and <UNK> scenes totally nonsense it seems the series tries to seem deeply thought complex or reviewed but a watcher with a bit of brain and cultural references will realize soon all those elements used don't have a real sense they are put there only to impress the ignorant <UNK> br br the final chapters are full of totally nonsense elements battles with cat <UNK> demons references to a supposed fight between demons and demons who controls time with no apparent reason the final is totally nonsense an ignorant watcher will see on it a floating final that gives them a place to <UNK> but the truth is this the final and the complete series is a total incoherent and <UNK> nonsense
<START> down <UNK> has been in our library since it first arrived in vhs since then we have acquired the dvd and a digital from cinema now br br it is a quirky flick that does not go <UNK> overboard as either pro or con it is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters i am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered br br the movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession even among the very young i became aware of this while visiting the <UNK> drum in mobile <UNK> in 2002 a group of <UNK> <UNK> my <UNK> among them had all taken up the roles from the movie and planned to <UNK> it during their <UNK> on board br br it is a fun romp that makes you proud both of our navy and hollywood which is rare company br br thanks to <UNK> <UNK> lauren holly and rob schneider for making what could have been an otherwise <UNK> movie such great entertainment
<START> this is one of the great ones it works so beautifully that you hardly notice the <UNK> of then <UNK> year old dana andrews as the <UNK> <UNK> jerk who goes to war and comes back four years later when he would have been at most 25 but then who else should have played him
<START> this is the single greatest movie i have ever seen mr is simultaneously br br 1 tortured about his talents e g i can control it i can i shouldn't have to it it good br br 2 desperate to make friends e g br br <UNK> the soup br br the soup is very good br br would you like some <UNK> with your soup br br i'd like some more <UNK> please br br <UNK> that br br yes the soup is very good br br 3 proud of his <UNK> e g pretty neat trick huh br br 4 a ladies man e g you're so pretty why don't you like me and br br 5 sometimes very very angry e g you can't get away br br <UNK> should have received an academy award for best actor for this movie i mean who was possibly better <UNK> roberts <UNK> to the <UNK> following her performance in <UNK> it's a wonder not all of the stars of this masterpiece did not go on to have brilliant careers i highly highly recommend this film it's available on amazon com everyone should own it make a night of it and have a bowl of soup while you watch
<START> anyone who complains about peter jackson making movies too long should sit through this cbs event there's about 45 minutes of story padded by 2 hours of unnecessary subplots featuring bland by the book tv drama clichés bad science is a <UNK> for crappy weather disaster movies so i'm not going to complain about that silly science can be fun to watch if it's executed in an amusing fashion what kills this movie is it's 10 subplots all of which could be <UNK> without destroying what is supposed to be the central plot the one character that is entertaining to watch in category 6 is <UNK> tommy despite being a very annoying stereotype br br note that i also didn't bother commenting on special effects their quality should come as no surprise br br not recommended
<START> this could have been so much better than it turned out tom <UNK> gives a good performance and some of the older actors do well with what they have to work with but it just doesn't work br br first the actors are much too old to play high school students especially howard vince he looks about thirty second it's hard to sympathize with poor <UNK> especially since betty is not all that hot to start with br br spoilers the ending is so strange it looks like the director intended for character to get shot but there are no <UNK> he's just knocked to the <UNK> where he lays there until the <UNK> drivers pick him up and place him on a <UNK> face down what were his <UNK> a skinned <UNK> goofy vince has just shot his girlfriend dead without any <UNK> whatsoever yet he simply <UNK> <UNK> to the ground and rushes off despite the fact that he makes no secret of the fact that he hates the kid and to make matters even <UNK> <UNK> begs the police to tell his father he's sorry duh hey <UNK> you just got knocked around i think you will have plenty of opportunities to tell your father you're sorry in person and this writer didn't get an oscar nomination skip it unless you get to watch it on <UNK>
<START> while the prominent and over use of the play like format is in total operation throughout the film it is not however this that lets this picture down rather it is the unconvincing female performances and rather tedious script that the film so obviously relied on a little too much with an idea that had potential the simple plot is <UNK> still by <UNK> failure to truly express the <UNK> her character so <UNK> claims to experience the use of improvised scenes by all the actors would not be such a bad idea if only the two leading ladies could take advantage of this <UNK> as downey jr proves as usual what a gifted actor he is he shadows the two actresses in their scenes together which is constantly noticeable the pointless yet intense sex scene seems merely to exist in order to prevent the film from being too <UNK> <UNK> giving the actors a much deserved break from talking with an unsatisfying conclusion two girls and a guy has very little to recommend it other than downey <UNK> <UNK> if not out of place performance
<START> this movie should have been called the eyes of alexander and they should have done away with the bogart concept altogether the film started out with a lighthearted approach to <UNK> legacy and some comical moments with his surgery oriented face but after the first 15 30 minutes it <UNK> into a more serious thriller where two palm size <UNK> laid as eyes into a <UNK> of alexander the great for him and seen by him right before his death so the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size but also because of the tie to the greatest <UNK> the world has ever known being an expert on alexander qualifies me to say that this is wholly and completely a fiction but it makes for a good movie anyway so the film winds around some early silliness and stumbles along with all sorts of alexander <UNK> in both the <UNK> and background which i really liked ending with a dated shark attack you couldn't go to a movie in <UNK> <UNK> without some shark showing up to menace the audience there is a <UNK> named <UNK> father's young wife a man named alexander philip it's been about 5 years since i've seen the film so can't remember all the details some street names and many others it was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the background details that the director obviously an himself put in when all is said and done the eyes are <UNK> and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by kind of a neat ending what would have been more fun would be if they went the indiana jones way and had an action adventure there were many many real <UNK> that could have been used to make this more interesting or instance the hand by <UNK> version of the <UNK> that alexander kept with him all his life even on his many <UNK> across asia would be of <UNK> value if found today olivia <UNK> my all time favorite b movie actress is killed off way too early and should have been the main actress throughout not the girl from the <UNK> and the though she was herself easy on the eyes if you can find this flick it might be worth checking out for the historical stuff and to see olivia <UNK> in an extremely funny deadpan humor bit early on but beyond that i'd pass on it for something more entertaining br br yours nick
<START> i somehow managed to make it all the way through this movie but was <UNK> by the complete lack of entertainment delivered my friends and i are fans of hk film but wow this movie has it all and by all i mean everything a movie shouldn't have underdeveloped and stereotyped characters way over the top overacting cheesy special effects talking robots no less than 20 double foot impossible situations unfunny gags and jokes <UNK> school premise mindless killings and too long running time for the material throw in the fact that gen x cops was a decent film and this movie becomes even harder to bear quite simply if you're entertaining the idea of watching this film don't
<START> i am sorry but this is the worst film i have ever seen in my life i cannot believe that after making the first one in the series they were able to get a budget to make another not that the budget could have been much this is the least scary film i have ever watched and laughed all the way through to the end actually i can't believe we watched it to the end but i think it is because we couldn't quite believe it
<START> this is one of <UNK> best books the characters of karen ross peter elliot <UNK> and amy are beautifully developed and their interactions are exciting complex and fast paced throughout this impressive novel br br and about 99 8 percent of that got lost in the film seriously the screenplay and the directing were horrendous and clearly done by people who could not <UNK> what was good about the novel i can't fault the actors because frankly they never had a chance to make this turkey live up to <UNK> original work i know good novels especially those with a science fiction edge are hard to bring to the screen in a way that lives up to the original but this may be the absolute worst <UNK> in quality between novel and screen adaptation ever the book is really really good the movie is just dreadful
<START> as i was flipping through the channel i came to a channel it is an urban channel i saw this movie on and decided to give it a try i almost became a mass murderer due to this film i have done home movies and they are oscar quality compared to this huge mass of <UNK> the lighting was terrible and the acting was absolutely bad i would rather watch star crystal holy cow maybe that is not a good example the main question i have about this film is was it to be a morality film the reason why i ask is because <UNK> was one line where this lady in a wheelchair says i would have been another gang <UNK> oh my head is starting to hurt after hearing that line i went into the kitchen and pulled out a knife ready to stab anyone who <UNK> watch this movie but some sense kicked in and i just changed the channel to watch the man with the <UNK> paint well that is all i have to say about this movie if you want to endure this pain go ahead but not recommended for those with short <UNK> or a bad case of
<START> awful is really all one needs to know first think of all the things that could be bad about a movie and then try to make a movie that is bad in all of these ways you will have made the state of <UNK> should feel insulted it's much too nice a place to serve as the backdrop for such trite mindless boring schlock i'm a romantic and i always want movies about two people finding each other to succeed and i tried hard to find the good in this one it was tough very tough i couldn't find a <UNK> of emotional connection among any of the characters in this exercise in <UNK> <UNK> except maybe in one or two of the bad guys br br <UNK> is a good this movie is not
<START> according to <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> cat holding a red rose is denying the crap well those criminals guilty of making this series probably wanted to show how to make a total opposite of the <UNK> cat holding a red rose because <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> from the place where the sun doesn't shine and their <UNK> <UNK> the whole <UNK> series mtv has received a lot of bad <UNK> from it's half nude stripper <UNK> while this is gathering positive reviews in imdb well <UNK> to everybody your butt is cool too if you go out showing it in the middle of the winter something these two probably would do still there is no need to make a film about your butt and yes these two probably would do that too
<START> this movie was bad on so many levels the writing was horrible so even the best actors could not have made this movie watchable it's a shame because they did have some good actors in this movie i mean if anyone has seen any of the police academy movies you would know that steve <UNK> was good his character in this movie was very serious which was a big difference from characters i have seen him play before so that was a plus and i did think that steve <UNK> was extremely hot in this movie with or without the shirt you can not deny that he has a great body sexy face too loved the 5 <UNK> shadow look it made him look dangerous at one part in the movie he is lying in bed without his shirt and i have to say i would have gladly jumped in there and tried to take his mind off of his problems so honestly i would watch this movie again just to <UNK>
<START> the pace of this movie is quite slow it takes about 70 minutes to get katie to china which we know that she will and leaves 30 minutes to wrap things up the storyline is so predictable that you know everything after about 5 minutes nothing surprises you i guess that the movie is a coming of age movie but the movie is full of stereotypes that are quite over the top br br katie a beauty that realizes that looks boys and shopping isn't everything she realizes that she can feel and see the real world touching br br the mother high strung nervous screaming mother wow very innovative that need taking care of by a strong man br br the father patient and always understanding and takes care of the incapable woman br br the boyfriend that only wants to get into her pants br br the comedian clown chinese guy that doesn't know how to speak english properly and made a laughing stock thought hollywood dropped those characters in the mid fifties br br the nurse that at times knows everything how to get around in china that in the next moment is a <UNK> copy of the mother i e a woman who cant handle the situation or knows anything br br the <UNK> chinese girl that with the help of us westerns get help and become a beautiful girl because in china a third world country according to the film don't have anything and hence needs our charity <UNK> wake up and smell what you are <UNK> br br sure that there are some poverty in china but the portrayal of the aid from western countries read usa is so shallow and happy ending ish that it is sad and revolting shanghai where the movie is set is the most <UNK> and <UNK> city in the world at the moment br br the chinese father that is so nice and <UNK> that in the end has one wish to be a cowboy with a white hat br br the teacher sean <UNK> that has this really heart ripping story not that he tells without feel why sean why br br etc etc it is difficult to actually finding a real person in the entire movie br br this is nothing but a feel good movie for americans below age 15 if you want to learn anything about the world watch e g hotel <UNK> instead for a better life story or coming of age movie i suggest you watch the italian cinema <UNK> that won the best foreign film academy reward some years back br br the only nice thing in the movie were the small town <UNK> that truly capture some not all of the beautiful chinese country side i have been there and seen some of it
<START> i must say that this has to be the best documentary i have ever seen in my life i first say the movie at my friends house and didn't get a chance to finish watching it from that point on i spent my free time trying to find the movie i never found it but on my birthday my friend who knew i had the hardest time finding the movie got it for me as present sean penn does a great job of <UNK> the documentary i loved how it told the story of each of the z boys and the history of <UNK> i have been to <UNK> and the surrounding area many times and had never known what had taken place until i saw the documentary i didn't get a chance to see the actual movie and i heard it was nowhere near what the documentary was i don't know if i actually want to see the movie but who knows
<START> wonderfully funny awe inspiring feature on the <UNK> of dj shadow and q bert are amazing in this terrific documentary check out just about every major dj <UNK> their getting in to scratch thanks to <UNK> <UNK> post <UNK> classic and <UNK> footage of some of the most complex and mind blowing <UNK> routines of all time
<START> 's reputation <UNK> it i first heard of it in one of those <UNK> style movie books the 50 worst movies ever or the golden turkey awards or something like that every review of the film basically said that this movie was so bad that it would make you bleed from the eyes to watch it so when the exposed film society finally got around to showing it i was <UNK> the kind of <UNK> experience that only a true cinematic stinker can provide br br however robot wasn't really all that bad br br oh this is definitely a z film through and through some of the voice dubbing as is usually the case for k gordon murray <UNK> is awfully cheesy and the movie itself seems to be <UNK> something of a frankenstein since a huge <UNK> of it seems to be footage from a previous aztec mummy movie narrated with a voice over by the leading man a dead <UNK> anytime the question then what happened is asked more than twice in the dialog you are looking at <UNK> footage put together with little regard for plot <UNK> or momentum in then what happened or what happened then is <UNK> at least four times in the 1st hour br br even without the <UNK> problems the plot and dialog don't translate well to an older american audience for instance as the hero explains and explains and explains the back story he includes a remark about doctor a doctor who suddenly turned into an evil master criminal and began his quest for the treasure that the aztec mummy guards no background no explanation he just suddenly turned evil obviously this was aimed at a pretty <UNK> audience br br the <UNK> though is the robot the supposed showcase of this movie this robot is the worst robot special effect since <UNK> kingdom or even santa claus vs the martians compared to this hunk of junk the tin man from the wizard of oz looked like the terminator that chased linda connor through the in <UNK> the aztec mummy himself is well designed and executed he's <UNK> undead familiar enough to look like a mummy and yet distinct from the boris karloff <UNK> collection familiar to most american audiences but whoever designed the robot in this <UNK> had no feel for the concept or no budget they could at least have given him some knees for <UNK> sake br br in addition the titular battle is terribly executed and lasts less than 60 seconds i've seen <UNK> matches on junior high <UNK> that are more convincing then the movie basically just stops that seems a bit of a rip off considering the amount of time the movie spends building up to the battle itself br br in spite of all these problems the movie isn't horrible or incompetent the way a coleman francis film or a larry <UNK> film was compared to monster a go go or attack of the eye creatures is like a coppola film it's just kind of dull and boring and silly the actors are competent in a mannered b movie way and reasonably <UNK> dr in particular seems to be having a wonderful time as he <UNK> and plots and <UNK> about in his cape and phantom of the opera suit i often found myself rooting for him in spite of his being the villain br br anyway i've seen much much worse file this with <UNK> vs the vampire women under interesting mexican juvenile <UNK>
<START> well i fear that my review of this special won't <UNK> much different observation than the others before me but i literally just watched it during a <UNK> <UNK> drive and frankly i'm too excited not to say anything to really appreciate the <UNK> that is barbra streisand you have to look back before the movies before the broadway phenomenon of the mid 60's when television was still a young medium there was a form of entertainment very prominent on the air that is but a memory today musical variety some musical shows were weekly series but others were single one time <UNK> usually <UNK> the special talent of the individual performer this is where we get the raw <UNK> first looks at streisand she had already been a guest performer on other variety shows including <UNK> moore ed sullivan and scored a major coup in a one time only <UNK> appearance with the woman who would pass her the <UNK> of <UNK> extraordinary judy garland in 1966 color me barbra introduced barbra streisand in color hence the title but copied the format of her first special a year earlier almost to the letter in 3 distinct acts we get an abstract streisand in an after hours art museum looking at and sometimes becoming the works of art a comic streisand working an already <UNK> audience in a studio circus populated with many fuzzy and <UNK> animals and best of all a singing streisand in mini concert format just well frankly just doing it br br it <UNK> me that she still had the film debut of funny girl yet to come as well as turns as <UNK> director and political <UNK> here she is barely 24 years old doing extraordinary things because as she puts it in her own on camera introduction <UNK> didn't know we couldn't so we did ' the art museum sequence is shot in philadelphia over one weekend immediately after the museum closed to the public on saturday evening and apparently done with only one color camera yet there are cuts <UNK> and tracking shots <UNK> resulting in one rather spectacular peak moment the modern slightly <UNK> <UNK> gotta move after getting lost amongst the modern jazz club <UNK> begin with streisand <UNK> in a psychedelic <UNK> and <UNK> eye makeup doing the catchy <UNK> tune with almost <UNK> sex appeal it is not until act 3 believe it or not that the moment is matched or <UNK> by another feat in the concert sequence in a white <UNK> and pearl <UNK> streisand <UNK> the <UNK> any place i hang my hat is home <UNK> into the final notes and revealing one of those climactic <UNK> that makes you scream like a little girl even if you're <UNK> years old and a guy just plain old great television check it out
<START> first don't be fooled by my family name my mother was full blooded italian so i really know italian families and i love mobster movies even the funny ones like this br br for those people who have bad <UNK> this film you know who you are you should have your movie <UNK> taken from you because you don't know what good is this is a damn funny and well <UNK> film the fact that almost nobody is italian in it is part of the joke so far as i can see and what red blooded straight male could complain about spending an hour and something with the likes of michelle <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when i saw this film it won me over with the opening song by <UNK> clooney who was as irish as one can get but her <UNK> of the italian words in <UNK> is flawless and sets the tone of what is to follow perfectly hell i even bought the record the next day because of it just the look of every <UNK> thing in the apartment that i have personally seen in my relatives houses though not in the same place which i found hysterical sold it for me br br this movie is like <UNK> on laughing gas i just wonder why there are no <UNK> worlds and what happened to the food these guys were supposed to get my guess is the crew ate it the <UNK> are <UNK> the shakes are <UNK> my mouth is <UNK> almost as much as it is thinking of the gorgeous ms <UNK> and i never trusted <UNK> anyway and the three best things about this film are <UNK> <UNK> funny mob wife <UNK> dean <UNK> as her <UNK> husband tony the tiger and last but definitely not least the great <UNK> by oliver <UNK> who should get more comic roles and note to myself find out where that black chick went <UNK> why does she work so <UNK> this picture is right alongside the great mob movies as it should be
<START> outstanding performance by <UNK> she carries this movie alone rip torn is great but just a shadow to a bitter sweet story of a woman who loves a very stubborn man beautiful funny sad touching a must see film
<START> this is actually a very good surreal mystery movie despite the description that tries to sell it as a sci fi movie <UNK> stars as a woman haunted by mysterious visions and lost memories that she is trying to piece together she spends the majority of the movie trying to make sense of her visions very atmospheric and effective it is true that kinski does not appear very much in this film but the staring actors are very good there is only an english dubbed version available in the us and the dubbing leaves something to be desired but the actors do a very good job the cinematography by academy award winner <UNK> <UNK> is excellent an earlier giallo by director the fifth <UNK> is also excellent and also <UNK> by
<START> i went to see this film out of curiosity and to settle an argument the film is now best known from the <UNK> of music <UNK> <UNK> from his incidental music to the film the movement even turning up in pop <UNK> the general outline of the plot is well known from the <UNK> notes on various <UNK> a clerk accidentally <UNK> a non existent lieutenant in a list to be presented to the the is interested in this person and rather than tell him he doesn't exist the <UNK> and officers maintain the <UNK> that he is real is <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> promoted married promoted again dies is given a state funeral revealed as an <UNK> and <UNK> to the ranks br br i had heard <UNK> stories about how the clerk invented involving <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> but i'd heard the film was lost so there was no way to find out what happens then the film turned up at the in london as part of their festival for the record it turned out that all that happens is that the clerk <UNK> two words whilst writing an order and turns into as the is in a hurry to see the order there's no time to correct the mistake br br having gone expecting an historical curiosity i was pleasantly surprised the film is very funny and the audience myself included laughed continuously although most of it is filmed straight set mostly in the palace there are a few trick shots where multiple images appear on the screen for instance the army is represented by a small group repeated across the screen four identical guards perform perfect <UNK> in perfect <UNK> two identical servants <UNK> the floor br br one slight <UNK> was it was very difficult to work out who everyone was there were two women who might have been the daughters or a daughter and a servant or something else and very few people were named but all in all an enjoyable film and i'm surprised it's not seen more often
<START> i like many others saw this as a child and i loved it and it horrified me up until <UNK> i have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on tv someday since it originally played on usa networks does anyone know where to buy this movie or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on tv again maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again i don't think they did a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows about people only know of the <UNK> wives and <UNK> husband movies no one is familiar with the fact that there was a children version maybe they should also do a re make of it since they seem to be doing that a lot lately with a lot of my favorite old thriller horror flicks well if anyone has any <UNK> please i beg of you write me with information thanks <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> i was surprised and impressed to find out this movie was released in 1940 before the united states entered world war ii on the surface <UNK> something as <UNK> and horrible as nazi germany could be <UNK> as <UNK> but <UNK> brilliance isn't limited to making a joke out of everything in fact the seriousness of his message wouldn't have been nearly as valid if not for the excellent use of humor in this movie along with the moments of stark drama <UNK> in drama alone wouldn't have had the bite and <UNK> that this film did laughing at someone can be the best way to attack them while laughing with someone the jewish <UNK> can be the best way to love them in the jewish final speech i forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago they are words that have meaning now and in any time of war for this reason i believe the film did far greater good than harm as it still has the same profound effect today
<START> <UNK> little <UNK> really <UNK> itself from other zombie movies first off all of the zombies in the movie don't exactly starting biting at you and <UNK> your flesh apart with their bare hands they kill you with either a or <UNK> and eat you after <UNK> second they can't die in most zombie movies you can shoot a zombie in the head and kill them but these simply won't die third which is the biggest reason why this movie <UNK> itself all of the zombies are children how did they die exactly to become zombies they were working in a coal mine when suddenly they were all killed in a collapse now they wander the forest carrying their <UNK> and <UNK> waiting for someone to come by so they can kill them and eat them oh they also come out at night yep only at night that makes the movie even more fun then it would be if they came out in the morning despite all of the violent and gory mayhem in this movie <UNK> little <UNK> is a great choice if you're looking for a movie about zombie children don't expect anything great like <UNK> of the <UNK> or <UNK> of the <UNK> but do expect lots of gore and violence that makes this movie a real zombie fan <UNK> everyone give <UNK> taylor <UNK> from rob <UNK> <UNK> a big hand for delivering a great performance like the one she did in <UNK> she really needs to start starring in more horror movies
<START> what exactly do people expect when they watch an al <UNK> film are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories you'd think so by some of the reviews al <UNK> films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy not much more so if you go into them knowing that already it helps and they aren't necessarily to be taken at face value especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value first off this starts by ripping off the end theme music from outer limits so you know things are looking promising this is the story of some <UNK> cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital of course nurse <UNK> tends to his needs and all and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so his spirit <UNK> her and nurse <UNK> begins to change no longer the nice nurse she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects there's a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a <UNK> football star that has become the love object of one of co workers who also just happens to <UNK> in voodoo this is not bad if you're a cult film fan but it may be bad if you're a <UNK> fan because you won't like it at times this actually <UNK> towards <UNK> for <UNK> anyway but then it itself with some ridiculous event if you enjoy <UNK> films and similar trash you may well like this for anyone else who may be looking for a lost treasure keep digging 7 out of 10
<START> my god i have not seen such an awful movie in a long long time saw it last night and wanted to leave after 20 minutes <UNK> knightley tries really really hard in this one but she cant handle it dropped her accent every once in a while and didn't have the charisma to fill the role <UNK> <UNK> acting gets you to a point where you start to ask yourself has she ever had acting lessons judging by the edge of love <UNK> never been to acting class but should consider to go in the near future they both look really pretty maybe thats what they should focus on in their future career if they can be actresses everybody can
<START> although perhaps not as entertaining as some of <UNK> work little <UNK> is another fine film by one of the world's greatest film artists <UNK> from <UNK> usual themes little <UNK> is a fascinating and uplifting character study about a brave man and his efforts to go on living after a life traumatic experience br br <UNK> wanted to fly from a very young age and the <UNK> <UNK> war gave him that opportunity but instead of spending the war <UNK> in a <UNK> he spent most of it grounded as a <UNK> <UNK> tells most of his story <UNK> and <UNK> with occasional help from <UNK> <UNK> does very little voice over this time but contributes a lot of subtly powerful and visuals which should be no surprise to those familiar with him br br is a fascinating and extremely likable person as human and as alive as they come i found the story of his life and his upbeat personality to be inspiring thanks to <UNK> for re introducing him to us br br the scale of the film is not as <UNK> and the drama is not as fierce as many of the early films that made <UNK> a force to be <UNK> with nevertheless i strongly recommend this to his fans and to those who enjoy documentaries it's a very interesting and well executed film
<START> the <UNK> blond has a great script but i just wish errol flynn was in it instead of james cagney he's not the person for the part i do think olivia did a great job this movie is also a day dream wrap around so it's hard to follow i don't like the male character attitude the way cagney presented it was just off i give it a 3 for poor acting by main male character if you like tough <UNK> men that like to fight all the time and argue then this is your movie the <UNK> blond would have been better if the main character had more of a attitude and change the script so he is happy he's with <UNK> br br this movie points out money does not bring happiness women right jokes plain and simple not the best movie but every one must decide for themselves
<START> well the film starts good but after half an hour it becomes boring and stupid when all the plot is about <UNK> that was the name of the girl right <UNK> br br the end of the movie it's really corny and the characters really dumb br br i don't know who is more stupid if the girl because she came back with her old boyfriend or the boy for the way he was used for her br br anyway my conclusion is this definitely not the best eighties comedy just another movie like many others with nothing special they could do it better but they ruined it if only the plot had take another way but they keep that <UNK> stuff and they definitely ruined so final conclusion i don't like
<START> the young john garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 they made me a criminal celebrating a ring victory in a <UNK> locker room boxer <UNK> <UNK> about his love of mom <UNK> of booze and clean living style to fans including cops who eat it up later in the evening he's <UNK> and with his bimbo gal while his manager in on the con shares the evening and the <UNK> br br a problem develops when another couple arrives the guy is a newspaper reporter and he says he'll expose phony life on the front page the manager kills the reporter and he and the <UNK> <UNK> the murder discovered cops later are on the <UNK> for the now <UNK> boxer whose car is driven by the manager with his new girlfriend <UNK> now instant ex a police chase ends with a fiery car crash manager and girl are dead and <UNK> br br johnny discovers that he's supposed to be a killer but he's also presumed dead seeking advice from a lawyer he <UNK> the <UNK> with the key to a bank <UNK> box holding his sole <UNK> 10 000 the lawyer later gives johnny 250 and tells him that the balance is his <UNK> for giving him professional advice get out of town fast and go far away i would never charge a client more than 5 000 for such <UNK> <UNK> and wise direction br br johnny now a <UNK> train <UNK> <UNK> winds up conveniently passing out at an arizona date ranch where he's <UNK> back to health by beautiful goldie west ann sheridan a fine actress whose career was in the <UNK> taking jack as his <UNK> the <UNK> loses some of his rough edges as he falls in love with goldie he becomes a mentor and pal to the dead end kids familiar screen characters to pre war <UNK> br br a chance to make money <UNK> when an <UNK> boxer shows up challenging any <UNK> to last several rounds in the ring with him it's a natural temptation for but there's a fly in the <UNK> who should show up but new york detective monty <UNK> the laughing stock of the department he's been on <UNK> duty for ages because of a slight mistake early in his career that sent an innocent man to old <UNK> we all make mistakes don't we <UNK> recognized from a news photo and he's there to watch the fight and make the <UNK> claude <UNK> is the cop who's endured and <UNK> from his fellow officers for years br br what follows is predictable but it's well acted i hope this was a main feature when it was released it's too good to rank as a b second on a <UNK> br br busby berkeley best known as an outstanding choreographer directed they made me a criminal and max <UNK> one of hollywood's all time prolific score <UNK> wrote nice but not extraordinary music for the film br br now available on dvd from <UNK> video the movie set me back a mere 4 99 and gave me real pleasure i'll view it again br br 8 10
<START> wow this was a great movie i just got it from the u s and it was worth all the money i gave for it this movie is one of the best movies for children i have ever seen maybe the best all you who like <UNK> must see this 1 the first 7 minutes you can not believe what you see it's so great br br <UNK>
<START> would have won an <UNK> for the worst film in 2004 may be overall too if it were global when it comes acting badly aka showing attitude <UNK> over not acting <UNK> <UNK> is no match for while the <UNK> had supposedly hot actress in <UNK> costume and some action sequences had nothing at all br br one of those movies which makes me wonder why imdb does allow one to rate a movie as 0 10 yet again i think that movie does not even deserve a 0 it has to be something negative or minus <UNK> br br ok what about the plot outline it is a giving arrogant full of attitude choreographer meet an useless skill less <UNK> who <UNK> to be an actor tale the story is so short that if just another sentence imdb might <UNK> me for writing a spoiler about the story telling its like a bunch sorry 2 people for the most part of people moving in super slow motion don't try this movie if you have bought new dvd player you would end up believing that either dvd is in bad shape or dvd player is struck not its fault at all br br at the end of it all you end up giving some credits to the director at least he realized that both and <UNK> <UNK> at least at that time can't speak dialogues convincingly so there are not too many dialogues in this movie so you can at least sleep your way through the movie with some annoying noises from those song sequences br br do watch this movie if you are new to bollywood cinema once you have <UNK> this movie you would be able to see any bollywood movie and enjoy it br br there can't be worse 3 hour torture than this
<START> is a tv movie so it's bound to be pretty dire especially as it's a supposed horror film this young girl is haunted by dreams as she arrives in a small town where there was a murder of a woman one year before she is amazed when everyone in the town thinks she looks exactly like the murdered girl the <UNK> are amazed when she keeps entering dream like where she reveals accurate details about the murder and murderer because the police got it all wrong apparently thinking that they are in danger of being found out the murderers there are two of them start to <UNK> a plan to get rid of her before she gets to the real truth by this time you will have probably fallen asleep and why do the makers of the film have the <UNK> machine on full <UNK> in the dream sequences
<START> i got encouraged to watch this film because i've heard good word of it it was supposed to be this thrilling true crime <UNK> disturbing shocking all that jazz well i am disturbed because i spent money on it and i am shocked that something so god awful actually got released that's about it br br this is a supposed new look at charles <UNK> family of insane loser <UNK> and their murders but if this is a new look then it's probably new as in fresh and totally inept just watching it gave me a headache and i had to give up trying to make any sense of it or even understand just what the director intended it to be br br i suppose i should say something about the plot but fact is it was so stupid and incoherent that i barely remember if there even was a plot at all there was something about a <UNK> tape delivered to a radio dj or a tv producer then an hour of pointless random footage of the family in <UNK> then the polanski murders looking like a bad school play and finally some idiotic part about a bunch of <UNK> getting drunk and beating the hell out of one another in an alley i kid you not and then it ended thank god don't ask me to make any sense of that i'm just <UNK> what i saw the performances were terrible too and how difficult is it to make a convincing <UNK> get a short skinny <UNK> bloke put a dirty wig and a shaggy beard on him there's your <UNK> but this <UNK> doesn't even look right he just looks like uh a bloke in a cheap wig and a glued on santa beard painted black br br or maybe that's what this film is actually about <UNK> family didn't make any sense so this film doesn't make any sense either it's symbolic yeah right i'm still so angry at spending money on this i stopped my normal lurking on this site and <UNK> just to vote 1 for this film and post this warning that will hopefully prevent others from spending their money on this garbage stay away from it it's not even worth renting br br ps the recent us tv production <UNK> <UNK> got bad reviews here but i saw it last month i saw the 1976 original too and let me tell you compared to <UNK> family that new <UNK> <UNK> is brilliant and flawless and i was disappointed in it that's how bad <UNK> family is it makes a flawed and mostly disappointing tv movie look perfect
<START> i think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals i recently found the prey in its original vhs <UNK> <UNK> form and was very excited i just love finding old slasher films on vhs because the cover artwork is fantastic usually though it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic the prey is one of those films br br to be fair it started off ok with the killer stalking the cliché teenagers in the woods the <UNK> sounds used are a great effect that make you tense as you watch this film is basically a big fat cliché and when the <UNK> stories section rolls in the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the running time on the back story of the killer i actually thought this was quite an original idea however the back story ends abruptly and shows us some stock footage of a burning <UNK> the lack of budget really starts to show now after this we are returned to the dumb teenagers being picked off in the woods the killer himself isn't shown until the end which is a shame because he actually makes an effective looking killer sort of like from the burning but better as for gore there isn't too much although there's an ok face <UNK> moment at the end br br overall i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone other than slasher <UNK> it really is a big mess
<START> i think this movie is underrated to me it felt like a <UNK> of fresh air some people complain about the <UNK> of the plot overlong sequences and lack of sex the latter being i believe the main reason for <UNK> and how come there are no drunken teenagers talking dirty but it's just not their thing and good for them if they can't relate to the story the performances are great i'd really like to see more of the actors in other movies the emotions are genuine the whole <UNK> love thing is presented with uncanny subtlety and it does give you the <UNK> feeling you expect to get from a good movie
<START> i first heard of <UNK> when a girlfriend of mine picked it up in a cult classics section of my local video <UNK> she knew i liked obscure artsy movies so i rented it and brought it home it sat on my tv for a couple of days and then i put it in the vcr just before going to bed i thought that maybe i'll see what it's like first then <UNK> more time to it the next day what followed was that it actually woke me up i sat through the entire film and loved it after i went through the closing credits i watched it again only after you see the closing credits do you get an idea of who is who after you know that you can watch it again with <UNK> appreciation don't listen to the people that tear this movie apart it's not for everyone if you're someone that doesn't like reading subtitles than this movie isn't for you not that there are subtitles there's no dialog at all if you're someone that actually owns rush hour 2 then this movie isn't for you br br this movie is truly original and inspiring it does what other movies have never done it looks like nothing else and is <UNK> than just about everything out there from 1989 to the current date you can tell that everyone involved in the making of this movie truly love the art of what they do and understand what can be captured in cinema form br br if you're looking to be entertained then the movie isn't for you however it is pure <UNK> in some extreme way and in film form it's like someone attached <UNK> to my head and taped one of my worst nightmares but this nightmare makes sense if you really sit and watch the images <UNK> the action of the actors and don't sit there <UNK> your guitar <UNK> but watch and not blink br br people compare it to <UNK> but <UNK> is so much more i'm not joking when i say it is my favorite movie it's an important film visually stimulating <UNK> inspiring and hypnotic one review i read about it is very true though no one will get through <UNK> without being marked
<START> the first time i saw this movie was on a flight between china and los angeles it was a real hoot and made the trip pass with much less <UNK> than the normal 10 hour flight i tried to locate a copy of it without success until i discovered a copy for sale on ebay having now watched it twice i recommend it as good entertainment my only real criticisms are that the choice of english translation words for the subtitles is sub par even by normal standards also the <UNK> is little to small <UNK> into the movie too often and frequently travels too fast to read well
<START> i don't know how this movie has received so many positive comments one can call it artistic and beautifully filmed but those things don't make up for the empty plot that was filled with sexual <UNK> i wish i had not wasted my time to watch this movie rather than being <UNK> it was a poor excuse for promoting strange and <UNK> behavior it was just another hollywood attempt to convince us that that kind of life is normal and ok from the very beginning i asked my self what was the point of this movie and i continued watching hoping that it would change and was quite disappointed that it continued in the same vein i am so glad i did not spend the money to see this in a theater
<START> there is nothing original <UNK> or insightful in this film the acting is average images are amateurish the writing lacks subtlety and the scenes are very basic something close to a soap br br in 2 <UNK> a suicide is used to turn the film into a suspense drama we watch partly because we want to know who dies the various characters each have a problem and the film shows how bad each problem is for them but only as a way to get them each to a place where you think they might kill themselves despite the different points of view offered by the camera on the key events there is never another way of seeing the events themselves so in 2 <UNK> the <UNK> are <UNK> the angels are angels this is simple stuff br br without this complexity the film emerges as a <UNK> tale of youth sex and violence you hardly get to know the kids as much as the breasts bodies and <UNK> that the filmmaker passes off as characterisation br br in the end if you know anything about film in the last 5 years 2 <UNK> is just an immature rip off of elephant not a <UNK> not a progression yet while the filmmaker and <UNK> use the alleged suicide of a friend at every chance to give the film some <UNK> they never talk about gus van <UNK> or elephant the positive <UNK> on imdb curiously avoid any mention of this or simply don't value originality if you do want something with heart and voice avoid this piece of youth exploitation i was surprised by the filmmakers age when i found out after seeing this film i had assumed a 13 year old had made it the twenty somethings i've always known are too busy trying to express something real in them to lift the work of an old man
<START> queen of the damned is one of the best vampire movies i had ever seen the movie had suspense action and gore the combination of the fierce demanding attitude of the queen and the rock mood of our star very well acted by stuart <UNK> makes a wonderfully done movie that only this combination can create i'm always the one to give advice to my friends and family members on which movies are worthy of renting and when they ask me if queen of the damned is worthy i tell them it's worthy of buying this movie is most for sure a must have in all horror movie <UNK> homes
<START> i think the <UNK> may run like this pay attention please because i had to look this up in 1967 peter <UNK> an ex auto <UNK> directs the english caper movie robbery the most thrilling part of which is a car chase through the streets of london down <UNK> where there are crowds of children playing and all that it's a success br br a year later <UNK> directs bullet starring steve i mean mcqueen featuring another even more spectacular car chase up and down the san francisco hills with <UNK> authentic engine sounds that seem to include double <UNK> full race <UNK> no <UNK> twelve <UNK> <UNK> under forty foot <UNK> <UNK> and all five thousand <UNK> running at full <UNK> lots of shots of <UNK> <UNK> chewing <UNK> <UNK> with concentration as he tries to <UNK> another car off the highway though a passenger in the other vehicle <UNK> a shotgun the chase is staged by philip bill hopkins drives the criminal vehicle br br a year or two later <UNK> a good thing bill <UNK> directs the french connection featuring a chase between a <UNK> cop car gene hackman and an <UNK> train in new york city lots of shots of <UNK> <UNK> face as he <UNK> the <UNK> car through the streets the chase is staged by philip academy awards follow br br <UNK> a good thing a year or two more brings us the seven ups featuring a chase between a car driven by roy <UNK> with lots of shots of <UNK> <UNK> face as he tries to <UNK> the other car which is driven by bill hopkins off the road although the criminal car to be sure carries a shotgun <UNK> passenger no hills in new york city just <UNK> but they are still sharp enough to elevate the cars a few feet the pursued car <UNK> around a corner and <UNK> down a street on which a dozen children are playing shots of the screaming kids as they <UNK> off the <UNK> and allows the car to zoom through but once is not enough the children immediately run back into the street and must repeat the <UNK> for the pursuing cop car carrying <UNK> br br i once witnessed a pursuit at high speed on the streets of philadelphia both the criminal and the cops drove through the streets at about 25 miles an hour coming to rolling stops at each stop sign and red light very dull stuff compared to this movie br br speaking of this movie it's pretty good robbery and bullet were cool everyone dressed neatly but the new york movies are filthy there's garbage all over the place and the subway cars are covered with <UNK> shoot outs and beat ups take place in <UNK> lots surrounded by <UNK> brick buildings or in <UNK> <UNK> for industrial sized br br the acting is pretty good too roy <UNK> seems <UNK> <UNK> the other actors have faces made for the camera especially richard <UNK> and the story is engaging if not entirely unfamiliar what's best about the film is the way it captures new york city in its almost total indifference to human <UNK> and <UNK> at a funeral the <UNK> drivers stand around with their <UNK> up <UNK> hanging out of their mouths kicking their cold feet together utterly bored at the ritual goings on the film wants us to believe that the seven ups are an elite group of <UNK> cops who stop at nothing to get the job done and here it's a bit of a sell out they always seems to be threatening to do something <UNK> and illegal beat hell out of a suspect or physically damage a <UNK> and helpless hood but they always manage to avoid doing it if they actually did it their characters would become <UNK> and ambiguous and we'd rather have our heroes and villains of a more biblical nature very enjoyable even if you've seen it before and you very well may have in one or another of its previous <UNK>
<START> at least one kind very human and moving not out to teach a lesson or anything like that all principals are effective i saw the movie years ago and still remember it but can't remember the morgan <UNK> role br br and a nice slice of american life
<START> 1 stephen baldwin doesn't care about his involvement in stephen baldwin vehicles br br 2 the acting in any stephen baldwin vehicle <UNK> from horrible to mildly passable br br 3 writers don't write stephen baldwin vehicles children do br br 4 most of the stephen baldwin vehicles <UNK> around one genre the <UNK> action genre it basically consists of crappy action sequences made with little to no effort whatsoever br br 5 the director doesn't care about stephen baldwin vehicles he passes his job to an <UNK> from time to time br br and now you know
<START> ok time for a bit of a rant i think it's been 2 <UNK> years since i <UNK> my original comments <UNK> this top rated comedy and the damn thing still hasn't made it to video or dvd or for that matter even been repeated on the telly br br does anyone out there know why not has there been a bbc style error <UNK> the original copy has been deleted wiped br br listen up you lot in charge of <UNK> <UNK> this on to dvd now do you even realise how funny this programme was it makes mike <UNK> look as bad as the current pants <UNK> team br br rant over for the moment
<START> i'm a big fan of the vacation franchise and i love randy quaid as cousin eddie and at least a couple of the behind the scenes names were involved in this project most notably simmons who produced or executive produced all 4 of the theatrical releases as well as animal house for those reasons i figured this made for tv spin off might be worth checking out even without chevy chase br br for the record i did not expect it to be very good i just thought it might be a slightly amusing <UNK> therefore my high level of disappointment goes to prove just how bad this utter turd of a movie really was it was mind numbingly jaw <UNK> heart <UNK> head terrible yet somehow i could not stop watching it it's a sickness i have i can't seem to walk out on a film or give up on a tv show before it ends nothing has ever made me want two hours of my life back more than this movie
<START> i caught this movie on late night tv honestly i saw most of it and the whole time i was sitting in complete and utter disbelief br br is there any genre that's more pointless than soft core porn if there is i don't want to know about it <UNK> porn combines all the horrors of porn lousy production values <UNK> acting crappy scripts with the of sex scenes in regular movies so the end result is <UNK> nor entertaining this movie also has the rather odd approach of a science fiction setting and it works horribly all the sex is performed in some sort of virtual reality setting where the crew from the future learn about physical love and yes it's about as confused and silly as it sounds br br but there has to be some positive points though right well there is one <UNK> allen is amazingly hot that's about the only thing that was less than awful in this movie i don't know what it is about her but she has an amazing sex appeal the rest of the cast look like the standard porn cast though rather unattractive women with poorly done fake breasts and men that have spent far too much time in the gym <UNK> themselves grotesque probably a gym in germany as well judging by <UNK> and clothing br br to sum things up if you enjoy <UNK> <UNK> presence on screen you can watch this for the brief moments where she shows some of her seductive potential most of the time she tries to <UNK> crappy lines of dialog though if you don't enjoy <UNK> allen then you might as well stay away altogether br br i rate this 10 10 for <UNK> <UNK> sex appeal 1 10 for everything else and 2 10 for entertainment value since this is a unique crappy porn science fiction hybrid that's not really like anything i've ever seen
<START> talk about over acting not just by govinda but also by salman and lara the direction was awful the first half hour you would pretty much want to switch the movie off because this movie is a real stinker mark my words br br i liked govinda in some o his comedy roles like <UNK> <UNK> no 1 se <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and this does not compare to any of them and salman khan should not do comedy roles at all he sucks he does not know how to do comedy the only good comedy role he did was in which was brilliant next to <UNK> khan br br there were so many done <UNK> scenes in this movie that make you want to take out the dvd and burn it so no one else in your house watches it ever again
<START> i <UNK> through the whole film the music is great the story telling is great it's a wonderful film this picture is made with respect and a true love of the sixties
<START> dorothy does the opposite here she keeps growing and growing i didn't <UNK> any subtext though the incredible <UNK> man and other movies of its <UNK> during the period were <UNK> about radiation nuclear war and other horrors growth is the result of an inept computer robot br br and who <UNK> this computer but lou <UNK> i like some of his movies with bud <UNK> but though this is a pretty bad movie he does fine without him and <UNK> green is an excellent foil br br green plays the pompous town big shot he is father he is intent on being elected mayor so when his beloved daughter starts having issues he <UNK> her he doesn't exactly dump her but gives up his battle against her longtime admirer <UNK> br br this is pretty implausible <UNK> is the local garbage collector br br the special effects are minimal and the subplot involving the military is lame in the extreme
<START> i really don't know much about the marquis de <UNK> not having read any of his book but i never imagined him as a <UNK> queen carson of <UNK> eye for the straight guy or jack from will and grace would have fit easily into the role that nick <UNK> gave us br br the movie itself was rather thin and seemed more of a parody or an excuse to show the paris <UNK> several times with men and women having a good time on the <UNK> in the <UNK> what they can't afford a room i did find it cute that the <UNK> <UNK> felt she was doing her patriotic duty taking care of the <UNK> needs br br the movie was just an excuse to show a lot of breasts and i mean a lot fans of <UNK> john rhys davies might be interested in seeing him in a different role as inspector <UNK>
<START> this film has haunted me since i saw it when i was about 8 years old i didn't know what it was called so am so pleased to have <UNK> it down finally i remember being quite scared because i'd just been to a tin mine in <UNK> when i watched it so could imagine it all fortunately i didn't see any ghosts of dead children there but i found this film really quite disturbing and scary when i was much younger i've certainly never forgotten it even though i couldn't find it anywhere i seem to remember the children's film foundation films being generally good but they don't show them at all any more i also remember <UNK> like the children of green in the same era on bbc equally unsettling in its own way
<START> although this movie has a slow dream like almost mesmerizing pace and an interesting though possibly not entirely accurate description of a rural french criminal investigation practices and <UNK> i find it ultimately impossible to recommend i think this movie is simply a setup piece to advance one person's the director's one <UNK> disgust with <UNK> certainly human sexuality in all its forms can have their revolting moments no denying that but to choose the bad uniformly at the expense of the good as this film does at every turn suggests a <UNK> sensibility at work in short if you enjoy watching <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as compassion and the depiction of <UNK> <UNK> and the female form in a hideous and <UNK> light then this movie is for you i don't and it wasn't
<START> well how can i <UNK> <UNK> without <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> ok here goes the scripts are fantastic with each episode offering so much entertainment drama humour and sheer <UNK> the casting is perfect especially that of the blue lady played by virginia hey each character has a depth that just isn't there on the star trek series br br i think having an australian spin on the show makes this for me australia has been knocking out quality films for years and <UNK> is no exception br br i have only seen the first four episodes in uk order and they have a quality that makes each 45 minute show in the uk stand out more like a film than a weekly tv series br br the episode that really does it for me is 'i which turns the alien concept around where a living ship even the <UNK> has a great character is forced to land on a planet that has yet to make <UNK> <UNK> and is surprisingly earth like and <UNK> meets a radio <UNK> <UNK> and he is the <UNK> green man' to them gripping stuff br br in short the effects are great the scripts are top quality and the main characters not one of them really given any more importance than any other are interesting not always <UNK> and well just excellent br br roll on the second season
<START> anthony quinn was a legend of 20th century in cinema by his great roles <UNK> this movie about a policeman <UNK> a false guilt for toni to rape his beauty wife but he failed in this trap because he faced the strength of but he succeeded in his trap which was prepared by him for toni that he put his name in the list of jewish people in romania and he transported from country to another in east europe br br this movie was directed in 1967 at the time of arab war in 1967 six days war as an evidence of <UNK> works from jewish people which were caused by jewish people not only in europe but also in the rest <UNK> br br jewish people were a great cause of french revolution in the revolution in russia <UNK> the turmoil of different countries in any time br br pearl buck wrote a novel in 1948 at the time of occupied in 1948 about chinese jewish people and their problems they faced in china because of their bad <UNK> they used in these countries as keys of crisis
<START> it has to be admitted that the best work of harold lloyd ended with his last great silent comedy <UNK> in <UNK> after that he enters sound films like chaplin and keaton and laurel hardy and w c fields and does do better than keaton but not as well as the other three chaplin was rich enough to make his own films as producer but he paced his films so there were five years between productions laurel hardy were under the protection of hal roach so production standards for their shorts and sound films were pretty good fields first worked with mack <UNK> than with paramount and then free lloyd tried the route that chaplin took but with less success br br he produced his own films but unlike chaplin he did not own his own studio also his first two choices were not good especially feet first but he did begin to choose more wisely and movie crazy the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> way were all good choices these three and possibly the sin of harold were his best sound <UNK> they are all entertaining but none are up to safety last the <UNK> the kid brother or <UNK> br br of the top four sound films the <UNK> <UNK> is the most controversial <UNK> solution to <UNK> the city that <UNK> him mayor is very extreme for the tastes of 2005 or is it when a movie is made <UNK> what it's politics are the <UNK> <UNK> is from 1934 that second year of the <UNK> new deal itself rather controversial for <UNK> government involvement movie audiences saw films like gabriel over the white house and the phantom president where our leaders did extra <UNK> actions to rid the nation of internal enemies and to force <UNK> around the globe even cecil b de <UNK> got into this act with this day and age where a bunch of teenagers use rats to force a gangster to confess his crimes br br to us the use of violence to force anyone even a bunch of <UNK> and like alan gang to confess is <UNK> after all the supreme court has <UNK> us from confession under <UNK> what we forget is that the <UNK> we are thinking of did not occur until the warren court and the <UNK> court made them for example although mr justice <UNK> opinion in the powell <UNK> boys case of 1932 guaranteed every criminal <UNK> had a right to <UNK> <UNK> v <UNK> did not <UNK> this to <UNK> court paid <UNK> to <UNK> until <UNK> the miranda case with it's now well known anti self warning is from 1963 nothing like this were considered necessary in 1934 br br if you study other movies of the period up to 1954 and even to 1960 tricks are used to get <UNK> kirk douglas <UNK> his crimes in front of witnesses in i walk alone while burt <UNK> holds a gun to him when <UNK> leaves douglas <UNK> about <UNK> under <UNK> only to see the gun is <UNK> suddenly he realizes that <UNK> in 1948 he has <UNK> without <UNK> hate to say it to any civil reading this note but what <UNK> lloyd does to and his pals in the conclusion of the <UNK> <UNK> was not only legal but would have led to their jail sentences in 1934 we may call it heavy handed <UNK> or horrid but it would have worked <UNK> when it was thought up
<START> german and uber actor paul muni who never saw a scene he didn't want to chew up goes <UNK> to play a humble mexican immigrant living in los angeles and working his way up in the world if this <UNK> vehicle reminds anyone of al <UNK> <UNK> performance as an <UNK> cuban in the remake of scarface don't be too surprised the characters are quite similar and both get wildly pop eyed when the script calls for it <UNK> everywhere should be greatly offended by <UNK> over the top performance as this <UNK> mexican living the american dream consequences be damned i guess <UNK> <UNK> grandfather wasn't available a young <UNK> blonde bette davis plays one of <UNK> love interests she eventually goes insane for love of mr <UNK> <UNK> can muni an absolute hoot davis is the sole reason to watch this <UNK> offensive <UNK> there is an absolutely delirious near the end when muni asks the gal of his dreams to marry him a white gal of <UNK> with one of those stilted stage like <UNK> accents that hollywood loved so much and she calls him a savage and a <UNK> of a different tribe muni immediately transforms into mr hyde and chases her to an <UNK> death in the final scene a <UNK> muni tells his sober faced priest that he is going back to his own people his own kind end of movie <UNK> that's all she wrote muni was said to have hired a gen <UNK> mexican as a <UNK> in order to study this exotic <UNK> speech pattern and physical <UNK> <UNK>
<START> first things first though i believe joel <UNK> is at best a mediocre director and more often as here downright bad the <UNK> share of the blame for this ugly travesty of a film must go to john <UNK> whose novel this is based on br br set at an <UNK> point in time the 50s the 70s now the film opens with the rape and murder of a child by <UNK> so <UNK> that their purpose seems to be to <UNK> <UNK> that at least we're not that bad  cut to the bad guys arriving at the <UNK> when the girls father samuel l jackson <UNK> they will get off on some <UNK> guns them down in cold blood before the trial br br the setting is a <UNK> <UNK> that probably never existed the few black characters live in <UNK> and seem to pick <UNK> the <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sutherland is a cartoon version of a are laughable in their <UNK> the set piece is the trial for the <UNK> are the good guys a <UNK> lawyer played by matthew <UNK> as though in a coma his assistant played by sandra <UNK> breasts she doesn't seem to serve any other narrative purpose and donald sutherland as the requisite drunk lawyer who <UNK> up to fight the good fight for the <UNK> kevin spacey goes through the motions of being demon <UNK> while in the town at large crosses are burned witness are <UNK> and the local citizens don't seem to br br some of the reviews here claim the film <UNK> since surely samuel jackson is a killer and should trust to the forces of the law rather than get off on a feeble heart <UNK> piece of <UNK> by matthew <UNK> to be honest <UNK> though the underlying message vigilante justice is good might be everything about the movie stinks the characterizations are pitiful the acting <UNK> the direction plodding the screenplay and the dialogue almost <UNK> on parody peter <UNK> lush 50s technicolor cinematography is pretty but derivative br br and it goes on for nearly two and a half hours br br what's left to say this is a waste of minutes of anyone's life it is tedious vacuous and hammy and almost as an <UNK> it is morally <UNK>
<START> i think i was one of the people who found this another one of <UNK> <UNK> his performance as awarded was stunning the story which was told so <UNK> by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop <UNK> proves again it doesn't have to be a war setting to be in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast and beauty go hand in hand while loneliness should become your best friend it shows a more sinister past of a small golden age kingdom which lands on a coast full of wealth for a 1st world country if u send the right men all in all a beautiful directed film from <UNK> a sublime cast
<START> when i heard there was to be an abc australian <UNK> corporation mini series based on life in wwii <UNK> camp with a focus on elements of comedy i was deeply <UNK> and somewhat critical br br my father had served in the second world war such was the of the japanese he was able to talk about the horrors in and around where he was <UNK> until only quite recently along with my father i had been awarded the fortune of knowing many great men of stronger character and spirit than i shall ever have who had witnessed acts of <UNK> at the hands of the empire of japan and had never completely <UNK> the name is destined to <UNK> horrific images for ages to come br br but upon viewing i was highly impressed with the cast the characters and the complex plot lines of this wonderful series i now regard as the highlight of my week bear in mind i have viewed only three episodes so far i hope the remaining episodes <UNK> to the standards set by the first three br br the black humour works <UNK> well however the <UNK> jokes are a little overdone and while much of the horror has been <UNK> the series comes quite close in <UNK> the spirit of the survivors who were able to later continue with their lives in spite of the memories br br the format of this series will be difficult for some to follow br br but i can not think of no better way to do adequate justice to the men who suffered deep emotional <UNK> <UNK> when painfully <UNK> experiences are remembered sometimes years after the horror br br one of the darkest chapters of the second world war the 20th century and i would go so far as to say in the history of mankind is being <UNK> to a new generation through this series and i hope it serves to <UNK> the overwhelming <UNK> <UNK> by the wartime generation br br <UNK> i don't think i shall ever be able to listen to the poignant tune <UNK> the road to in the same way again tune in
<START> the king of queens in my opinion is a pure cbs hit despite the fact that i've never seen every episode i still enjoy it very much for that reason it's hard for me to say which episode is my favorite even so i must say that cbs really knows how to make a good sitcom before i wrap this up i'd like to say that everyone always gives a good performance the production design is spectacular the costumes are well designed and the writing is always very strong in conclusion if this show lives on in <UNK> after it goes off cbs i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
<START> the copy of this movie that i have seen is not very good it's grainy and has almost no color in some parts it switches back and forth between english and french often in mid sentence and sometimes even in the middle of a word to make matters much worse there are no english subtitles during the french language parts which i think make up at least one quarter of the film but amazingly the movie is still very understandable and enjoyable even in this condition and i think that says a lot about how well made this film is br br this is a top notch spaghetti western with great acting an interesting storyline and an excellent music score it also has a cool protagonist a beautiful dark haired girl some strange characters and events and an overall feeling of melancholy this film has euro written all over it br br i hope there is a <UNK> negative or print of this film out there somewhere because it deserves a quality dvd release and when it comes out i will be one of the first in line to get it
<START> in need of work straight man bud <UNK> as jack and comic partner lou <UNK> as get the latter a job <UNK> self described problem child david as donald young winds up reading mr favorite novel see if you can guess the title which puts <UNK> to sleep dreaming he and mr <UNK> are <UNK> the story of jack and the you guessed it br br the <UNK> tone switches to color for the bulk of the production apparently this was an attempt at something different for the duo a colorful children's fantasy it fails but this is where you get to see <UNK> <UNK> in color silent film superstar william as the king make his last performance a bit part boxer max brother buddy and before disney's spin and marty br br jack and the 4 4 <UNK> jean lou <UNK> bud <UNK> buddy <UNK> william
<START> after you have seen enough movies there is very little that doesn't remind you of other movies nevertheless this was a watchable if somewhat disturbing film i had to shut it off from time to time and come back to it later like silence of the <UNK> it features the search for a serial killer who has <UNK> someone and has confined her to his chamber of horrors like the main character explores a dream world through an experimental <UNK> the <UNK> of the dream sequences is what makes this film as one finds the characters in a situation and landscape in which literally anything can happen and beyond this continuity and making sense are not necessary which makes it a film <UNK> dream too br br the only thing that seems a bit off is the fact that in the end one hopes for the redemption of the serial killer or the <UNK> of his demons you actually feel sympathy for the little boy inside the man but clearly the innocence of the boy cannot be separated from horrible deeds of the man the focus <UNK> as it must from saving the man to saving his victim
<START> i hadn't heard anything about this project until i saw that it was going to be on so i watched it with a completely open mind and gee the cast is full of strong players br br unfortunately it's awful i don't mean it isn't good i mean it's extraordinarily bad sometimes laughably so but mostly it's just boring its strongest appeal comes from having attractive people as naked as us network tv will allow but it's all <UNK> and no substance and having <UNK> as <UNK> characters can't justify several hours of bad tv br br there are two basic problems that the cast can't overcome first the script is awful yes making changes to the <UNK> myth which is certainly not a single <UNK> story in the first place is traditional but this version is relentlessly dull and much too frequently dumb and sometimes downright head <UNK> peculiar with terrible pacing bits borrowed from here and there and several parts seemingly <UNK> in different films and truly awful dialogue the dialogue is frequently <UNK> bad in fact to the point where you feel embarrassed for the actors sean <UNK> apparently now <UNK> as second banana seems especially <UNK> by one awful line after another there's no <UNK> of tone or atmosphere and little <UNK> to the plot br br second most of the special effects are really bad really bad there's occasionally a decent bit of cgi but mostly again you feel really embarrassed on behalf of the cast i have no idea what the budget for this project was but it sure looks like crap compared to clash of the <UNK> or even <UNK> the legendary <UNK> and doesn't even compare very <UNK> with the old lou <UNK> and italian <UNK> <UNK> movies just painfully miserable br br there are plenty of other problems the story is needlessly complex and can't keep up with itself and <UNK> himself isn't presented as a very interesting character almost everyone who doesn't have a european accent tries to fake one of some kind which is not merely amateurish and dated but never really made sense in the first place drama doesn't become better just because the actors use british accents after all but the terrible script and equally terrible effects sink the whole thing right off the bat br br in fairness <UNK> was apparently intended as a four hour miniseries but <UNK> for this airing anyway to a three hour tv movie i don't know what they cut but it's possible the edits made things worse i don't think you could make <UNK> good by adding to it but that doesn't mean that the continuity say hasn't suffered from the network edits there's no way i'll watch the usa version to see though
<START> it came as no surprise to me that this was a very depressing and <UNK> movie after all it's all about the impact of war on civilians and it's by the king of depression <UNK> bergman in other words so many of <UNK> works delve deep into human misery and angst and so this movie seems not so extraordinary coming from this director br br even though it is more difficult to watch the last half of the movie offers perhaps more insight into the lower depths of humanity that's because initially the main characters <UNK> <UNK> and max von <UNK> try to overcome <UNK> and are basically decent though a bit stupid people however as <UNK> after <UNK> occurs they especially von <UNK> become less and less <UNK> and more <UNK> doing anything in order to survive br br fun to watch no freaking way but an interesting insight into human nature br br ps 1 thing i loved about this film is that it avoided a stupid movie <UNK> when the couple sat down with the <UNK> to drink a glass or wine they finished the wine completely in most movies they barely touch their drinks or leave them <UNK> it drives me crazy as i would never leave a 4 alcoholic <UNK> without drinking it unless it <UNK> terrible or had a bug floating in it bravo
<START> totally forgettable movie but an unbelievable soundtrack i'd give it soundtrack a 9 out of 10 i have the cd and the guitar work <UNK> is superb i saw the movie years ago and had to check imdb to remember what it was about i obsessed about getting the soundtrack and have since had to replace it it <UNK> from blues soul <UNK> to a dose of <UNK> all songs written arranged produced and performed by <UNK> who is the other lead <UNK> opposite steve van <UNK> in the e street band this dude can play the <UNK> are handled by <UNK> he can't sing very good too <UNK> bonnie sheridan who is a great singer and tom
<START> bad acting yes but it was not a surprise stupid story yes so what br br but why tell me mr director why all that slow motion crap fight scenes were bad really bad because of slow motion and bad cutting not because of seagal br br what if i just speed this up for 2 seconds and then slow down those next 5 seconds and then maybe i need to flip the <UNK> to decide what were you thinking mr director
<START> although i am a fan of heather thomas and i have a few of her old bikini posters around here somewhere i can honestly say that if the only movie i had ever seen her in was <UNK> i would never be able to guess why she had made it as far as she had in show business br br directed by fred <UNK> ray about as good an omen as seeing <UNK> circle over head in the desert this tale of a woman thomas who must protect a high tech motorcycle from <UNK> types is about as b movie as it gets or in fred case b minus br br the cast itself should tell you something it's not every movie that combines thomas with actors the <UNK> of <UNK> hall combs <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> if you're lucky very few movies do and even though they seem to be having fun shouldn't some of that fun be passed on to the audience i vote yes seems they voted no br br of course if you ever wanted to see heather deliver an to another woman use the f word and get hooked up to <UNK> <UNK> you've probably been looking for this one myself i'll be content with old fall guy reruns br br one star given in hopes that when another <UNK> hits town heather runs for shelter i know i will
<START> an awesome made for the sci fi channel movie which by far surpasses many of the poor previous efforts they've <UNK> out bruce campbell is on superb form as a possible <UNK> who gets caught up in a bizarre experiment led by a delirious professor <UNK> <UNK> and his half wit assistance ted <UNK> the film is pure b movie gold and its great to see <UNK> and ram up on screen with bruce and the fact that a lot of the film works purely on <UNK> comic slapstick acting is what make it hilarious and makes me ask the question why isn't this guy getting more of his scripts <UNK> it indeed a sick world definitely worth a watch
<START> this show sucks it was put on <UNK> on roller coaster and whilst it undoubtedly destroyed the running theme of friday programming i shall judge it <UNK> still i think it sucks it really is super lame <UNK> and her stupid friends are weak characters and the pot sucks and is really lame br br the lame and pot sucks and i <UNK> the dialogue and <UNK> are weak the weak humour and lame <UNK> characters suck and the whole show is frankly a disappointment not worth watching it sucks and is really really lame it really has to be one of the <UNK> shows on tv really not worth watching i mean how lame weak and <UNK> can a show get before it gets <UNK>
<START> i am a lover of bad movies i own r o t o r and <UNK> vs python and am working to build up my collection to such great titles as <UNK> 2 and what's up but storm <UNK> is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies it's just lame the guy who said he's had better dialogue with his <UNK> plants has it right everything about this movie is stupid when the robot guy runs into the car it seems almost as if he knew it was going to blow up there was just no reason he would ever run in that direction judge jury and <UNK> the perfect cop but they went too far i mean come on why do people bother making these movies anymore r o t o r makes it because it is hysterically awful but storm <UNK> is just a waste of cinema because it isn't even bad enough to be so bad it's worth watching this belongs in someone's home movies collection something they can be sort of proud of but that is all i am p <UNK> off it was on an hbo channel with only 1 star which is why i watched it because it didn't belong there even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie it is shameful
<START> as a child i was never in a situation where i could be introduced to dr who and though i had heard of the series in passing i never really realized exactly what it was it was then with some <UNK> that i sat down to watch the <UNK> doctor and his antics having be told that he was something like arthur <UNK> from the <UNK> guide to the galaxy but <UNK> i can't believe what i've been missing out on seriously why had no one told me about this before my entire childhood was <UNK> of doctor who adventures me being a tremendous fan of most sci fi and fantasy adventures honestly i thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to any future episodes br br i have to admit that at first i was not so sure that <UNK> <UNK> would be the best actress but i'm happy to say that she did very well i thought and added a very realistic touch to the series i think actually that was one of my favourite aspects of the series the contrast between great alien conflict scenes <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> of the south london <UNK> estate life i'm always interested in instances where people's ideas about the world are drastically challenged and how people can take any situation and edit it in their minds so that it may fit in with their mundane lives i also loved christopher <UNK> i haven't seen many of his films and i've never seen another actor as dr who but i thought his portrayal of the doctor was brilliant immensely likable and yet dark enough to make you wonder i find that many other characters with his sort of character history tend to be a bit two dimensional they have all the right emotions and actions but they always seems slightly shallow this doctor on the other hand earned my loyalty with his <UNK> personality i agree with some of the other comments that a higher budget for the special effects aliens and <UNK> might have been a bit more effective but then again this isn't about special effects though they help from what i've read and heard from long time dr who fans it's the spirit of the whole things that really counts and i don't think they did a bad job with what they had i quite liked all the aliens but my favourite had to be the <UNK> if i ever knew anything about dr who before watching the series it was that there were things in it that looked like <UNK> on <UNK> previous to watching i was quite <UNK> about these pepper <UNK> threatening the existence of humanity but some of them were quite scary which i loved of course br br overall a good show i look forward to future episodes with delight the doctor has a new fan
<START> a holiday on a boat a married couple an angry <UNK> and a <UNK> is the reason to this films beginning br br i like boobs no question about that but when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim my anger just rises to a whole new level take two guys a husband and another man put a pure <UNK> woman in the middle of them ad a deserted island <UNK> all her moral issues ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments fish and a <UNK> lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this br br the acting is i would say good there are some <UNK> but not many as far as i could see the main female character makes me sick this is due to her lack of moral values the man with the most fish <UNK> her attention even though one of them is her husband she sees no problem with being <UNK> with <UNK> the other man because i must do it to survive how can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is away and he won't even benefit from it the female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does if she <UNK> get <UNK> for her actions she's a victim br br i recommend everyone to see this movie this is the kind of movie that will make just about everything else you see this year a pleasant movie experience
<START> this movie was outright painful for me to watch i understand that indie films do not have the same resources as other mainstream films but there are basic elements of film making that typically you want to <UNK> to first off jump cuts there are numerous in the film's opening 15 minutes there are shots in which it appears that two separate takes of the same shot were edited together what i mean by this is a character will say half a line from one take and the rest of the line is from a different take secondly the dialog i understand that many writers <UNK> for a very realistic and true dialog for their films since this film is very specific to its location the dialog must be spoken in a specific tone also example set a movie in boston yet people use west coast <UNK> with a chicago accent even with understanding this it is still hard to sit through some of the lines these actors present these are only the two most vivid problems i encountered with this film there were a few others i do not mean to sound like a harsh critic who doesn't know a thing i have years of experience in the film more importantly the low budget indie film industry i also understand that with many directors there is often a method to their madness i have been unable to discover this method used in this film this makes it difficult when trying to decide whether i view this film as an example of unique style in film making or just another low budget poorly put together film i honestly hope that it is not the latter if anyone has any insight into why things were done a certain way or has any thoughts views of their own concerning this film i would love to hear them hopefully i can understand this film more and my current opinion can be changed
<START> caution spoiler at the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge <UNK> just a few days after it was captured the impression is that the attack was all for nothing in reality taking the bridge at was the last important victory for the western allies it was the crossing of the <UNK> that the allies had been trying to achieve for six months because the bridge was taken the war ended in just a few weeks br br the bridge only need to last for a day after it was captured this was enough time for the americans to send combat <UNK> and a large protective force to the other side and they could then start building a series of bridges the taking of the bridge was a complete success and meant the that the end of the war was near and would not last through the summer contrary to the cynical nature of the film the victory was <UNK> with <UNK> by the troops who did it they knew how vital the battle was br br this film has little to do with real history it was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time in which it was produced
<START> you'd think a movie about incestuous sisters who eventually murder their <UNK> couldn't help but be gripping but then you'd be wrong br br there is no plot there is no character development there is no redeeming visual beauty br br this movie is a waste of time the exploration of how the relationship between the sisters develops is <UNK> their sexuality is never anything but a grotesque the class relationships are <UNK> over and <UNK> is a silly caricature br br <UNK> <UNK> and period clothing do not equal depth of meaning
<START> this as the first of the ma and <UNK> <UNK> flicks <UNK> main ma steals the show in anything she does funny to see <UNK> moore as emily the <UNK> old lady on the train god she was always old she was in desk set and alfred hitchcock presents their new house is also a co star here its the house of the future with some really cool <UNK> that <UNK> doesn't care for love the painting gag keep an eye out for tom he starred in <UNK> the professor unfortunately he died real young oddly enough his last role was on the series death cruise weird directed by charles <UNK> who not only directed several of the <UNK> films he also did a bunch of the <UNK> and <UNK> flicks so he must have known a thing or two about comedy fun story plain simple humor even the release date was april <UNK> day 1949 the story starts out by showing us what <UNK> and country folk they are the neighbors are even native americans but as the story progresses we have sympathy and respect for them
<START> this was a movie of which i kept on reading the reviews again and again and despite it being played at film museum and not at <UNK> theatres  i decided to give this movie a try the reasons were many  in the reviews it was compared with pulp fiction it had several parallel stories running in the movie and lastly it had already won 17 awards <UNK> in various categories i was eager to see this movie and due to my off day at i decided to make myself happy by going and seeing this movie br br it is a story based in <UNK> i think it reflected the current life of people in general  drugs crime sex anger anguish fear and guilt every emotion was captured brilliantly in the movie there are several characters and stories <UNK> but a few characters come back in the latter half  making a link with the beginning sequences and that takes the story forward br br the story is about two friends  one of whom is computer geek and the other is a drug addict  son of an abusive father the drug addict boy <UNK> a euro 500 note  <UNK> by his friend  to buy back his music system and in returns gets huge change of cash back to buy more drugs the <UNK> of euro 500 note continues to bizarre events  from the shop <UNK> to an auto mechanic <UNK> <UNK>  to a car dealer  to a <UNK> <UNK> salesman  to a prostitute  to a police officer  then to her family and children how the beginning of a small thing  creates a chain reaction that lead even after 5 years of that first incident to a depressing last note  which i won't reveal here br br the direction is excellent the character development in the movie is first rate the character that sticks on your mind even after you come out of the movie is of the <UNK> <UNK> sales person all the <UNK> of the movie are handled nicely here i would like to make a couple of critical comments first during the sequence of one event leading to another i felt that the <UNK> were too rapid and forced but this screenplay writing error is <UNK> when one sees the whole <UNK> second the trail of one character leading to another somehow leads back to the first two characters and that again i found to be a forced decision by the screen play writer there was no need to have the same characters showing up again when there are different causes leading to different effects in such a big city br br but after saying that  it is an excellent movie it is a dark movie with quite a few sex scenes the characters are having the black white and gray shades and emotions that change from facing different situation which is brilliantly captured by the director br br a top rate movie it has all the ingredients of becoming a cult movie i hope that only such movies should not become and achieve the status of cult movies and win lots of awards because without crime sex violence drugs etc too one can make fantastic movies  <UNK> thieves and are its prime examples  only thing is that they were a long time back and times are changing and i think movies are <UNK> the current times
<START> really disappointed me i can't consider it as a bad movie but the development just seemed too rushed and non believable for it to evoke any emotions dr displays some <UNK> bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one can't really understand where it was born from i mean how many times does he ever have a conversation with maybe once also never appeared to be a real character instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie or else another title was needed some of the best acting came from a role that wasn't really important to the story that of the sub intelligent yet humble <UNK> of course the scenery the cultural <UNK> of the <UNK> islands and other wow moments were interesting but the movie fell short of a documentary in case this was its real intention and most importantly as a solid drama
<START> john travolta <UNK> his role as <UNK> <UNK> hollywood gangster who now turns his eye to the music business using his <UNK> skills he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend played by uma thurman and try to get his young singer christina a hit record br br before i saw this sequel i had heard that it was a terrible film however be cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it's not as good as the original the movie focuses on the music industry this time around instead of the movie industry the music business is portrayed very poorly in the movie and they use a bunch of lame stereotypes i can't tell if this was the intention or not since get <UNK> did a nice job of <UNK> the movie industry the same can't be said for the sequel and the attempts just come as lazy br br an impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking the best performance is given by the rock and it's nice to see him in a different type of role vince vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end surprisingly uma thurman gives an average performance and i was expecting more from her john travolta returns as <UNK> and he does an okay job his performance is kind of dull though christina gives a horrible performance and she's also not that good of a singer cedric the entertainer gives a good performance though he isn't in the film for very long there are also a bunch of cameos including steven tyler and james wood br br f gary gray directs and he does a poor job he just doesn't handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess there was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile also at minutes the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots the film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasn't fortunately for the film the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes sometimes the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny compared to the original the sequel doesn't measure up well however be cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy in the end be cool is worth a rental and that's it rating 6 10
<START> this show had a promising start as sort of the opposite of <UNK> but has developed into a shallow display of t a actually according to my little brother thats the only good part of the show br br the first season was by far the best it was new and interesting things just went downhill after that the only redeeming point of this show is the other actors are lack <UNK> the characters lack depth and they seem to be incredibly selfish <UNK> generally un likable people br br to quote a friend las vegas is like in a casino in my opinion thats way to generous <UNK> was way better and much more realistic
<START> great characters great acting great dialogue incredible plot twists in plain language one of the best shows i've ever seen in my life do yourself a favor and watch this show you won't regret it this show re writes the book on sci fi
<START> the cookie cutter gets to work <UNK> in this obvious and unoriginal love story the plot such as it is has been done before a <UNK> times so there is no need to <UNK> any of it suffice to say that all 12 year old girls will love this movie while the rest of us will be forced to make a face even the soundtrack is awful its not that i dislike figure <UNK> although i don't its that i dislike cliched bad movies
<START> inspired by true events radio is one of the best acted heart felt dramas i seen widely released in sometime it definitely is one of the year's best films of 2003 br br radio stars ed harris who is oscar worthy nonetheless in this film as football coach harold jones coach jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the game however coach jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by debra <UNK> and sarah drew one day radio played by cuba gooding jr in his best performance since men of honor comes by the football field while the <UNK> team is practicing for the game some members of the team then tie up radio and throw him into a building they then bang on the building and finally coach jones suspects something is wrong he comes over and helps radio who is frightened and from that point on coach jones and radio shares a very special bond radio becomes the highlight of every football game and really enjoys <UNK> in the football games and at school events he also becomes coach <UNK> main interest in life over football which at first was his main <UNK> before both his family and radio br br the movie deals with all sorts of real life problems including what your <UNK> are life accepting people for who they are even if they are different death and family relationships the movie touches upon all those issues and more and is extremely well done and director michael should be very proud of this film the thing i liked most about radio was how real it felt the performances were like watching something in real life occur right before your eyes radio had a great mix of comedy and drama some parts were quite funny yet other parts were very serious and sad br br in conclusion i feel that radio was very overlooked by critics only getting average reviews they must have there heads up there <UNK> because its amazing how this film can only get 2 star reviews and something like school of rock can get 3 or 4 stars it doesn't make any sense to me also the performances as i mentioned before are top notch and oscar worthy in my opinion both ed harris who i think is underrated as an actor and cuba gooding jr should both get some kind on nomination for this movie radio is one my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the big hollywood movies my final rating for radio is a 9 10
<START> my family watches this movie over and over even our 3 year old loves it i like the goodness in the movie giving the stranger a chance showing <UNK> to one obviously in need of some <UNK> acceptance the movie gives a feeling of <UNK> and victory one other aspect of the movie that makes it so appealing is the personalities of siblings the bird lover the bug lover the boy lover very cute and happy movie there is one thing however that is irritating about it that is how mrs brown often makes mr brown look foolish or <UNK> she at times comes off as a know it all and he as a <UNK> which he is not too bad to put that into such a nice story nevertheless we will continue to enjoy this wonderful old movie
<START> this movie is just crap i cant put it differently since the very beginning one knows is going to be crap br br the story dialogue acting special effects make up pretty much everything sucks i like vampire movies and i know they will never be oscar winning movies but this one is not even worth seeing i can't believe how somebody produced this thing br br it's not even about vampires it's more about a dream reality experience the development of the movie is incoherent the motivation of the characters is doesn't exist everything seems like a big joke maybe that's what they tried to do but i sincerely doubt it i wish i knew what they tried to pull but it just <UNK> it's definitely one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life and i've seen many bad movies but nothing compared to this please make yourselves a favor and do not watch this br br p s it's also full of clichés p s 2 bad script bad directing bad cinematography p s 3 i bothered commenting on this as a favor to everyone
<START> dear mr ram <UNK> <UNK> i don't know in which capacity i am writing this letter to you i am a never say he's finished amitabh bachchan fan having sat through his <UNK> chasing act in i also demand some important <UNK> in the godfather fan club having watched the coppola classic more times than you have delivered <UNK> from your factory and of course i have been a big admirer of yours right from the time you had <UNK> the cycle chain around his <UNK> in <UNK> br br when you announced <UNK> and called it your take on godfather all one wanted to know was the date the first look would be out the sunday the <UNK> would go on air the friday the film would be released it was sheer wish <UNK> at work knowing that you and not someone <UNK> between the <UNK> fields of and the <UNK> gardens of <UNK> had taken up the task of <UNK> the <UNK> pages on the bollywood big screen br br your cast couldn't have been more you  working for the first time with the legend casting <UNK> as his screen son giving kay kay a role he has deserved for years bringing back forgotten faces like and and picking complete non actors like <UNK> and to join the before july 1 you had made <UNK> the most <UNK> film ever for any godfather freak who <UNK> bachchan br br the opening credits <UNK> the hope that your stunning <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the telly had <UNK> but now you labeled <UNK> your tribute to godfather instead of the word inspired which you had been using all along probably you don't want the two creations to be compared but when the medium is the same then a <UNK> would be compared to <UNK> dogs and a <UNK> dogs to a city on fire br br also when your first and last sequences  the heart of any screenplay treatment  are all about the establishment and the transfer of power you can't keep the and the apart even if you replace the american mafia moves with <UNK> political power play br br but you got it wrong mr you wanted to show amitabh in his 70s <UNK> as up by the <UNK> of you wanted him to <UNK> around larger than life you wanted him to be his own brand o then how could you steal his voice in the name of using silence how could you keep him <UNK> to his chair in the hunt for interesting camera angles how could you leave him stranded without his voice and stature the two things that have made his b so big <UNK> godfather cameraman gordon willis masked <UNK> eyes throughout the movie because it didn't have the power to match that <UNK> <UNK> voice or that sudden snap of the fingers but you tried to repeat the <UNK> act from your very own company but bachchan is no ajay <UNK>  his <UNK> doesn't lie in the <UNK> stare and the <UNK> silence you made the man look like a <UNK> patient who's reminded from time to time to look at the cue cards and mouth those predictable one liners for that there any given saturday br br which bachchan fan would go and watch kay kay <UNK> stealing the thunder from under his nose in the scene where <UNK> asks to leave his house which amitabh <UNK> would go and watch him focus on and in a film that talks about power with a capital p in the <UNK> we can't handle so much in the name of restraint and understatement you don't even allow the camera to rest on him for five seconds when he learns that his son wanted to kill him give me the old school camera only on bachchan style any given saturday br br kudos to you of course for making an actor out of <UNK> first in and now in <UNK> you also allow him to show <UNK> that he can run as well as his father even in the short prison sequence you really make the come out of the text an opportunity missed in <UNK> wish the film could have been more a father son story rather than a chaotic conflict between caricatures in the name of characters who pop up like the ad windows on the internet br br you also let the women more into the script than <UNK> and coppola did and again you deserve all the <UNK> points for <UNK> them in so effectively is a welcome return as the mother in the middle lovable as the <UNK> girl <UNK> a revelation as confused lover and silence speaks volumes br br but sub plots do not a classic remake when your free flowing camera tries to make every frame look and your loud background score <UNK> <UNK> we keep getting reminded that we are in a factory well maybe not a <UNK> score but <UNK> certainly deserved better than those govinda govinda <UNK> and <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> br br mr <UNK> some of your factory directors tell me that you are involved with every project from <UNK> the shooting <UNK> to <UNK> the editing sessions perhaps in the middle of all the various <UNK> the <UNK> scream is being muted by the silence perhaps you need to bring the down on the factory and work on a single <UNK> product otherwise your products would remain products to use and throw not treasure and movie buffs like me for whom there are no hits and <UNK> only good cinema would rather choose a film without factory finish any given saturday
<START> <UNK> silly anime only six episodes in duration about a hapless delivery boy called <UNK> well he's called a delivery boy though he is meant to be in his <UNK> and the adventures he has on his travels each episode sees him arriving in a new town <UNK> a new job developing something of a love interest before each episode ends with him leaving br br gently sexist juvenile very immature at times this is the kind of anime that just puts a smile on the face br br not one to start with if you are not a fan of anime as this certainly won't convince you about the genre but for those who are already converted this is entertaining fluff
<START> one of master director alfred hitchcock's <UNK> films this is the story of an american and his family james stewart doris day and their young son who are <UNK> in north africa stewart is a doctor and day is a world famous singer they meet a frenchman who speaks the native language and helps them out of an incident on a local bus later one the frenchman <UNK> something into stewart's ear after he is attacked and dying the rest of the film is a puzzle as stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery the movie is <UNK> in mystery and <UNK> from the exotic locale to the odd <UNK> you never really know what's going on in this film why people are appearing until the end and even then you're not sure the final scene takes place in albert hall and is one of the most famous in film which lasts for 12 minutes with no dialog hitchcock had originally made this film in 1934
<START> family guy is easily one of the worst shows i've ever forced myself to watch not at the bottom though i've seen the jersey shore a popular hit with high school and college kids who mistake <UNK> for <UNK> this show is unoriginal and stale br br as this has been dubbed a comedy show let's take a look at its humor 1 random flashbacks cuts to celebrities or movies or politics or anything that can be cut to for a <UNK> jerk laugh it got old after the 5 or so <UNK> per episode simple solution every time you hear this is worse than like the time plug your ears br br 2 for its own sake this show is notorious for <UNK> inappropriate gags that have little to do with the overall plot solution watch south park they did it right br br the bottom line is that family guy is not worth your time and doesn't hold a candle to the simpsons
<START> this film is supposed to be about the <UNK> of film making it certainly frustrated me with its endless boredom the setting is an attractive spanish resort with his usual large cast the script is very poorly written or maybe there was no script just all ad <UNK> br br a far superior film about the <UNK> of film making is <UNK> <UNK> day for night made in 1973 it shows all the <UNK> and how the cast can in an intriguing manner it doesn't bore the viewer and you gain sympathy for the director who somehow must complete the film
<START> the gate to hell has opened up under <UNK> a priest played by vincent <UNK> goes to the city to find a friend who has gone missing in the <UNK> under the city in an attempt to find the <UNK> wandering around underground he and his colleagues have to deal with the <UNK> inhabitants both human and demonic good idea with a good cast of second <UNK> actors goes nowhere much like the <UNK> that are its setting i've watched this twice now and i still have no idea why this is suppose to be scary when not a heck of a lot happens other then people talk about the evil and we see shadow forms nothing is clear and honestly i didn't see the point of it all other than provide a pay check for those involved second billed val kilmer is in a couple of fleeting scenes that don't amount to much other than to allow him to be billed as in the film the idea is really good the performances are fine the script goes nowhere take the advice of several of the characters in the film and don't cross the river to see this
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a 1945 film starring ingrid bergman and gary cooper it's based on a 1941 book by the great <UNK> <UNK> she may have had gone with the wind on the brain parts of the story reminded me of <UNK> br br set in the <UNK> <UNK> is an <UNK> child who returns from new orleans from france with a servant <UNK> <UNK> and a dwarf servant jerry austin she has given herself a <UNK> title and claims to be a widow her mother killed her father by accident and his family <UNK> her <UNK> takes over the old <UNK> with the idea of embarrassing her half sister and the wife of her father which she does by calling great attention to herself her plan is to marry someone very wealthy who can give her the security and <UNK> she <UNK> then she spots clint cooper a texas <UNK> and falls for him the two have a <UNK> relationship and he doesn't have any money so she can't marry him so he leaves for <UNK> springs eventually the family has enough and their attorney gives her 10 000 to get out of town she does she goes to <UNK> springs and goes after the owner of the <UNK> bart von <UNK> but clint is always around br br bergman is beautiful in dark hair and wearing the period costumes and cooper is drop dead gorgeous with that incredible 300 <UNK> smile of his how she could resist him is beyond me and the love scenes <UNK> what chemistry the supporting cast is excellent <UNK> and creating interesting characters and <UNK> bates giving an excellent performance as a socially prominent woman who takes <UNK> under her wing knowing she's a big fake br br the film runs a little long and some of the acting may seem old fashioned today but it's an absorbing story filled with atmosphere and vivid performances the ending won't come as any surprise it's a fun journey though
<START> maybe spoilers hard to spoil this thing more then it is but just in case <UNK> i don't see how anybody could have liked this re make it was like a made for t v show and still pretty lame for that lots of fake snow bad acting by top stars bad action and that crazy <UNK> forest in detroit what the heck i didn't really think this would be a great movie but i was hoping to be entertained nope we fell asleep half way and had to finish it up the next day i could have <UNK> the rest easy but then i would have missed those great woods i'm so glad i missed this at the theater bad enough to have wasted 3 50 at the video store and i am a lover of cop action and drama films this was a very <UNK> 1 out of 10 stars give me the original any day
<START> this film really used its locations well with some amazing shots dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly but constantly keeps you watching modern love worked well in the gold coast film fantastic program this year offering audiences a glimpse at an australian cinema that is usually neglected most importantly it is refreshing to see australian cinema not taking on the cliché aussie characters and story lines we have seen done to death over the years this film would compliment any festival and will open debate after its <UNK> the performances and characters are well developed and the cinematography is fantastic an interesting exploration into family relationships and <UNK>
<START> out of all the films i could have chosen it had to be this when i was last in new york i went into a times square store and out of the hundreds of dvd's they had i chose joel m <UNK> <UNK> freaks 1976 and this on a double feature dvd that also included <UNK> of sin 1968 did i regret it read on to find out the film opens on an island near <UNK> <UNK> island home where two lovers are walking along with a massive <UNK> seemingly made from paper at one point he gives her the top of a <UNK> as a gift out of nowhere colin hal a retarded <UNK> pops up and kills both of them for no reason at all after the opening credits which are joined by some of the worst headache inducing music i have ever heard at least it got me used to it as it's used constantly throughout the film we are introduced to three couples the wives are all sisters <UNK> ann <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> hayes and bill don williams plus elizabeth carol <UNK> and donald richard <UNK> they each receive a letter from a lawyer h <UNK> neil that request a meeting so he can read their late father's will <UNK> informs them that they must spend three days in their childhood home <UNK> and fill it with harmony and marital <UNK> that it had never known because of the strained relationship between their father and mother he informs the couples that the will is highly <UNK> but legal after three days the inheritance will be settled the couples are also told about the servants martha <UNK> <UNK> maggie <UNK> and the retarded colin who <UNK> the couples by killing and biting <UNK> out of a rabbit in front of them later on that night whats left of the dead rabbit is found in one of the couples <UNK> with a note that says <UNK> are the meek for they shall this starts a series of events which end in gruesome murder and reveals dark family secrets br br co written photographed and directed by the talentless andy <UNK> this is an absolutely horrible film in every way possible lets go through just some of it's faults the music it's awful and headache inducing sound you can barely hear what characters are saying and certain scenes don't have any sound effects plus at certain points you can hear <UNK> shouting out orders to his actors oh and there's a constant <UNK> on the soundtrack throughout as well the acting probably among the worst i have ever witnessed the very un special effects colin <UNK> <UNK> eye out in the opening sequence it's the size of a <UNK> ball the part where someone is tied down and has his stomach opened up with a saw looks really awful as are the various hands and legs that are chopped off photography <UNK> has absolutely no idea how to stage or film a scene he regularly cuts the top bottom or sides of peoples heads and faces off the screen and his camera <UNK> and shakes around like it's <UNK> by someone who is constantly <UNK> over there is also at least one scene so badly thought out and filmed that a crew member is seen the film is often so dark you can't see whats happening too editing again some of the worst i've ever sat through he seems to cut scenes before they've finished cutting away while characters are in the middle of a sentence the script if there was one credited to both <UNK> and hal <UNK> it took two people to write this is all over the place and is incredibly stupid there is one unbelievably bad sequence where the killer follows a victim down into the basement the killer walks right behind him at one point the potential victim turns around what does the killer do to avoid being spotted they duck down right in from of him the killers close enough to give the guy <UNK> sex yet he doesn't notice them right in front of him you have to see this sequence to believe it i still can't believe what i saw bizarre sub plots just happen and then totally disappear check the scene out when richard has to borrow money from his brother walter producer and co writer hal <UNK> who turns out to be a gay priest who has had an incestuous relationship with his brother before he was married a strange scene that's there for no reason at all martha the <UNK> reaction to the first murder she's more bothered by the fact that it's thrown her dinner schedule out there's load of insane dialogue as well patty and martha discuss colin patty says if only i didn't beat him so hard martha <UNK> replies you have to patty you have to delivered totally straight faced and don't start me on how ugly the <UNK> looks throughout the house the only good thing i can think of saying is that the costumes look reasonable for the time period it's meant to be set in i could probably go on all day about how amateurish this is but i think you get the idea one to avoid unless your a serious <UNK> i didn't regret buying or watching it for a second though
<START> the recent history of hollywood remakes of ghost horror films from the east has been dismal this film will inevitably suffer the same fate so get a copy on e bay or similar br br it is well photographed and the sound is superb viewing on a good screen and with a good 5 1 or <UNK> <UNK> sound system is recommended obviously it is subtitled so if that puts you off then i wouldn't bother with this dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here br br it is also genuinely frightening with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to western audiences i would particularly single out the stepmother character who was utterly brilliant the ending will have you wanting to watch it again if you can cope the plot is relentless and offers no <UNK> moments of release along the way br br if i do have a small criticism there is perhaps a <UNK> influence in certain scenes from the japanese version of the ring we have however accepted straight copies of other <UNK> ideas for western films for years and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it 10 10 i believe most fans of this genre will <UNK> huge pleasure from this film which i for one hope goes down as a classic
<START> i'm usually not inclined to write reviews about films i don't think deserve a mention but in the quest to grow as a writer and film critic i feel it is important to express my thoughts when i don't like a film queen of the damned is one of those films br br anne <UNK> popular horror stories of <UNK> a <UNK> vampire first took to the screen in 1994 in the successful an interview with a vampire starring two of hollywood's biggest <UNK> in tom cruise and brad pitt the film's stylish aesthetic and gothic <UNK> en scene captured the audience while it may have been a case of style way over substance there was something about it that worked despite its i have never been that <UNK> with the vampire genre in general br br since that time brad pitt and tom cruise have gone on to much bigger things it's likely both would have <UNK> with laughter when asked to appear in a sequel they would have been laughing even harder when they saw the final outcome queen of the damned <UNK> the type of <UNK> p hollywood is content to put out at a low cost with the hope of <UNK> a quick buck thanks to an average soundtrack and big marketing campaign aimed at 13 to 17 year olds br br needless to say this film is terrible from the start <UNK> now played by brit stuart <UNK> of shooting fish fame <UNK> from his dark grave to the sound of you guessed it <UNK> metal he freaks out some confused musicians and joins their band under the that he only appear at night what with the sun burning his skin and all during the day br br jesse <UNK> <UNK> a student studying the <UNK> vampire studies 101 perhaps tries to find out if <UNK> really is who he says he is along the way she falls for him something to do with her odd past but has a little competition in queen <UNK> a vampire demon queen who is returning from the underworld to <UNK> <UNK> as her chosen king br br the film is <UNK> self yet its campy tone leaves some room for its <UNK> humour anybody who sees this film for anything but a good laugh needs to see more films in general watching <UNK> is enjoyable he knows the role is utterly over the top and does his best to walk the <UNK> between utter <UNK> and serious acting the late <UNK> is unfortunately terrible in the title role she has minimal <UNK> and what she does have she does not use to the <UNK> the poor makeup and special effects do not help at times she sounds like she's talking through a br br it is <UNK> that this film was heading straight to video until <UNK> death last year with the possibility for people to see her final film warner bros put this out to a general release otherwise this would have been one of those movies you see on the shelf at video <UNK> but avoid because you can tell it is going to be simply terrible br br no doubt films like this will continue to be made look at the <UNK> of teen <UNK> com rip offs around or the <UNK> of that genre itself with films like not another teen movie if there is a market to exploit hollywood will do so br br the biggest issue i have with this film is not the film itself hollywood is about making money so if there is a market for this film then they will pursue it that's business but what concerns me the most is that people will <UNK> go out to the cinema and pay money to watch it i guess that's the biggest argument in the world of cinema is film art first and entertainment second or is it the other way around the only people who can decide that is the audience if you like and are intrigued by good films stay clear of this turkey
<START> let me begin by saying that there is no bigger fan of the original <UNK> <UNK> than i both the <UNK> prize winning book and the <UNK> mini series adapted from it stand alone in my experience as moving dramatic believable and engrossing works there is no comparison between <UNK> <UNK> and any western film at least not since the legendary <UNK> of john ford and john wayne it was with real <UNK> that i sat down to watch this new mini series what with non participation and the missing original cast members after watching the first episode it was clear that this is no <UNK> <UNK> in almost every way this sequel falls short of the original but so what i wasn't expecting it to measure up taken as an effort of it's own this film is engaging entertaining and of a very good quality if it were done as a new story not as a sequel to <UNK> <UNK> there is no question in my mind that it would not have received as many negative ratings jon voight did a <UNK> job as call barbara <UNK> was a terrific clara and the new characters like <UNK> walker and vega were well rendered and believable louis <UNK> jr deserves special mention as the horse <UNK> <UNK> the film made me care about the characters and i don't ask any more than that from an actor it is unfortunate that this worthy effort stands in the shadow of it's predecessor it is worth viewing in it's own right
<START> this film is one of my favorite christmas classics sure it's fluff it's not relevant but when did movies being simply entertaining and fun become a bad thing no this movie is definitely a good thing as martha stewart appropriately would say barbara stanwyck is so appealing in this film and dennis morgan perfectly <UNK> her both of them have charm and warmth to spare they are <UNK> by a crew of those incredible character actors who seem to have disappeared since the 40's and 50's sydney <UNK> s z <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> among them where are characters like this today not one role could have been better cast bette davis thankfully refused this role as beneath her and she was right to refuse it she would have attempted to steam roll over everyone and everything around her and completely destroyed the film stanwyck was a strong actress but had the wisdom to play this lightly she has seldom been more appealing and is pitch perfect morgan is the essence of the nice guy because his part is the least <UNK> there is a tendency to overlook his skill just the fact that he could hold his own surrounded by such distinct character actors is an accomplishment in itself but he too is absolutely perfect as <UNK> jones skip the ill advised and pointless 1992 remake and watch this bright <UNK> holiday gift
<START> the only problem with married to the mob is that it is not funny it dresses up exactly like a romantic comedy but almost nothing that happens is funny but if you can look at it as a film where almost nothing funny happens then you'll have a really good time it's a <UNK> mob film too as per the title extremely <UNK> but the director jonathan <UNK> is one of the few <UNK> cult directors who fully and completely <UNK> the 1980s in his work from that decade rather than understandably pretending it was still the 1970s br br the opening credits combine 1980s animation italian <UNK> and <UNK> en scene <UNK> on top of each other at once from there despite it feels about right the lighting by <UNK> frequent cinematographer <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> soundtrack <UNK> with widely varying pop and alternative <UNK> are <UNK> and that is indeed controlled and nuanced as part of the atmosphere <UNK> is good at colorful instant characterizations in his visual and sometimes seemingly <UNK> composition of a fun mix of styles a plot that could've gone any which way where a smooth fbi agent played by a very bland matthew <UNK> trying to <UNK> a mafia family sees a chance when a gun <UNK> played with come <UNK> <UNK> by michelle pfeiffer tries to leave the criminal lifestyle after her trigger man husband in just what you would hope for in an alec baldwin performance is <UNK> br br the way it goes works for awhile because <UNK> seems to have a firm hand on the wheel he knows the significance of showing us the very <UNK> and <UNK> life at home scenes with pfeiffer as well as her cares and <UNK> as a morally conflicted mom although her relationship with son joey is taken a bit for granted what <UNK> son is listening to party mom when <UNK> boss played with dean trademark <UNK> and by far the scene stealing stand out of the cast is giving him such awesome gifts on the whole though <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> are easily viewed as a novel take on a fun crime thriller tale br br ultimately though we find we've been going the wrong way because inevitably <UNK> and pfeiffer have to fall in love that's not <UNK> bad and every here and there it actually feels bearable but as a romantic subplot it is not handled interestingly or well hardly at all because it across various <UNK> clichés which fulfill the initial expectation of a cheesy 1980s date flick and for that audience i think it has just the right impact but for someone who has found themselves genuinely interested in the story and the aesthetic approach it is a let down into state of tedium br br so it's a decent movie with huge <UNK> at certain points but as a date movie or a nostalgic piece for those who grew up in the '80s perhaps saw a lot of date movies in the '80s the entertainment value is not as likely to except for said <UNK> in true laughs there maybe a few <UNK> and it's very <UNK> tongue in cheek but i wouldn't leave the comedy <UNK> with the high hopes with which i'd have initially entered whatever the case anyway there are additional <UNK> in bit roles by great character actors who have by now begun to fade like nancy travis joan cusack and oliver <UNK>
<START> this film could of been a hell of a lot better if they didn't use brian <UNK> as a gangster and if they didn't start the film with christopher br br when i watched this film i had absolutely no idea what was going on there were too many double crosses and plot twists to make the film believable the film deserves a 0 but seeing as i there isn't a 0 i gave it a 1 br br i wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy i would rather poke out my <UNK> with some rusty <UNK> than watch this film again i'm telling you that was an hour and a half of my life i won't get back br br if you want to watch a gangster film don't get this watch going off big time or lock stock and two smoking <UNK> instead
<START> even for the non opera loving public the name carmen is immediately recognized as an opera by <UNK> about a gypsy girl whose <UNK> loves destroy men but as much as the opera is now considered a <UNK> in every opera house <UNK> the real story of the wild gypsy <UNK> as created by <UNK> <UNK> in has never been told as well as in this cinematic version by the <UNK> gifted spanish director <UNK> la aka mad <UNK> <UNK> they tell you i etc <UNK> the author of the novel as a main character seeking the story of carmen from one of her lovers <UNK> provides just the right <UNK> for the story of this famous gypsy wild lady to be told br br carmen the amazingly beautiful and talented paz vega works in a <UNK> factory in <UNK> a factory <UNK> the military station where the very proper <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> carmen is <UNK> and in a fight <UNK> by a fellow factory worker bringing attention to the fact that carmen is a gypsy carmen murders the co worker and is arrested <UNK> is physically attracted to the <UNK> carmen and when carmen <UNK> with him he <UNK> to allow her to escape his <UNK> is the promise for a night of passion with carmen carmen keeps her <UNK> providing <UNK> with his first sexual encounter and <UNK> is doomed his lack of military discipline results in his losing his rank and being imprisoned for a while but at his release <UNK> encounters carmen again kills a fellow officer and in fear runs off to the hills to live with the <UNK> and <UNK> that are people many incidents occur to try the passionate bond between the lovers but when real husband is released from prison destructive <UNK> take over that include <UNK> and affair with a <UNK> and the passion of carmen and <UNK> comes to a tragic end br br one factor that makes the story as adapted for the screen by director and <UNK> move so well is the role that <UNK> <UNK> jay <UNK> plays his questioning of <UNK> <UNK> the story that <UNK> opera only <UNK> the acting is superb the cinematography by <UNK> and the excellent musical score by <UNK> contribute enormously to the success of this very fine film this is a must for lovers of the opera carmen and a splendid action drama for those viewers who admire historical pieces highly recommended grady <UNK>
<START> much can usually be forgiven in period pieces that ask us to recall important historical events and spice them with enough love interest to keep the story going battle of the brave <UNK> the 18th century struggle for the control of <UNK> an all of canada between the british and the french with <UNK> form the new america it has the <UNK> of a sweeping epic of fascination but sadly in the hands of writer pierre whose script deserves a <UNK> award for worst of the season and the scattered <UNK> and confusing direction by jean this film is a dud a two and a quarter hour tedious mess of a film br br even a cast a fine actors pairing as marie with david la <UNK> as <UNK> le adding the lovely <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> depardieu as le thomas and the likes of <UNK> <UNK> vincent <UNK> ridiculous in period <UNK> tim roth as william pitt <UNK> <UNK> as benjamin franklin and jason <UNK> as james <UNK> doesn't help veteran actors such as these must have <UNK> at the crude lines written for their characters cover the whole mess in a sappy musical score by patrick doyle and the result is a long film to be avoided sad to say such bad things about a <UNK> project but be warned grady <UNK>
<START> i got this for my birthday in a box set under the name broke skull well after watching one on the dvd and being pleasantly surprised i popped this sucker in it was worse than i had expected and i didn't expect much this movie is basically a convoluted story about a guy who dies and comes back to life with the mob and other bull crap there was some interesting ideas in this that were never followed up on now everybody has been saying there was a lot of gore can somebody tell me were i saw a bad effect of a head being crushed brain <UNK> or something and blood coming from the penis area two times i have to say the the part were the guy gets his man hood bitten off made me <UNK> that was the only good thing about this movie and that gay sex scene was just thrown in there for no reason the acting in this was atrocious really it blew that asian chick was annoying then the annoying mexican boyfriend who comes in to just be killed i say if you get this in a box set that is fine but don't spend any money on it at all
<START> outside sweden you are not expected have seen this movie happy you the cast includes several actors that are important part of modern the swedish movie history and still br br seems like peter <UNK> only had a an idea lasting for about 20 minutes robert <UNK> is totally <UNK> in this movie trying to copy a younger by the way is the only actor fulfilling the expectations br br credit that can be given is for the photo splendid idea using black and white music is ok br br but over all it's a waste of god actors and the time of the audience
<START> what can you say after watching this movie that is if you had the interest and concentration to see it to the end i was left speechless due to the amazingly dull story annoying situations where one american equals that of a fifty or more <UNK> and boring dialogue i think that if this movie has something to teach it probably goes like don't screw with us or we'll come and kick your <UNK> plus this film truly encourages and votes for killing masses of <UNK> in the name of war i got the image of <UNK> chess pieces out of the playing board except now it's fast and there's not so much thinking and on top of that no character there has any spirit then how can you care at all what happens to any of them <UNK> war movie fans with no taste i wouldn't recommend this to anyone there should always be something more interesting to do
<START> this is without question the worst screen adaptation of a stephen king work if not the worst movie of all time this is an unbelievably horrible movie i fell asleep on this stinker several times and i wasn't tired i would rather shoot myself than sit through it again
<START> i just picked this up in a decent if not outstanding dvd version for one dollar at wal mart br br run out and buy it br br i'm fairly sure that this version is the short <UNK> version released against the <UNK> wishes in the late fifties but even so at a buck it's an incredible bargain br br this film was <UNK> in small <UNK> as a serial to local tv stations in the early 60s for the kid's shows that almost every station ran on <UNK> <UNK> in those days mr bill and <UNK> <UNK> gang channel 4 <UNK> and captain grady channel 13 <UNK> <UNK> which is where i saw it it made such an impression on twelve or so old me that i immediately <UNK> it when i spotted it in wal mart tonight and grabbed it br br wonderful you should get it
<START> let me say first of all that i spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a <UNK> before i realized i was totally <UNK> i've always thought it was cool watching cats that know how to get extreme on 'em do their stuff but i've never been a <UNK> and have never really followed the sport that being said i thought this was a very informative and interesting documentary some reviewers have said that these <UNK> were sort of waving their own flag a bit but what the hell it looks to me that these guys probably deserve as much credit as anyone for giving the <UNK> world a <UNK> and they've provided some good footage of their <UNK> to back it up it's great the way viewers are allowed to see these guys both then and now and the footage they shot while they were teens growing up in california provides some interesting nostalgia that goes a bit beyond the sport of <UNK> i never would have realized where extreme <UNK> came from but this films sort of ties all the pieces together and gives us an informative documentary i'm sure it's at least a tad biased but aren't all documentaries worth watching for anyone interested in the sport or as in my case anyone who grew up in the 1970's
<START> the movie begins almost <UNK> slowly a romance yawn that seems to <UNK> off course all part of the plan then roughly one hour into this <UNK> movie is the feast it's worth paying attention to that first hour the feast is still <UNK> but humorous suddenly the <UNK> and slightly petty characters come to life and everyone you and the characters leave feeling <UNK> by the experience br br women will love this christians of all sorts will enjoy the profound faith demonstrated by the characters not my favorite movie of all time no dinosaurs or laser <UNK> after all but definitely a movie i am happy to have seen not to be missed br br jim
<START> this is a pale imitation of the die hard franchise that just sucks the low ambitions of the movie are clearly on display when the terrorists hold the vice president hostage and he has to call the white house to beg them to transfer some money in most movies of this genre the president is kidnapped or held hostage because after all he or she is the most powerful person in the country with finger on the nuclear button etc etc would most americans have really been worried if dick <UNK> had been kidnapped the honest answer is probably not why the terrorists would choose a stanley cup final to carry out their operation and why despite many explosions around them the audience inside the hockey stadium is oblivious to the situation are <UNK> questions let's just say this film is really hokey not hockey those who liked the film and found it to be exciting should get a life
<START> oh my god what a story this movie is very good and it had to be god who had this happen you did a awesome job the acting was really good you picked the right actors for sure this movie is so good i am really glad you made this because if you had not then i would have never ever known about this story because i am not a big golf fan and i think it is kinda boring so thank you i really enjoyed it and that is why i gave the movie a 10 10 i liked <UNK> <UNK> too he was perfect for the roll of i hope most of that stuff you put in there was true also oh and some parts were funny and others i was just really happy
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> victorian beauty kidnapped by sean connery as a <UNK> desert how can you go wrong how oh let me count the ways <UNK> primitive sean connery exactly the right man to tame a <UNK> classy beauty like <UNK> is well <UNK> in the role that's because instead of having dialog about the real issues you are a woman i am a man he has to <UNK> nonsense about the will of <UNK> and the wind blows destiny across the desert <UNK> john <UNK> a director known more for the worship of naked male bodies and <UNK> military force than any insight or interest in conventional human relationships has a <UNK> way of cutting away from his desert lovers every time it looks like <UNK> might get <UNK> instead of watching nature take its course with two <UNK> attractive people in a <UNK> landscape we are treated to endless and i do mean endless shots of brian keith flashing his <UNK> sized <UNK> and delivering gritty <UNK> on the <UNK> of being teddy <UNK> i have nothing against teddy <UNK> but watching him test out his new rifle or make speeches about the heroic death of a big bear just doesn't <UNK> me the way the love story between <UNK> <UNK> and sean connery would have if it had ever actually gotten <UNK> the weird thing is <UNK> spends most of his time building up characters and story lines that have no resolution two little children in the story both get more screen time than she does there's no humor no chemistry no <UNK> in any of the things that happen to her in the desert unless you think it's funny that after weeks of <UNK> around on <UNK> her hair is still perfect br br the only real moment in the story is when late at night <UNK> <UNK> shakes her little daughter out of a sound sleep on soft <UNK> and says we must escape the little girl turns over and without missing a beat replies but mother i was sleeping that one line sums up what's really missing from the story no danger suspense or <UNK> in the basic story line of a <UNK> lady in <UNK> she and her children are both so <UNK> and well cared for that it's hard to believe anyone is worked up about their fate br br mind you if <UNK> herself had said the line it might have worked better if the tension came from her enjoyment of her <UNK> or her delight at being in the arms of sean connery and her guilt about all the trouble being caused by her <UNK> then the story would have had some tension but <UNK> makes the odd <UNK> that the audience is just as worked up as he is over whether teddy <UNK> will get the chance to prove his <UNK> three thousand miles away in the end the pretty lady and her children don't seem to matter worth a damn to him and since they're at the center of the story the whole thing seems rather dry and endless like the burning desert <UNK>
<START> don't get me wrong i really love the <UNK> martial arts genre and i get more and more surprised over how many films like this there are out there this one is one of those and it's not even close to be one of the best with <UNK> <UNK> in it i thought it would be good he can't save this movie though and to be honest he wasn't very good either just don't pay attention to what other people say the fighting scenes in this movie are not good at all i really know what i'm talking about since i have seen so many movies like this there are also a bunch of scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot whatsoever i guess they added these only to make the movie last a little bit longer in addition to <UNK> the bad guy as bad like we didn't know that already
<START> this movie will send chills down your spine even if you don't understand german i first saw this in my german class in high school and found it for 5 at my local wal mart i've seen it at least 20 more times since this being only a couple years ago and it's great to watch on a movie night the <UNK> bodies are mostly real used from body worlds this movie was an out <UNK> to that a german dr <UNK> dr death began human bodies for display and now body worlds is a <UNK> deal right now in chicago <UNK> many people were opposed to this and so a great german horror movie was made i personally love this movie and would recommend it for all who like thriller slasher films
<START> i own this movie and i love canadian movies but hire an actress like rose i don't understand she is <UNK> useless in this movie just a name that's all the rest of the cast is good good enough to make this little thriller work i was surprise by the plot which is not the first time it was used but those unknown actors did very well even i'm not a big fan of his but i liked him in this movie if you got the chance to see it go for it
<START> i enjoyed this movie extremely it was the last great mario van <UNK> movie i know of it had a hip hop old west flavor to it big daddy kane and tone <UNK> had major parts it shouldn't have won any oscars but it was enjoyable all the same
<START> spoiler in fifth paragraph this was an amazingly frank uh huh uh huh picture for 1955 otto preminger and <UNK> productions took a chance by making it the motion picture association of america <UNK> at a film that openly shows a <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> full of heroin into his arm frank sinatra took a chance both on playing an addicted musician and at falling flat on his face in a role that required at least twice as much acting as he'd ever done all in all these <UNK> paid off the movie is a classic though it's not perfect br br nelson novel may be great but it has far too much going on to fit <UNK> into a two hour movie 'the man with the golden is minutes and often feels much longer however in my opinion it's not just frankie machine sinatra that makes the film but the other characters and their sub plots all involving frankie ultimately it's not just frankie who has the addiction everyone and everything seems to be <UNK> on him and he feels it <UNK> when the pressure gets to be too much the drums start <UNK> on the soundtrack and frankie steps across the street with his well dressed friend <UNK> br br it's an exaggeration to say that frank sinatra's music career was ever really in the <UNK> but in the early 50's he was in <UNK> between his days <UNK> with big bands and the las vegas era <UNK> here to established him as a serious actor and his career as a singer <UNK> as well but 'the man with the golden was still a significant challenge the whole show sinks or <UNK> with his performance he pulls it off with such skill that for several minutes at a time i forgot i was watching frank sinatra he must have known <UNK> musicians and exploited that knowledge to the <UNK> br br set side by side with billy <UNK> masterpiece 'the lost <UNK> there is more emphasis on the <UNK> causes of addiction in 'the man with the golden arm ' whereas don ray <UNK> in 'the lost <UNK> seems to struggle mostly against himself frankie machine is <UNK> by <UNK> forces and he takes <UNK> in the <UNK> neither approach is wholly right or wrong mostly because addiction is impossible to fully explain but it seems like this film might have <UNK> from a little more insight into <UNK> internal struggle br br spoiler one of the problems i have with this film is the clichéd <UNK> on <UNK> cold turkey i realize that 'the man with the golden was probably setting the trend rather than following it but that doesn't make it any better in the beginning of the movie frankie has to all appearances kicked his habit with the help of a doctor and a treatment facility of some sort naturally the drama of the film requires that he but i found the all american ideal that a man has to face his problems alone or maybe with the help of a good woman out of place here going cold turkey and riding off into the sunset with kim novak seemed too unrealistic the end of 'the lost <UNK> was similar but in my opinion was a little less <UNK>
<START> i am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60s films so ridiculous and silly that they are good for a laugh so because of this it's natural that i'd choose this film especially because with john <UNK> in it it was practically guaranteed to be bad sadly while it was a bad film it was the worst type of bad film dull beyond belief and unfunny at least with stupid and over the top bad films you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and terrible direction and acting here you never really see that much of the monster mostly due to the darkness of the print and the acting while bad is more low energy bad <UNK> and dull br br the film begins with some young adults going to <UNK> hollow to neck well considering the name of the place it's not surprising when they are later found <UNK> to pieces duh don't go <UNK> at <UNK> hollow well there are reports of some sort of crashing object from the sky so what do the teens go yep throw a dance party a very very very slow dance party where the kids almost dance in slow motion so it's up to the sheriff <UNK> and his men to ensure that the teens can dance in peace without fear of br br as for the monster it's some guy in a gorilla suit with a silly mask a bit like the monster in robot monster not exactly original and not exactly high tech to make it worse it makes <UNK> noises and moves very very slowly so slow that even the most <UNK> teen could easily <UNK> it how it manages to kill repeatedly is beyond me br br overall too dull to like even if you are a fan of lousy cinema
<START> so it's friday night and you want to go watch a movie all you want is something entertaining not too artsy or anything that might require a long night of philosophical discussions so you pay 10 to watch the <UNK> squad the trailer to this movie should have <UNK> me off but come on it's three of hollywood's most beautiful people eye candy but that's about it a string of moving <UNK> ads and what did hollywood producers forget a plot why are these kids running around the streets after some unknown enemy where are they but don't worry after a while you'll just stop caring i was on the verge of walking out of this movie because i thought sitting in my room and staring at the wall might have been more <UNK> and free but by that time it was over 90 minutes it's only saving grace so still willing to waste 10 go get yourself a nice hot meal
<START> and thus was born the most <UNK> <UNK> ever to grace the silver screen while the plot has an abused cat painting himself like a <UNK> and inadvertently <UNK> <UNK> le <UNK> called henry here <UNK> certainly steals the show no doubt chuck jones realized that this love seeking member of the had that special something necessary to be a star in his own right and so he cast <UNK> in for <UNK> reasons four years later firmly establishing enduring presence on screens everywhere br br so while <UNK> able kitty may be a place <UNK> otherwise i try to imagine watching it for the very first time in 1945 could anyone have guessed that this supporting character would soon join the ranks of bugs <UNK> <UNK> and the rest whether or not anyone did <UNK> remains one of the most likable characters to this day <UNK> <UNK>
<START> very dull show whats worse its very racist the white guys are dumb idiots and the only romance is between a black guy and a white woman there is nothing interesting about this romance it is not exciting it is not fun they don't even seem to care for each other at all its more like the writers and directors wanted an <UNK> thing going on why this is so popular in media today it is social programming and will lead to no good there is always tension when too many people want the same thing this show is not worth the 20 bucks for the season its a waste of time and <UNK> to society at least when they use tv shows to sell products they are more <UNK> selling whatever agenda here is quite obvious and without clear thinking some may feel wrong to <UNK> it but some of us know better
<START> new year 2006 and i'm watching <UNK> man again say what you like i find steven <UNK> movies amusing like many comments good fight sequences i particularly liked his answering of the phone at the restaurant saying how long it would be closed for <UNK> bit like <UNK> humour in the earlier action films although that tended to be self <UNK> br br but the one i like here is brian cox one of the most versatile actors around pity about his hand and foot but so much for <UNK> extended <UNK> must have <UNK> that class at the farm br br as the films went on i wonder just how the ever <UNK> <UNK> of seagal affected his movement never mind it's entertainment
<START> mr baseball is a film of <UNK> written and filmed as a light sports comedy it truly has a heartwarming core as human and universal as some of <UNK> finest at the plot level you have the <UNK> of baseball a fine old american game as it is played in japan turned around with american values cast off and japanese values <UNK> upon the game some of the superficial sports comedy results from jack's <UNK> disbelief at how is played in japan you also have a lead character who's presented as an over the hill aging baseball star but who is actually quite immature pro ball allowed him to <UNK> growing up and you have a lead character who is <UNK> <UNK> to the changes in his life that are being forced upon him <UNK> to accept the that life has given him in the midst of a new country a new manager a new team and a new girlfriend who have all welcomed him and try to accept him sound like heavy stuff not really it's a charming clash of cultures comedy that takes place on the national sports romantic and professional levels but if you watch it <UNK> enough you will also find a great story about a man who has to abandon his <UNK> and grow up way too late in life causing some amount of personal pain and finds success in places he never expected it i love the story but i also have great respect for performance he <UNK> his <UNK> literally to portray an ugly american insulting people and throwing <UNK> in public then lets us inside this character to understand his <UNK> it also doesn't hurt if you're a big fan of ken like i am mr baseball is a surprising loss of innocence tale
<START> this game is one of the best horror <UNK> games i've ever played the plot is a little choppy but the game never fails to send you plenty of chills and excitement many people <UNK> the game when they found that there are no cheat <UNK> for it and very little health <UNK> and <UNK> to be found but actually after you've gone through the game once you are more familiar with the monsters and different rooms so you can easily get by the second time around the <UNK> are great not too hard not too easy there are tons of different monsters so you never get bored and there are plenty of <UNK> areas you really feel like you're in a good stephen king novel as you play it's nice and creepy pick this game up cheap and have some fun
<START> for the very reason that i love movies such as central do <UNK> central station 1998 i really love chop shop there is no sugar <UNK> there is no attempt to make these people's lives over to something more <UNK> or pretty what you see is what you get and that is often gritty and at times heartbreaking but that is exactly what makes a movie such as chop shop so wonderful alongside the fact that the storyline unfolds so <UNK> and subtly for a young brother and sister who are about as close to <UNK> as one would ever want to get working and living at an auto body <UNK> shop in queens new york is as good as it gets is this a good or bad thing that is the question this movie essentially poses to the viewer this movie is really a fantastic slice of life piece that at times feels like a documentary instead of a drama and that is a great thing because it looks and feels so real in the midst of so so many current movies based on essentially surreal and often implausible plots stumbling upon chop shop is like finding a little gem
<START> wow i was really disappointed i wasn't really planning on seeing this movie in the theater and i wish i stuck to that plan it really should be a made for tv movie i was kind of excited to see it as i'm a big fan of <UNK> <UNK> but this movie didn't do her justice <UNK> i'm a little disappointed with the acting all around what a horrible cover up of <UNK> <UNK> it bothered me every time i saw her shoulder br br there was no flow to the movie it was very hard to get into it one scene we get angry hyped up we want blood the anticipation rises just then the director takes us to another scene to show the love between annie and bobby it would have been more enjoyable to follow if it was broken up into three sunday paper comic strip br br there was also little logic behind the characters chosen to play some parts the gangster leaders were <UNK> guys not very believable matt dillon head of a mobster organization come on give me a break there was just no <UNK> there br br the soundtrack wow i think this is one of the worst musical scores i've ever heard what awful guitar <UNK> my god the sound of my teeth <UNK> was more pleasing to my friends i'm sure br br anyhow there is one positive comment i'd like to make about the movie the settings were nicely done i liked the colours a good job conveying that time period
<START> it's been a long time since such an original quite funny black comedy has <UNK> if eating <UNK> is on your top 100 list do yourself a favor and find <UNK> betty immediately the subject of death being funny has been attempted before see paul <UNK> and mary <UNK> in <UNK> academy while that movie has some brilliant moments of black comedy <UNK> betty is much more steady with a better cast who could imagine that the <UNK> business might be <UNK> ground for an original uplifting and heartfelt comedy i was surprised and you will be too i highly recommend seeing <UNK> betty <UNK>
<START> in france <UNK> is a young <UNK> of twenty and something years trying to get a job in a <UNK> department through a friend of his father he is advised to have a <UNK> in spanish economy and language to get a good position he decides to apply in an european exchange program called <UNK> and move to <UNK> to improve his <UNK> in spanish culture and language she leaves his girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> promising to keep a close contact with her and once in <UNK> he is <UNK> <UNK> by a french doctor jean michel <UNK> de and his young and lonely wife anne sophie <UNK> he had met in the airport later he moves to an apartment with international students the english wendy kelly <UNK> the spanish <UNK> the italian <UNK> the danish lars christian and the german <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> then the <UNK> isabelle <UNK> de france and <UNK> brother william kevin bishop join the group and <UNK> learns spanish language and finds friendship and love in his experience living abroad <UNK> is one of those movies the viewer becomes sad when it ends the story is a delightful and funny tale of friendship and love in a <UNK> world and an <UNK> europe this very charming movie made me feel good and happy although i have never experienced to live in a republic of students the newcomer william <UNK> the funniest situations along the story with his big mouth and short brain further it great to see a fresh approach of students living together different from those dumb american <UNK> and their stereotypes common in american movies my vote is eight br br title brazil spanish
<START> i loved this well i loved the romance part with <UNK> and the girl rachel her name i honestly was only interested in those too i loved them in the movie i want to see more movies like that but please no more sad endings where they cant be it made me cry but the romance between them the plot the trauma everything was great i just was more into <UNK> and rachel ha ha everything about this movie was thrilling the kind to keep you glued to your seat because i sure was honestly my only personal want would be more focused between the couple <UNK> and rachel and at least a decent ending i hated the ending a better one could have been more thought out not the fact of forcing <UNK> to his death and rachel having a son the ending would have killed the movie
<START> yet another gay film ruined by <UNK> politics final speech just about sent me running out of the theatre with its <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> read the comic book it was based on for a much more entertaining experience
<START> this is truly awful the attempt at a comics adaptation ever committed to film every possible thing about this movie that could be bad is music acting lighting sets special effects about the only <UNK> i can find are that sue looks cute in her blue <UNK> and that the thing make up is almost passable face only that's it <UNK> don't bother tracking down that <UNK> copy it's really not worth your time even the <UNK> captain america movie from the early 90's is far less excruciating than <UNK> in your seat while you try to endure this mess
<START> yes i spelled that right this movie is so predictable the actual word needs additional letters to <UNK> the predictability from the moment the principal characters and situation are introduced it is paint by numbers as to where this plot will take us the <UNK> was as subtle as a two ton <UNK> you could take numerous pieces of dialogue and <UNK> the role it would play in the ending br br catherine zeta jones and aaron did decent jobs in <UNK> roles and <UNK> <UNK> played the cute role admirably it's just that the movie brought absolutely nothing new to the romantic comedy genre the romance was tepid and the laughs were weak and few sure it's an ok movie if you have nothing to watch but you won't miss anything by missing this one
<START> what makes watching and reviewing films a pleasure is when every once in a while when you least expect it a film like the cell comes along and knocks your <UNK> off this movie is a superb horror that has everything a you could want when you want to be scared out of your without going into the story all i will say is that it has a great beginning middle and end that keeps you on the edge of your seat while being <UNK> with the amazing special affects the acting is good without being outstanding but that does not matter because the subject matter and the way it is put on the big screen makes this one of the best horror movies i have seen for a long while it is one of those films that you imagine started as a novel but saying the credits it does not look like an adaptation so a lot of credit must go to mark the writer 9 out of 10
<START> it's pretty evident that many of your nights were spent alone if you watched 5 minutes of the actual show instead of watching the commercial you would have seen one of the greatest television shows in canadian history being made too bad you would have been watching it alone probably the reason you hate it no game keys to the <UNK> is hilarious light and funny guys are going to eat this show up my game is tight and i can hardly wait to get on this show the chicks were and the <UNK> kicked ass i'll be watching every week it makes me wonder why more great shows like this one aren't being made now it's clear that the talent in canada has the ability to produce american quality television
<START> the capture of bigfoot is one of the <UNK> and worst movies of all time i love sasquatch and bigfoot movies but this one is just a sheer waste of one's time terrible terrible terrible i watched this movie last night and it was all i could do to finish watching i understood that this weird crazy man wanted to capture bigfoot but that was the only thing that made sense in this movie it did have some amusing parts though there was this very cheesy and corny disco club with very bad disco dancing that seemed to go on for far too long in the movie i think the director was trying to fill time the worst thing was the way the bigfoot looked the obvious man in a suit looked like a pink faux fur bigfoot it was laughable if you want to see a very bad bigfoot movie then i suggest that you purchase this movie personally i wasted my time and my money on this one
<START> this was a very nice concert by the one and only <UNK> the choreography was excellent and the costumes were decent the <UNK> were okay i have to admit that his <UNK> were crap on human nature and <UNK> jean you couldn't hear him half the time the other songs make up for the singing the highlights of the show are jam smooth criminal i just can't stop loving you she's out of my life thriller <UNK> jean the dancing not the singing black or white man in the mirror the concert was almost perfect if it was anybody but <UNK> it would have been a 9 it is a must see i wish i was born then so i could have gotten a ticket to the best concert of 1992
<START> look this movie is obscure brilliant and a classic that should sought out by any means necessary i suppose the powers that be have decided that it will forever be <UNK> towards the <UNK> bin nevertheless we could only pray for the chance to see this one on dvd i would say that it even beats the great if you like a dark movie with plenty of spooky imagery look for this one and see how an 80s horror movie is suppose to be
<START> i admit i go more for the traditional vampire tale but this one is a real winner lots of way out graphics and good story to go with them made for an interesting 2 hours there was loads of gore with vicious blood <UNK> attacking <UNK> and even each other for control of the world a good one for all us vampire lovers
<START> this is a <UNK> drama of mostly the later years of life with nearly all the parts played by actors but spot which tv plays himself it was made for the arts channel but my guess is there will be <UNK> and dvd releases soon is <UNK> played by the excellent michael sheen here repeating his previous stage role with great success most of the supporting cast are also very good and a nice touch is the recreation of period tv appearances with the new actors this is not however light viewing anyone familiar with <UNK> and general unhappy <UNK> will already know how twisted he could be in later life so don't expect 80 minutes of carry on <UNK> <UNK> since the emphasis is decidedly downbeat throughout recommended but it's <UNK> comic indeed
<START> leon errol handles his double role of uncle matt lindsay and lord basil superbly but i have trouble liking the mexican <UNK> series because they all are contrived to produce mistaken identities and these are <UNK> way in advance errol is funny as the <UNK> lord but i would have preferred a lot more wit and much less <UNK> br br
<START> this was <UNK> as a sequel to crash dive which was a very good film in the low budget category i assumed this movie would be good also but boy was i wrong first this movie has nothing to do with crash dive other than they both take place on <UNK> secondly the plot can be slow tedious and in some cases totally preposterous br br this movie will not hold most people's attention i remember reading a book during the slow boring scenes there will be scenes that are supposed to be used for dramatic effect that will make the viewer laugh out loud the <UNK> scene is definitely one after i got over my initial shock that anyone would slip this in and not know people would not only <UNK> it but laugh at the sheer silliness of it i was able to find humor in it br br if you want to see <UNK> in a good sub flick watch crash dive and leave this lame film on the shelf
<START> i happened across this movie while channel surfing and it seemed to be yet another poorly made christian film about the end times which i find rather entertaining because they take themselves so seriously to be fair i only saw the last 30 minutes so i missed the part about <UNK> and the sci fi stuff but it was long enough for me to <UNK> it as an embarrassing and appalling representation of the christian faith as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sense br br as a film the script was terrible the acting was mediocre and the pacing was poor the cinematography and direction were sub par no interesting visuals no layered plot line no creativity don't just blame it on the budget films can still be interesting without special effects this wasn't christian films cannot excuse their mediocrity and <UNK> in the artistic <UNK> just because of their message and the message here was hardly christian br br <UNK> the rest of this comment is targeted towards christians br br first off it is <UNK> in any business to bait and switch your customers i don't like being told i can win a free <UNK> only to realize i have to spend 300 at <UNK> stores first don't like being told they're watching a sci fi film and then get <UNK> with christian propaganda that has all the subtlety of a <UNK> hidden <UNK> don't win you any friends much less <UNK> br br secondly you should not use overt <UNK> to convince people your beliefs are true the actors who represented christians came off as <UNK> smug bullies when dealing with the skeptical they even go so far as to stage the rapture in order to scare him into believing <UNK> dialogue turn to jesus or go to hell fine don't believe me but you'll be sorry the day you die i can guarantee you'll wish you paid more attention to this jesus stuff when you land in the belly of hell ok i may be <UNK> but it certainly came off in the same manner if you think this is a clear message for christ you're wrong i don't recall jesus using <UNK> and and i don't think people can make an authentic decision to believe in him out of fear so christians please don't use this as a witnessing tool for your <UNK> friends it is heavy handed offensive and inaccurate in portraying a true christian message br br <UNK> the <UNK> was bad apart from <UNK> jesus as a means of hell insurance it gave no room for debate or discussion and didn't attempt to engage the issue of whether <UNK> or alien life could exist instead it offered one pat answer <UNK> are the devil's scheme to <UNK> people when the rapture happens which is neither biblical nor widely accepted by most christians as the bible doesn't mention <UNK> or aliens you can't use it as a source to draw conclusions one way or the other the rapture isn't necessarily even a widely accepted sound biblical concept though nowadays most <UNK> christians seem to believe it because of a popular book series if you do your research as so many of the supportive reviewers are suggesting the idea of two <UNK> of christ the first as the rapture is a relatively new <UNK> in church tradition <UNK> by some traveling <UNK> around the turn of the 20th century the majority of <UNK> christians will probably find this film's message to be a pretty big stretch that rests on a lot of <UNK> br br basically this film misses the mark both as a worthwhile piece of entertainment and as an accurate representation of christianity and its beliefs i wouldn't recommend it
<START> you gotta love the spaghetti western universe the vision of a west where good guys get shot point blank with no warning cartoonish villains chew the scenery in extreme close ups and the anti hero walks away from the girl in the end a lot of people call films <UNK> i find that a bit dodgy as far as <UNK> go i think bleak and <UNK> are more apt mostly because <UNK> suggests a level of sentimentality almost every director ignored in favour of painting characters in broad <UNK> br br <UNK> must be seen in all its widescreen glory before it can take its proper place in the sergio <UNK> <UNK> it's a beautiful movie and it makes sense that <UNK> wanted to blow off some steam with <UNK> after the <UNK> one two punch of the great silence and this although he would later <UNK> back to his usual tricks with the <UNK> sonny and jed there's still a certain amount of caricature that <UNK> from the overall <UNK> of the movie imo it hurts more than does any good to have a needless inclusion of three kids dressed like hippies <UNK> around town in search of gold and trouble and it hurts to have mario playing mexican one handed <UNK> el <UNK> as over the top as he always plays his characters br br those minor <UNK> aside there's more than enough here to wet the <UNK> of the spaghetti <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the population of an entire town reduced to <UNK> naked in the dirt the typical iconic of the <UNK> <UNK> played by johnny <UNK> the moral <UNK> of almost every character in the movie <UNK> might never receive the acclaim of the more famous sergio or the american of the genre but you and i know that's a gross injustice for a very talented director his dynamic shot selection in depth staging with objects sticking close to the camera and <UNK> in the background his flair for quick pacing and <UNK> energy in moving a story that wasn't always all that along the way he photographs open spaces everything in his work makes me sure that if <UNK> was american and had emerged 15 years later along with mann and <UNK> the <UNK> du cinema critics would have <UNK> him as an auteur worthy of serious critical consideration
<START> what on earth happened to <UNK> there are so many things wrong about this movie that one needs to stop and decide where to start first and worst the music every scene was accompanied with this pretentious background music that was telling you the mood quite <UNK> i might add secondly the lighting do we really need such dark scenes where we are wondering if the <UNK> is still working and finally if you are going to the godfather and godfather 2 please realize that a lot of us have seen in was a ripoff of but better done and more entertaining i have seen a similarity in both company and <UNK> and while <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was brilliant these two movies leave something to be desired people will not be impressed any more by just corrupt politicians and the lot maybe <UNK> should see which is good enough to be <UNK>
<START> watching this little movie is a sheer delight from start to finish the story is always entertaining the tension never <UNK> up the whole cast is wonderful the <UNK> of walken and <UNK> works to perfection it is almost like an echo of a classic screwball romance <UNK> is very sexy and really funny as the <UNK> artist who fights for her independence for some reason they gave walken a very strange make up and the <UNK> <UNK> i can imagine  it's sort of a parody of the one burt <UNK> had in elmer <UNK> for me it added to the pleasure it's the first movie i saw <UNK> <UNK> in probably one of the most under appreciated movie actors of his generation he's very good in a small role as <UNK> even the <UNK> thugs are a sight to behold i can highly recommend this movie
<START> having spent all of her money caring for her <UNK> ill <UNK> recently widowed karen <UNK> moves with her two daughters sarah <UNK> taylor <UNK> and emma chloe to her late husband's run down family home in rural <UNK> where local legends speak of zombies who <UNK> the woods at night br br just seeing the names of this film's writer and director in the opening credits was enough to send <UNK> up my spine <UNK> <UNK> is the responsible for <UNK> the scripts for such <UNK> titles as <UNK> 1 2 <UNK> and crocodile whilst j s <UNK> gave us the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and dull vampire flick the <UNK> with such dubious talent responsible i didn't expect much from wicked little things br br and having just finished the film i'm glad i kept my expectations low br br although the movie looks good at times with lovely use of the eerie <UNK> locale and the cast give reasonable performances given the clichéd drivel that they are working with the plot is so <UNK> poorly written and derivative that it's impossible to be enthusiastic about most importantly perhaps the film's killers undead children who rise each night from the mine in which they died aren't in the least bit scary a <UNK> of makeup black contacts and some crappy joke shop <UNK> doing very little to add to the sense of menace <UNK> taylor <UNK> and company do their best to look afraid of the tiny <UNK> screaming convincingly with every confrontation but their admirable attempts to <UNK> a sense of fear in the audience is to little <UNK> the little just ain't got what it takes to chill the blood br br there are a few <UNK> zombie <UNK> scenes in a <UNK> <UNK> to win over gore <UNK> and the final kill which sees the <UNK> blood both <UNK> and is suitably tasteless but on the whole wicked little things aka zombies in the uk is instantly forgettable another <UNK> in the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> this movie tries to be artistic but comes across as <UNK> as a film school <UNK> first attempt next it tries to be erotic but comes across as clumsy as a <UNK> first attempt lastly it tries to be cruel gripping but aside from <UNK> performance which is powerful but <UNK> misplaced amidst the amateur melodrama it's about as gripping as your hand around a wet <UNK> which is an appropriate metaphor considering how un erotic this film is it features a <UNK> scene which is even <UNK> than career <UNK> performance in the brown bunny run away now while you have the chance go find yourself a victoria's secret <UNK> <UNK> instead it's more artistic and more erotic than this tripe
<START> <UNK> is the one of most powerful shocking and moving motion picture to come from brazil it's about the lives of street kids on the streets of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> de <UNK> and it centers around a ten year old boy the camera follows them around in an almost documentary style from the juvenile <UNK> center where most of the staff is as corrupt as the police and back to the streets and it never turns away from the horrors of the city prostitution drug use dealing corruption and murder are all witnessed by these <UNK> yet it's something they're painfully used to director hector used real street kids as the actors adding to the films brutal reality although not for everyone a film i highly recommend an emotionally devastating movie br br
<START> one night on an independent channel famous for showing off the wall films was aired this monstrosity though tempted to turn it off we watched it to the bitter end hoping to see some semblance of redeeming value alas there was none absolutely nothing the film quality was cheap the soundtrack was <UNK> the editing was ridiculous then again there was precious little to salvage after a few minutes of cameron <UNK> doctor character <UNK> about some patient of his the viewer is tortured by no plot pathetic writing <UNK> terrible acting and an utter lack of <UNK> and continuity the rotting <UNK> on top of this <UNK> mess was the most horrendous special effects and makeup to ever disgrace the screen even for television the main character stumbles through his role in a <UNK> rubber mask and a pair of <UNK> which appear to have been <UNK> in <UNK> and rolled in <UNK> perhaps the poor lighting and gag worthy film quality were attempting to cover up how bad to the <UNK> power the makeup was one can only hope that at least one deliberate decision was made in the course of this hopelessly amateurish video seriously a handful of three year old kids could've produced a better project at the end poor mr mitchell returns how desperate he must've been for money and <UNK> out some nonsense that's supposed to connect this pile of crap with the aids <UNK> please spare you and your loved ones the <UNK> cruelty of sitting through this it was so bad even mystery science theater 3000 couldn't have <UNK> it
<START> this movie is nothing more than christian propaganda it started off like a good sci fi movie and then works a <UNK> sweet christian theme into the story which is totally unrelated i had to turn it off half way through because i felt tricked into renting it the catholic church has officially announced that aliens do not <UNK> belief in god br br the movie is slightly entertaining despite this but the dialog is unbelievable writing and acting is mostly rubbish and all in all this movie is mostly a stinker to be avoided br br there was obviously some research done into the phenomenon by the filmmakers but then you quickly realize that it is only for the purpose to <UNK> and <UNK> their own paranoid religious views into a valid interesting subject if you are a <UNK> religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels you will love this movie
<START> i'm not american but <UNK> still really hits me maybe because it's a sweet sweet movie watching it again today made me sentimental for a time i can't really put my finger on and a place i can't quite remember br br <UNK> is just a great movie it reminds me of innocent days when nothing really <UNK> and anything was possible br br if you're reading this you probably know what i mean br br all i can say on top of what i've already said is that <UNK> must be even more nostalgic if you're american br br i guess you know what i mean by that too
<START> this is another enjoyable and entertaining hitchcock film james stewart and doris day are incredible in this movie bernard <UNK> appears as himself near the climax br br the scenery and locations are great except the one scene early on where the background was obviously fake which doesn't make sense to me since scenes before and after were in the same setting and they were real location shots i've heard that hitchcock did this on purpose sometimes br br the reviews for this movie seem to be mixed i think this is a better than average hitchcock movie very entertaining and it has a great light comical scene at the end br br i rated this movie 8 out of 10 br br
<START> they've shown i twice in a very short time now here in sweden and i am so very tired of it the bad acting isn't enough the story itself is so boring and the effects hardly exists i love the original from 1953 so i recommend you to go and rent that one instead because this one is such a bore
<START> good boring or bad it's good worth your money if you can spare it for a ticket sure better than the trailer makes it seem yes oddly br br there isn't much to the script guards working at <UNK> truck company move vast amounts of cash guards see opportunity to <UNK> as <UNK> one of them is too honest to go along with it all and a well laid plan goes to hell br br this could have been a poorly executed <UNK> dogs ripoff but the skill of the cast and the director's ability to make just about anything tense pull it out of that realm and put it onto a solid <UNK>
<START> the worse film i have every seen like the other honest reviewers it is just an excuse for getting naked birds with their out don't get wrong naked women isn't a bad thing but there is another film genre for that br br boyfriends beware i sold this to my girlfriend as a classic bike gang fest due to reviews to be <UNK> with every other scene full of naked women <UNK> about the place slap in the chops for me br br what makes me laugh the most is all the bike <UNK> they went to in the film were full of models with the works <UNK> what biker bars have these they are usually slightly <UNK> with <UNK> and far completely unrealistic the acting is terrible loads of pointless swearing and a complete waste of time storyline br br did anyone check out <UNK> <UNK> attempt at an american accent its as embarrassing as his football skills br br avoid like the plague the only reason you would watch this film is if you are a young <UNK> who cant access p <UNK> and have <UNK> it from their parents movie collection for a few <UNK> kicks
<START> 2001 a space odyssey is set in 2001 and the main character is hal a computer that's right a computer who talks and thinks entirely on its own this was made in 1968 and to think by 2001 it would be <UNK> that computers would talk is a joke if this was in a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered just as moronic as this there is nothing in this film that <UNK> any kind of emotion it <UNK> two reactions and one is called sleep it starts with nothing but a pitch black shot for well over two minutes then the first shot we see that has some kind of lighting is the dawn of man sequence so if it's in <UNK> order the <UNK> prior to this is the birth of the world br br during the dawn of man sequence out of no where a huge <UNK> comes out of the ground from the sky we'll never know where it comes from but for one reason or another it's there the monkeys go t once they find this <UNK> that only man could have made but that's the man hasn't evolved yet so who made it and where did it come from what is its purpose the monkeys find a tool the monkeys use bones to fight an <UNK> group of monkeys the monkeys with the weapons are now the <UNK> group because they have used their mind to gain an advantage the more advanced monkeys and more importantly smarter and more innovative monkeys are the dominate group as they have taken over the <UNK> hole br br we quickly jump into space millions of years later where we see a bunch of <UNK> floating around to classical music we can see the earth the moon the sun the universe and for a film made in 1968 the visual effects are stunning but outdated the score is legendary the cinematography is spectacular the editing is atrocious there are countless shots of <UNK> looking space ships floating in outer space for what feels like an <UNK> amount of time once we board the ship there isn't much to talk about for the next hour kubrick shows various shots of life in outer space kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut which is very boring and we completely get the message the <UNK> interior and exterior are <UNK> and outdated looking remember what the first cell phone looked like me neither but that's what the future looks like in 2001 all the characters have clothes and <UNK> that resemble 1968 the <UNK> are <UNK> in bright red colors and oddly shaped because we all know in the future we're going to be sitting in weird looking <UNK> the computer screens are hideous looking and this is obviously prior to <UNK> because the clarity is atrocious all the tv sets look like they're from 1968 so it's not all that futuristic like all films set more than 20 years in advance they look terrible and unconvincing just because this is kubrick we shouldn't say well that's how you would think it looks no i wouldn't just like i wouldn't think a computer would be talking to me in the year <UNK> it's not going to happen and if someone made a film right now set 30 years in time and had a talking self thinking computer i would laugh at the stupidity of it just like i did with 2001 br br hal is the <UNK> person i just called him a person hal is a computer but he has more life than any of the muted characters in the film and he actually thinks he's alive hal is the only thing that's lively and he sees the humans as his <UNK> men taking care of him while he does all the work hal reads the lips of one of the very few conversations between dave and frank and he sees that they are planning to turn him off this is where the only dramatic part of the film enters an ensuing battle between a red light and a guy in a spaceship trying to get into the bigger spaceship oh the drama once hal thinks he has the upper hand dave makes his way back into the spaceship proving mans <UNK> dave proceeds to <UNK> hal hal <UNK> for his life as he slowly fades away which like everything else seems to take forever br br the final act is just as tedious as the first two once again the <UNK> that the apes found appears at the end it comes out of nowhere again then an <UNK> is born in a <UNK> like shield <UNK> the earth from space what is kubrick saying is it about transformation dave to an <UNK> is man <UNK> again is kubrick saying this is the end of man and the start <UNK> whatever that alien looking thing is maybe i'm going crazy trying figure out what this crazy director is trying to say but the more i think about the more the beginning and the ending make sense there are so many questions left unanswered especially for the purpose of the <UNK> if you can make it through the film it should spark some thought br br in the end the film struggles with getting to where it wants go the first act and the third acts are strong but the second act <UNK> around <UNK> in one place for what seems like eternity there is some intriguing stuff in the film that will <UNK> some thought if you give it a chance once the start of the film makes sense the ending works much better even if you still don't what kubrick is trying to say which i don't
<START> this movie deserves the 10 i'm giving it br br but it's not the 10 that you'd give to movies like 'the <UNK> or <UNK> or <UNK> this is the kind of 10 you give to a movie which just makes you laugh over and over again it's the most horribly written and directed movie yet it doesn't fail to entertain it has the most amateur effects yet you enjoy every moment i saw this movie today on tv and i didn't want to move away read the following dialogue to know why br br whole college is standing around who has just <UNK> a rape attempt and the guys who attempted the rape are asking for forgiveness br br bad guy 1 please forgive us br br bad guy 2 yes we won't do it again br br no response from br br akshay come on forgive them br br i don't know br br akshay you are a beautiful woman and even dead men can get <UNK> by you and these are living young males don't blame them br br yeah br br to what if they tried to rape your girlfriend br br i'd break their hands legs and kill them but anyways just forgive them br br akshay yeah if you don't forgive them then it will be as though you are too arrogant about your beauty br br now that is a true masterpiece of a dialogue this movie never fails to entertain mainly because there are so many goofs and unrealistic situations the bad guy can do basically anything he can blow a <UNK> from his mouth or he can get a motorcycle from his <UNK> and just as easily make it disappear again br br every actor takes turns to speak one line from akshay then from then from <UNK> then then it's the main rule followed by the director so that equal screen time is given to each guy and then there's the all powerful <UNK> which can cause even a <UNK> car to go right through you without you being <UNK> all these things make it an enjoyable movie and i can watch it over and over again i think this movie can go into the comedy hall of fame if there is one br br the only problem is that it wasn't trying to be funny
<START> the first opening scene that lasted around five minutes showed the potential of becoming an instant classic with to good acting good film a story that keep the volume up and an in the corner the of screen a spooky did you see that the scarecrow moves br br after the quick set up of history that would come into the present it was like someone else had written and directed the rest of the film the next scene is a basic outline of how the film goes downhill like a runaway truck it looks like the rest was shot in video with crappy porn style actors the set design was a lawyers office with practically nothing on the or anything in the office at all br br i remember only watching crap horror films for a chance of seeing some naked teenage girls back then there weren't victoria's secret <UNK> everywhere and not watching for things that make great horror films of today like acting terror suspense and so on br br it took nearly fifty minutes for the first person to die when it did me and and my friends were so shocked by the worst costume of a monster ever we through our popcorn at the tv screen <UNK>
<START> before hitting international acclaim with the silence of the <UNK> director jonathan <UNK> cut his teeth making quirky comedies this was one of them and like quite a few oscar winning american comedies i could mention it has a fine concept is well paced has great performances a complicated romance but it just simply isn't very funny pfeiffer is mob widow who moves to the city after her husband baldwin is murdered the crime boss who killed him <UNK> takes a fancy to pfeiffer his wife is furious and to <UNK> matters pfeiffer also falls for the cop who is <UNK> her all of this should have been a laugh a minute pfeiffer sporting a <UNK> wig is excellent as the widow as is the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> is good too as the nice cop but the script is simply devoid of one liners wit humour or punch lines of the verbal or physical kind that this kind of film demands the result is it raises smiles at best rather than <UNK> it <UNK> charm but is <UNK> short on humour
<START> totally genius film from the crew not the jackass boys johnny <UNK> chris <UNK> steve o etc are not in this br br film ok so maybe <UNK> not the best actors but its not what you call a serious film but hey there fun and its totally funny to watch who doesn't want to see don <UNK> dressed as a roman emperor br br a total must if you like <UNK> la <UNK> or an amazing soundtrack provided by the almighty him and others check out the extra features on the dvd especially <UNK> br br chinese rap number two seriously hilarious check this film out you wont regret it 10 10
<START> i had no expectations when i started to watch this movie how surprised i was this is a great beautiful twisted movie which will give your mind a good work out it's not simple if you only enjoy police academy style no brains movies this is not for you the cell is a deep complex film with influences from movies like cube silence of the <UNK> and the <UNK> man along with lots of completely new ideas wonderful twisted <UNK> good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films i have seen in a long time be open minded and you will love it
<START> these were two video shot movies that decided were horrible so in a desperate move turned into this one movie perhaps the <UNK> on side helped spark the comedy but for whatever reason this is very funny stuff with an inspired bit with oliver stone doing commentary during the movie lots of cameos lots of use of the lesbian cannibal song add to the fun <UNK> parker ted <UNK> julie strain etc etc br br one of the best of recent releases yes it's all over the place know that going in the production quality or lack of becomes one of the many running jokes go with it and you'll be in for a good time br br the behind the scenes frequently the best things about releases are also above average this time around i really think the anger they felt over these two lousy films helped drive them to well not greatness but drove them to fix this film in a way that's better than either of the films would have been as they were originally planned
<START> on paper this looks a good film michael caine plays a tough and ruthless boxing <UNK> who's son is up for a title the pity is that when the story is transferred from paper to my television screen it loses a certain everything i had hoped we'd be seen <UNK> his definitive role in get carter and as the film progresses it does seem to take on the qualities of a tough gritty revenge thriller but the whole tone of the film jumps around so much you'll be confused as to what genre it's trying to fit in to for example caine who you can't believe in as billy <UNK> simpson he's simply michael caine has a laugh out line as he refers to someone as <UNK> jacques then in a supposedly humorous moment has his henchmen break someone's arm oh how i laughed i mean it's supposed to <UNK> a laugh the way it plays out on screen isn't it but these seems at odds with the way the rest of the film plays out br br obviously director john <UNK> doesn't know what approach to take with scott screenplay <UNK> isn't a bad director and is well regarded for his war films such as the dogs of war and <UNK> hill but he's ill suited to this type of violent drama and one can't help but feel he might have been <UNK> somewhat by a living legend like caine caine does give the impression he's just doing it for the money and the well known faces in supporting roles like <UNK> and are basically just cameos who could be played by anyone
<START> i usually love teen high school genre flicks but this film was really lacking in originality the only premise this film has is four friends cheating their way through high school and the strain it puts on their friendship there's just not enough depth in the story or the characters to keep the viewers attention for the full length of the film the acting isn't all that bad although the actors don't really have much to work with as the dialog is tripe and <UNK> after watching this movie one must wonder how on earth a producer could come across a project like this and think i must make this film no wonder it couldn't get a theatrical release andrew is a hack avoid or burn
<START> wow <UNK> this was a very how to say it different type of movie it calls itself a comedy but it <UNK> really out loud funny at all it was insane if you are willing to accept that 3 people survive a <UNK> of a global scale why not 4 or 5 and why did it suddenly end without anything happening they could have made this much better by simply having another element in the plot such as a <UNK> female for the ugly dude or something <UNK> br br i <UNK> watch it it <UNK> that bad sorta funny at times i guess br br schneider
<START> as long as you go into this movie with the understanding that it's not going to contain any historical fact whatsoever it's not bad br br it's on par with sam <UNK> <UNK> the legendary <UNK> as far as plot acting humour and production values are concerned you'll see the similarities at several points most of the fight scenes are not as good however and the film suffers from that br br jack palance <UNK> the screen as well as ever and at no time do you have the impression he's giving anything less than his level best same for oliver reed the problem is that their strong performances make square <UNK> don less than stellar acting skills seem even more awkward <UNK> bit player was very good as well playing a character much like in the aforementioned <UNK> br br if you enjoyed the low budget swords and <UNK> movies of the early 80s you're probably going to enjoy this show as well it's actually a shame they attached the <UNK> <UNK> name to it it really has nothing to do with life contrary to the expectations of most of the people who will want to watch this movie
<START> stan laurel regarded putting pants on philip as the first l h film the second hundred years was the first <UNK> l h film but this was the one where stan completely <UNK> himself not only to performing he had signed on with the hal roach studios as a director and man' before certain situations among them oliver <UNK> accident with a leg of <UNK> leading to stan having to replace him and the extra money that performing would provide for himself and his new wife lois brought about his historic return to performing as well as writing directing editing and involvement in other areas of production but also realised the fact that he was part of a team that worked well together this therefore is an historic and very important film in the history of comedy br br it is also a surprisingly funny little silent film rather different from what laurel hardy would become known for and from what they are more immediately associated with today the characters of <UNK> ollie do not appear scottish stan laurel plays the nephew of oliver hardy a respectable man about town who is reluctant to be seen with this strange looking fellow with a <UNK> and the habit of chasing pretty girls there are some very funny moments in this well made charming little movie and the performances of these two kings of comedy are spot on watch <UNK> little and smile that says well know when he sees girls or the hair scene at the airport for instance hilarious br br watch this film if you can with backing music from the beau <UNK> orchestra available on the video releases which enhances the 1920s feel and is very very pleasant to listen to it's a brilliant and underrated little film which is why i said it was <UNK> funny
