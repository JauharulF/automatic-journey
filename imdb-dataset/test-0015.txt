<START> right here we go you have probably read in previous reviews on this film that it is awful badly acted avoid at all costs well i suppose in some ways this is true it is fair to say that you couldn't write a spoiler in this comment as there is no plot to spoil however there is a fine line between plain awful and absolutely hilarious and believe me this film is the latter the acting is so bad the plot so non existent and the ending so completely <UNK> it will have you laughing the whole way through there are scenes in this film that take comedy to a new level do not expect an oscar winner but believe me for the small price you will pay for this disaster it is worth every penny
<START> this story takes place in <UNK> i was half <UNK> watching my tape when i heard the name i wasn't sure where it was taking place until i heard them say green bay then i figured it was <UNK> watching further confirmed it br br <UNK> awaiting the outcome i could really feel frustration i did not know it was based on fact until the end it left me glad but sad and wanting to know more
<START> good grief to think i've seen it all danny thomas looks so out of place in this <UNK> he seems really uncomfortable he can't sing worth a <UNK> and when he's paired up with peggy lee peggy lee she easily easily him maybe the director saw this and made him do the really bad comedy routines that he sometimes does in the film peggy lee is okay but the whole thing is a <UNK> good for a laugh maybe
<START> is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production if i remember correctly we had to watch it on a <UNK> station and this meant using a in those days <UNK> not part of regular tv to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious i remember all the sound effects that <UNK> used to talk a great memory from 50 years ago i'll have to see what other memories might be hiding on the web by the way i try to do computer animation thats where the comes into the picture
<START> to quote clark <UNK> in the original christmas vacation worse how could things get any worse take a look around here ellen we're at the <UNK> of hell little did chevy chase know that he was describing the sequel to one of his best films christmas vacation ii sets a new high or maybe it should be low in bad movies my wife bought this dvd thinking it would actually be a sequel to the original but we were severely disappointed this film is lame it bears no resemblance to the original is an absolute waste of film and an embarrassment to the otherwise good actors who had the misfortune to be part of it it must have set a record on imdb for the most bad reviews i really think we have a good case to win a class action <UNK> to recover the money we <UNK> wasted on this movie
<START> it begins with a couple of disgusting sex comedy gags but soon it reveals its true colors it wants to be a death wish clone i say wants to because the script gets so increasingly laughable by the minute that it ends up looking like an <UNK> death wish spoof from a love scene in a room inexplicably filled with <UNK> to heroes who dress up as <UNK> and wave their machine guns because they don't want to attract attention to themselves to bad guys who drive around the city in a black van long after it has been recognized as their vehicle this film has too many ludicrous points to fit in a list the other major problem is that you can't tell most of the characters apart of course you know who <UNK> and <UNK> and even james van <UNK> are but all the other roles could have been played by different actors in various scenes and you wouldn't know the difference 1 2
<START> the filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in <UNK> which includes an <UNK> <UNK> by richard williams bell son of john and lucy bell and younger brother of <UNK> bell titled our family trouble to knowledge this is the only <UNK> account ever penned the filmmaker should be credited for accuracy but there is little to say about the production and acting quality the acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor it appears that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without <UNK> or <UNK> them into a flowing plot or story line if you must know the story read about it its much more gripping and <UNK>
<START> people seem to be expecting citizen kane here the planet is a b monster movie and as such is good fun and different enough to be enjoyed the director clearly has something to offer not so sure about some of the cast as for the effects ain't a lot of effects budget i for one would happily recommend this outing to a sci fi head or anyone who doesn't take monster movies too seriously if so watch blue instead i noticed one review saying it had ripped off alien like alien didn't rip things off the best thing about the film the director the worst thing about the film the cast maybe it's time for the director to move from <UNK> to london and find some talent in the meantime well done at least you're trying to do something
<START> <UNK> arrives in a strange city he doesn't remember where he came from and how he got there he is ordered to arrive at work and gets his own apartment in the city all his co workers are nice and polite to him they say hi and smile when they pass by him but then later on <UNK> discovers that the city isn't that pleasant as it seems going home from work he see some people wearing grey suits cleaning up the bloody mess of a dead body apparently a suicide victim that had thrown himself out of the window the <UNK> is done with a <UNK> mind as if they were <UNK> a <UNK> the following day <UNK> meets the suicide victim fully alive at work more and more <UNK> discovers the atmosphere of the city br br <UNK> might be the best norwegian film i've seen original artistic directing is usually missing in norwegian films with only a few exceptions the plot is also very original and could even be called post modern horror as the film present us a terrifying thought of having to cope with a world that is completely and the more you try to fill your life in this city with a meaning the more meaningless it becomes i am fascinated by how the director manages to create the feeling of a universe a nightmare that you simply cannot escape from not even with death br br go see it its really worth it i gave it 9 out of 10
<START> i have seen this movie twice now on cable the first time i saw it it caught me by <UNK> the <UNK> i was seeing were the guys we followed in the pages of <UNK> magazine back in the late 70's these were the guys we copied and tried to become while <UNK> i am glad that a film was finally made that gives an accurate account of how it all came to be i am almost 40 years old now and i guess a pretty uptight kind of guy with all of life's problems however this film did a great job of taking me back back to the <UNK> <UNK> the backyard and the road <UNK> to <UNK> hill <UNK> i suspect that in order to really understand this movie and appreciate it you had to live it otherwise it probably won't have the impact on you as it did me but for those of you and you know who you are who did live it you know exactly what i am talking about in any event i don't care who you are if you get a chance to see this movie do it i give thanks to the z boys of <UNK> for the memories of my youth and thanks to <UNK> for making this movie job well done
<START> naturally <UNK> is by far the worst show i have ever seen it is such a piece of sh and loaded with complete <UNK> i didn't find any of the gags to be funny or somewhat clever it was all awful jokes br br the acting sucks many of the characters sucked at acting charlotte arnold <UNK> is such a terrible actor the other characters suck too <UNK> rain hal br br the plot isn't unique and creative at all and the show is <UNK> very much predictable this is one of the worst shows made of all time it shouldn't have even been made the idiots who are responsible of writing this garbage should get fired if they already didn't the fist season was actually watchable but the second season was just a disaster its too hard to watch this show it is beyond awful
<START> i saw this film when it was released to theaters it's definitely one to remember i had forgotten the title until recently a friend found it via online search br br one dark night is rather unusual for the suspense horror genre of the time in that it contains no blood it is of the teen fright variety yet the teens are respectable in their own ways it's a nice old school film with props and scenes that reflect the times our hero rides a motorcycle with no brain bucket for example br br as has been mentioned by previous reviewers one dark night is currently available on dvd the original negative was not available for the dvd transition some reel changes are a bit rough but this doesn't take away from the story that being said the colors are vibrant and the lighting is very good br br adam west plays a rather part in this film as son in law his role as an overbearing and indifferent husband is thankfully short br br the story builds over the course of the film unlike many horror films of the era one dark night is a great suspense story that gives the viewer time to <UNK> what is happening br br the final 20 minutes or so of one dark night are what make it so memorable <UNK> abilities are used to open old graves in the <UNK> pull the <UNK> out open them and move the corpses around attention was <UNK> to great detail in the final scenes the rotting worm <UNK> corpses look quite real
<START> <UNK> after the success of <UNK> started work on this film which was a comedy the film was in making for 3 years and released finally in 1994 but didn't work for some reason before this film <UNK> <UNK> released and did well br br the film is a mad comic film like most <UNK> films <UNK> but it is funny and well handled the film has a proper plot unlike today's films and makes you laugh most characters became famous be it crime master <UNK> <UNK> kapoor <UNK> <UNK> and others br br the film keeps you laughing throughout it's run time though being too slapstick and overdone yet it's one of the funniest films br br direction by <UNK> is very good music is good br br amongst actors <UNK> steals the show and delivers his funniest performance this was his first out n out comedy salman does well but looks amateur front of <UNK> yet does a good job and their chemistry is delightful <UNK> is annoying and sounds like a child <UNK> is adequate <UNK> <UNK> is too funny in both roles <UNK> kapoor is hilarious in his over the top act khan dubbed by is very good and <UNK> too is funny rest all are good too
<START> once in a great while i will watch a movie that completely surprises me one that comes out of nowhere to be a bit of rousing entertainment one that is pure fun from beginning to end well folks when a stranger calls is not that movie it is an unbelievable stupid and far fetched remake of the much better 1979 horror camp classic our lead heroine jill is forced to <UNK> after going over her cell phone minutes and is <UNK> by <UNK> calls from a mysterious <UNK> every cliché in the world is used here from the stupid cat jumping out of a hidden spot to the car that won't start to the killer can be anywhere at anytime this movie is bad not even bad in a so bad it's good way more in a so bad it's boring way skip this <UNK> film and save your movie for something else you'll thank me later trust me on this grade d
<START> i have rented this film out about 6 times it is very well directed and the story is unique and grabs your attention from the beginning big up to jason <UNK> whose acting in this film was wicked and i loved the guy with the st fighter moves
<START> i had never seen this movie before it aired on a local cable sci fi network it reminded me of the irwin allen tv series of the late 60's time tunnel etc excellent effects they beat star trek 5 done 20 years later but then that wasn't very hard to accomplish br br i found the script very intriguing and mature for this type of production they would have needed a few touch ups to tie some loose ends on the characters' level but for a kid movie its surprisingly interesting especially the the glimpse at futuristic euro politics surprisingly similar to today's european union br br the plot is indeed reminiscent of twilight zone in general as other users have pointed but in this case it's a compliment br br great sets by the way br br 7 10
<START> it takes an eternity for this typically over simplistic and idiotic stephen king based film to finally get out of the starting <UNK> about half an hour is spent on needless <UNK> to various boring characters and their irrelevant little personal problems that might <UNK> bored <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> dramas but this is supposed to be the horror genre or so i <UNK> thought the <UNK> fails to look all that <UNK> which leonard <UNK> the <UNK> clueless hopeless and always <UNK> film critic would disagree with he considers <UNK> to be genuinely frightening i often do have to wonder if <UNK> is genuinely thick or merely likes to do <UNK> for his hollywood friends it's both illogical and inconsistent the way wallace survives an attack with only a leg injury and naturally her car breaks down just when she needs it to save her life this is one of the oldest horror film clichés trust king to use it to minimum effect the premise is <UNK> too banal even for a horror film a <UNK> <UNK> attacks a family is that it this sort of thing barely <UNK> a 3 minute sub sub plot in your average zombie film i think even <UNK> must have <UNK> that he was starring in a turkey have terrible agents but what i really don't understand is how people can actually throw themselves at the <UNK> book and read it from cover to cover these fans must be immortal that's the only explanation i e why they treat time as such a meaningless <UNK> br br <UNK> 3
<START> i gave this 9 stars out of a possible 10 if it had had just a <UNK> <UNK> bit more plot line i would have given it 10 br br nonetheless it is a highly interesting film br br <UNK> playing a likable old <UNK> should have been given the oscar for her performance br br emily grace portraying alice whom i had never seen before also does an excellent job and has the <UNK> body i think i've ever seen on film br br in a beat to heck old car alice has lit out from the n e for florida where she has a friend or maybe it's her sister i'm not sure and that's my fault not the film's and high hopes of going to college which she and her family can't really afford br br she seems rather vulnerable out there on the road alone and sure enough she encounters some slightly rough looking characters and shortly after that it's discovered there's a hole in one of her <UNK> br br she is at a rest stop at the time and is <UNK> by a woman named sandra and her husband bill an older couple who are traveling in an <UNK> br br they're going south to florida and take her under their wing but is everyone quite the way they're presenting themselves flashbacks and paranoia enter the story as our young heroine learns some new lessons about life
<START> this is my favourite film and i think it is perfect unlike virtually any other film i can name i never watch this film and think it would have been better if they'd changed this or that or whatever is this the definition of a work of art i think so every in <UNK> is perfect and it all flows from the <UNK> script i've always sort of liked paul <UNK> work you can't argue with taxi driver and light sleeper is an amazing film but while his writing often seems to border on the <UNK> his directing style is usually non existent this is deliberate i think because his films usually deal with a search for redemption and are set in the real world ugly and harsh his style suits his themes as he presents his characters in a simple and realistic way and lets them show the audience the truth of the situation imagine if <UNK> had directed taxi driver or bringing out the dead instead of scorsese but like the protagonists of those two films while <UNK> the man was ideal <UNK> material right wing vain and at odds with society his works were subtle and beautiful in fact he had a secondary writing career as a woman's writer <UNK> out what can reasonably be described as romantic <UNK> so you wouldn't necessarily imagine that <UNK> was the ideal man to capture that subtlety and beauty on film i think the film shows that he was the script he helped fashion <UNK> <UNK> the man into three parts his life his death and his mind his life is represented in black and white still camera <UNK> compositions his death for which he will always be best remembered is <UNK> documentary style and his mind is represented by the <UNK> <UNK> from his novels each one revealing the thought <UNK> of this complex man who hardly ever wrote a character that wasn't a reflection of himself these <UNK> are beautiful to look at thanks to <UNK> remarkable production design and <UNK> imaginative staging in all parts the acting is superb especially from ken as <UNK> who captures the essential charm arrogance and <UNK> of the man the photography is excellent throughout and contains images that the viewer will retain forever finally the music is simply superb perfectly matching the images although written and recorded before shooting <UNK> during the <UNK> process and then re recorded how much the music influenced the shoot i do not know but it bonds perfectly to the image i have seen many ideas of what various people think the theme of the film is what <UNK> is trying to say you know the big stuff about life death etc but i do not think the film is saying anything <UNK> has already said it the film simply repeats
<START> one of my absolute favorite childhood films the <UNK> adventure packs incredible fun <UNK> for young and old alike the animation is lively and colorful and the film itself boasts some of the best songs ever put in an animated feature who could forget the dynamic boys girls of rock <UNK> roll the exciting diamond dolls and the <UNK> my mother br br this should be considered a nostalgic classic animated gem from the eighties it's too bad they don't make them like this anymore most animated films today resort to violence crude humor or sentimental <UNK> except of course the folks from pixar br br bottom line an amazing and unforgettable adventure for all ages
<START> when i first heard about greek i figured i would watch it because it sounded ridiculous another of abc family's so bad they're almost good shows but <UNK> in with a friend from college found us both enjoying the pilot episode a lot more than we had expected br br as a member of a greek society i can say that a lot of the stereotypes that are brought up here are ones that come up almost every time someone starts talking about the <UNK> and <UNK> on a campus and are also very fun to play with just on are own let alone to watch on a tv screen the opening scene to an only slightly <UNK> version of preparing for an actual <UNK> rush in some <UNK> and it continued on from there br br this isn't a show for over sensitive <UNK> if you get offended even at jokes about things that aren't so great about greek life then you'll spend the entire first episode and probably many other cringing and yelling but everyone else should have a ton of fun watching it it's nothing new but when it comes to college nothing ever is
<START> gordon scott with his well <UNK> hair <UNK> figure and weird <UNK> english has to be the worst of all the <UNK> as for the other actors in this mess they're on a par with any 4th grade <UNK> school drama class i've seen used car dealers in tv commercials who can act better they make <UNK> moore look like laurence olivier and where does jane the dull eve brent get her <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in the jungle i realize these were made for kids but wow the plot line seemed ok but the director should have required more from his actors i realize even the <UNK> films have a few flaws but this one seemed so low budget
<START> when <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> is released from prison his <UNK> officer has found him a job working at a big city bank when some of the crime underworld from his past learn of his position they plan to exploit it and rob the bank <UNK> is at first horrified because he really wants to go straight but when a twist of fate happens <UNK> begins to think one shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth br br also known as the <UNK> bank caper amongst others this is a hugely enjoyable piece that is quintessential 1970s london and all it's highly dubious fashions are lit up like a christmas tree in ralph thomas and guy <UNK> <UNK> caper if the viewer can accept david niven as an aged crime lord of some it's not easy i can tell you then a <UNK> sang in berkeley square could well surprise you the actors aren't pulling up any trees for sure but it's really not hurting the picture at all it has an honest fun quality that is never less than entertaining the score and soundtrack is perhaps guilty of over during the dramatic criminal moments but it's a minor complaint to leave me thinking this is an under seen british gem br br richard jordan takes the lead role of <UNK> obviously hoping to lure in american viewers 70s heart <UNK> oliver <UNK> a mass of hair is in there to keep the ladies interested whilst the <UNK> get the <UNK> sight of <UNK> <UNK> and her delightful legs for company moving along at a decent enough clip and containing a seriously rewarding finale a <UNK> sang in berkeley square deserves far better than the <UNK> 5 7 rating here on imdb but just how many people have seen it i wonder hmm go on give it a go if you the chance it's good stuff 7 10
<START> the revelation here is <UNK> <UNK> dancing ability though she was known <UNK> to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer miss turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film br br so viewers take notice here mgm were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young <UNK> and were therefore her to everything from andy hardy to doctor br br in two girls on broadway however she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift <UNK> in the lavish production number my wonderful one let's dance this number is conceived and filmed as a sort of hybrid between a busby <UNK> style <UNK> and the sort of routines <UNK> pan was <UNK> for astaire and rogers at rko br br thus the number opens with george murphy and miss turner depicted as bar <UNK> with full chorus before a curtain of black lame <UNK> mr murphy <UNK> the number to miss turner then the camera on a boom pulls <UNK> in a remarkable <UNK> shot to reveal an enormous stage and a <UNK> set <UNK> with steps <UNK> and <UNK> walls br br from this point on murphy and turner <UNK> a fast stepping variety of <UNK> and attitudes including lifts <UNK> soft shoe and ending with an <UNK> series of <UNK> <UNK> that concludes with murphy both <UNK> and <UNK> turner with thrilling speed to a racing orchestra br br all told a <UNK> feat that proves miss turner was fully capable of more than holding her own as a dancer though i <UNK> most of her <UNK> would <UNK> at <UNK> her from her throne as the queen of melodrama
<START> ok i did think that it would be horrible but when i saw it i was <UNK> wrong emily did a superb job as did jason london sue was under used and under written the <UNK> were ok dylan bruno and rachel <UNK> are definitely the stand outs as for the things the teens do and how people claim it's all wrong whatever my friends and i use the term <UNK> a lot and i have driven a car and had someone steer as i changed it's pretty much all there i've just never been at a after game party in a house that big with it's very own light show the deaths are good the best involves a pair of glasses a <UNK> gun and a pool all in that order i must say there will be people who hate it but i'm not one of them
<START> i don't leave imdb comments about films but this this film was bad very bad i fast <UNK> through most of it stopping where i hoped the acting had improved since the last scene only to continue with the fast <UNK> formula plot once the obvious murderers were <UNK> there was only the one left and that was in the first five minutes scene by scene it felt as though i'd already read the script before because there were no surprises no mystery the <UNK> character bad bad acting a true waste of time on dvd and a definite <UNK> go to bed option if it's the only thing on television if you watch this film you will find yourself <UNK> you'll never be able to get back the time you've just wasted
<START> andrew mccarthy played the role of an <UNK> very well i liked the plot of the movie it gave something to think about other than a comedy it had a very twisted mind and a good cop versus god a very well used plot line
<START> i wasn't expecting much out of this movie and i was slapped in the face julie <UNK> rupert and laura <UNK> perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie any teenager can relate to <UNK> control and the urge to come out as who you really are which is basically what this movie is about ben rupert does this when he meets retired actress julie <UNK> and begins to express his ideas with words he slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much less awkward each and every viewer feels the ups and downs of the movie and the theatre is filled with laughter 75 of the time the film <UNK> all and i hope that soon it might be released in all us theatres because many do not have the chance to see the film unless they live in big cities it is a must see
<START> i read the book before seeing the movie and the film is one of the best adaptations out there very true and faithful to the book sean penn and sarandon are amazing robbins is a talented <UNK> and i wish he would add more to his he made the film very haunting and intentionally slow paced to add depth an especially brilliant bit of <UNK> was the reflection of the victims appearing in the glass of the execution room at the very end
<START> this is so overly clichéd you'll want to switch it off after the first 45 minutes the beginning is very interesting with a fair going on and someone gets killed this movie would have been better set on this setting br br so jill johnson is a depressed with boyfriend issues i don't see the point of adding her <UNK> with her boyfriend occurs in any of the events in the story br br since jill has come home late her father sends her to <UNK> for the in their glamorous home in a deserted lake the kids are sleeping and the maid is cleaning another empty house to the side for their son who's at college ok br br after about half an hour of her stalking around the house by herself she gets a couple of hang ups <UNK> scary ones to which her friend comes to the rescue to come up with a couple of high school lines about <UNK> and whatever friend leaves and goes to her car to which then she drops her keys <UNK> then the music she <UNK> to pick them up and gets into her car which of course doesn't start how <UNK> is that so she disappears d jill alone again uh most of this movie is with her by herself so there's not much dialog so more <UNK> she calls the police who say they cant help her but call back if she has any more problems br br so then she suspects that her boyfriend is calling or her boyfriends friends are calling they have been but only once like thats supposed to be scary much oh and did i mention her friend just now comes on <UNK> id and some creepy man voice comes on she gets all freaked out and <UNK> br br yeah so skip that she <UNK> the light in the house of the son go on so she runs through the woods with music as her companion and goes in br br ah its so boring i cant continue
<START> i had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable tv and i can't understand why <UNK> <UNK> arnold as an action hero in this film <UNK> is an ex cia assassin who is <UNK> and given an identity as a <UNK> with a quiet family life in a rural town she continues that life for 8 years with a husband and daughter clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else especially when someone tries to kill her it seems that her former <UNK> have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does she hires samuel l jackson who is a former police officer together they form a pair that is as entertaining as mel gibson danny glover when <UNK> finally <UNK> her memory she <UNK> a transformation into the killing machine she once was with the song she's not there playing in the background what follows is <UNK> and samuel have to go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive all through the rest of the film <UNK> has to decide who she really is the killing <UNK> machine the mother <UNK> with the quiet family life or a combination of both especially since the bad guys grab daughter great action scenes that rank up with any of the die hard movies
<START> i haven't seen <UNK> but i did have the misfortune of seeing kevin <UNK> <UNK> this is worse maybe the absolute worse piece of garbage i have ever seen and if you look at my review for <UNK> <UNK> that is saying something bad plot acting was <UNK> and even wasted even though yes michael keaton has been in some of the worst movies i have ever seen and this movie has no redeeming value to anybody with more than half a brain do not see if you have <UNK> the 4th grade as you will find this an insult to your intelligence
<START> at 2 in a bathroom at an <UNK> <UNK> a student takes their own life and the different worlds of six teenagers are changed forever br br 2 <UNK> is a brutal honest and breathtaking film centered on the pain of being a teenager the film follows one day in the lives of six teenagers all <UNK> all dealing with their own personal dramas while there are a couple of stereotypes in the mix  the beautiful would be popular girl dealing with body issues the over obsessed with his <UNK> there are several horrors that are as far from main stream as you can get including a social <UNK> dealing with a brutal illness and a young girl trying to make sense of a devastating event in her past br br the movie is mixed with documentary style interviews from the characters which some viewers may find a little out of place in the otherwise <UNK> narrative the pace is also a little slow but it fits with the feel of the movie the young australian actors are all stars in their own right in particular <UNK> <UNK> who's heartbreaking performance earned her an <UNK> nomination br br the film is very well shot with terrific direction some scenes are a little hard to watch  in particular the five minute long suicide scene but overall it is a film that leaves a big impact on its' viewers it draws you in right from it's shocking opening scene and keeps you guessing as to which of the six main characters is going to be the one to end up in the bathroom ultimately it's a beautiful made but slightly disturbing look at teenage life
<START> i'm starting to wonder after reading some of the opinions here if i watched the same film as the other reviewers but after checking my facts i am forced to the sad conclusion that i have br br this witless <UNK> screwball comedy has to be one of the the longest <UNK> minutes i have spent and one of the most unfunny things i have seen for ages now don't get me wrong i love screwball comedies but this boring set bound drivel falls so far short of the <UNK> heights of preston <UNK> and <UNK> that it doesn't deserve to mix my <UNK> to be thought of in the same breath as those <UNK> writer director charles <UNK> dialogue is neither witty subtle or interesting and there's so much of it he doesn't know how to end a scene either with some ruthless cutting especially of people <UNK> rooms and saying goodbye to each other the pace of film would have been lifted and then the fact that the limited number of characters are doing stupid and <UNK> things for no other reason than this is supposed to be a comedy would have been a little less obvious characters in this movie fall in and out of love with each other and move in and out of apartments at a <UNK> notice only to move what little plot there is forward one moment people are desperately yearning for one person the next they are getting married to someone else having <UNK> and been <UNK> off screen so we know nothing about it until one of the characters tells us oh they're getting married usually after someone has made a faux <UNK> or jumped to the wrong conclusion if we had known that these two characters were in love or supposed to be engaged before hand we the audience might have enjoyed the experience of watching someone making a fool of themselves in front of them as it is the characters just come over looking like selfish <UNK> idiots and we have no sympathy for any of them br br the sets are limited and the action confined to them in a way that makes the whole thing look like a badly filmed stage play the only moments of relief from the tedium are <UNK> <UNK> who looks like he has <UNK> in from a different movie and has decided to hang around and be slightly funnier than all the unfunny stuff going on around him br br highly <UNK>
<START> my reasoning behind viewing this film despite the fact that it was free was more or less out of curiosity slight slight curiosity i wasn't all that familiar with this straight to video <UNK> account of mr <UNK> and discovered during the opening credits that it featured horror icon kane <UNK> in the starring role my emotions turned from not just curiosity but now a <UNK> of mild anticipation as to how his portrayal of <UNK> would turn out also in the credits among some grim photos of <UNK> crimes was michael <UNK> and <UNK> okay i thought to myself this may be mildly amusing as the movie started and progressed slowly my <UNK> confidence or as i call it <UNK> hope for this movie faded entirely and i was stuck with an overwhelming feeling of <UNK> as i died a little inside from watching this dung heap <UNK> who is widely known and respected for his past work as an <UNK> serial killer <UNK> puts that into play here turning eddie <UNK> from a mild mannered <UNK> to a <UNK> full blown killing machine he <UNK> by night killing cemetery <UNK> his grave robbing buddy and teenage girls leaving in a panic as the local <UNK> department seems to do nothing to <UNK> the dangerous situation in the least the deputy and his mom have a warm little relationship that gave me a fuzzy feeling inside or that could have just been the <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> halfway through this turkey i'm not sure what the point of this movie was and obviously the director knew nothing about the subject he was working with there is already such an abundance of films <UNK> to story that unless the ed <UNK> snuff footage is discovered i don't want to see anymore of these on the shelves if you want a more authentic film of this nature than check out <UNK> ed <UNK> aka in the light of the moon
<START> my friend made me sit down and watch this film this is out there material god the devil heaven hell and a restaurant thrown in for good measure br br four guys and a <UNK> who dies when and how is that's the story you'll never guess the ending for this one a <UNK> realized little gem of aussie cinema hats of to the team that made this one br br 10 out of 10
<START> this film also known as don't look in the basement is actually not bad it is a little known film even to die hard horror fans but i found this movie pretty entertaining don't get me wrong it's certainly not without its problems but do think more people should give it a look the story of a hot nurse going to work in a <UNK> is certainly an appealing one to me i thought the acting which seemed forced at first somehow got better as the film went along it seems like the actors really got into their roles there are some good colorful characters including a guy who thinks he's still a soldier one who thinks he's a judge an adult with a child's brain and an attractive girl who <UNK> attention so bad she drops her clothes when any man gets near her the title don't look in the basement has about as much relevance to the story as the last house on the left has on that film if you like movies with creepy characters in a mental ward like i do check this out
<START> this dvd usually sells for around 20 i wouldn't pay this much for the dvd if i had known what i was getting but regardless this is a pretty good disc it displays the <UNK> in all their glory with footage from their <UNK> playing <UNK> wait and bleed and <UNK> among other tracks including the spit it out music video which was apparently banned from mtv br br <UNK> for those who don't know is essentially a <UNK> of the damned nine masked men who display total chaos on stage with machine gun drums <UNK> guitar and <UNK> that will tear your face off and leave you wanting more for those who've never seen <UNK> before i cannot recommend enough you get this dvd probably off ebay or amazon so you can get a better deal br br a short though well made show of the <UNK> br br seven out of ten
<START> this movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title the movie was cool despite the fact i hate new ones all of the cast was awesome it has great cast and an awesome plot the main plot is a man is <UNK> and he has to solve his own murder neat eh dennis quaid is the man who is d o a in other words dead on arrival he finds help with his friends but everyone is now a suspect character has several hours to find out who <UNK> him the movie is quite fast and full of action you can see two other big stars in meg ryan city of angels courage under fire and daniel stern home alone very bad things in supporting roles in this awesome cool remake of a classic movie
<START> russian actress <UNK> reminds me so much of the young audrey hepburn and the camera in the <UNK> are flying seems to love her just as much she is the <UNK> point of a bittersweet war romance against the background of world war ii in <UNK> br br the film is almost poetic in its gorgeous b w cinematography which was the main reason for watching the film in the first place since i had never heard of it and decided to give it a try when it aired on tcm br br it's a very moving love story about a girl's deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away by his role as a soldier <UNK> in wartime russia she's unable to forget the memory of her romantic <UNK> to him but inexplicably marries someone else who has forced himself on her a <UNK> who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier she hopes to hear from their marriage is a troubled one because she can't let go of her <UNK> of a happier time with her soldier sweetheart br br by the end of the story she accepts the idea that he's never going to return and is able to face reality and cope with the situation there's a very poignant final scene at a train station where arriving soldiers are <UNK> their loved ones and the <UNK> girl shares the joy of the returning soldiers by giving some flowers from her <UNK> to the <UNK> families br br the stylish and striking camera work is what carries the film as well as the honestly played story br br <UNK> done but perhaps the english subtitles didn't tell the whole tale because some of the plot elements seemed a bit <UNK> to me as if they had been <UNK> over br br <UNK> up easy to see why it won awards at the cannes film festival reminded me in style of another great russian film <UNK> of a soldier
<START> see i really wanted to enjoy this movie there were moments when my heart beat faster when the hair on my neck began to stand up when my <UNK> began to <UNK> but just like a strip <UNK> i was left with no real action no resolution and money missing from my <UNK> br br and <UNK> <UNK> apparently don't know the correct recipe for making a horror movie and as such <UNK> the old amateur <UNK> method of throwing everything into the pot br br this movie is really the shining <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> all rolled into one amazing i know but true all the <UNK> are there you can taste each of them they just don't mix well i'm not gonna go down the list of every thing wrong with this movie in short good cinematography mediocre acting worse dialogue br br the real problem with stealing from so many movie plots and combining them into one movie aside from the resulting confusion is while you can have several plots running at one time you can't have several endings and what does do when he runs into this problem just like a <UNK> in english 101 you end your story with <UNK> the little car <UNK> into the darkness and the end <UNK> spooky not really and very <UNK> the ending left me confused and disappointed almost empty br br take your 10 go rent the shining <UNK> and <UNK> scare the pants off yourself have a great time and forget that the darkness ever existed br br
<START> superb editing outstanding acting especially by and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack this film reaches back to the 40's to comment on the racial lifestyle differences and some effect of <UNK> while it weaves the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady br br the actor portraying the young <UNK> howard character does a wonderful job <UNK> the life and times of his upbringing in the small <UNK> new york town the audience laughed cried and <UNK> in applause for the film and its director br br soon to be shown on hbo <UNK> 7 i believe fire up the <UNK> and enjoy a great story
<START> i was looking forward to this movie i like road trip thrillers i like sex drugs youth action and a great sound track and i was especially interested in taking the movie trip across europe to see if i recognized any of my own travel spots br br from the first scene however this movie was unwatchable what was guy doing driving on the wrong side of the road what could possibly have blown up the van that rolled <UNK> down a shallow <UNK> if they're such bad drivers why would they take a delivery job and that's just the first scene not even bad enough to be campy or silly just horrible horrible horrible waste of time move on to something anything else
<START> 2005 the final part of toronto based indian film director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> trilogy has been finally completed almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element 1996 which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel <UNK> 1998 <UNK> made her directorial debut with a 24 minute canadian short film <UNK> 99 a portrait of louise <UNK> 1975 but it was her canadian feature film about the life of indians living in canada that brought her fame back in east her country by <UNK> 1991 recognition <UNK> came in the way of 1994 starring bridget fonda along with the actress who in 1990 won an oscar in best actress in a leading role category at the age of 80 <UNK> the way for middle aged actresses to still have hope for her portrayal of a stubborn old jewish woman in <UNK> miss <UNK> 1989 late jessica <UNK> br br dealt with a friendship between two women from two other ends of the human <UNK> a may december friendship was last picture she died the very same year br br international fame followed <UNK> <UNK> in 1996 with the release of the controversial which spread with rage among the false patriotic consciousness existing indian <UNK> having already explored friendship between two women in in <UNK> went a step further to portray a more intimate relationship between two lonely neglected women set in modern day india the <UNK> of the capital city of new <UNK> it shows two brothers and their wives the elder brother <UNK> <UNK> having joined a weird <UNK> <UNK> leads a life of <UNK> faithful to his guru of <UNK> existence the younger brother <UNK> is having an extra marital affair with a chinese woman alice thus both the wives <UNK> <UNK> playing the elder brothers wife and <UNK> <UNK> the younger wife find themselves neglected in their own way one forced to lead a <UNK> life thanks to her husband's <UNK> and the other whose only interaction with her husband is through sex and nothing more living in a world of in laws and being the only two <UNK> in the family having nobody else to <UNK> in the two women fall in the arms of each other thus comes the issue of <UNK> if there were an outside man's shoulder to cry on there most probably would have been chance for them to fall into the arms of a man but having no one else to <UNK> in their need for each others support is quite obvious it does not necessarily state that all neglected women would end up taking <UNK> it just happened to exist with regard to the two women in this context all in all the movie is excellent and <UNK> far deeper than just two women rolling in bed the key focus isn't <UNK> in the movie but the plight of modern day neglected indian wives even in the capital city the two female characters just happen to have a sexual relationship br br two years later <UNK> <UNK> second installment was the element of mother earth released in india by the name of <UNK> yet another excellent movie by a great director this time in the hindi language unlike which was made in the english language br br now <UNK> <UNK> has managed to complete the trilogy despite a lot of problems having released the final installment recently no doubt it would be just as great as the other two
<START> this show is great not only is a very well written anime show it also reflects things like philosophy science fiction and a little religion it's hilarious at some points and cute for lack of a better term at others actually this may be effect to my lack of experience with japanese anime shows but it is one of the best of its genre i have seen br br i mainly have to give credit to the writers i haven't seen such brilliant <UNK> of imagination in a television show since the original star trek i hope the writers continue to add strange new characters and give more insight on the already great characters that have been added br br 9 10
<START> possible minor spoiler br br it's not a terribly objective review but i just found this movie horribly depressing like a lot of russell t <UNK> br br work it asks more questions than it can answer his best work bob rose doctor who <UNK> in hope against the odds and <UNK> even after apparent defeat these uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here i suppose the fact that i'm still thinking about it days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program but the resolution was just too bleak for my tastes br br i would however disagree with the reviews i've read complaining that the end feels tacked on i think each conclusion follows <UNK> from its premise and the ending represented a sound personal belief that neatly resolved the primary theme of the show while i never really <UNK> the progression of events i felt like there was much that could have been expanded upon i've also read that it was originally conceived as a four part series instead of two and it's possible that the has done some harm to the completed piece however these flaws appear throughout in sequences and themes that sometimes feel rough or <UNK> in br br to his credit davies is totally <UNK> to write big and you have to admire the sheer <UNK> and scope of this project the premise he <UNK> here is the stuff of movies or novels  it is a brave and ambitious thing to tackle it in the medium of television strong points include christopher <UNK> who is positively <UNK> in the lead for me he was and remains the best reason to watch the depiction of the humanity was brilliant thought provoking and engaging and a real credit to both <UNK> writing and <UNK> acting i also thought the depiction of the modern world's reaction to the second coming <UNK> true br br so two stars simply because i personally want my entertainment to be entertaining i would rather be <UNK> or at least distracted by my fiction i have a whole big real world around me  as <UNK> through <UNK> or the <UNK> if i choose to be horribly depressed there are definitely less <UNK> reasons by which to judge this piece but i'm afraid my judgment in this matter is <UNK> by my emotional response
<START> the opening shot of the consequences of love perfectly sets up this intriguing and absorbing film a slowly carries a <UNK> out of focus figure towards the camera <UNK> a huge <UNK> behind him like the central character in the film we know nothing of him and our initial interpretation of him his profession the <UNK> of the <UNK> could be way off the mark br br consequences of love is that kind of film from the title you might expect a <UNK> of a relationship what we have instead is a lead character living life in emotional <UNK> seemingly choosing to cut himself off from those around him if the film can be classified in any way i would call it a mystery as we are engaged in working out who is and what he is about what we know from the start is he is cool composed and <UNK> <UNK> he has lived for the last eight years in a <UNK> looking swiss hotel always paying his room <UNK> on time but seldom showing any interest in the staff or other guests br br his only real companions are a couple who he plays occasional card games with the couple it <UNK> used to own the hotel but have now <UNK> everything away and have only the room they live in left their love of money <UNK> and each other was their <UNK> and seems to identify with their plight he once had it all but now is now living as a virtual prisoner in the hotel his brother a long haired surf <UNK> drops in to see him occasionally but he sees his visits as more of an <UNK> than a pleasure they talk about the person considers to be his best friend even though he hasn't seen him for 25 years this long lost friend is now a <UNK> engineer <UNK> the communication network that brings so many together meanwhile phone calls to his wife and children end quickly when they refuse to speak to him br br <UNK> through the film makes an <UNK> move and begins to open up to a young <UNK> from the hotel with his judgement <UNK> by emotion he sets himself on a course of actions that will ultimately seal his fate for good br br the slow unfolding of fall from grace is and beautifully scripted shot and scored the <UNK> <UNK> soundtrack does much to build up the tension as more and more secrets are revealed the final half hour turning into a taught thriller as lets his mask slip and must once again face the consequences of his actions the ending with a visual nod to is dramatic yet ambiguous and leaves the audience to once more question his motives br br patrick bliss <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> beauty in trouble v is not a great title all the <UNK> of this film fail to capture what it really is  an adult fairy tale a poor girl is <UNK> by a prince the girl played by the stunning anna has an isabelle <UNK> beauty with a red hair face and figure that are <UNK> sexual and endlessly fascinating she has a <UNK> of a husband but they have great sex the kids listen to the <UNK> through walls it's rough and passionate as the sex of the working class seems to often be portrayed in film but it's also for us to recognize that this is the thing that <UNK> them together in an otherwise <UNK> marriage the husband a professional car thief is eventually caught and thrown in jail how she got into this marriage we don't know but she is not exactly a high class herself but she's beautiful intelligent we assume and loves her gorgeous and <UNK> kids she deserves more and she may get the life she deserves eventually no spoiler she is forced to move back with mom after her husband is sent to jail mom has a hideous second husband read ugly <UNK> he is a real horror show he borders on being a child <UNK> to the kids he's obsessive about <UNK> but <UNK> at the table all the while demanding manners and <UNK> from the kids he's real low class socially handicapped <UNK> mom puts up with him like <UNK> husband at least he's <UNK> hideous but horny the <UNK> confusing layered characterizations are what make the film so powerful and interesting these characters have flaws some seemed driven by class some by <UNK> character these flaws and details of character are charming one minute and <UNK> the next the audience really has to <UNK> <UNK> feeling of class sexuality ambition commitment and the role of a woman as mother and wife through the quickly changing <UNK> of the story at the bottom line as with many films like the wonderful <UNK> movie <UNK> than water the children can be the victims what's right in the end may be what's best for the children  who are our salvation and our future it's a theme played out these days in films ranging from <UNK> <UNK> to children of men foreign cinema is <UNK> in intricate morality tales that life is confusing brutal unfair and as adults we must get our act together in order to pass something worthwhile to the next generation if we give in to our <UNK> instincts we may lose ourselves and the world in the process the extraordinary and complex and colorful characters in v speak to the qualities of what makes a man what drives a women what <UNK> hope what is class is it economic status of the fabric of one's character the film is richly human as <UNK> by the very last 2 shots which moved me incredibly and unexpectedly the director's choices are so subtle and intelligent that to compare this to an american film seems unfair americans sometimes seem to lack the desire to consider that <UNK> in human nature don't offer set <UNK> but here <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> fairy tale for adults are interesting moral questions don't be fooled by the simple story this is a great movie
<START> this film tries hard but fails perhaps to non australian audiences it may have appeal as a <UNK> but to the native it is merely tedious br br anyone who lives here knows broken hill is a rough tough isolated mining town if a couple of <UNK> turn up in drag well it's all so predictable where have i come across that well worn theme before oh yes town mouse and country mouse spare us br br i kept hoping it would improve but after the broken hill scene i could see where this was heading and so turned off the tv and went to bed
<START> the story told by the <UNK> are flying is not admittedly all that original young lovers are separated by war bad things happen to both we've seen it many times before br br nonetheless we haven't seen it filmed this well with bold shots that take liberties to emphasize <UNK> or destruction or <UNK> all the more remarkable coming from the soviet union and reason to conclude that <UNK> is not the last word in modern era soviet cinema br br i was reading <UNK> three sisters the other day and <UNK> upon what may be the meaning of the title of this film in act 2 objects to the notion that we must live our lives without meaning or understanding br br surely mankind must believe in something or at least seek for the truth otherwise life is just <UNK> <UNK> to live and not to know why the <UNK> are flying why children are born why there are stars in the sky either you must know why it is you live or everything is trivial mere pointless nonsense br br likewise <UNK> has a hard time believing that the war and her and <UNK> <UNK> have been pointless better to <UNK> a meaning to live as if one's life is significant and not to give in to despair it is perhaps this thinking that <UNK> her to her final act in the film br br btw as a minor <UNK> to one other comment here there may be a pattern of in the film though i hadn't noticed them myself but the first letter of name is not a further instance of this in the <UNK> her name begins with a letter which looks like an english b
<START> there are some great canadian films there are some crappy ones last night i watched one of the crappy ones it wasn't the typical canadian film where it tried to be so different by being arty this film tried to be some type of hollywood gangster movie it was terrible br br from the beginning i had a sense that it would be a bad movie it had some of the <UNK> <UNK> a movie can have there was this voice over for one scene and then it never returned that always bugs me when filmmakers just use voice over when they can't think of another creative way to tell a story br br i know being in the canadian film industry i should support my fellow brothers but this movie is junk the premise is something like a <UNK> episode only not realistic some <UNK> mafia boss dad is on his death bed and orders the son to make the business <UNK> not so original and the workers complain about it but they just take the fact that they will soon be out of jobs like nothing to make it <UNK> they use <UNK> irony but not the good kind then some freak show girl who had an awful elvis wig and <UNK> that covered half of her face <UNK> the main character and kinda rapes him anyways this guy for whatever reason now likes to dress up as girls then this <UNK> <UNK> up with a hooker when he has a beautiful future wife at home but he falls for the hooker because the hooker dresses like a man and puts make up on him she <UNK> him with some photos of him wearing <UNK> and <UNK> yet he still loves her he also has no reason to leave his fiancé but he does in order to be with the hooker br br for a movie about <UNK> crime and sexual fetish there was neither action nor sex it was like a late night <UNK> porn movie without the good stuff the would be sex scenes weren't hot or sexy it was all too amateurish the movie had nothing going for it just the lame plot br br i don't think it was the actor's fault i think they had a terrible script to work with what stuck out the most was the ridiculous characters the bad guy's name was uncle bunny or something but the name wasn't important it was they all were cliché the <UNK> was laughable throughout the movie and fellow movie goers laughed <UNK> at some of the movies serious moments then the worst of it all it had to be the <UNK> ending if you can ever remember playing shoot out as a kid with either imaginary guns or toy guns that was basically the ending of the movie but i was more than happy it ended and i had to warn my fellow <UNK> to not waste time or money watching this film
<START> this totally odd ball feature is a typical and prime example of <UNK> shocking 70's horror the events are thoroughly confusing and it takes up quite a while before you figure out what the hell is going on but the brooding atmosphere sucks you in immediately right from the <UNK> bizarre intro showing a couple of eerie children turning toys into real life war <UNK> you just know this become an <UNK> and gritty shocker <UNK> of satan soon appears to be another installment in the alleged <UNK> creepy little town hiding a dark secret sub genre a young widower traveling with his new <UNK> girlfriend and 8 year old daughter stops in a remote little town to report a car accident they witnessed on a nearby highway the villagers behave very hostile and insist the <UNK> on leaving right away the town clearly <UNK> in an ambiance of fear and panic as local children <UNK> inexplicably <UNK> and unnatural forces maintain everyone within the boundaries of town is in the grip of a satanic cult apparently ruled by the elderly members of the community i really liked <UNK> of satan a lot the story reminded me of a novel written by john <UNK> but i can't remember the title it also dealt with a cult of elderly people <UNK> youthful villagers for their own greedy merits the film mainly relies on creepy scenery like dolls and witchcraft <UNK> but a slightly more involving and coherent screenplay would have been nice the subject matter often raises a lot of issues and questions and director bernard can't always provide us with answers the climax is terrific very seventies meaning shocking and unforgettable beautifully shot film too
<START> a plane carrying a rich <UNK> daughter goes down in thick wilderness he <UNK> a group to go and find her and the others but the rescue party soon suspects that something is stalking them then <UNK> motives for the expedition are revealed and that only adds to the already existing tension br br the movie is a decent idea and a take on the popular sasquatch legend was bound to wind up on film sooner or later however the film's direction breaks a fundamental rule of horror thriller directing and that is showing too much too soon of course the audience knows there is something stalking the characters just read the title but showing what should have been the film's <UNK> that early just ruins most of the suspense and as a direct result much of the fun the film also lacks a good atmosphere and there are almost no landscape shots that show the <UNK> of the wilderness but there are plenty monster point of view shots that add nothing to anything they actually knock off <UNK> quite shamelessly the low budget horror film <UNK> did what this film tries to do much better br br some of the character tensions and a non cliché ending manage to make up for this rise above the crap pile but it is still poor and given the premise and potential very disappointing 4 10 br br rated r for some violence and profanity but it's pretty tame compared to most r rated horror
<START> fatal contact bird <UNK> in america 3 out of 10 this movie is both funny and sad the funny part is fairly obvious as this certainly isn't a sober look at a possible impending crisis this is a modern version of the <UNK> and much like those killer <UNK> and the so called killer <UNK> crisis that <UNK> them bird <UNK> has joined a <UNK> of media inspired end of the world scenarios <UNK> <UNK> global warming that simply refuse to actually come about br br the sad part is the blatant attempt of the filmmakers to inspire panic disease historically were fairly common after all people didn't all die in their forties from heart disease even recent such as aids mirrors the old fashioned <UNK> crisis think <UNK> that used to kill more soldiers than bullets br br the <UNK> <UNK> of the early <UNK> was a nasty business killing millions but honestly life went on i wonder if our over dramatic media and their power hungry government allies would allow life as normal today br br the movie itself <UNK> wildly from fairly competent scenes <UNK> in grand central station to the ridiculous <UNK> try to <UNK> national in manhattan br br the scenarios themselves are fairly useless as the filmmakers can't seem to decide exactly how <UNK> the bird <UNK> is or for that matter whether the <UNK> are an <UNK> style crash or simply a long illness indeed one scene will show everyone in bio <UNK> suits and the next will have nobody even wearing a mask br br the film also <UNK> refuses to actually give any practical advice regarding what to do in a bird <UNK> crisis outside of wash your hands what no <UNK> tape the acting and directing are competent for a tv movie but the script is all over the map last the movie has a strangely non <UNK> death total running on the bottom of the screen just like the <UNK> did
<START> i saw this black and white comedy noir yesterday at the london film festival <UNK> it has been compared to pulp fiction but it is perhaps closer to the structure of <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> mood of kevin smith's <UNK> four stories <UNK> at a french <UNK> diner the first <UNK> has <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a hold up at the diner the waitress <UNK> anna takes pity and tell him her story the second has two incompetent <UNK> leon and paul <UNK> take a teenage girl from her rich family unfortunately for them she is <UNK> and her family don't appear to want her back the third is a dialogue between two <UNK> rock stars who <UNK> into each other at the diner <UNK> and playing themselves the final part is about four ex criminals who <UNK> their old partner out of hospital to visit their old <UNK> which has since been turned into  the diner an returns to <UNK> and <UNK> to complete their story not really an <UNK> more a conclusion br br the structure does not really work the stories are not <UNK> <UNK> as in pulp fiction nor is the diner crucial to the action to at least two of the stories in the way the car crash was crucial in the four stories of <UNK> <UNK> the quality of the individual stories <UNK> the <UNK> story is a cute idea with a couple of good gags but does not come off and the rock star reunion is pointless and dull on the other hand the kidnap story is hilarious although its connection to the diner is <UNK> the most balanced and successful story is the <UNK> and <UNK> one br br this film isn't entirely successful but has moments of interest and hilarity i look forward to seeing more of writer director's samuel work
<START> i like the show but come on writers get some action in it quit dragging it on and on you have a great concept and it could be a whole lot more miles <UNK> is great and performs as a kid that age should act in the situation he finds himself in hey get creative with the creatures they may have <UNK> <UNK> or other out <UNK> powers the kid actors in the series are very good and convincing the parents of miles do appear to be a little too out of sense as to what is going on but develop this come on you have a great seed here and there can be a whole new twist to next season with a lot of new characters and creatures and all kinds of neat sci fi stuff if they could make a series on a witch then you should be able to make one on these creatures and kids
<START> this is a film that everyone who lives in sweden should watch the film shows the political <UNK> who took place in <UNK> in 2001 from a new perspective it features interviews with those who were convicted where those people gets the first chance after the <UNK> to tell their side of the story and why they think the world can be a so much better place to live in and be a part of i react emotionally when i see this since i just feel so mad about how those people were treated both during the <UNK> but also after the <UNK> br br i hope as many as possible gets to see this movie as it really gets your mind thinking is this possible in sweden a democracy in 2001
<START> junior and his dad start a new life in a new town it's the same life because junior hasn't changed one bit he is still the same rotten brat as before only he's gotten bigger this time he has a pal named <UNK> and she is only slightly worse junior doesn't like his dad dating and <UNK> up every opportunity that he has then grandpa moves in and the dog comes along i thought that the two of them would have made it a good movie but they didn't even become buddies until the end this is a movie for the most immature people it has <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> do do and toilet humor in it only someone under the age of twelve would find this to be super hilarious i hope when i have a son he is exactly like junior
<START> i had never heard of before then i saw it on <UNK> disney and instantly loved it i also think that it is not just for kids and that people of all ages would enjoy it it has a great plot great effect and cool characters i will always love the show and i heard it will be coming on on dvd worldwide soon and i'm going to get it i haven't read any of the books but i intend to the show deserves a 10 out of 10 and i hope the books are just as good well that's all i have to say but i still have 2 lines i have to fill up so who do you all think is the coolest character mine is <UNK> and my second favorite is <UNK>
<START> the only good thing about <UNK> is the shadows created in the german <UNK> style of animation and a hint of history this movie bored me it was about a woman <UNK> with her culture who tries everything else and then goes back to her roots here she finds great <UNK> once again and finally leaves for final to let everyone else in her country figure out the situation and what they will do now that she is not there to support them it comes to no conclusion and leaves us with a feeling that this woman has no <UNK> mind you she is torn between cultures and doesn't have enough of a background it seems to figure what is important and real she is listening to ever so many voices and will most likely end up a world citizen of some kind than one with any ties to her native culture of iran the only thing i received from this movie was angst
<START> such pain pain in the shape that it had promise in its central idea but it never fully <UNK> it and goes on to blow a lot sand in your face i wouldn't say this straight to video south african canadian uk horror flick is awful but its just too bland predictable and there's just very little memorable about it it's a guarantee you'll forget it not too long after watching it i tried watching it last night but had to finish it during the morning as i couldn't keep my eyes open even then i couldn't remember where i got up to which left me watching it from the beginning again the only thing that hit a <UNK> was <UNK> sharp cinematography of the vast harsh and eerie desert locations a nice glossy <UNK> creates a striking visual sense which can't save the film from that overall empty feeling everything else is below par and almost comes off grating like the head scratching revelation of the beast huh the computer generated special effects of the ominous monster are tolerable and there are some grisly flashes of stripped flesh and bones but there's too little as there's no hiding the fact that the clichéd script wants to <UNK> on the generic character conflict to build tension and <UNK> that would be fine if the <UNK> script was more than just basic shallow fluff because it never generated any strong lasting suspense but makes it <UNK> on the lead characters are superficial and the token support fall in the <UNK> basket it's your stereotypical bunch scott and <UNK> <UNK> performances are <UNK> and the beautiful rachel shelley tries but looks rather weary
<START> nice way to relax i am <UNK> my <UNK> now so i can go and be with caroline <UNK> phony monsters and scenery make for <UNK> minutes of harmless fun something you can enjoy with your family and not be offended
<START> this movie is a bizarre fantasy tale that i'm sure doesn't appeal to anyone over 10 but is too strange for children the plot is stupid and the acting is some of the worst i've ever seen br br 25 year old kathy ireland plays a teenage girl who acts like a 9 year old she seems to have gotten her character's voice by listening to alvin and the <UNK> her high pitched <UNK> baby voice gets annoying the second she starts talking all of the other acting is bad but really kathy ireland is by far the worst the plot is also terrible and is kind of a mix between alice in wonderland and mad max <UNK> <UNK> ireland gets a letter saying her father who left her a long time ago fell down a <UNK> pit in africa and when she goes to find him she falls into an underground world full of strange australian <UNK> people it's one of the <UNK> movie you'll ever see with terrible lines throughout br br it's annoying the effects this movie uses for character development kathy ireland is a nerd who won't do anything or go anywhere she flies to africa wow what development she drops her glasses and then doesn't need them why does dropping one's glasses represent them not becoming a nerd it should represent her descent into <UNK> it's just stupid the only positive i can think is there are semi good special effects and camera work and the musical score sounds ok br br overall this a ridiculous family fantasy that will only appeal to those who expect nothing from a movie br br my rating 1 2 out of <UNK> mins pg for violence
<START> i really liked two <UNK> one of my friends rented it the other night and we were really impressed with how good it was and how cool the main guys were i wonder if they are thinking of making a sequel because that would be excellent br br two <UNK> rocks
<START> a depressed creepy teenager does many bad things to a socially active older lady who does not like to use shades or <UNK> in her windows he <UNK> <UNK> things from her <UNK> at her does prank calls and plays <UNK> unpleasant tricks on her oddly he keeps none of this a secret from her at first she does not seem to care one way or the other that he is bothering her then later she seems to begin to respect him for his cruel <UNK> activities br br there are some illogical items to note one is that the guy <UNK> into the night through a <UNK> of glass from the more <UNK> lit side in real life such a thing would not happen the more <UNK> lit side of a <UNK> of glass acts as a mirror he would be able to see exactly nothing also everyone out in the night would be able to look inside at him sitting in his well lit room br br one other illogical item is that the creepy teen takes a job as a <UNK> and his one and only <UNK> each morning seems to be the lady he is picking on easy work if you can get it br br i saw a short film about love at a public showing by the end there was not a single open eye in the house a short film about love is the foreign language movie for those who do not like reading subtitles not only are there very few words spoken in the film but much of the movie is silent a certain rest in peace
<START> not a terrible movie but there are monster scenes where you will be rolling on the floor laughing not a good thing for a action thriller the acting is generally pretty decent for a scifi channel movie barry corbin plays a credible us senator and lou diamond phillips again gives us a decent military police sheriff agent <UNK> figure the special effects are well special for example the <UNK> train shots are very obviously a model train br br goofs a meteor strikes a <UNK> car in the opening scene the car bursts into flames but does not <UNK> an inch after the impact the meteor is <UNK> in the top of the <UNK> hood impossible from the low angle that the meteor came in at br br spoilers br br a good portion of the movie's events are predictable from the helicopter crash pull up pull up to the fact that the annoying people get it in the end to the classic blown bridge over a 1000 foot <UNK> awaiting the train to the sequel set up at the end br br the scenes showing the aliens attacking are hilarious they are vicious cute puppets and move at <UNK> speed remember the monty python rabbit spoiler goof in one scene four people shooting clip after clip cannot hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed later in the movie todd bridges <UNK> up a mini flame <UNK> which he uses to <UNK> a number of creatures at close range on several occasions lou diamond phillips is able to easily grab creatures with his bare hands
<START> i also saw this at the cinema in the 80s and have never forgotten it even though i have never seen it again anywhere br br i don't know whether if i did see it now it would seem dated but remembering the storyline and comparing it to some of the terrible modern films i've seen on zone horror i should think it would stand up very well br br i can still remember his coffin <UNK> out and opening up and all the dead bodies becoming <UNK> and the blue lightning having seen hundreds of horror movies and still remembering this one it must be good
<START> i caught this as part of the cartoon noir package at the <UNK> street theater in <UNK> and it was simply brilliant the saving grace of what was an other wise forgettable to just plain bad <UNK> of films br br a perfect use of deep black and pure white with excellent yet simple animation this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon funny charming and touching a small piece of heaven for cat lovers <UNK> and any one else who <UNK> how beautiful simplicity can be if it's in your town see it this one short is worth the price of admission
<START> hi to read the entire plot around oz just look at imdb here to find it br br warning spoilers inside this review oz is the a series that has not only moved me but also shows a small bit of the american prison system but i have to say judging on discovery channels program over jail it is not really realistic br br although i got to say there not shy rapes stabbing happens <UNK> still it is television so for you <UNK> out there that think this is realistic wrong br br there is a good degree of violence in it and some here and there overdone scenes plot over plot over plot that can get pretty boring but remember the series is almost ancient by now so times do change as well i believe i should judge this in the time line as it came out br br as the season prolonged up to season 5 it was pretty good until one of the cons wins a <UNK> ticket of 2 million dollars because he talked to god it struck me as ok this is getting to the point i do not want to see this series no more still i <UNK> and now i just seen the episode 3 of season 6 this is were <UNK> gets his brain <UNK> and then his mom hold him after while he is <UNK> then you see o <UNK> cry as well seeing his <UNK> like that <UNK> brothers as well now thats by far the best scene out of the entire oz series that was real to me still do not read this wrong that i'm trying to crash and burn it it is a really good series and even now <UNK> well worth a watch i give it a 7 because of the storyline that <UNK> with the season but still a golden <UNK>
<START> having grown up on westerns and considering the present <UNK> of westerns on tv and at the theater i was really looking forward to moon br br after watching two nights and not another it appears to be have been shot on a tight budget robert duvall and tommy lee jones level stars are <UNK> absent there is val kilmer but what the heck is going on with him four or five buildings on either side of the street plus the <UNK> mansion make up the entire town of austin the <UNK> is never seen only the inside of the <UNK> office br br the dialog is often times hokey meaningless rambling the plot line disjointed altogether completely forgettable
<START> this film <UNK> the subjects of loss personal struggle and transformation in such a smart <UNK> sensitive and visually stunning way that i was completely transported it is a rare gem of a film in the way it <UNK> beauty and women you'll have to see for yourself <UNK> jane masterfully portrays the subtleties of a remarkable if not somewhat broken personality in a way that every woman will relate to i found the honesty of the emotional interactions among characters to be very refreshing and profoundly engaging there was nothing in this film that said to me low budget as far as quality is concerned nothing the fact that it is a low budget film is a tribute to the film's creators the final sequence during the credits will also knock your <UNK> off it is a brilliant celebration of jane's choice unexpected and inspiring
<START> over the years i've come to be a fan of director writer barry <UNK> and he didn't let me down with this very funny look at politics popular tv comedian tom <UNK> robin williams has <UNK> the nation with his <UNK> jokes about the state of the country and elected politicians responsible night after night he has his fans rolling in the <UNK> then the question is <UNK> that <UNK> run for president himself his manager jack christopher walken says go for it <UNK> <UNK> flames a grass root movement that puts him on the <UNK> comedian to president <UNK> meanwhile a young woman laura <UNK> finds a flaw in the computer system that will count the coast to coast my favorite sequence is <UNK> <UNK> in the coffee shop williams is absolutely hysterical with his rapid <UNK> others of note in the cast jeff goldblum lewis black and rick roberts
<START> man this movies sucked it appeared to have like seven different plots going on at once and they all made little to no sense the special effects costumes and all that stuff were beyond awful the acting was <UNK> bad everything seemed so forced especially the lines from the woman with the huge eyes and the little kid his <UNK> as he gets is so <UNK> it's laughable a good portion of this movie is rather funny anyway the one woman's death where she <UNK> a knife into a <UNK> gets <UNK> and magically turns into the <UNK> <UNK> in the world had my friends and i laughing for a good ten minutes br br bottom line if you're into watching really horrible movies seek this one out if not run for your life
<START> comedy what's so funny about watching an ugly <UNK> alcoholic attending 6 sessions by the time i turned it off of anonymous set off by a <UNK> script of <UNK> and <UNK> and drunken served up with <UNK> of hollywood's religious god will save you redemption drivel another reviewer mentioned the sassy dialogue of tea <UNK> well i managed to watch nearly an hour of this boring film and i still haven't seen any sassy yet in fact my 80 year old grandmother has more amusing <UNK> than <UNK> character in this rubbish tea is more <UNK> faced and shows less emotion than keanu in fact one wonders if she too isn't addicted to something maybe <UNK> her face is so wooden save yourself from being killed with boredom from this film
<START> if this is what's best in the <UNK> cinema at the moment i'd say those big tax <UNK> spent at supporting culture have gone to waste here in a horrible way <UNK> is the worst kind of example of trying to make a <UNK> european film for big audiences i'm sure they wanted it to be all state of the art smart and touching at the same time the result is crap br br to make it short the story is pretentious <UNK> and not credible the same goes for the characters i can imagine them about making a film where everything would like turn to t and people would be hurt and feel you know really bad inside because <UNK> people are so <UNK> depressed too and their self <UNK> is so bad which brings us to the fact that br br the film is loaded with clichés mostly about the <UNK> mentality the way the it deals with people's problems and their causes could be straight out of a regular women's magazine or a cheap bull psychology self help book we feel so bad inside i'm sure they watched some too to find out what it is about his films that people like misunderstood him completely and came up with a boring depressing story about people going through all kinds of s t for no other artistic purpose than perhaps social pornography it's a crying shame they threw in <UNK> here it's just a sign of trying to be smart and of not being br br i think the worst fault however is the complete lack of vision and depth the film is highly unoriginal it is also frustrating to watch endless <UNK> and suffering without any real revelation brought to it i can go through this kind of mind <UNK> if the film is funny or ends up being an elaborate joke or better yet something sublime like in e g von <UNK> breaking the waves there was none these in <UNK> actually though i did start laughing at some point because the turn of events was again just too predictable over the top and incredible br br who does this crap and who likes it i hope they're pretending
<START> mickey rourke who was once a famous movie star plays martin fallon an ira terrorist who accidentally blows up a school bus full of children who is so disgusted by his actions decides to leave the ira and goes on the run in london br br mild spoilers br br the movie's opening is rather disturbing as the lives of little children are ended in a <UNK> things like this happened throughout the 1970s and 1980s and into the 1990s in northern ireland which gives a <UNK> for the dying a stark realism however as soon as fallon decides he's going to give up violence what he's a terrorist and he's never blown up innocent before realism disappears and clichés and ridiculous plot twists take place martin is employed by the london underworld don't they have their own hit men to commit a hit while he wears an ira uniform never knew the wore uniforms at a cemetery in broad daylight wouldn't an ira man use a bomb placed under a car where he's spotted by a priest who <UNK> him while he was in the <UNK> hands up who thinks i'm lying i'm not and we're half way through the running time and there's still several clichés to come br br this all sounds very silly and it is but what do you expect from a novel by jack <UNK> everything is clichéd contrived and stereotypical and the bits that aren't are just plain bizarre the critics slaughtered this movie when it came out most notably they stated that it might have some potential if the movie had bob <UNK> playing gangster jack and alan bates playing the <UNK> soldier turned priest and for once the critics would have been right they should also noted the film might have been less dire if fallon was played by someone who was capable of doing an irish accent rourke might be hunky and macho oh <UNK> another movie with an ira but accents aren't his strong point any more than character acting is to give you an idea how disappointing <UNK> for the dying is the director ended up <UNK> it which is always a bad sign br br as a <UNK> the original release of <UNK> for the dying in britain was <UNK> for several months because of the bombing in november 1987 the <UNK> ira <UNK> a bomb in the centre of where a <UNK> day parade which <UNK> war dead was being held eleven 11 people were killed and scores more injured it wasn't an accident and no one left the ira because of it
<START> the film begins with a 30 minute explanation about the war the human <UNK> battles history and then <UNK> 2 actors into a <UNK> pit they run around this <UNK> pit desert area for about an hour shooting at each other that's it must have cost about <UNK> 00 to make with change avoid br br marks out of ten acting 9 sets 1 costumes 9 direction 50 production 1 titled intro 4 br br i think to improve this film would be to lose the commentary let the watcher decide what's going on remove some of the awful cgi add some <UNK> rave music to it they might just rescue it
<START> i was really disappointed by this movie great actors in it and potentially a great plot but it just seemed to limp along br br <UNK> <UNK> was masterful in her role and beautiful but it seemed like 90 of her on screen work was in car chases done with austin <UNK> product placement gone wrong so very wrong br br the direction seemed off too edward norton is the bad guy and it was so obvious right from the start every time the camera would pass over him it would <UNK> too long and norton would <UNK> or something c'mon hollywood give us a little credit it's okay to surprise us with a plot twist without having to <UNK> it br br sorry but this movie was just below average i have always been one to appreciate the work and talent that goes into a movie but this one just didn't have it
<START> yet again director j lee thompson <UNK> with actor charles bronson for a violent and <UNK> action flick in fact this is probably <UNK> most brutal film quite a feat for a man who appeared in death wish ten to midnight and <UNK> land however brutality doesn't on its own make for a good film and the evil that men do is ultimately a disappointment if you were to take away its brutality the film would have precious little else of interest br br the story is about a retired <UNK> bronson who lives a <UNK> life on a <UNK> island he is <UNK> to come out of retirement to track down and eliminate a sadistic torture doctor who has been <UNK> his vile trade around various south american hell holes throughout the film especially at the beginning we are treated to some graphic torture scenes to show us just what a nasty piece of work he is br br these themes are actually quite serious torture does go on in latin american <UNK> and everyday folk are made to suffer some <UNK> painful experiences simply for <UNK> an <UNK> viewpoint but the evil that men do for all its worthy <UNK> isn't really bothered about the plight of these poor people it is bothered purely with giving charles bronson an excuse to blow away some unpleasant <UNK> <UNK> it's just an exploitative <UNK> which hangs its coat on genuine issues the torture sequences make you the viewer feel like a dirty sick in the head <UNK> rather like someone who <UNK> pleasure from viewing snuff movies the script is full of horrid dialogue including some excessive <UNK> of acts of torture the evil that men do fails to explore its disturbing ideas its serves them up as entertainment and asks us to enjoy them sorry but that's just wrong
<START> i was <UNK> with <UNK> glee when i found out about this movie shortly after seeing spirits within br br after years of anticipation they gave november 2005 release date well november came and went followed by december oh look today's january <UNK> 2006 no us release as of yet br br oh well i'm so glad i had a friend with a <UNK> subtitled copy d br br well the cg was great not as good as expected but near perfect i <UNK> however at the unnatural movements made by the children throughout the movie i had thought that we were passed this by now also i didn't really care for the anime look given to their faces i was under the impression that they were shooting for a realistic look to the film and yet most of the characters have larger than norm eyes especially the girl characters they had personality though i'll give them that br br even though i'm not a big fan of anime i do have to say i was impressed with the wild fight scenes they were animated beautifully and had me hanging onto the edge of my seat br br for about the first two br br and there in lies <UNK> children's biggest flaw it's mostly just a bunch of hyper stylized fight scenes br br a sequel of epic proportions had been promised for years instead they gave us a pretty piece of cg with barely a plot to excuse it's just under two hours running time br br where final fantasy is famous for its intricate stories this movie falls short you don't really get to know the characters the only way you'd have any understanding of most of what occurred in the film would have been if you had played the game we barely got to see them before they were battling it out with whatever current threat br br what hurts the fans even more is the awful cameos that the majority of characters were given they were nothing more than <UNK> i'll call if i need you but i probably won't back up singers and to add to the hurt they had each character <UNK> throw cloud higher and higher this little part here was so cheesy i almost turned it off i would have been much more impressed if he had just simply jumped up all on his own off of walls to get himself up higher br br it hurt even more when they reduced the <UNK> to less than just comic relief that was fine for the game but this is cinema people do not act like cartoon characters in a harsh battle they took away their dignity br br and spoiler yeah right most of you probably already know anyhow who remembers darth <UNK> being hyped up in <UNK> episode 1 yeah now picture that but with that's right he had maybe 5 minutes of screen time maybe that end spoiler p br br if this movie was made for the fans then way to go square if this is any indication of the direction you're taking the <UNK> series i doubt you're going to be seeing much of my money i played your games for the wonderful story and the excellent characters br br you had a chance to make something epic something truly beautiful a masterpiece that flies in the face of all of the disney cg films br br instead you gave us a pretty piece of flesh with hardly anything underneath to hold it together way to go br br and i'm sure if the rest of the fans <UNK> for a moment and tried to just pay attention to everything but the cg they'd know what i'm talking about well i was gonna rate this a 5 10 but after thinking about it while <UNK> this i'm giving it a 3 10 because they could have done better they have done better and this is just sad br br if they're gonna remake anything they need to do this one first
<START> i have to admit before i watched this film i thought this is one of those <UNK> love stories where everything works out fine and dandy all the way through but i was proved wrong when i actually sat down to watch this i found that it was in fact a really good story about a family who go to a dance park for a 3 week holiday and there the youngest daughter baby finds love but has difficulty getting there with her new found love due to <UNK> with her father but along the way helps another dance <UNK> and risks the whole relationship a truly heartwarming film like no other br br 10 10
<START> the true story of a spanish <UNK> who fought for decades for the right to be this film along with the best picture winner of the same year million dollar baby caused a stir that year with their depictions of disabled persons <UNK> death both <UNK> for the disabled and unfortunately for the <UNK> <UNK> conservative pro life groups <UNK> both films and their oscar nominations the nominations also came during the entire terry <UNK> just to put it all in some historical perspective the <UNK> especially from the <UNK> groups against million dollar baby make some sense  the film clearly depicted without <UNK> the life of a as worthless the film's central character maggie fitzgerald becomes a doesn't seem to get any <UNK> whatsoever no help whatsoever and immediately wants to die the film is honestly pretty dumb and the sea inside based on the true story is certainly a lot more thoughtful on the subject it most likely got <UNK> into the same category as million dollar baby without its <UNK> having even seen it an incredibly common phenomenon the film does give time to many different sides of the argument and it immediately declares that the wish to die is that of the protagonist and the protagonist alone it is guilty of a couple of crimes though and i'd still understand why <UNK> groups could have a problem with it first and foremost there's the <UNK> meeting with a bishop i don't look kindly on the way he's depicted his <UNK> <UNK> wheelchair is depicted as absurd and there's almost a comic sequence where his <UNK> boy toy servants are dragging him in his chair up the stairs he can't even reach the room in which <UNK> is located and one of the boy toys is forced to carry the conversation between them i had to think gee maybe if <UNK> lived in a slightly more wheelchair accessible household he wouldn't spend his entire life in bed and might find life more fulfilling who knows how closely the film depicts the reality director <UNK> the others also includes some laughable scenes that try to make this film about suicide more life <UNK> like a cross cut sequence where <UNK> looks thoughtful and his <UNK> baby is born but besides a few ugly moments the film is very good it hurts that someone may want to die when they have the ability to bring so much joy and insight into the lives of others however in the end our lives do belong to us shouldn't we have the right to choose the film's strongest asset is its supporting characters and the actors who play them it depicts how fight and decisions affect those around him with a beautiful <UNK> the family members in particular are great and final departure from them is absolutely heartbreaking and had me in tears my favorite performance in the film comes from lola whom i also felt gave the best or at least certainly most <UNK> performance in <UNK> last year
<START> the main problem with <UNK> company 9 is that it is not sure whether it wants to be saving private ryan or full metal jacket the attempts at spielberg <UNK> are embarrassing such as the sergeant crying in a field of red flowers the training sequences have none of intensity or realism that kubrick gave them in his masterpiece br br a further bone of <UNK> is that the <UNK> fighters are called ghosts because they strike and are hardly ever seen here they attack a russian strong hold almost in <UNK> with no attempt to use cover i am sure tactics have move on since <UNK> br br every scene in this film has been seen before in other war movies and done considerably better br br i have to ask why do all talented need to chew on a match br br finally i am always suspicious of a film that starts with no narration yet needs to qualify the end br br we won no you didn't
<START> the big knife a movie about the dark side of the hollywood motion picture industry is ironically far more like a filmed play than a film itself apart from a few very brief <UNK> scenes all of the action takes place in the living room of the film's hero played by jack palance he's a movie actor who wants out of his contract with his studio because of the lack of redeeming qualities in the films they put out his on again off again wife <UNK> <UNK> is also fed up with the studio not to mention her husband's <UNK> ways unfortunately for them both the head of the studio rod <UNK> is a real bastard he has blackmail material to force the increasingly tortured actor to sign a new contract but it's only a matter of time before he pushes the man too far br br this film is not i repeat not a film noir rather it's an exceptionally theatrical sitting room melodrama the plot proceeds at a <UNK> pace and is so intricate and confusing that it is in violent <UNK> with the static setting and carefully contrived <UNK> of the actual scenes the acting is overwrought in the extreme and <UNK> <UNK> between out and out <UNK> and <UNK> but no less <UNK> <UNK> that are obviously meant to be poignant but come across as pretentious <UNK> especially in the hands of the woefully miscast palance <UNK> was obviously going all out for a stylized something here but i doubt even he knew what it was and certainly the audience never does br br i think the main lesson here is that films and plays are very different <UNK> what might have worked in a play did not come across as even remotely natural or plausible on film the result a big waste of time there's little to enjoy here
<START> i'll say this first the film would've been a 70s sci fi classic if it had been executed a lot better br br that said let's examine the plot it starts with peter graves or is that clarence running for president then cuts to a goofy college campus like full of in goofy <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and retarded <UNK> who all act like they're <UNK> age 8 it then shows one guy apparently going to america having a party then taken to a medical lab where he is drugged wrapped in a plastic bag and then prepared as if the doctors were <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> packs okay actually he's being put on ice so the doctors can <UNK> the organs they need br br it then cuts to another dopey man thinking the place he's living in is a bit strange after a beer can of all plot devices possible he finds in a river makes him look suspicious damn those beer <UNK> he and some equally stupid love interest of his feel they need to get to the bottom of it all so he makes her stay behind as he escapes through what is basically a large college administration building with some evidence he discovers on the way about <UNK> and how he's a part of it br br he escapes his after being shot some and an old reporter guy helps him find his <UNK> the man he was <UNK> from it just so happens he's a clone of the brother of peter graves after debate about what to do with him and his evidence he goes back to the facility to find his girlfriend who has been <UNK> in the meantime to be even more stupid harmless and ready to host a talk show according to the <UNK> crew he is captured and put into cold <UNK> just like his nazi build <UNK> friend from the beginning of the film br br meanwhile a confrontation at <UNK> brothers house results in several deaths including <UNK> the reporter guy and his wife are killed in the middle of an exciting conversation by a bomb it seems the <UNK> have won to some extent br br then peter graves turns out to be able to survive being run through with a metal poker by the miracle of <UNK> parts and giving another for <UNK> speech just as <UNK> confront him about the <UNK> thing br br definitely mst3k fodder but on the low end of the spectrum as far as overall badness goes
<START> i was fortunate enough to catch a midnight screening of this movie tonight i must say i was expecting a horribly cheap movie with bad acting and a mediocre plot i was completely mistaken this movie was not only incredibly entertaining but everything about it i simply loved bruce campbell was as amazing as ever the biggest surprise was none other than ted <UNK> you know <UNK> little brother he played the mad doctor's henchman to the greatest extent somewhere between physical comedy and clever dialogue he did nothing but shine but i really cannot ignore the magic that is bruce campbell though i did think that ted <UNK> stole the show bruce did what he does best on the big screen somewhere between the <UNK> nasty american business man and the tragic victim he displayed the same energy that he has always shown to be incredibly attractive to audiences the movie itself was often interrupted by applause from the viewers the crowd was definitely excited with each little turn that the movie took br br this movie may not be oscar material but my goodness it was amazing i would highly recommend this to any bruce campbell fan also anybody that likes campy sci fi movies do yourself a favor and watch this can't wait till this makes it out to dvd br br take it as you want to br br the fed
<START> no words can describe how awful this film is its like the director literally took a s in a roll of film and sent it out to the viewing public br br the acting in this movie is horrendous the plot is so dumb and the deaths of each character is laughably bad some stupid scenes include akshay kumar pulling a gun out of nowhere to kill a <UNK> yes a <UNK> akshay kumar carrying a <UNK> around the town <UNK> getting beaten up by a poorly animated <UNK> <UNK> and double <UNK> how did they think this was straight also i'd like to point out that the animations are absolutely terrible the scene that supports this statement is when has the <UNK> and somehow <UNK> the glasses the shopping job looks like it was done in <UNK> paint br br the best parts in this movie are with sunny <UNK> this man is so strong that he makes even god feel scared in one scene he literally breaks open a jail door by kicking it chuck <UNK> round house has nothing on that he is even so powerful that he can fly from london to india in a matter of 10 minutes overall this movie is perhaps the most poorly made movie in the universe if you were to watch it watch it for the hilarity that ensues throughout btw this movie is supposed to be serious
<START> this is absolutely beyond question the worst movie i have ever seen it is so bad in fact that i plan on renting it again as soon as i can find it this movie makes <UNK> 9 from outer <UNK> look like an oscar <UNK> just looking at the actors makes me want to laugh out loud i cannot say enough bad things about this movie it's awfulness perfection br br the plot is based on a terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon in san francisco i think that's as far as i can go i am laughing too hard i know it shouldn't be funny but br br move over ed wood br br
<START> i've seen many dustin <UNK> movies like straw dogs or rain man and i liked them but his characters are much to often calm or even shy persons i expected him to be in this movie the same as he was in straw dogs but i saw a totally different person he was much more energetic in this film and kinda reminded me of al pacino in <UNK> the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end i liked the way dustin <UNK> character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son this movie is also revealing personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue
<START> this show is based on the concept that loud obnoxious <UNK> funny the comedic writing is non existent in fact i face serious <UNK> by even comparing it to entertainment of any sort here is the premise two girls accidentally get their <UNK> posted on the internet and hilarity ensues after their initial success they <UNK> the idea that they should make a web cast to showcase their brilliance br br ok so where should i begin let's start with the laugh track the <UNK> used but never successful reminder that we the viewing audience should laugh according to the <UNK> guys this show is the funniest thing on the planet we should all be dropping loads into our pants because of the brilliance of the humor placed before us the laugh track seriously goes every few seconds it quite possibly scooby doo for the king of laugh track over use br br then the in your face shout at the top of our <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of words to seem silly trick is also employed with little to no success <UNK> and let's not forget creating new words to sound funny trick that is web o <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> what the hell br br finally the acting i can't entirely complain here the actors are young and inexperienced but this should and can be <UNK> by good professional help because of the <UNK> nick should be helping the actors define their craft instead in usual nick fashion the actors are placed in front of the camera and told act which for the most part is robotic <UNK> of lines missed timing and overall epic fail br br the lack of anything in this show makes it a disgusting representation of how not to be funny don't waste your time this show is to all of humanity
<START> spoiler meets texas chainsaw massacre if you've seen those don't waste your time with this one typical slasher movie nothing new here except for the spoiler visions which just add fluff to an already weak plot i would recommend this movie if you have absolutely nothing to watch and it's either see this movie or stare at a bare wall for 1 5 <UNK> the only semi interesting part spoiler is when the chick starts drinking in the empty <UNK> office i say it's interesting because at least she made good use of that <UNK> instead of <UNK> using it to start a fire to kill the bad guy although she did go that route towards the end all in all lame bad and not worth effort
<START> in fact everyone responsible for this dreck ought to be whipped dragged and hung if this is what great eugene drama is like i never want to be victim to viewing it ever again there are so many things wrong w this feature where does one begin first elmer <UNK> <UNK> score is present thru out the entire film even in the quiet scenes where background music <UNK> from the character's motivations second these characters are not pleasant people and while some reviewers might enjoy that i personally disliked every scene in which <UNK> ate up the scenery but that was the way his characters was written to be disliked w loren it just never is made clear whether she's good or bad  and all her <UNK> about how she's going to change things back to the way they were before the baby arrives  well i saw what was coming clearly <UNK> is miscast and then he plays the role like a warm up for norman bates which he played two years later even wanting to take blame for the murder at the end hokey third this film is a studio sound stage production and it suffers because of it the story would have <UNK> from location shooting to develop a sense of place regarding the farm which all the main leads are fighting over as it is filmed there's no sense of value to the property because the film has a studio sound stage feel to it that isn't convincing this is a really awful film
<START> i thought anywhere but here was a good movie it stars two wonderful actresses susan sarandon and portman which when i heard they were in a movie together i resist watching it overall it was a pretty enjoyable movie it had it's moments where i felt as if they tried to hard and there was also some really overdone and worn out material but there wasn't anything in the movie that i absolutely hated i even liked how they used the pop up performance of the uncredited <UNK> and all the little happy sad moments are touching and effective if you want to watch this movie go ahead because even though i don't recommend it it's not something you should avoid and a 5 9 rating seems unfair in my opinion
<START> is it just me or the fact that the evil racing team is japanese and that their arrogant star <UNK> is german seem a little over the top maybe that is how it is on the international racing circuit but if all america had representing them are <UNK> like cody and his mechanic chris peter <UNK> who must have been still learning how to act then i would be rooting for another country formula movies can be good but the characters have to be likeable and no one meets that <UNK> in this movie to put it <UNK> a very bad movie
<START> i stumbled upon this movie by accident i mean how else could i find out it wasn't hyped at all by the studios nor did i even hear about it's release from my normally <UNK> in friends after throwing my money away on so many bad movies this year i wish i could've seen this one in theaters as opposed to dvd mike judge is the master of <UNK> deliciously intelligent humor in a low brow package just watch king of the hill for a while it's ostensibly redneck humor but it's a very subtle <UNK> at <UNK> while being very sympathetic at the same time i read the <UNK> for this film and immediately i ordered it off the internet i really don't understand where these negative reviews are coming from except maybe from <UNK> jr this movie is not only hilarious but it's balanced as well moments of <UNK> are interspersed between hilarious sight gags and <UNK> at our current superstar corporate culture sure there is some fart humor but it's only there to laugh at <UNK> the premise is only semi plausible but since when did that even matter i don't see people <UNK> <UNK> upon <UNK> because the premise is very similar just watch this movie if you don't laugh then something is really wrong with you maybe your dad works for or something and he was really offended by the movie maybe you're an idiot probably the latter
<START> mr bean has shaped the face of british tv comedy he has proved that you do not need wicked words or wit a massive budget a great deal of intelligence or even any intelligence to make something brilliant and mr bean is one of those characters who you just can't forget some of these episodes had me in <UNK> yes they're not realistic at all and they're all pretty stupid but to be honest realism is one of the <UNK> bean has broken on its way to greatness <UNK> <UNK> and co always manage to cook up interesting new ideas and hilarious new gags remember when mr bean drove his green mini whilst sitting on a <UNK> on the roof mr bean is one of those things that never gets weak the movie wasn't as good as this but bean has introduced a distinct new sense of humour to the world and kids and adults alike will marvel at its immense fun factor extras and little britain can be damned this is british comedy at its best and most original these <UNK> never get old 10 10
<START> the plot michael <UNK> has done everything in films but direct and is looking for his 1st big chance he discovers molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star he signs her to a contract with the <UNK> that he must direct the producer agrees and their big time careers are under way what follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy and oh yes there's romance and a little sadness too the performances by don <UNK> and alice fay are top notch the music is a real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard lots of dvd extras as well in this restored version released in 2008 it must be <UNK> that this movie is a story 1st not just a tribute to silent films later years would bring similar films such as <UNK> in the rain <UNK> dick van dyke carl <UNK> the comic 1969 what is special about this film though is <UNK> silent movies in 1939 we see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that <UNK> era although some sound effects are included in glorious b w while the rest of the movie is in <UNK> color one of the greatest in the silent era buster keaton who at this point was on an <UNK> climb is used superbly in 2 silent film <UNK> scenes and he is on the top of his game it is said that he had some <UNK> on his scenes as well but the real reason to watch the movie if your a motion picture history fan is that beyond everything else hollywood <UNK> is mack <UNK> film legacy it doesn't take a genius to realize this movie is a positive <UNK> of mack <UNK> and mabel life the character michael <UNK> is mack <UNK> whose real name was michael and molly of course is mabel <UNK> had the pie the bathing <UNK> and <UNK> cops he worked with buster keaton ben <UNK> cameo <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> body double and fell in love with his leading lady not only all that but <UNK> was technical <UNK> for this film and appears in it as well as most film viewers today prefer sound features those who were associated with short subjects and <UNK> are left out to <UNK> as mack <UNK> fell into that category it is fortunate that there is hollywood <UNK> <UNK> was of course very <UNK> in the evolution of comedy in movies his career started in <UNK> as an actor then writer director producer he semi retired in <UNK> with about 500 films to his credit he had worked with the best such as charlie chaplin gloria <UNK> bing crosby w c fields keaton harry <UNK> <UNK> and even roy rogers in way up <UNK> as film comedy is an extremely difficult path to continue for an entire career mack played it wise did only <UNK> work for the next 25 years in 1931 he had receive an academy award in the short subject category and another in <UNK> for a lifetime of work in the 1940's his presence was still felt e g here come the co <UNK> 1945 where a recreation of the <UNK> soup scene used in <UNK> wandering <UNK> <UNK> is done in <UNK> the road to hollywood used some of <UNK> crosby films 2 years later brought some nostalgia with the film down memory lane in which he <UNK> with his knack of always <UNK> with the right people a guest role with the <UNK> popular lawrence <UNK> his radio show came about later in the year 1950 brought a re release of his greatest triumph <UNK> <UNK> romance <UNK> with sound in <UNK> he was <UNK> on tv's this is your life then his autobiography the king of comedy 1954 which is a great companion piece to hollywood <UNK> was published 1955 brought a more <UNK> association with <UNK> <UNK> as he had a cameo in a c meet the <UNK> <UNK> finally in 1957 another tribute with the <UNK> film the golden age of comedy so when you watch hollywood <UNK> it is the legacy of a motion picture <UNK> in the film at the <UNK> scene the camera pans over the guests at a long table as we get to the silver haired mack he alone turns his head to the camera as if to say here i am when he rises to give a speech a short while later he is at his most subdued <UNK> the words given him as if to mentally convey i know my influence on comedy will never end but will people forget mack <UNK> the individual maybe this movie will help
<START> <UNK> like going around in a museum you can appreciate the great talent of the main composer michael <UNK> this fabulous art of light <UNK> <UNK> as i said <UNK> like being in heaven discovering all the creation this man can applied to a single frame imagine when you can look at a moving picture of this artist i can say this film is one of the best
<START> this film is great well written and very entertaining david duchovny shows once again that he is much more than fox <UNK> and the performances by the old men are funny as can be old married folks like me will appreciate the connection between two hearts
<START> this has to be one of the most beautifully morbid films i have ever seen has created a living painting that unfolds with horrific violence sex and a <UNK> retelling of the life of jesus christ the high contrast and thick <UNK> of grain make you question yourself as to what you are really seeing at times but the use of <UNK> combined with the extreme contrast create an incredible viewing experience this film is not for everyone i think you have to keep an open mind and not be so quick to <UNK> this film for its content which if extremely rough but does make a fairly important statement about creation god and humanity whether this film is a work of art or shock value trash is open to discussion
<START> first i am a teenager ok and i have to say this movie was pretty good i think any kid ten and under will like it but people my age an up might be a little um a well we'd describe the movie as lame but i liked it it may be that i still act like a kid or i visit a cattle farm every weekend but this movie was cute i did like how the actors were like kids not little blonde <UNK> <UNK> wearing three layers of clothes a trendy hat and about a thousand like most shows today to name a few drake josh <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> well any kid show and the setting was perfect but there was a flaw the family was in debt right why in the world did their internal house look like something out of a western <UNK> store that was one flaw br br the cameos are great there's about five hundred of them and the only <UNK> one is julia roberts being the main little girl's aunt how in the world did they get everyone else this movie seemed to be on a tight type budget br br i liked this movie it was a fun one to watch and i thought some parts were far fetched like a cow selling for <UNK> 000 ha my butt a cow sells for that much but otherwise it was good i liked it and i could watch it again but i'd never buy it there's not even special features on the dvd what's up with that but do rent it especially if you have little kids running around the house
<START> this is an excruciatingly boring slow moving movie we can feel some sympathy for the socially and sexually inexperienced and awkward but the motivations of <UNK> are pretty hard to see and the ending at least for me was <UNK> br br maybe it's about how we all need love but i'd get more out of a good busby berkeley br br i'm told that comments have to be at least ten lines so i'll add that in the background are some interesting shots of the relationship between polish citizens and government employees and <UNK> i wonder if it's meant to portray this before or after the fall of the communist government br br finally watch for the clever way the men from the gas company investigate whether or not there is a gas <UNK> in <UNK>
<START> first of all the genre of this movie isn't comedy it's more of a drama br br i had low expectations on the movie and still they didn't come up them as some of the other reviews point out there are some nice music in the movie but if you want to listen to good music i suggest spend the time looking at some concert recording with bon <UNK> or <UNK> it'll be more quality time br br last if you want to watch a good movie in this <UNK> genre i recommend almost famous
<START> this is an excellent movie there were several parts to the movie i liked this movie is very funny visit the ernest fun club web site at www com there are several movies such as the following ernest goes to camp ernest saves christmas ernest goes to jail ernest in the army ernest goes to school ernest rides again slam <UNK> ernest etc i highly recommend these for family movies all star jim <UNK> again try visiting www com which is the best ernest movie in my opinion there are actually 2 ernest goes to camp and ernest goes to jail so if you have never seen ernest p its time to go and see him you will find him quite satisfactory no what i mean
<START> first time i ever felt i needed to write a review br br i have seen thousands of movies in my life and i like a wide range of movies i am reasonably opened minded and can easily say i enjoyed a movie while still saying yeah it was not good but i enjoyed it i can appreciate the <UNK> of great movies like the shaw <UNK> redemption the godfather and american history x i can like good movies in a genre like horror or comedy even if the movie might not be that great i can even enjoy a bad movie that just happens to entertain me <UNK> i also will try to rate movie fairly even if i did not like it city lights by charlie <UNK> was not a movie i enjoyed but i can appreciate the acting and story lines for the time br br i think some people when they go on this site instead of randomly click a rating should take a few ideas into account try to rate the movie based on how good it actually was do not let your personal bias affect the rating also look at other moves you rated and compare the movie you are going to rate br br this movie was the worst piece of trash i have ever seen 2 hours of my life where just stolen the acting was awful across the board the scenes where choppy at best however the real disgrace was the story the first 20 minutes we actually had a story that tried to make sense and take the viewer from point a to b however after that it was a nightmare they kept trying to add new elements but nothing was every explained nothing really ever made sense was <UNK> dead is he alive did he hit by lighting was it really lighting was it aliens is he an alien etc the ending tied nothing together and really did not answer any questions the only positive was nobody cared we where just happy to leave the theater br br 6 5 10 what is wrong with some of you i will admit that the 8 of us where so mad about seeing this we did think what would make it better and we decide to tell a few of our friends that this movie was good so they would have to suffer and see this movie what can i say misery loves company that is really the only reason i can see for a 6 5 rating br br do not waste your life
<START> me and a couple of friends went to rent some movies one day we picked one each and one of us picked lets just say that from now on we never let him pick a movie this movie sucks
<START> is it possible to give a 0 out of 10 rating because this one deserves it while i'm not a big fan of jane <UNK> books i sat through this one with two women who are well at least we had a big laugh about how bad this film is robert hardy was the only actor with any charisma in the whole thing though he <UNK> it as he usually does nearly as bad as william shatner but that wasn't enough to save this stinker from total it's often hard to separate the girl's dream sequences from what is really happening and so many holes are left in the story that you can barely figure out what is going on too many loose ends and the ending feels like a tune in again next week climax the lead actress is too <UNK> and weird looking to be a heroine the leading man is too goofy looking and <UNK> to be a convincing hero and the music sounds like some kind of cheap new <UNK> pet project of the director's <UNK> daughter i mean <UNK> mixed in with some kind of spacey operatic female <UNK> so in conclusion i suggest you blow the budget and order a dvd of this one as soon as possible especially if you like disappointment
<START> this is beyond a shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie i have ever seen it's been a long time since i've seen it but the jokes are not funny the plot is painfully <UNK> calling the main characters stupid is to vastly <UNK> their intelligence <UNK> i just wanted to punch tom arnold and make him cry because he wasted two hours of my life when i was done watching this piece of cinematic filth i don't even know why i ever wanted to watch it but remember if you see this movie don't say i didn't warn you br br ps tom <UNK> character sings a song in this movie called i'm my own grandfather <UNK> said
<START> <UNK> lubitsch gave us wonderful films like design for living <UNK> the shop around the corner to be or not to be and other wonderful films but people usually put <UNK> wife as one of <UNK> weakest films br br but i consider this film as an important film this film began the collaboration of charles <UNK> and billy wilder charles <UNK> billy wilder and walter wrote the screenplay for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of course lubitsch worked with writers in the scripting process after that charles <UNK> and billy wilder worked together they together wrote the screenplay for famous films like the lost weekend and sunset <UNK> br br there are lots of funny moments in the film i thought the <UNK> of the <UNK> was very funny there is a famous expression called films are <UNK> of life and here is a great example from <UNK> wife 1938 br br at the first session of the scripting process lubitsch <UNK> this question how do the boy and girl get together billy wilder promptly suggested that the opening scene should be the men's shop of a department store the boy is trying to buy a he but he sleeps only in the tops he is <UNK> so he insists on buying only the tops the clerk says he must buy the pants too it looks like a catastrophe then the girl comes into the shop and buys the pants because she sleeps only in the pants <UNK> lubitsch and charles <UNK> were enchanted it wasn't till months later they discovered that billy wilder himself is a tops only sleeper and that he had been <UNK> the idea for months waiting for a chance to use it br br i got this information from a book i think this film can be considered as the return of <UNK> lubitsch right after this film he made wonderful films like <UNK> the shop around the corner and to be or not to be br br i thought gary <UNK> performance was good i think lubitsch casted gary cooper probably because gary cooper played long fellow deeds who inherited the fortune in frank <UNK> mr deeds goes to town but this is just my opinion br br as for me i highly enjoyed the film i rate this film 9 out of 10 lubitsch films are different because his films are <UNK> of life
<START> i absolutely despise this film i wanted to love it i really wanted to but man oh man they were so off with sara and the father living was pretty cheesy that's straight out of the shirley temple film br br i highly recommend the book it is amazing in the book sara is honorable and decent and she does the right thing because it is right she doesn't have a <UNK> bone in her body br br in the film she is mean spirited and <UNK> she does little things to get back at miss in the book sara is above such things she does stand up to miss she tells the truth and is not <UNK> by her but she does not do the stupid <UNK> things that the sara in the film does br br it's really rather unsettling to me that so many here say they loved the book and they love the movie i can't help but wonder did we read the same book the whole point of the book was personal responsibility behaving with honor and integrity always telling the truth and facing <UNK> with calm and integrity br br sara has a happy ending in the book not the ridiculous survival of her father but the joining with his partner who has been searching for her in the book she is taken in by this new father figure who loves and cares for her and <UNK> and miss is not a <UNK> <UNK> that part of the film really was stupid br br to see all this praise for this wretched film is disturbing to me we are <UNK> a film that <UNK> petty <UNK> behavior with a few <UNK> of the hat to kindness sara in the book was kind to the bone and full of integrity i don't even recognize her in the film she's not in it br br good thing mrs <UNK> isn't alive to see this horrid thing it's ghastly and <UNK> to bear the title of her book
<START> we see a man move from city to out back and change dramatically his family asks questions but he goes mad br br strange brilliant film for screening here in israel wonderful locations great actors a film which <UNK> as a thriller but which is more a case study of madness in the lead man br br the film was way above the other films screened as part of the festival here in israel best of luck to the team who arrived at this film it's a grand <UNK> a little masterpiece of noir br br my only criticism which <UNK> a 10 is that the sound and the music is <UNK> at times it tends to get in the way of the images which speak for themselves
<START> my favourite movie of all time this was a flawed piece of work by coppola and seeing the documentary <UNK> of made it even more compelling coppola at this point was king of hollywood after making 'the <UNK> and and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like <UNK> <UNK> through sheer arrogance he went to the <UNK> with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there just as captain <UNK> thought he would know what to do once he got to <UNK> compound and just like <UNK> he didn't know what he was going to do once he got there this is such a masterpiece of american cinema beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story what i like most about <UNK> <UNK> is that it offers no answers or conclusions consequently because of this open it <UNK> some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious br br this movie defies some call it a war movie which it isn't at all really it is more of a personal study of man the best <UNK> about vietnam is in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the vietnam war go there first for answers br br coppola should be <UNK> for his take on the <UNK> of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with gen corman and lucas harrison ford and the <UNK> review the sheer <UNK> of makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a hollywood classic br br it is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone very challenging to watch but rewarding as well i could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless this movie is intended for interpretation and <UNK> as opposed to immediate <UNK> br br a little <UNK> definitely if your a first time viewer of apocalypse now watch the original version first the version is i think more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a <UNK> and version of the movie
<START> great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years great production design appealing stars great lines miss <UNK> i don't care if you beat it out on a native drum says joan <UNK> amanda <UNK> to hope lange when lange <UNK> asks how she is expected to read a <UNK> a large amount of <UNK> in a very short time if you've seen this movie <UNK> and <UNK> on tv and not in the <UNK> version on pay tv or <UNK> american movie classics you haven't really seen it hopefully this guilty pleasure of a film will be made available soon on dvd in a <UNK> version and with it's original 4 track <UNK> soundtrack great opening title sequence that really catches the mood of 1959 new york while johnny <UNK> sings the best of everything theme song in an echo chamber surrounded by a chorus of <UNK> and another chorus of background <UNK> insanity office romance bitchy cold hearted bosses <UNK> love it's all here to enjoy
<START> this is pure crap and probably the worst biblical theme film ever absolutely inaccurate i mean they've put and before the great <UNK> they've described lot as a friend of <UNK> although he lived after <UNK> to make things worse later lot became a pirate and attacks <UNK> <UNK> during the <UNK> and what's with the <UNK> who comes along on a boat which is moved over the water with a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> alcohol for a food and water and then <UNK> is portrayed as alcoholic mockery and continuous one after another and it goes on and on and on film maker and all participants surely <UNK> themselves the front row in hell with this garbage br br please stay off this crap because you will save yourself nearly three hours of your life
<START> in a better civilization this and many other of the david <UNK> movies would be released in theaters the plots are fabulous no i'd no clue who had done it but the clues were all there if i'd been more imaginative the best kind of mystery the production values astounding the acting from edward fox sarah miles <UNK> anthony <UNK> <UNK> and of course david <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> simply perfect the dialogue wonderful the music and <UNK> of suspense and tension just wonderful stuff br br one of the pleasures of these <UNK> <UNK> movies for a man is how many beautiful women star in them here were have two the sexy <UNK> <UNK> and the stunning <UNK> anthony br br you really can't go wrong renting these they're just wonderful like the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine your mind constantly working because it's all there and you struggle but by keeping your mind constantly thinking can keep up with everything and the settings gorgeous br br i can't think of movies that <UNK> thought more than these <UNK> <UNK> david <UNK> movies it's impossible to over praise them and i had never seen one before a few months ago nor read an agatha christie
<START> i enjoyed this film which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex love hate relations along with interspersed action scenes and some lighthearted moments in which the mountain men counter harsh army discipline all the main characters are well cast true john wayne or robert mitchum could probably have done the starring role just as well but victor mature certainly comes across as a <UNK> <UNK> tarzan of sorts reminds me of his film role as <UNK> another difficult but not impossible man to tame br br the mountain men in the opening scene are certainly an <UNK> as the era of pure <UNK> mountain men pretty much ended 20 years before with the collapse of western <UNK> <UNK> as well as the fashion market for <UNK> <UNK> this story supposedly takes place in <UNK> just before the end of the civil war judging by the <UNK> in the background of the opening scene probably <UNK> the fictional <UNK> was located somewhere in a remote section of the as we never see any other civilians however there is plenty of <UNK> evidence that it actually takes place in the mountains of <UNK> or montana red cloud the war chief who threatens the and soldiers in the <UNK> is the <UNK> of a very famous <UNK> war chief who led a very successful campaign in <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> the newly built army <UNK> in <UNK> and montana <UNK> <UNK> eastern <UNK> is mentioned as being not too far removed from the fictional <UNK> the <UNK> tribe of is mentioning as joining red cloud this aspect of the story then bears a general resemblance to historical fact br br it may be of interest to note certain <UNK> between the plot of this story and that of john ford's <UNK> <UNK> in both cases we have a <UNK> commander who was recently assigned to his first frontier post with native american problems he <UNK> the military <UNK> of his <UNK> regarding them as little more than cannon fodder to promote his career in both films he pays <UNK> for his <UNK> in dealing with the enemy also in common the <UNK> commander <UNK> a <UNK> who has long experience with the local native americans and wants to tell him what is wise to do and not to do in both films we have a budding romantic between a woman very close to the heart and a <UNK> which the commander does everything to clearly the commander must be eliminated to allow these romances to proceed to <UNK> br br i also see certain <UNK> with the <UNK> the soldiers as a whole including the commander are <UNK> of a sort as one of them admits mostly they have problems or are raw <UNK> with no experience fighting native americans the wife apparently is the only woman in or anywhere near this <UNK> thus is <UNK> a <UNK> with a husband who is very uncertain of his future in the army the in turn are also <UNK> not really wanting to accept army or <UNK> discipline yet cut off from their previous free spirit lives by the recent army generated <UNK> by red cloud br br finally we can also compare this story with anthony <UNK> later film the far country starring jimmy stewart in stewart's case he can choose to return to being a loner cowboy at the end but <UNK> character doesn't come up with an <UNK> new way of being his own boss red cloud has made life outside of the army in this region too dangerous to contemplate besides he has an obsession with the wife
<START> this is one of those films that looks so dated that being that way is part of the fun you see and hear things you would never see or hear on the silver screen today some of that is good some it too corny for words some of it bad depending on your <UNK> on certain cultural issues br br for instance in this short <UNK> minutes 1931 film you have br br the grandpa of the family that is featured in this story <UNK> the value of <UNK> and why one should speak up against criminals for the good of the united states picture that in today's films br br a district attorney walter huston almost begging for death penalty sentences and the <UNK> shown as supporting it 100 percent once again picture that in modern day movies br br along the way you have some shocking violence such as a young boy being picked up a few times and literally thrown head first into a closet and his father being picked up and <UNK> repeatedly head first into a wall this is a tough stuff to say the least br br yet the film is <UNK> with comedy mostly by the patriotic grandpa <UNK> played by charles <UNK> sales there are a bunch of laughs for all those who view this unique crime film and for soft touches there are the two young boys one of whom <UNK> moore went on to become a pretty famous child actor in his day here he is just a little <UNK> of about 5 years of age who understandably is far from being a polished actor but you can see stardom for him on the horizon in fact he did just that the following year with a solid performance in blonde <UNK> starring marlene <UNK> br br anyway this is an entertaining film because of an effective mixture of violence comedy and sentimentality and it has a nice feel good ending and a thought provoking message it was up for an academy award too for best writing original story i am sorry to say it is only available for viewing on cable tv as it has never been put out on vhs or dvd and that's a shame
<START> mario from europe is the only user who has posted a comment so far and covers the major points to the film yet again another difficult film to purchase in the uk i had to go through midnight video who have a swedish branch i went to the post office and bought by mail order this and a similar title at only a title br br this film goes under many a k <UNK> depending on when and where it is <UNK> i had previously purchased the <UNK> leads the dance which you will find if you search on imdb under people and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the actor who plays the count on his private island in the latter film had his words dubbed from italian into english by an actor with an <UNK> <UNK> and rather tired sounding voice i <UNK> when i heard this same voice dubbing on the english soundtrack as the police inspector who is investigating the murder of the prostitute killed in the in the subject film my choice of course was to see another outing by the delicious <UNK> <UNK> br br there are quite a few rather <UNK> sub plots in the movie involving blackmail <UNK> sleazy affairs with mothers a <UNK> cycle chase resulting in a <UNK> hit a by a <UNK> motorcycle friends sleazy photography cross dressing by <UNK> etc which give a <UNK> to this film <UNK> in a word sleaze but artistic sleaze the aforementioned <UNK> liked this film but the <UNK> rating suggests other imdb fans did not albeit without explaining their <UNK> and personally i thought there were too many subplots and not enough put into the main story and the relationship of these <UNK> characters to the central plot and the development of their screen characters also a professional film editor was sorely needed as some of the scenes appeared to last far too long having made their point so that the film appeared to drag in places e g the scene of the dancing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> appears in one <UNK> scene with a client but this too is but a <UNK> and i was left wanting more from her the director and the screenplay br br i love the political <UNK> shown in older films this is 30 years from its making e g smoking in <UNK> and the way some characters react to each other in the office i would suggest 4 10 as a more realistic rating and i have awarded it as such
<START> i had high hopes for this film when i saw the listing and decided to watch it on tv <UNK> by commercial breaks i've liked lee van <UNK> in many movies but i'm afraid that having the other characters call him chris repeatedly doesn't turn him into even a reasonable <UNK> of <UNK> chris br br i found this movie to be a complete disappointment the music sound track tried to <UNK> the <UNK> portrayed in the original but it too failed to bring the film up the the standard of the original the rich <UNK> of the characters in the original were mostly missing from this film i guess if you haven't seen the original it would be okay too many clichés and too little depth to the characters i missed the humanity and compassion and the three dimensional characters of the original
<START> i saw the trailers of this movie and found the cinematography and what was presented interesting i saw the imdb rating and 6 8 confirmed it to be an above average movie thus went to see it br br the story is about mandy lane <UNK> heard  a beautiful girl in high school who is a subject of male sexual desire <UNK> friend michael welch <UNK> to another fellow student to show his love for mandy leaves the fellow student drunk and jump down to death nine months pass and mandy is invited for a summer weekend to a secluded ranch by her teenager friends  three girls and three boys go there there is a security guard <UNK> <UNK> who works at the ranch during the first night itself the killings take place  one by one the members of the group are killed who is behind the killings i wont tell here to spoil did i like the movie no after usual interesting opening  the movie takes a <UNK> turn with every unfolding of event by half time when the killer is revealed one <UNK> all interest in the remaining proceedings there is a last twist in the tale to shock viewers but rather it made me shake the head in <UNK> belief and laugh all this for suspense <UNK> heard acts and plays her role well as a shy and conscious girl  who is aware of her beauty and men's desire for her the remaining cast are usual  nothing to say about there are so many movies made of teenager boys and girls going to a secluded place and slowly someone killing them one by one  that it does not interest me anymore br br director jonathan <UNK> tries hard to make the movie interesting by using contemporary chat talks of teenagers loaded with sexual overtones but does not allow the movie to rise above the mundane br br the only and the most appealing saving grace of the movie is its cinematography by darren  who captures beautiful picture perfect images stars 3 out of 10
<START> <UNK> juliet <UNK> <UNK> edition br br william shakespeare's play romeo juliet has been interpreted hundreds of times on stage and in films sometimes literally following the original text which is at times vague in stage directions sometimes in new interpretations where directors chose to show their own view on the piece some are good many are mediocre lloyd <UNK> film certainly stands out as one of the most original modern versions of the <UNK> creation it may be placed in a modern day <UNK> new york and full of the modern day anti social behavior body <UNK> <UNK> and kinky sex which for the more than casual reader shakespeare himself wasn't <UNK> away from but at the same time it stays incredibly close to the overall feel and point of what the play is all about which is quite an effort kaufman wrote the script with his co director on the film james <UNK> who is now famous for writing two successful scooby doo movies doing the impossible by making a perfect remake of an already perfect film with his script for dawn of the dead and directing one of the best horror films of the year <UNK> lloyd innovative directorial view alongside with james <UNK> original and <UNK> writing make for an interpretation of shakespeare's play that maybe not everyone will get immediately but will certainly be recognized by a truly unique and highly important view on a classic play with a script that is written entirely in <UNK> <UNK> appearances of and an outrageous <UNK> soundtrack watching <UNK> juliet is something no one will ever forget apart from it's historical significance <UNK> juliet is a treasure for film lovers of all kind not only for the script by james <UNK> now a good influence on hollywood while working from the inside but also because it features an early part of legendary actress debbie <UNK> well known by everyone familiar with films that are made on lower budgets the <UNK> <UNK> edition on dvd adds to all that by including so many as yet <UNK> gems that not only all the information one could wish for about the film itself and the experience of making it is presented in ways that make it impossible to turn off the dvd but also a very honest and disturbing look is given into the ways independent cinema has to <UNK> these days in many ways the <UNK> on the disc are an <UNK> addition to the already impressive amount given on <UNK> film school make your own damn movie historical items from the troma <UNK> which include james <UNK> debbie <UNK> and all other <UNK> to this masterpiece are included and the film itself is apart from looking better then ever accompanied by no less than four audio <UNK> each and everyone informative excruciatingly funny and all done for serious addition to the film instead of the boring and nonsensical <UNK> that are so common these days there are new <UNK> one with kaufman and <UNK> together but also the one james <UNK> did for the original release of the dvd but couldn't be included there for some of honesty he displays about some other people is present on this disc with fan <UNK> of a few of the scenes from the film a video diary of lloyd <UNK> visit to the set of james <UNK> <UNK> and a visit the two brought together to eli <UNK> hostel birthday party and much more this is the ultimate set everyone must own weather you are a film <UNK> someone interested in interpretations of the great <UNK> work a fan of great cinema a fighter for independent cinema a fan of james <UNK> interested in learning more on making films on a low budget a fan of lloyd kaufman or whatever this is the most important dvd release of this millennium
<START> as a fan of <UNK> i always loved this movie i seen it when it first came out and finally i bought it on dvd from brazil it was never released in the us on dvd i like the film but like everything else in this world everyone has their opinion love it or hate it no matter what a movie does someone will always say why didn't they do it another way in other words you cant please everyone if you love <UNK> you will love this film to me its so unique thats its not cheesy or silly like a lot of lower budget movies this film always kept me interested i can see a few scenes that <UNK> borrowed from here but tell me what movies don't do that a lot of films use other ideas from other movies and sometimes change them around fun film
<START> s l o w l o n g d u l l br br oh my god dull br br characters so annoying you'll cringe every time you see or the guy that played from now on they must have never <UNK> or reviewed the film in progress mel gibson was absolutely wooden br br this may not be the worst movie ever made but that it went almost straight to video says it is darn close br br
<START> i say ben johnson and my fellow <UNK> say ben johnson he was a <UNK> movie star guys a cowboy and by 1976 he was <UNK> by playing a sheriff in stupid made for tv disaster movies such as this <UNK> in on the deadly <UNK> of killer <UNK> that everyone apparently thought were coming to get us at the time so there's these <UNK> and they kill some people by flying in their mouth and going after them underwater eventually these idiots find the <UNK> and die and this woman is trapped in her car by the entire <UNK> the cops are like what do we do uh <UNK> die when it's cold so where could we make it cold i know the stadium in new orleans so they drive this car and its attendant <UNK> of killer <UNK> on and on through the streets of new orleans with a <UNK> saying get off the streets or you will be <UNK> to death and the future home of <UNK> of thousands of <UNK> victims with its broken <UNK> so becomes the <UNK> doom of this particular <UNK> i don't know which is the greater <UNK> on this great city well i do but this one sucks too most appropriately viewed on an extremely faded to orange <UNK> print although <UNK> is a good alternative
<START> this if the first movie i've given a 10 to in years if there was ever a movie that needed word of mouth to promote this is it a 4 <UNK> box is a disgrace people don't know what it's about if you have any appreciation for the blues or just a good use of excellent music that alone is reason to go see it how many people knew jackson could sing and damn fine too you hear books and movies <UNK> that they're about salvation after seeing this you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word yes it's gritty sexy down home truth bizarre and in your face real isn't that the best reason to see a movie those that get my meaning won't stay away from seeing this another week
<START> when i first saw the premiere episode of <UNK> i had no idea what to expect i was immensely impressed and satisfied with premiere subsequent re watches however have made numerous flaws apparent to me that i missed initially premiere is not a great <UNK> episode but it deserves credit for successfully and <UNK> setting up the plot and giving the basic back stories to many of the regular characters br br the episode begins with john <UNK> ben <UNK> an astronaut and scientist preparing to launch into space in the <UNK> <UNK> a small space ship <UNK> by <UNK> and his friend <UNK> <UNK> has a revealing conversation with his father jack <UNK> and then begins his test flight in space of course everything goes wrong and <UNK> is shot through a <UNK> and winds up in a distant part of the galaxy br br after <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is pulled on board a living space ship from here the characters and story line for the <UNK> series are introduced in an entertaining albeit rushed manner br br the regular characters are properly introduced during the first half of the episode of course there is <UNK> played well by ben <UNK> he offers a the audience a sympathetic character to identify with he's lost and has no idea how to do much of anything in premiere <UNK> has to choose between joining the prisoners or the <UNK> he knows nothing at all about either side but in helping a captured pilot it becomes clear that he <UNK> to help the <UNK> he probably would not have ended up <UNK> with the prisoners if it hadn't been for a captain <UNK> <UNK> to be the murderer of his brother this puts <UNK> in an interesting situation he's stuck with bizarre violent escaped prisoners in a far off galaxy about which he knows nothing at all <UNK> total lack of knowledge of the world makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during first season br br the supporting cast is just as compelling there's a blue and former prisoner she's peaceful and reasonable as opposed to fellow prisoner <UNK> a powerful and hard headed warrior virginia hey is totally covered in blue makeup allowing her character of to appear cool and convincing mega makeup in contrast is below par he looks kind of silly with his giant <UNK> and strange nose and there is something peculiar about his eyes they look as if they have had some sort of <UNK> reaction to his makeup <UNK> would give some <UNK> to his makeup in season 1 but the overall costume would for me at least remain as a problem until season 2 br br the puppet digital characters of and pilot are to put it simply excellent is a tiny who <UNK> around on some sort of in premiere he is given some good dialogue but not much else pilot nearly steals the show as the <UNK> between the living ship and passengers even in the first episode pilot gives off the appearance of being a real living alien he never once in the show seems to be a giant expensive machine br br the characters introduced are quite interesting as well the <UNK> are made up of a race called who look just like humans the chief antagonist is introduced in premiere as <UNK> who believes that <UNK> killed his brother in reality brother's death was merely an accident resulting from an accidental <UNK> with <UNK> ship sun a pilot who <UNK> helps escape tries to explain that the death was an accident but just claims that she is <UNK> and refused to change his mind obsession for revenge <UNK> or not it should be clear to that <UNK> isn't responsible is mysterious in premiere but would be explained later in the season herself provides an extremely interesting character by being forced to leave the <UNK> she changes her whole way of life and is in that regard in a similar though less severe situation as <UNK> br br the actual episode as mentioned earlier feels somewhat rushed and clunky so much happens that not enough time is spent on anything also for now looks kind of silly running around in his mediocre costume trying to appear menacing still premiere is solid entertainment the special effects such as in the sequences are impressive most of the costumes and the sets on board are original despite its flaws premiere is a must see for <UNK> fans 3 4
<START> i admit to being in awe of the sea and have spent a number of years in the navy so i am somewhat biased on this one i missed this documentary when it first came out but various people to buy me it on dvd this christmas 2002 and i got it some of the film is amazing and i have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries to see 200 ton blue <UNK> through the sea is an incredible sight they looked like <UNK> i like the level of information and facts conveyed through the narration it is just right i don't want to know a load of science just some of the <UNK> to see these things is enough for most people the bbc has a knack of putting things at the right level for the intended audience br br a really great documentary up there with 'the world at war <UNK> me the dvd is of excellent quality if i had a minor criticism it would be some of the obviously added sound effects here and there i think they detract from some of the scenes but well done to the bbc and discovery
<START> well i thought the movie was blah 1 10 br br anyways the best part is the first 5 minutes of the film with the <UNK> or whatever girlfriend this is the part u guys watch out for tho she had big <UNK> i thought is that really a random actor heck no it wasn't it was actually a model by the name of <UNK> but u already knew that br br so that made sense but that was about it rest of the film that i saw anyway didn't care 4 and didn't bother watching the rest of it that's br br all i needed to c to be satisfied so 2 those of u that just care for that well there u go enjoy
<START> i was disappointed with the sequel to the <UNK> princess i can see what they were trying to do with the story show how married life was going for <UNK> and derek but the story wasn't interesting enough to hold my attention and it seemed to cover the same <UNK> as the original br br it isn't funny the only bit i found humorous was when jean bob was turned into a prince and then back into a frog and no one saw it happen and he was trying to convince them that it really did br br the villain is rubbish and the animation isn't as impressive as the first film br br the queen is a very irritating character and instead of cheering with derek to rescue his mother you're hoping that the villain puts a spell on her voice box to stop her talking br br it is a shame because i really liked the first movie but it didn't live up to my expectations
<START> it has been a long time since i have been to a movie as lame and boring as this one it is one thing to have a slow pace where characters are being developed in a <UNK> way or some aspect of the movie clearly is enhanced by such pacing such as <UNK> in translation however there is a difference between slow progression and outright <UNK> as happened in this one i guess from the look on helen <UNK> face she must have been <UNK> by the disappearance of her husband surprise surprise what a <UNK> creative moment the meeting of the mistress and wife was sarcasm and what a great way that the whole story fell apart at the end truly a masterpiece
<START> we found this movie nearly impossible to watch with such a super cast it's a shame that the writing and direction were so awful the excruciating pace at which the story was told was <UNK> the flash backs were clumsy the characters were one dimensional the heavy handed <UNK> the river the cat were repeated way too often br br the movie <UNK> fool based on another novel by russo was infinitely better probably because it was more tightly written and directed br br the photography in empire falls was lovely too bad it wasn't a <UNK> br br i read the novel and enjoyed the writing style but had some <UNK> with the novel itself i would give the novel 4 out of 5 stars perhaps the screenwriters and director were so <UNK> by the <UNK> reputation they felt they had to include every darn thing in their movie this was supposed to be a television movie guys not books on tape
<START> the eighties produced a lot of gory little horror flicks most of them within the slasher sub genre thus putting this film ahead of most of the rest of its <UNK> night of the demons is something of a cross between the ultimate gore film the evil dead and haunted house <UNK> slash flick hell night films like this usually feature a deranged <UNK> madman as the lead bad guy but here we have <UNK> demons which is always more interesting than a lunatic if you ask me there's also a lot of comedy in this film and the first third of the movie could easily be the set up for a straight comedy film but once the characters enter the central location a sinister funeral home known as <UNK> the film <UNK> into the horror film that you would expect given the title the plot line is as simple as you'd expect it to be and we follow a bunch of kids that decide to put on a halloween party inside said funeral home this turns out to be a bad idea however once it <UNK> that the house is possessed and the demons start to inhabit the kids' bodies their only salvation lies on the other side of the underground stream but finding the gate to the grounds isn't as easy as it sounds br br the film's <UNK> is the gothic mansion where the action takes place this <UNK> old house makes for a great horror film location the fact that it used to be a funeral home only adds to this director kevin <UNK> shoots the house well and a particularly good job is done of establishing the fact that the house is in the middle of nowhere and escape is difficult the comedy towards the start of the film is generally very funny and i was hoping it would keep up the laughs once the horror starts the film does have its comedy moments when the kids enter <UNK> house but it's never overly funny and it's obvious that horror is the film's main aim not that this is a problem but the night of the demons could have been a lot better had it <UNK> these elements properly the characters are pretty much what you'd expect from this sort of film but the acting suits the movie well and it's clear that the young cast had a good time making this movie and it <UNK> well to the screen the effects are good in that they suit the film well and as most of the death sequences are well executed it's a good bet that most people won't get bored watching this this isn't a classic or must see film but i can highly recommend it as it offers a good time and will appeal to fans of silly horror fodder
<START> i remember seeing this film when i was 13 years old and i fell in love with it and i was a big fan of the film and the characters i <UNK> my favorite character was <UNK> <UNK> because she made me laugh when she showed no interest in fred cameron <UNK> who really liked her and i was hoping that in the end that they would get together then her boring boyfriend <UNK> christopher murray because he ignored her and hung out with his friends i love the cast and the story i always love the part when fred try to get together with <UNK> and i always remember when he chased her around the car but it was so good i'll always remember <UNK> that in my teen years now that i am 33 years old and i picked up my copy on dvd and will look forward seeing it
<START> i've never been a big larry clark fan but somehow i've been dragged to almost every single one of his movies now i like independent films and i grew up very much into punk rock and i'd like to say that this film is disappointing to both audiences not every punk song <UNK> <UNK> into its as they do in this particular film br br but the real problem with this film is that it switches <UNK> every fifteen minutes or so and lacks any kind of <UNK> clark has made his living pretending that his <UNK> stories are how kids really are and as such you'll allow him ten minute scenes of stupid dialog that go nowhere because that's the cinema <UNK> feel he's going for however when he shoots a ridiculous death scene pick any of them save for the opening drive by the over stylized attempts at what i assume is intended to be black humor are completely out of context ridiculously shot in most cases far worse than a student film and absolutely ludicrous in terms of the story john <UNK> and date movie make poor <UNK> as the <UNK> into the latter style take you out of any kind of reality to remind you that you're watching a movie a really really bad one at that
<START> first of all i <UNK> if i was supposed to use my imagination in this film or the director was trying to save money or low on budget here we go br br basically there were so many years and gaps that i don't understand its like the movie was jumping from 9 years to 20 years to 30 and so much gaps that makes you ask questions how the hell did this happen and why i think this is a big flow forget the reviews who keeps whining about the history this movie doesn't have only history facts issues but also has so many flaws so most of the people keep saying watch this in cinema you will lose all cinematography like rivers <UNK> etc thats true they are beautiful thats why i waited for <UNK> release ok beautiful scenes but whats the point of that i turned off the movie after 1 hour and half i just lost interest the movie kept on doing the exact same things jumping in years at least mr director put for example after 2 years after 10 years i mean i couldn't watch the movie i lost understanding of whats going on anyways i wish i could include spoilers but when u decide to watch this movie just ask yourself how did this happen you will know what i mean don't watch this movie its a waste of time
<START> honestly this is one of the best horror movies i have ever seen i was captivated by the story <UNK> of captain <UNK> and on the edge of my seat for the whole ride i do not really understand all the negative reviews br br the set up has already been discussed in depth captain <UNK> is an on line predator who sets up <UNK> with teenagers <UNK> them and introduces them to his favorite <UNK> of body <UNK> and <UNK> dee <UNK> is captain <UNK> and he is one of the scariest <UNK> ever created maybe the scariest because he is so human and you get the sense especially if you are into body <UNK> at all that there are really people like this in the world br br but the biggest reason i liked this movie and the reason it is so horrific is that captain <UNK> becomes the hero at the beginning of the movie the roles are clear cut the victims are innocent the cop is the good guy and <UNK> is pure evil by the second act however things have changed a little you want <UNK> to be evil but it turns out that he is really just a victim of <UNK> and maybe the good and the bad are not obvious it is terrifying to find yourself cheering for the bad guy br br a couple people have mentioned that should have been broken into two separate movies to be sure there are definitely two separate acts but this movie works so well because the two acts are back to back the first act is the typical psycho thriller but the second act is the most disturbing because of the viewers reaction to the situation i do not think it would have worked quite the same if the second act were expanded and turned into a sequel br br as a big horror movie fan i highly recommend this film it is the first horror movie ever to give me nightmares
<START> i'm all about the walking dead but my mind is still unsure of the walking frozen dead sadly the chilling didn't help me make up my mind this is really slow with nothing happening for the first 45 minutes making me hit the film <UNK> button several times by the time the well designed zombies show up it is too late and the director two are <UNK> to have filmed this has no idea how to shoot them <UNK> blair and <UNK> all look tired embarrassed recovering in some fashion i will give the film credit as it <UNK> the <UNK> ending with villains being frozen by <UNK> the <UNK> show dvd offers an extended <UNK> reel from back in the day that runs 8 minutes long and i would actually recommend that over watching the flick in its entirety
<START> very disappointing <UNK> chapter of this slowly dying series very evident that the budget was extremely low this movie was made for one reason and one reason alone to sell puppet master toys fans such as myself of the series have decided from what i have read and heard that the only one in the series worse than this is curse of the <UNK> in turn turning us away from the series br br <UNK> to make this a pg 13 film for whatever reason did not work in the films favor the plot seemed almost to be there but was easily lost in the steady stream of nonsense br br the only film in the series worth watching also directed by <UNK> is part 3 <UNK> revenge br br granted i do favor the scenery in the film br br <UNK>
<START> this review is based on the <UNK> cut br br <UNK> <UNK> was a major disappointment at the box office way back in <UNK> personally i've always loved it and am proud to have it in my collection but because of it's failure and also because of rights issues it would be 6 years before we would see another installment the film had the <UNK> of being one of the best if not the best in the series a hardcore fan writing the script the return of not only donald <UNK> as dr <UNK> and george <UNK> as michael myers but also the return of the character of tommy doyle from the first film a major studio backing the project and a fall release all made the film sound like a hit in the making so what went wrong i'll give you two good reasons re shoots and poor editing due to a bad test screening and also the unfortunate passing of donald <UNK> the film was changed and not for the better the film like parts iii and 5 <UNK> at the box office and earned negative reviews from both critics and most series fans but then thanks to the magic of <UNK> the original cut <UNK> out and many fans including my self were very happy i will end this portion of my review by saying this this film is so far at least my favorite <UNK> film and i'm not afraid to admit that br br pros the score is simply <UNK> has some of the best writing and dialogue of the series <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the original in that it was more about suspense and mood instead of blood and guts and 6 is the same way great performances especially from the late and very missed donald <UNK> moves at a breathtaking pace an interesting explanation for michael's evil and why he won't die some brutal kills some pretty chilling moments my favorite being the one involving kim character a lot of really cool <UNK> to the previous films some good surprises like the previous two sequels this one has an awesome cliffhanger ending br br cons though the explanation for michael's evil is fascinating it does make him a little less scary since when can michael move around from place to place so fast br br final thoughts this was the first <UNK> that i saw in the theatre i was so excited because i really had thought 5 would be the last and then i heard this was happening i enjoyed it at the time but over time i saw it for what it really was a great movie trapped in an ok one with a terrible ending why did the filmmakers have to listen to the people at the test <UNK> if they had released this superior version it may have done much better and the series might not be stuck in the mess it's in right now br br my rating 5 5
<START> this movie is bad br br this movie is really bad br br this movie is might as well be half a minute long and shown 200 times in a row because you'd get the same effect br br the phone rings man a answers the phone and gets annoyed by man b man a <UNK> off man b and then hangs up the phone repeat br br this is the entire movie br br do not watch this movie trust me
<START> to view the <UNK> biography the city story i claim is to enter fields where u s filmmakers have seldom <UNK> director phil got his directorial assignment on the <UNK> tv mega hit series largely on the basis of kansas city <UNK> and this film and it has become one of the most admired and most <UNK> movies ever made the <UNK> feat for us filmmakers seems to be the hero centered <UNK> anti crime film or tv series i remind the viewer how <UNK> <UNK> hundred 's and <UNK> and <UNK> 's and even the ' producers had to work to produce anything but episodes devoted largely to the activities of criminals rather than those of their <UNK> opponents this powerful <UNK> and very gritty movie has a style all its own and its lesson seems to be attention to detail about the opponents and victims of criminal <UNK> as well as their gang members there is a twelve minute <UNK> to the film in which reporter roberts interviews the real participants from the <UNK> city's who had <UNK> against its corrupt vice gangs the problem grew out of the presence of <UNK> <UNK> across the river and the nearly century long existence of vice <UNK> in the area the film details the return of john <UNK> from germany where he has been a <UNK> his father defeated for attorney general of <UNK> refuses to join his pursuit of the <UNK> street despite several <UNK> including a beating of his son <UNK> by <UNK> on his <UNK> there are several well developed characters including <UNK> who works in one of the <UNK> and her honest boyfriend the leader of the <UNK> the and john's wife ed gage the <UNK> and <UNK> ward an honest black man <UNK> for his opposition to them the cinematography by harry <UNK> and the art direction by stanley <UNK> are in b w and are very much like news film adding to the film's realistic power music by harry contributes to the film effectively writer daniel and <UNK> <UNK> produced a swift paced and straightforward story that <UNK> into parts part one illustrates the empire from inside one of their <UNK> showing the fate of a victim who is beaten and then picked up by police in the pay of the mob in part two albert <UNK> refuses to <UNK> the leader of the mob the intelligent <UNK> <UNK> in part three young <UNK> returns and after several incidents including his having to beat up the head <UNK> to avenge his own beating decides to run his father for attorney general of the state his wife is horrified and the mob kills <UNK> <UNK> daughter and <UNK> the body at house with a warning his children will be next a few more such incidents including the loss of a trial in which the prove the <UNK> killed a friend of theirs who had found the car <UNK> in the murder of the little girl and watch the <UNK> <UNK> the death accidental convince <UNK> to run and he wins the <UNK> nomination despite the tactics and is promptly <UNK> john <UNK> stops a vigilante crowd from starting open <UNK> with the <UNK> street mob and uses their voices to call the capital and demand martial law for city the <UNK> are closed and equipment <UNK> but not before the girl inside is murdered by the <UNK> and <UNK> has to be stopped by <UNK> ward from killing <UNK> instead of delivering him to the law the <UNK> ending is upbeat but the for the town is less <UNK> than painted the mob in fact tried to come back then moved to <UNK> in this well acted classic of anti crime film making richard <UNK> is young but very strong as <UNK> playing it without an accent john <UNK> as his father is very good while edward andrews as boss <UNK> is award caliber others in the cast include kathryn grant as the girl inside <UNK> jean carson and kathy <UNK> as the women john as their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as the young victim james <UNK> as <UNK> ward <UNK> peterson as john's wife and some good character actors as <UNK> and mob bosses it is i suggest hard to say enough good things about the realism and lack of <UNK> in this film it is certainly one of phil best directorial efforts also did the scarface mob later did walking tall as well a <UNK> and inspiring look at the ease with which <UNK> citizens of a public interest democracy can <UNK> to <UNK> and how a few honest men can teach them the need to fight for their rights
<START> this one surprised me br br i read a few reviews beforehand that called it a good b grade movie and was prepared for the worst halfway through it i suddenly realised i was completely wrapped up in it and enjoying it a lot there were some really tense moments that had you sitting forward <UNK> <UNK> with the remote control or any other object in reach overall this movie definitely doesn't deserve the b grade tag br br credit must be given to director gary <UNK> and writers bill todd king for their movie debut i hope these guys continue with bigger budgets and some studio backing
<START> worst pile of drivel to date everyone involved with this production should be ashamed of themselves not one single element of the movie was anything slightly like an original idea a first <UNK> telling you a story about <UNK> time is more entertaining
<START> well the hero and the terror is slightly below average in my opinion yes chuck is a real martial artist and kicks some butt in this film but it is rather slow and the acting in my opinion is for the most part <UNK> although i think steve james does a decent job like my friend ryan i was confused as to why the psychopath chose to go to the theatre at the end of the film rather than to go after <UNK> girlfriend until than the killer had only killed women oh well i guess it wasn't as predictable as i thought <UNK> a film you can pass on
<START> there's lots of <UNK> but not a whole lot of sense in the supposedly <UNK> third sequel which <UNK> on the <UNK> visuals to no effect good old alan <UNK> directed this one in which various members of the same family all played poorly by bruce <UNK> are <UNK> by <UNK> doug <UNK> <UNK> out of <UNK> for the <UNK> time peter <UNK> tries to <UNK> his script with poetic touches but doesn't seem to realise that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a plate of sick the incoherent plot fails to adequately fill the movie's <UNK> running time although this may have more to do with studio <UNK> than anything the filmmakers intended
<START> i first saw this when i was a teen in my last year of junior high i was <UNK> to it i loved the special effects the fantastic places and the trial aspect and flashback method of telling the story br br several years later i read the book and while it was interesting and i could definitely see what swift was trying to say i think that while it's not as perfect as the book for social commentary as a story the movie is better it makes more sense to have it be one long adventure than having <UNK> return after each voyage and making a profit by selling the tiny sheep or whatever br br it's much more <UNK> when everyone thinks he's crazy and the sheep do make a cameo anyway as a side note when i saw laputa i was stunned it looks very much like the kingdom of <UNK> from the trigger video game 1995 that also made me like this mini series even more br br i saw it again about 4 years ago and realized that i still enjoyed it just as much really high quality stuff and began an excellent run of <UNK> mini series for nbc who followed it up with the solid <UNK> and interesting alice in wonderland
<START> sometimes reading the user comments on imdb fills me with despair for the species for anybody to dismiss 2001 a space odyssey as boring they must have no interest in science technology philosophy history or the art of film making finally i understand why most hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous they understand their audience br br thankfully those that cannot appreciate kubrick's accomplishment are still a minority most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer <UNK> that went into the making of this epic this is the film that put the science in science fiction and its depiction of space travel and <UNK> future remains <UNK> to this day it was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn't caught up br br 2001 is primarily a technical film the reason it is slow and filled with is because the aim was to realistically <UNK> the future of technology and the past in the awe inspiring opening scenes the film's greatest strength is in the details remember that when this film was made man still hadn't made it out to the moon but there it is in 2001 and that's just the start of the journey to create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief i still can't work out how some of the shots were done the film's only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted <UNK> technological and social development it is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001 not kubrick's br br besides the incredible special effects camera work and set design kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human and where the human race is going yes the ending is weird and hard to comprehend but that's the nature of the future kubrick and clarke have started the task of <UNK> it now it's up to the audience to continue there's no neat resolution no definitive full stop because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel i know that's what most audiences seem to want these days but kubrick isn't going to let us off so lightly br br i'm glad to see that this film is in the imdb top 100 films and only wish that it were even higher stanley kubrick is one of the very finest film makers the world has known and 2001 his finest accomplishment 10 10
<START> who do you dream of hoot gibson <UNK> <UNK> i'm talking about the theater harry crystal br br nothing beats a great stage show nothing and harry crystal lives that belief a stage actor still waiting for his big break harry brings the magic of live theater to a small town and to <UNK> <UNK> tom <UNK> a young man who has big dreams but just didn't know it until he met harry br br with scenes and songs from many of america's classic musicals those lips those eyes conveys both the ups and downs of the people that for 2 hours take us to a fantasy land but who manage to keep that magic alive in their hearts all day long br br like <UNK> once you've seen those lips those eyes you're hooked kid harry crystal
<START> i have not read the novel from which the film is based on so i cannot comment on what is missing or if there were changes made br br as i stated above i had a wonderful experience watching the <UNK> runner i find that when i see films about other cultures than <UNK> here in the usa i learn how other peoples live exist br br the actors in this movie are from afghanistan other countries in that area there are 3 young children in this near epic movie in there first roles they were marvelous br br the scenes that was supposedly in <UNK> were shot in various parts of china i assume that the area is similar to the actual places in the book br br mark foster directed he did finding he has created the same magic here br br all aspects of production are first rate br br i found this a better movie than those nominated won oscars br br the film is sub titled it is very clear to read it has a proper pg 13 rating spoiler alert the child rape scene is very well handled br br i cannot however give this a 4 star rating as the general plot story line we have seen many many times non the less this is a very worthwhile movie to watch br br ratings 1 2 out of 4 95 points out of 100 imdb 9 out of 10
<START> why a film maker with a track record like wes craven would want to lend his name to a tedious collection of cliches like this is anyone's guess and if he did <UNK> up any money for it all of <UNK> judging by the looks he should have been <UNK> on the director's door for a <UNK> the minute the film was released there are many alien rip offs and this is one of the worst even the reliable lance <UNK> <UNK> with a character dumb enough to allow his kids to wander around a dangerous government lab can't save it as a cure for insomnia this rates a 10 as a piece of quality film making forget it
<START> <UNK> presents an interesting mix of original concepts in screaming teen cliché horror with a more thriller like pacing in some ways <UNK> is very successful but in many other ways the film fails miserably br br overall <UNK> avoided the typical <UNK> of the <UNK> and innocence of youth of endless horror films in the like of cabin fever texas chainsaw massacre and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers have sex run around screaming and one by one are <UNK> off by some sort of monster instead this innocence is replaced with pride <UNK> and arrogance the characters had several opportunities to save themselves from <UNK> death and despair but failed to do so due to their own personal demons in the end you were left with the feeling that there were no and perhaps are no innocent victims br br as the name implies the film also touches greatly on following a leader or authority this was used in a direct sense of if the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film following a central figure is a <UNK> theme throughout the film br br through all this the film makers also <UNK> a lot of cliché which i suspect was intentional and gave the film a unique mixture of depth as well as <UNK> which i found intriguing this perhaps inadvertently plays well with the characters who are at first appearance very shallow but as the story unfolds it becomes obvious that they are at least the two main male characters quite complex br br technically the film has a lot of problems however the cinematography which is typically regarded highly i find rather <UNK> and over stylized <UNK> formulaic 2 3 approaches far too many transitions i felt were also over stylized the use of symbolism was not only vague but also greatly over used br br the plot was poorly planned and relied exclusively on <UNK> in order to achieve a rather hokey twist ending which was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused methods used to resolve the climax are cheap and ill prepared motivations are <UNK> unclear and major plot points remain <UNK> in the end br br overall the film's relative originality themes and <UNK> are lost in a <UNK> of poor technical execution over stylized imagery unclear motives <UNK> and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists <UNK> only by a lack of or entirely incorrect information br br if the film were better executed it would have been excellent however <UNK> receives only two stars in my opinion
<START> even sophie presence and the few very few good french gags are unable to save this otherwise slow and boring movie a disappointment the story is weak and so is acting this movie was advertised as the french version of the mummy but the mummy has at least spectacular and enjoyable effects
<START> i was a fan of the american werewolf in london movie and so was curious whether a 16 year later sequel could be done with french language and local re cast major supporting and minor characters tonight i watched the edited for fox network version that was some sort of curious hybrid of several <UNK> sequels the screenwriters and directors pay homage to certain of the key plot concepts tourist gets wolf bite full moon comes out boy meets girl boy becomes beast boy dies heroic death after help from ghost victim for me the <UNK> aspect of this formula teen horror special effect ride was the casting of the school teacher love interest of the tv comedy ed as one of the <UNK> clueless victims who is more or less totally unsympathetic in the scripted lines they handed her i haven't seen another horror flick that this movie is a vampire fighting flick titled blade but i guess that parts of its <UNK> must explain how villain werewolves they're are threatening the good werewolf pair during a long part of the movie there is also a final conflict in a paris subway train a la speed this 1997 studio product is an odd hybrid of a film since considerable technical effects are shown for scary purposes but the authentic <UNK> of the original have been completely <UNK> in my opinion such an odd re write of the werewolf legend and movie mythology my suggestion to those considering this at the video store go for a classic top of the line thriller instead alfred hitchcock's psycho
<START> this is probably the only film i've seen where the imdb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100 accurate the is an atrocious dim witted film with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever and is a <UNK> to a director like john <UNK> and that's what makes it great br br in order to appreciate the you have to keep in mind a little known but very true <UNK> spoken by director <UNK> i urge you to learn to look at bad films they are so often sublime in order for any film to work the film must establish and follow it's own logic and if it does so convincingly and sincerely then it's actually possible for the film to work for example when you watch freddy got <UNK> as a traditional gross out comedy it's complete and utter garbage when you watch it with the understanding that it's actually a neo <UNK> comedy it's brilliant br br it works with good movies too if jaws hadn't accepted the reality it created the air tank explosion ending wouldn't have worked but a lot of people think jaws is vastly overrated for this type of reason and they aren't wrong but it has it's strengths doesn't it the point being that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective some people like me get it right away while others never will no matter how often it's explained jim <UNK> made a compelling defense of <UNK> once and even afterwards i still can't see it from his p o v doesn't mean he's wrong though if you have the right frame of mind when you watch this movie and no i do not mean stoned i'm gonna put that to bed right now you can actually enjoy the movie for the dumb cheap pointless slapstick late 80s early 90s style farce that it is br br the <UNK> and <UNK> of this film are right it's stupid and that's the point the movie accepts the stupidity of the characters much in the same way the jerk accepted <UNK> <UNK> idiocy and because it takes that and runs with it the movie focuses exclusively on using that to forward the plot and to define the characters a bad movie would actually do this and fail to use that logic properly bad movie are bad because they make it up as they go along whereas movies like the knows where it's going what it's doing and why from the beginning br br i can't defend the film from an artistic standpoint which is why i give it such a low rating the acting is mostly bad the jokes very superficial and the live action quality probably ruins what would have worked as a cartoon but i can't deny that it is entertaining in its own way and that's why i defend it i got it right away and i pity those who don't br br i'll admit i was drawn to this movie because of christopher lee's delicious cameo appearance hearing him say release the drive <UNK> would have been worth the rental price even if i hated this film but was amazed to find that aside from the tv studio applause sign segment with jenny mccarthy i was never bored and never disappointed in fact many of the jokes because of their cartoonish context were hilarious in particular the <UNK> cigarette explosion they were dumb but they were funny and the movie doesn't pretend to be anything else a stupid comedy about stupid characters and instead of <UNK> for it it enjoys itself br br and that's exactly why it works
<START> as social satire <UNK> is just as good as office space but with a wider scope to criticize this film as too <UNK> due to <UNK> humor is to kind of miss the point i think there are certainly fart jokes etc but they're not really intended to be funny to the audience they exist to define the state of culture in the world of <UNK> ad visited by joe as a background to the bizarre state of affairs in which he <UNK> the real humor of the film lies in the many sight gags and attitudes present in this future society that are just a <UNK> off of what we encounter in our daily lives and which should serve as a warning my personal favorite is the depiction of fox news the subtle brilliance in the film lies in the fact that it also <UNK> at smart people and average <UNK> like the protagonists note the times in the film when joe and rita almost <UNK> <UNK> to the idiots around them and you realize that <UNK> is not created to pick on any group of people in particular but on the culture of idiocy in general i don't know what to say about the made for conspiracy theory behavior of fox in releasing this film but if it's not playing in your local theater demand it we all need to see this film if not for the social commentary at least for the fart jokes
<START> this is one of those movies that you watch because it's bad such a movie that you watch just to see it's <UNK> <UNK> supposedly a horror i cannot imagine how anyone can be afraid of a <UNK> bug especially one that is <UNK> in nature where you can see the actor's legs behind it br br even with no budget a little bit of attention to detail and even an attempt at making this movie believable would have sucked the fun right out of it as they would have had to replace all of the actors and the entire story with it if i had nothing to make fun of while it was playing i would have stopped it after 10 minutes and put on some quality show like bob square pants <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br i strongly recommend that brett <UNK> get with <UNK> and really <UNK> out some <UNK> br br
<START> i remember the events of this movie the ill <UNK> cruise of donald in 1968 in the golden globe single handed around the world <UNK> race i was a 13 year old living in england the previous year francis later sir francis he was <UNK> for his exploits had completed the first solo of the globe i remember it mostly because we were given time off school to watch his return on a grainy black and white tv and then his by the queen it <UNK> a huge <UNK> of patriotic <UNK> in the uk it all seems so quaint now became a national hero but he had stopped half way in australia to re fit his <UNK> so the next logical step for was to attempt the journey without stopping br br it's important to remember that this was a world pre <UNK> when <UNK> on land were still pretty <UNK> never mind in the middle of the ocean now with <UNK> that fit on a key chain and <UNK> a position within a anywhere on earth it's hard to recall a time when you could go to sea and quite literally <UNK> as donald did br br a number of signed up all men back then including mystery man essentially a weekend sailor had not been a spectacular success in any previous enterprise including careers in the british army the air force and as an <UNK> <UNK> selling <UNK> aids he wanted to do something big with his life and he saw the five thousand pound first prize well over 100 000 in today's money and the ensuing publicity as a means of kick starting his business he signed a deal with a <UNK> that proved more <UNK> than his boat and which meant failure would <UNK> him and soon found himself a popular figure with <UNK> as he prepared for the race now the brits always love the idea of the <UNK> amateur taking on the think eddie the eagle losing endless olympic <UNK> jump <UNK> and the amateur riders who regularly start the grand national horse race the public up to see him set off but his boat wasn't really ready and even as he started the last <UNK> to leave the uk must have known he didn't seriously have a chance but too much was riding on him to quit br br in the wonderful archive footage we see doubt written all over his poor wife's face left behind with their 4 children she is interviewed <UNK> throughout the film together with one of sons she was in a no win situation had she attempted to stop him she would have been considered a spoiler but afterward she was with doubt as to whether she could have saved his life by stopping him faced with the certain truth that his boat was <UNK> and would never make it through the southern <UNK> and unable to turn around and face <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> a plan to cheat laid up <UNK> <UNK> and brazil out of radio contact he waited for the leaders to round cape horn and start back up the atlantic thinking he could sneak in at the end of the line and pretend he had <UNK> all the way around the globe he <UNK> his <UNK> and made <UNK> films and audio <UNK> to back up his plan but as one after another the other <UNK> dropped out he realized that in fact he would come in 2nd and his <UNK> would be <UNK> unable to face certain <UNK> his <UNK> suggests he lost his grip on reality and eventually committed suicide his <UNK> was found he never was br br this beautifully edited film also follows the journey of bernard an experienced and enigmatic french sailor who was in second place and certain of the <UNK> journey prize when he abruptly left the race unable to deal with the <UNK> and publicity he knew he would face and <UNK> into the wide blue <UNK> eventually pulling up some 10 months later in <UNK> having spent some seven years working at sea myself albeit on very different ships to these i well understand the pull of the ocean standing on deck seeing water in every direction to the horizon knowing there's a couple of miles of water below you nothing between you and oblivion but a thin metal <UNK> without easy access to tv or radio even nowadays on most working ships you feel pretty isolated it's possible to truly escape from the <UNK> of everyday life for a while there is some thoughtful analysis of what drives people to attempt this kind of very long lonely journey and the effect it has on the human mind most people would think that attempting to raise 4 children is adventure enough but much is made of the need for self discovery in the <UNK> at sea the search for self br br i strongly suspect that robin knox <UNK> the ex navy guy who won the race and many since probably knew pretty well who he was before he set off which was why he succeeded not just in winning the race but also <UNK> his sanity en route those who went searching for something profound within themselves may not have entirely liked what they found br br the marvelous archive footage of britain in the late 60s is almost reason enough to watch this did it really look quite that bad i don't remember it looking quite so <UNK> but perhaps we <UNK> out the worst aspects of the past but overall it is an excellently well made and engrossing movie highly recommended
<START> for once a story of hope <UNK> over the tragic reality our youth face rising draws one into a scary <UNK> and unfair world and shows through beautiful color and moving music how one man and his dedicated friends choose not to accept that world and change it through action and art an entertaining interesting emotional <UNK> beautiful film i showed this film to numerous high school students as well who all live in <UNK> with poverty and and gun violence and they were <UNK> with anderson the protagonist i recommend this film to all ages over 13 due to subtitles and some images of death from all backgrounds
<START> <UNK> is based on the classic shakespearean work of the same name but bears little resemblance to its source material br br it <UNK> as being as cerebral as its <UNK> but instead is a <UNK> convoluted and hackneyed exercise in tedium the original the premise that people have an evil side which would be destructive if <UNK> here you just get an uninteresting mid life crisis yawn goof ball who is having everything go wrong in his personal and professional life he becomes <UNK> with a supernatural power that he uses to try to control his environment in other words to get his own way br br every few minutes after something else in his pathetic life goes wrong he finds a secluded place and starts <UNK> show me the magic while waving his hands around and making a serious concentration expression from the way these scenes are shot it looks like he's trying to turn bugs into other kinds of bugs turning a spider into a <UNK> maybe but by this time you really don't care br br the story has him <UNK> from his life with his daughter to a greek island somewhere then have a awkward relationship with some girl he meets one of the <UNK> romances ever committed to film the story just <UNK> down and moves at a slower and slower pace you are never given any reason to like or dislike anyone br br i'll give this a 2 because of the beautiful greek location shots and the semi optimistic conclusion although it isn't clear if the <UNK> power brought this ending about or not the spirit of shakespeare's work has been captured much better in other movies one notable example is forbidden planet which gave <UNK> to how the power gets out of control br br as for this <UNK> its only magic is to cure insomnia
<START> is about a teenage girl named <UNK> miranda <UNK> who lives with her artist brother spencer in a <UNK> in seattle <UNK> has a web show that gets millions of views and makes tons of money a year so much money she doesn't even know its a real number her best friend is sam <UNK> who's as predictable as they come she says normal things and beats up neighbor <UNK> who is in charge of all the technical things for their web show <UNK> shouts every word and looks like she doesn't have emotion sam chases <UNK> around and <UNK> screams in one episode <UNK> and her friends shoot the <UNK> down in elevator and he survives br br i would not recommend this at all unless you like teenagers shouting hurting people and making fun of stuff
<START> if anything william was an <UNK> who wanted a piece of the action in regards to whatever was popular during the time i mean a <UNK> flick in <UNK> kentucky who would of <UNK> it i can just imagine the enthusiasm he must've had getting pam <UNK> quite a hot item to star in his picture if you are pretty familiar with the genre <UNK> baby doesn't necessarily stray too far from formula despite a change of <UNK> the film still deals with a ruthless businessman <UNK> shark who <UNK> in on <UNK> companies using stooges to <UNK> them in order to get their <UNK> br br <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> a former <UNK> cop working in chicago who returns home at the request of her father's partner brick austin <UNK> assault on <UNK> 13 <UNK> father despite <UNK> bullying tactics his man in town is pilot a wannabe gangster <UNK> with stooges who aren't that menacing rather <UNK> in nature so thin skinned they hire hit men outside of town to shoot up the <UNK> <UNK> building won't give up his company and this eventually costs him his life when a warning through the use of <UNK> force leads to his being killed <UNK> will get her revenge on all those responsible for his father's death in other words <UNK> ass is grass can you dig it br br seeing <UNK> with a <UNK> is enough to sell this particular film the novelty of the setting being in <UNK> is part of the package you even get to see a <UNK> chase <UNK> in <UNK> with gangsters not necessarily the most polished kind one might be <UNK> to seeing in a chicago or new york during this period in <UNK> lots of blood <UNK> from bullet <UNK> bodies torn apart by gun fire and colorful characters such as a <UNK> <UNK> shark in <UNK> dress named walker and pilot who is one of the least scary <UNK> you are likely to see who show up during the film most having the misfortune of coming in contact with a very angry <UNK> the plot itself is nothing special but <UNK> is always worth watching and <UNK> plenty of action sequences to keep his target audience entertained a modest success for and one of his more accomplished films
<START> the book gets 10 out of 10 stars br br probably contains spoilers of both the book and the movie br br if you've never read geoffrey <UNK> rogue male the source material for man hunt you'll likely enjoy fritz <UNK> treatment of the story on the other hand if you're in my camp and have practically <UNK> the book the movie will be a crashing disappointment i'll assume you've already read a synopsis of the story and proceed to my complaints <UNK> little novel is one of the all time great suspense classics taut and spare with only a bare handful of characters to <UNK> the action fritz lang and his screen writer dudley <UNK> feel the need to throw in the <UNK> brother and a sympathetic <UNK> the latter of which <UNK> the depth of the story by <UNK> an motivation into the screenplay where the novel needed none in fact the true climax of the book was not the <UNK> <UNK> escape from his underground <UNK> but rather his self acceptance of his true motive for going on his hunt in the first place and that's another thing if david <UNK> and quentin tarantino can get us all the way through fight club and kill bill 1 without revealing the names of their respective protagonists why can't lang what hat did they pull that out of which brings me to my complaint <UNK> hunter is so <UNK> british he would bleed a union jack if you cut him but walter <UNK> who plays him is canadian he can barely sustain the accent which is only slightly deeper and more convincing that kevin <UNK> in robin hood he looked about right in the role and was a fine actor for the 1940s but as rogue <UNK> reluctant hero let's look to the <UNK> itself for a more convincing version remake soon with subtlety and with please i'll direct it for
<START> if you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization there is an excellent book called outlaw <UNK> or the outlaw sea and it describes in story after story how these things do happen the <UNK> of the high <UNK> is a reality for a number of reasons one many of the world's are of questionable <UNK> <UNK> and it's difficult to impossible to <UNK> international laws when the ships owners don't have an office in a real country two many ship lines employ <UNK> from dirt poor third world countries the <UNK> are often like illegal immigrant workers threatened and <UNK> into <UNK> with questionable or illegal practices three there is often a language <UNK> not only between the officers and the crew but also between the crew members themselves the crew are rewarded for their <UNK> and their silence four once committing an illegal act the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint anyway it's fascinating reading br br horrifying story excellent movie does anyone else notice how hbo seems to make the best and most important movies hollywood has trouble releasing enough oscar worthy movies in any given year so that several of the top 5 <UNK> usually come from britain jerry bruckheimer the end of quality cinema br br i loved the thoroughly evil performance by sean pertwee i also as usual loved omar <UNK>
<START> what was this a <UNK> brothers movie i don't mind a little humor in my holmes i'm a big fan of billy <UNK> the private life of sh but this version of the sign of four feels like a grand <UNK> <UNK> episode of murder she wrote right from the opening credits that are of the worst possible kind a montage of scenes from the movie as directed by mel brooks ian richardson is a fine actor and certainly looks the part he's a dead <UNK> to those drawings from the <UNK> but his interpretation of the character is all wrong and overly humorous from the silly smile he frequently sports i thought the drug holmes was into was cocaine not <UNK> to his expressions of comical <UNK> in the carnival sequences not to mention that when he <UNK> himself as an old man he is so over the top that despite the fine makeup we instantly recognize him david <UNK> is an <UNK> but given the circumstances acceptable watson and is not too much of a <UNK> at least not more than the rest of characters <UNK> <UNK> plays mary in an exaggerated <UNK> fashion straight out of a 1930s vaudeville br br story wise there are some pointless <UNK> like giving <UNK> vampire teeth an <UNK> for raw meat and a carnival pit as a place to live turning him into a reject from island of dr <UNK> and we are even denied the pleasure of discovering the mystery alongside holmes as we are well informed of everything way before holmes finds out and this is full of tired clichés not only we get the infamous <UNK> <UNK> my dear watson which as any will know conan doyle never ever wrote but we are exposed to such blatant <UNK> as having hindi music pop out of nowhere when holmes goes to see a white guy in hindi clothes br br bottom line in britain in the eighties two rival tv companies attempted to create a long running series of sherlock holmes adaptations and produced initial tv movies as potential pilots one of them starred ian richardson the other starred jeremy brett thankfully the one that got its way through multiple episodes was the good one br br 3 10 travesty
<START> one of the flat out movies of all time <UNK> and <UNK> are at their best matching wits over the <UNK> of an all boys and all girls school sharing the same quarters slapstick has never been this sophisticated
<START> a true geek girl's dream high tech high drama smart guys steamy sex and large explosions very large explosions sam <UNK> is so natural in the role of <UNK> that tapes of the real <UNK> sound odd apparently he had a voice similar to ronald reagan the triumph and tragedy of <UNK> is one of the 20th <UNK> most stirring dramas and this movie stands as a model of what <UNK> drama ought to be the facts are allowed to speak for themselves while the fictional parts are used to <UNK> and fill in the record not to call attention to themselves an interesting fact some of the technical details used had only recently been <UNK> and so are of special interest a must see
<START> if you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times this is a hilarious and <UNK> enjoyable looney tunes cartoon the animation is wonderful the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of <UNK> <UNK> too the writing is razor sharp and the sight gags especially <UNK> constantly getting his head blown off are brilliantly timed i really did love the arguments between <UNK> and bugs and that bugs wins every time i also love it that <UNK> is really greedy and nasty while being <UNK> funny i do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too bugs is still his charming and <UNK> self and elmer is funny if rather dumb too in short this is absolutely brilliant and actually my personal favourite of the hunting trilogy for sheer entertainment value 10 10 <UNK> cox
<START> after reading a biography on the last russian nicholas ii and his failure to secure the <UNK> support i decided to give this film a try br br i watched it with a completely open mind not knowing anything about it except its reputation br br these are the things that impressed me the most br br 1 the shots of <UNK> and the soldiers used as extras more than once i stopped to think if this was done in this time and place 80 of this would have been computer generated br br 2 the realism in it from the <UNK> <UNK> meat to the shot of the sailor with his candle and the legend killed for a bowl of soup this movie makes no <UNK> to the pc cause which thankfully hadn't been invented yet br br 3 the slow descent into madness of the <UNK> steps sequence from the first shot when the <UNK> man appears you get the idea something might be wrong since the overall shots are composed though you end up feeling comfortable in your surroundings then an <UNK> appears and people start falling in dramatic poses still the shots are composed until the appear into scene and the incredible shot <UNK> appear this scene is easily worth the price of admission br br 4 the fact that this movie is 100 <UNK> propaganda then again when rambo fought in afghanistan he also was having something to do with propaganda only a different kind br br overall a film marred by a bit of a slow narrative nevertheless metropolis the <UNK> of dr <UNK> and this movie are perfect examples of inventive edgy movies that are still remembered for their merits today they really make modern movies look boring and repetitive
<START> the 70s were without a doubt the golden age of made for tv horror this is one of those that was probably <UNK> out as an abc movie of the week it's the old story of a house and or ghost <UNK> one of the new owners the movie has promise but it's never realized everything is rushed too much tension and suspense need time to build and grow and there's nothing new we've seen it all before and one better br br one final thought i don't understand why robert <UNK> character would fall for the long dead movie star when he's married to kate jackson for goodness sake
<START> i saw this film on september 1st 2005 in <UNK> i am one of the judges for the <UNK> film festival that screens films for their truly moving picture award a truly moving picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life <UNK> gave that award to this film br br this is a story of golf in the early part of the 20th century at that time it was the game of upper class and rich gentlemen and working people could only participate by being at country <UNK> with this backdrop this based on a true story unfolds with a young working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest <UNK> in the world harry br br and the story is inspirational against all odds francis played by <UNK> <UNK> of holes gets to compete against the greatest <UNK> of the u s and great britain at the <UNK> u s open francis is ill prepared and has a child for a <UNK> the <UNK> is hilarious and <UNK> and steals every scene he appears in but despite these <UNK> francis displays courage spirit <UNK> and <UNK> at this world class event br br and we learn a lot about the early years of golf for example the use of small wooden <UNK> the <UNK> of the short holes the <UNK> the <UNK> swinging with <UNK> in their mouths the terrible conditions of the <UNK> and and the play not being canceled even in <UNK> rain br br this film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing and with no big movie stars the story is somehow more believable br br this adds to the <UNK> of great sports movies in the vein of miracle and remember the <UNK> br br <UNK> there is a truly moving pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years
<START> the first review i saw of this on imdb says that vince vaughn is a much better actor than anthony <UNK> was in this role makes me wonder if he saw the original it's tough to review psycho if you don't have the perspective of how revolutionary the movie was in 1960 you have a heroine who isn't very likable and is killed not far into the movie and a villain who is creepy but makes you feel for him add to that some graphic violence and you have a blue print for some of the slasher films of the 80s and 90s br br where does this film go wrong let's start with casting anne <UNK> is fine as a vivian <UNK> but as norman bates vince vaughn is all wrong for one thing he looks far too young secondly he has no idea how to play the roll his nervous laugh reminds me of ron howard trying to play a tough guy on happy days everything he does screams i did it the original movie even to those who know everything about it still makes you feel uneasy about the influence of mother on norman and turns her into a real separate character how about the shower scene when i finally saw the 1960 movie on a big screen i was surprised at its power to scare the heck out of me bernard score becomes incredibly shrill and loud and goes further toward <UNK> you than danny <UNK> <UNK> interpretations during the scene this shower scene merely serves to show us anne naked body and some nice color blood which brings us to the choice to film in color didn't work br br there is something about <UNK> classic films that hardly ever seems to work some may see this as a noble experiment but honestly if gus van <UNK> had nothing to add to this film he should have left it alone
<START> shakespeare would have been <UNK> the writers <UNK> shakespeare's amazing work ariel is the only believable acting performance the african voodoo secluded swamp and <UNK> man character make the movie a mockery of shakespeare's true <UNK> br br don't waste your eye sight on this movie
<START> perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of jane <UNK> works has been portrayed perhaps i am too severe on this adaptation but i'm afraid i am biased to the a e version i have a hard time imagining mr <UNK> portrayed by anyone other than colin <UNK> br br the characters seemed shallow and often dialogue forced <UNK> seemed to lack the real feeling that is so evident in the book her fancy for was <UNK> and then her sudden like for <UNK> was not believable br br <UNK> was portrayed <UNK> well i will grant him he managed to maintain the <UNK> that is required but i felt he did not project the feeling and inner struggle that makes his character so delightful especially in the <UNK> scene br br mr and mrs <UNK> were also played well but seemed lacking in many ways the mean temper of mrs <UNK> was not completely captured in her performance br br mr <UNK> was a good portrayal very much in line with the book br br i will <UNK> from commenting on lady catherine except to say that she is possibly the worst portrayal in the entire film br br other problems i saw were the few liberties they took with the order of events such as <UNK> being present at the first meeting with lady c and also that miss lucas and sir william did not join <UNK> on her visit to the <UNK> br br the choreography was dreadful during the dancing scenes the scene where <UNK> and <UNK> dance loses much of its intensity because one cannot get past the feeling that they look <UNK> on the ballroom floor at least this bbc version left out the dialogue between <UNK> <UNK> and sir william when he <UNK> the two on their dancing as they performed very ill indeed br br there were occasional moments that it kept me interested but overall i find this version to be a disappointment i would not advise this film unless you're like me and you are <UNK> <UNK> by such <UNK> br br
<START> the first time i saw this film i was a kid i was ten years old when it was released but since my family never went to movie theaters i saw it on network tv i remember watching it crying afterward it was only the second film to <UNK> that response rocky was the first and there haven't been many since i can't say why exactly larry rain murphy didn't deserve to win any more that rocky <UNK> or anyone else i know i admired murphy not so much for what he did but for the way he did his time stoic he didn't need a <UNK> or freedom to find dignity he ran because he could he needed no other reason i have a rule today that when i see this film late at night on cable television the only time most will come across it i must watch no matter what i have to do the next morning fortunately it doesn't play often like <UNK> redemption or other favorites so i still get plenty of sleep and i never tire of the story of one man's <UNK> <UNK> and personal victory
<START> i watched this movie on hbo and i had a good time br br the director has done a great work i found myself totally absorbed into this movie once it started norman performance is cool i expect more chilling movies from him br br i was so absorbed that on occasions i wanted to grab gun from norman and shoot that snake girl <UNK> i like the movies when innocent looking girls play tricks with men really <UNK> the ending was what i wanted br br this movie is filled with twists of moments you expect this but something else happens br br in the beginning those massive images cut scenes were really painful to eyes br br although it was not shown when norman <UNK> changed <UNK> notes or is it me standing by <UNK>
<START> <UNK> feels like the <UNK> of the sopranos in mixing the criminal and the domestic and of the buddy film to feel as contemporary as <UNK> dogs br br even as these gangsters are <UNK> <UNK> with wives children lovers and parents they are <UNK> ruthless and we are constantly reminded they are no matter what warm situation we also see them in they can <UNK> a kid's hair and then shoot a threat in cold blood the key is loyalty and the male <UNK> is beautifully conveyed without ethnic or class stereotypes even as their web of past <UNK> and pay backs <UNK> into suspicion and paranoia as the old gang is in various stages of <UNK> retirement out on <UNK> or into new less <UNK> <UNK> an intense <UNK> is of sending a stranger to perform an old escape scenario it is a high point of emotion when a wife is told off that she's not the one the gangster is friends with while virtually the only time we hear music on the soundtrack is when he recalls his wife br br in italy and france are <UNK> used in <UNK> daylight to dark water and <UNK> from the opening set up of a pair of <UNK> robbers who are traveling with one's wife and two kids rugged <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> captures the screen immediately as the criminal dad and the second thug is clearly a casually <UNK> presence in their lives as they smoothly <UNK> the <UNK> and escape in cars <UNK> on <UNK> and <UNK> in easy <UNK> this is not the cliché <UNK> old guy <UNK> with the big eyed orphan these are their jobs and their families and they <UNK> in horrific ways br br the film pulls no punches in unexpectedly killing off characters directly and as <UNK> damage and challenging our sympathy for them right through to the <UNK> end which is probably why there was never an american remake br br it seems so fresh that it's not until jean paul <UNK> enters almost a third of the way into the film looking so as a young punk that one realizes that this is from 1960 <UNK> sandra milo has smart and terrific chemistry with him from an <UNK> to an elevator to a hospital bed br br while the film forum was showing a new 35 <UNK> print with newly translated subtitles it was not <UNK> the program notes explained that the title refers to a kind of insurance policy and is pun on tourist class
<START> with <UNK> thank god you're here the network may be trying to <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> sitcom who's line is it anyway in which host drew carey would judge the performances of a handful of cast <UNK> asked to <UNK> scenes of some kind in the nbc show dave <UNK> and co host dave alan <UNK> <UNK> a handful of notable comedians who must <UNK> their way through various scenes which all begin with thank god you're here it takes itself far too seriously why must viewers be repeatedly reminded that the actors have never seen the sets before both co <UNK> seem less then <UNK> after watching the continuously sub par unfunny attempts by the actors to some laughs i am left wondering whether the live audience is genuinely laughing at what <UNK> or whether they too are <UNK> expect this time <UNK> filler to be a very short lived one
<START> as a <UNK> diver i can appreciate the incredible physical strain the <UNK> must have endured to get the shots underwater this series is much more than that though the narration is perfect the scenes <UNK> on implausible and the subject matter enthralling the day to day struggle for life taking place out of the view of we <UNK> <UNK> is mind <UNK> this dvd set has open my eyes to another planet right here on earth i urge everyone to watch this series
<START> mr bean has always been my favorite no <UNK> how many times you watch the same thing the show never gets monotonous or repetitive mr bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesn't need to even speak to make people laugh his gestures his facial expressions and his face itself is so funny to watch the situations which he faces on the show is simply hilarious and the way he handles them is even greater there is simply no reason why this show shouldn't receive a 10 because it is fabulous its something that would even make the most serious or sad person in the universe laugh some of my all time favorites episodes from the show are 1 when mr bean at a hotel 2 the one where he watches the scary film 3 mind the baby the <UNK> scene especially in fact all the episodes are so good that it is really difficult to criticize the show mr bean can go to any heights to prove that he is funny including completely <UNK> himself in one of the episodes the way he handled that situation was simply mind blowing 10 out of 10
<START> i've heard people compare this movie to <UNK> how this comparison was made i'll never guess because this movie was in no way comparable to <UNK> br br these 2 films were as different as star wars and the the only thing they had in common at all was they both had wine as a subject br br though the interviews in this documentary were semi interesting they were ruined by the absolute worst camera work ever attempted i've never seen worse camera work in my life and i'm comparing it to home videos accidentally taken by 5 year olds br br i give this two stars only for the interesting interviews with french wine types and for showing how <UNK> and corrupt the american wine companies are aren't all companies <UNK> and corrupt i'd give it 10 stars yes that's negative 10 for the <UNK> terrible horrible awful vertigo inducing 5 year old could do better camera mess
<START> <UNK> old films that you thought were average isn't necessarily a good thing they sometimes get worse <UNK> by the <UNK> camp in they labeled it the scariest film since texas chainsaw no <UNK> the geek inexplicably developed a cult following as an intense horror picture actually it is just an average stalk and bite film that briefly sets itself aside from the pack by featuring a killer who like a chicken yes like a chicken to the <UNK> credit at least they didn't make the killer sound like a duck a la the new york <UNK> that would just be silly br br narrative logic is completely abandoned in <UNK> the geek i'm not saying that slasher films are abound with reason but at least in halloween michael myers escaped <UNK> is actually <UNK> after a lengthy scene where people argue he is <UNK> even though he like a chicken and has razor <UNK> which he apparently fashioned in prison it is the kind of film where a couple sees a <UNK> in door and the girl <UNK> it by saying oh my mom must have forgotten her keys she forgets a lot of things since my dad died the kind of film where the hysterical mother runs into a cop looking for <UNK> and tells him the killer is in my house so what does he do he grabs her and literally drags her back to the house and says just show me where he is and i'll do the rest why not call back up br br it is too bad the film is filled with such horrible action and dialogue because the <UNK> character is actually pretty interesting most of the credit goes to ed terry a dead <UNK> for tom <UNK> in <UNK> who gives the <UNK> <UNK> a genuine air of menace in the hands of a right director <UNK> the geek could be on the same level as sonny boy or santa <UNK> and be a true cinematic <UNK> but <UNK> is not that director and merely places the fascinating character of <UNK> in tedious slasher <UNK>
<START> this is one of the best episodes of doctor who ever we have the the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> may scare young children and of coarse the doctor doing one of his best acts bravo david <UNK> good scenes as if it was a movie with thrilling scenes in some streets an invasion on the base and leaving the world different to <UNK> basically a 45 minute movie br br being part 2 of rise of the this would never disappoint with it having a great build up to the final br br the doctor plus an evil enemy <UNK> master <UNK> or even is a battle to the death just be careful with young children watching this
<START> this movie was really bad plain and simple how a movie like this gets wide release is a wonder to me br br it's a decent idea but it just didn't flesh out edward burns is a decent actor though i liked his small role in saving private ryan br br let's get down to the big issue here br br the visuals were so incredibly bad i thought i was watching an old dinosaurs in 3d point and click adventure <UNK> on windows 3 1 i mean i've seen cut scenes in <UNK> games from pre 2000 that have better looking dinosaurs than this i mean heck the original tomb <UNK> t rex looked better than this one br br the lizard monkeys were laughable i thought they were some sort of ripoff creation from killer instinct i've seen better <UNK> puppet monsters now that i think about it br br you know there's a ton of made for tv movies that are better than this how does a gem like scifi channels the shining get such a small audience but this load of cgi easy to make 4 gets put out in the open i don't care if it's a ray <UNK> story
<START> this movie is stupid made by stupid people the plot i suppose works well enough for a horror movie but the actions these characters take is insanely stupid like incredibly non <UNK> stupid to the <UNK> degree basically the whole movie consists of these 4 idiots being captured repeatedly despite having many many easy ways and opportunities to overcome their <UNK> it does not make one <UNK> of sense and is not entertaining whatsoever stabbing yourself in the eye is more is more rational and probably more fun than watching this br br spoilers the ending is hilarious the only good part of the movie i nearly died laughing at the end that whole stupid movie and it ends with the dumb girl getting <UNK> off in a <UNK> to white slavery in asia hilarious i thought it was a totally awesome ending to a really sh <UNK> movie
<START> this is a typical college comedy and its very average the story is ok but not very entertaining its about a unlucky guy named reno who <UNK> his job gets his car ripped off and then his uncle dies in a his got a girlfriend though a nice one btw anyway this uncle gives him his mansion in la and <UNK> as <UNK> and soon reno and his girlfriend moves to la to this new house the problem is that they would need some roommates in order to pay the high rent for this house and so the film unfolds br br the movie starts ok and has a few funny jokes here and there but the suddenly the movie takes a turn straight down to hell the ending is bad really bad it destroys everything about the movie you will know what i'm talking about when you see the movie br br 2 10
<START> i love the beach boys and their music so being that i am a filmmaker i thought wow a beach boys movie sounds great well wrong i just actually turned off <UNK> the channel the movie was playing on because it was so bad someone above mentioned about editing well they should have at least looked at the <UNK> while they were filming i don't know if anyone else caught the mustache falling off the face of one of the guys after he <UNK> his wife and then he it back on with his hands ever heard of re taking a scene acting was terrible direction was terrible make up was terrible possibly the worst make up job i have ever seen brian <UNK> fat looked like <UNK> <UNK> br br this is honestly the first time i have ever commented on imdb and i know it really doesn't make a difference but come on what the hell were the producers thinking
<START> night of the demons 1988 was another in a long line of teen horror films that were released on video and pay t v during that <UNK> of film making the eighties but unlike most of the crap that was being <UNK> around this one was actually a decent watch a group of bored teenagers decide to party halloween night away with a pair of bizarre sisters <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> at the infamous <UNK> house your usual cast of stereotypical teenagers are invited to the party but an average teenage bash turns into a night of terror as they try to survive halloween night when they undead residents of <UNK> house decide to crash the party <UNK> survive this night of bloodshed and horror br br a nice horror film that is best seen in the <UNK> version if you watch the r rated cut then you'll miss all of the splatter effects and nudity stay tune for the amusing <UNK> a gory film that was followed by an equally entertaining sequel for horror fans only br br highly recommended
<START> oh my god i was so expecting something more entertaining than this when i <UNK> this movie seeing as <UNK> was one of my <UNK> years for movies ever but it sucked the plot although i'd hesitate to call it that is about some dumb elephant it slowly makes its way onto some platform and gets <UNK> to death lame even for a short film the plot was too thin to keep my attention edison is like the worst director ever plus the elephant has no screen presence whatsoever and the ending wow that wasn't predictable at all sarcasm br br the picture quality is horrible too you can barely tell what's going on most of the time the only positive thing about this movie is that unlike most other un scary horror flicks this didn't <UNK> eleven sequels other than that this is a complete waste of money and 1 minute of your life you'll never get back
<START> what a shame this movie was never released it is now playing on cable i tuned in based on my high regard for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie far better than the ones i've been paying to see in theatres recently i like to be surprised so often movies are <UNK> as offbeat but are in fact more of the same old recycled drivel this movie is genuinely different with the bonus of a heartwarming message jonathan <UNK> sings like an angel even though he is required by the plot to sing some of the most sentimental songs ever written he does them so well one doesn't mind cathy bates and rupert everett are well cast and superb but a newcomer in the role of cathy <UNK> daughter in law steals every scene she is in give this film a chance
<START> big d b tries to keep peace between the <UNK> and their red brothers br br <UNK> an aging bruce bennett has to try and prove to the local indian chief <UNK> <UNK> jr appearing to be drunk as usual that his son was killed by the <UNK> leading jerk who has also been dealing in rifle <UNK> when <UNK> looking young sings though he holds his rifle like it's a <UNK> br br ok western adventure directed by two guys neither of whom has many credits on his resume but this flick ain't too bad and it has a nice short running time of <UNK> minutes
<START> this is a <UNK> photographed and unusually well written western by veteran creator of <UNK> charles marquis warren gordon douglas is its chief help in this regard its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences a hard <UNK> by the book <UNK> officer captain richard lance captures a leader of the indian enemy after a massacre at a <UNK> he insists on bringing the man back for trial to be sent his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the <UNK> is wiped out this means the leader has escaped and lance must now lead a second <UNK> and he picks the men the <UNK> can most spare a company of problems to defend the advance <UNK> that had been wiped out and save the command from another attack by stopping up the pass in that <UNK> as lance young gregory peck is quite strong other in the large cast of this film which really shows life at a <UNK> <UNK> looking like an army establishment of <UNK> and <UNK> types includes war bond powerful as a hard drinking sergeant <UNK> brand and steve <UNK> as <UNK> warner anderson and <UNK> <UNK> jr as psychological <UNK> and gig young art baker herbert as fellow officers with <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> wife even barbara <UNK> as the love interest gets by in a difficult role michael is the captured war chief and jeff corey plays the <UNK> there are really two great scenes in this very well made western the long section at the <UNK> before the last <UNK> is sent out and that long <UNK> to the doomed <UNK> <UNK> itself once at that <UNK> peck gets to deliver a grand speech in which at the demand of the men he has <UNK> up for orders he tells them each why he took them along reading them their shortcomings one by one they then tell them why they think he sent his best friend to die in his place take the indian in instead of going himself and he proves them wrong for the remainder of the film by winning his lonely battle through intelligence and courage the music by <UNK> <UNK> is good the production qualities admirable the argument about what would happen if lance takes the war chief in happens to be true other than this mistake by the central character this is is great western it has been a favorite of mine for fifty years
<START> the final entry in the on the <UNK> trilogy sees the usual <UNK> go about their business in <UNK> i feel sure the franchise could have continued but harold <UNK> complained that the screenplays made him look bad in comparison and so no more were made br br it's actually less than two minutes before we get our first <UNK> of <UNK> a woman running for the bus finds her breasts fall out of her dress for no reason whatsoever still it does at least make stan <UNK> <UNK> laugh but then what doesn't he and jack bob grant spend the entire movie laughing <UNK> with little or no <UNK> you get the impression that they'd wet themselves watching paint dry br br as before the only funny element is the genuinely amusing stephen lewis hilarious as <UNK> he's on his own though with a cheesy dated script that even wastes first rate talent like <UNK> <UNK> and henry <UNK> yet it seems as if only lewis understands how to time the shaky material <UNK> laughs out of even the weakest lines describing how her daughter fell in a river <UNK> mum <UNK> i hope it's not <UNK> well it will be now <UNK> <UNK> br br the plot if indeed there is one sees stan <UNK> after a young girl but being continually <UNK> by her <UNK> mother it's a recipe for side splitting hilarity i'm sure you'll agree and whether it's on a storm <UNK> boat or the swimming <UNK> stan and exploits always produce the same result <UNK> boredom later <UNK> include maria an italian stereotype and a staff co worker even <UNK> mum gets a one night stand with stan reminding her to put your tin <UNK> on br br when one of the comic <UNK> is arthur <UNK> <UNK> trying to locate a light switch in the dark i can't find it and thinking she's talking about sex then you can see why this work reaches the upper levels of literary sophistication in fact why it didn't get in the <UNK> top 100 movies is beyond me br br other <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> involve <UNK> anna karen breaking her glasses i don't know what's more surprising the lame predictability of the set up or the underdeveloped pay off the short <UNK> <UNK> follows a man in a <UNK> into the <UNK> thinking he's a woman in a <UNK> the next shot sees her <UNK> out by <UNK> and <UNK> to the ladies and that's it next she ends up in another man's bed and is ordered out by his wife and no that's all there is to that scene too br br when holiday on the <UNK> was last screened on british television there was a breakdown in <UNK> it actually came as blessed relief
<START> first let me mention the fact that in spite of its title in <UNK> there is only one kitchen story as to whether died or not at the end i'm not so sure since in one of the very last scenes his <UNK> is seen lying on the table next to the two <UNK> on the dvd cover there is a reference to <UNK> it claims that the film is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> funny reminiscent of <UNK> <UNK> the great jacques <UNK> relied mainly on <UNK> and silent deadpan attitudes to achieve his comical effects and to offer his <UNK> <UNK> views of his french society of course does take place during the and it does offer some rather faint satirical references to the <UNK> of <UNK> and there are some long moments were no words are <UNK> â but they are not really funny are all these small details enough to make a movie this being said i have to admit that does deal with the sometimes false <UNK> of scientific research versus the of human <UNK> emotions generally speaking the movie was <UNK> slow with nothing much happening with barely any the involving parts were the set up during the first 15 minutes or so and during the last half hour or so indeed the last segment was finally interesting and moving it might seem that it was a short subject of less than an hour <UNK> stretched to some 90 minutes now about the set up a observation on the behavior of single males in their kitchen at first it seemed very promising â with the <UNK> out of the <UNK> and goings of <UNK> in their kitchen as a means to determine what new <UNK> would be most useful to come up with but very quickly this premise turned out to be just a prologue an to introduce the real subject which was only fully developed towards the end and which was about loneliness and the <UNK> bond of friendship pity i honestly wanted to like that movie yes it seemed so promising when i heard about some of its unusual little which were indeed there and which i enjoyed â such as the burning of a nose hair instead of using <UNK> to cut it off the of having a huge <UNK> of black pepper <UNK> away in a <UNK> the role <UNK> the <UNK> becoming the observed a mouth <UNK> sounds from a radio program and there is also a sick horse becoming the <UNK> of half hidden human despair the relative importance of right or left side car driving in sweden and <UNK> a reflection of the importance for each of these very close <UNK> countries to <UNK> its <UNK> am i the sole person who did not fully enjoy that film does this necessarily mean that i'm wrong perhaps <UNK> almost generally praised were in fact for me perhaps could my individual views on this movie ironically reflect the very essence of the film itself which would be the vital necessity to have the right to <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> and not to follow <UNK> <UNK> and opinions each one of us has the right to have different personal views and not to be a slave of the demands of bread winning demands often we do have other <UNK> that would allow each one of us to be useful to our society while <UNK> inner principles in short being true to <UNK> â the way that in that film ends up by giving up his job while <UNK> to stay in his new friend house and help his out with the tasks of his farm and so la as the french say
<START> let me start by saying that there's really no reason to watch this movie i only sat through it because i was trying to kill some time before going to work br br basically it's your typical <UNK> comedy aimed at the teenage set there's nothing remarkable about it other than the complete <UNK> of the story not to mention that there are plot holes big enough to <UNK> a carnival cruise liner through obviously this isn't supposed to be a realistic movie it's supposed to be funny sadly it mostly fails on that count as well i must admit that i laughed a few times but mainly in a holy sh t i can't believe how stupid this is kind of way br br if you never see this movie you're not missing a thing
<START> possible spoilers br br i love dennis quaid and i like meg ryan i was looking forward to seeing them together being married and all i wanted to see their on screen chemistry okay that being said i guess the fact that they are actors their off screen relationship didn't have to <UNK> their performances especially with this script br br how stupid can a professor be to <UNK> himself to anyone i don't remember the original but i can only assume that o'brien probably was <UNK> to his leading lady probably in a more inevitable way if i were <UNK> to someone i'd be pretty angry the crush i would have would definitely have <UNK> quickly meg showed not even a little annoyance only slight surprise dennis would have to take me kicking and screaming that whole section of the movie was so horrible especially meg having to go to the bathroom 2 between <UNK> in the dark at night <UNK> no f ing way br br what's with dennis <UNK> every single suspect in the movie <UNK> first ask questions later not once not twice but too many times i could have kept count if i were so inclined br br the most interesting part of the movie was nick and his family drama too bad that couldn't have become more of the plot the assumed off screen drama leading up to this tragedy i think it could have been written in without distracting from quest br br my blame lies with the writer of this screenplay unless the director and others <UNK> it up so much that it's <UNK> br br i won't even get into the real reason poor <UNK> was murdered how ludicrous is that even when <UNK> confronted the real killer and the reason was explained a true film noir moment everyone on screen seemed bored oh happened oh yawn <UNK> even says this is a silly reason for a triple murder oh the tension you could cut it with a <UNK> br br if anyone but dennis had been in this movie i'd have to give it 1 2 star only because i really have seen worse but in this case 1 1 2 stars br br for dennis and meg stars see anything else
<START> this is the third three stooges short that the team ever made and like a lot of their early ones this is absolutely and totally hysterical now <UNK> it on dvd as part of the three stooges collection <UNK> 1 whenever i feel like it i watch this br br in this short film moe larry and curly play these three doctors in a hospital who are trying to help out everyone but boy they end up making a mess out of everything br br this short is another one of my all time favorite three stooges shorts i also am a very huge fan of slapstick comedy and the three stooges are the kings of slapstick br br when i heard that it got nominated for the academy award for best short film i really became curious about this when i heard that it had lost i was very disappointed about it br br this short is one of the three stooges funniest by far i extremely recommend that you see this hysterical riot br br 10 10
<START> this is one of the best action films i have seen portrayal of the tough as nails gentle mother was superb and samuel l jackson just keeps you laughing all the way through with his classic one liners sure there were a few holes in the actual story but this fast paced flick keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end br br i felt <UNK> was a perfect choice for the role of sam <UNK> and her <UNK> as an actress is evident for her role as the mother in the recent movie both samuel and <UNK> were well supported by david morse brian cox sweet little <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> sexy craig <UNK> and <UNK> this film <UNK> the growing trend of strong female character and the <UNK> away from traditional male female stereotypes as we see sam <UNK> davis and mitch jackson <UNK> from one disaster to the next br br while i and many others loved this movie it is fair to say that there will always be people that don't and that's fine each to their own i highly recommend this film to action fans for its hilarious scenes and fast paced action
<START> i saw this film yesterday on tv i had just finished reading the book in which the movie was supposedly based in the opening credits it said this is a free adaptation of de novel i should have turned off my tv at that moment br br vera idea of free adaptation is turning a story about <UNK> influence over people and the <UNK> of people claiming morality at the end of the 19th century into a story about sex in fact the only thing she adopted from the novel was the sex part which was only mildly referred in de novel and of course the name of some characters br br as of the characters in the novel and <UNK> <UNK> were victims of <UNK> influence was <UNK> by father and all the time she was controlled by him <UNK> <UNK> her fiancé was by the priests because he <UNK> to criticize them in this movie <UNK> every one she meets and father is just another victim <UNK> <UNK> is a dealer of drugs and illegal weapons br br vera <UNK> has turned a novel which criticized moral costumes of an <UNK> and turned it into just another movie with lots of bad sex even worse her story was completely empty of ideas two wasted hours de surely did not deserve this
<START> two soldiers is an excellent example of fine film making the director and producer took a heart warming story and brought it to life with a very skilled and dedicated cast excellent cinematography and very creative artistry br br the relaxed back woods lifestyle of the brothers was depicted with great details and <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> lifestyle that they were thrust into the interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears as they <UNK> with a hard but peaceful life in the back woods of north <UNK> and an even harder life of war br br the acting was great particularly from the younger brother who is new to the big screen played by jonathan to the older brother played by ben allison and the powerful performance by the colonel played by ron <UNK> the performance was extremely well cast br br it was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of two soldiers and i <UNK> recommend it to audiences of all ages
<START> i believe that this movie was a terrible waste of my time and i would know after watching it 5 times in class this movie does not show what absolutely perfectly happened during these times no one can truly say that these things happened to the letter if anything the only good part would be the actors even tho that they were really really crap they were reading the script without expression quite boring i would rather watch play school so i would definitely like to never ever see this movie again in my whole life it is a complete waste of time unless you want your time to be wasted and if you would like to see an unrealistic view of what happened back in 1981
<START> it's one of my favorites tv series a wonderful cast great screenplay and a out <UNK> plot br br watching the routine of the kyle family is of great moments of humor and great comedy performers let's see damon wayans no <UNK> he's one of the <UNK> today se has a perfect timing and always get the point of the joke br br campbell <UNK> paranoid and sentimental jay is just wonderful to see br br george o gore ii perfect for the paper it's impossible to imagine someone else as the adorable and dumb junior br br jennifer nicole freeman the <UNK> claire found the perfect actress beautiful talented br br parker posey impossible to not fall in love for her br br <UNK> grey this boy have future i'm sure of it br br i get very sad when it ends but this show will be in my mind forever michael jay claire junior we love you
<START> its almost embarrassing to say i even saw this movie i mean it doesn't take much to make a good zombie movie besides good special effects lots of blood and gore some scary moments and a decent plot does house of the dead 2 do any of these things right no not one of course its not as bad as its predecessor from uwe and thats the only thing about this movie that scares me br br the dialog in this movie is notorious with such lines as what do you do for a living in response i kill zombies and i was never a <UNK> <UNK> i was a soldier the special effects are embarrassing even for a made for tv movie i mean seriously the zombies all look like they have bloody lips are hyped up on crack the army base in this movie is a parking garage with a desk and a open <UNK> room this movie is so low budget that they couldn't even get co ed locker rooms in fact it seems like this entire movie was filmed in a middle school br br also why is it that the all the female soldiers in this movie are models and for that matter why is everyone in this movie so clueless at to what is going on that they simply just stand around letting the zombies kill them heck one guy even <UNK> to give food to the zombie br br overall this movie makes even the worst of scifi channel movies looks fantastic
<START> sad really sad this movie has nothing hmmm well maybe <UNK> <UNK> to keep you watching it also hurt my eyes to see linda blair in this exploitation flick she certainly deserves better br br so what's the story about let's see warden john <UNK> tapes the inmates in rather inspiring positions while prisoner <UNK> actually runs the prison and little linda must fight to survive sounds like a b movie huh it is
<START> the most enjoyable parts of this film were the clips from the original movie the acting was poor and the premise of sexual was revolting the effects were <UNK> at best there were no stand out performances amy irving was put in this film to try and get a part of the halloween <UNK> audience the original was much more enjoyable and <UNK> i am sorry to say that this is not going to be one of the years 10 best so far it is at the bottom of my list don't bother with this one folks
<START> a powerful debut film from k that explores events in the life of a group of high school students each of them in crisis in one way or another the film starts with the discovery of the body of one of the students then <UNK> the lives of the group over the previous hours leaving the audience in suspense until the last minutes as to the identity of the deceased each of the main characters is facing major which we could see as potentially <UNK> a suicide the cast of <UNK> provide performances full of power and emotion fantastically well done especially considering the youth of the writer director who was 19 years old when he wrote the script
<START> an unusual movie which starts off with the classic premise of a <UNK> who marries a girl who loves him in order to escape the country but a twist soon turns the tale upside down most of the film hits the right buttons the story develops smoothly acting is solid <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is priceless she really can act chemistry between both leads works and rolling american rural <UNK> and quirky side characters really make for a good time the mood which starts off as light and romantic soon moves into something darker and downright <UNK> at times br br at times though the pace slows just a tad more than we would like but don't let this stop you watching this unusual little cinematic treat alexandre paris
<START> okay you saw the film and i saw the film true if not there are plenty of plot <UNK> out there and there is absolutely no reason for us to waste time on any feeble attempts of mine to create another br br the most stunning aspect of the film is <UNK> the performances by the two young men and the young lady in the leads their emotional honesty was as compelling if not more so than any performances i've seen in recent months i found i laughed cried and <UNK> right along with them and that's saying a great deal because i'm often called a jaded and cynical jerk br br as one would expect the story is <UNK> with clichés and i suppose that's the <UNK> <UNK> of the picture it's a story we've all seen many times before we all know how it will end from the moment they introduce <UNK> though you may not know exact <UNK> you know there will be a <UNK> friendship a bittersweet romance and a gut wrenching conclusion if it weren't for the strong cast and directing this film would be nothing more than the <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> percent of the hallmark <UNK> program schedule
<START> where on earth do i start with the mess that is <UNK> firstly the script is one of the worst to ever find its way onto a cinema or tv screen and can only be described as a poorly judged stephen king rip off at one point the supposedly <UNK> jack claims that carol the girl who is helping the man he is pursuing is as annoying as a in a <UNK> i would be laughing if i was making it up but i'm not just as ludicrous is how carol originally came to have the power to see how people die a cat gave it to her when she was holding it during an auto accident she had as a kid what br br secondly for a horror movie it has no sense of tension or threat whatsoever this may not be helped by the fact that all the action happens during stark broad daylight not very atmospheric at all br br <UNK> the acting is truly awful proves again that he needs to be speaking in his native tongue to be even remotely believable jeff <UNK> is obviously on auto pilot but how can blame him as he runs through a <UNK> bogart <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> we get the joke it just isn't funny credit should go to susan an actress i was not aware of she does her best with the awful part she has and puts the other more experienced actors to shame br br at no point is it even explained how the human character can understand what van character is saying to her she obviously has some sort of degree in <UNK> alien languages br br on the plus side one moment is well done the car crash involving susan the <UNK> are <UNK> believable and if it weren't for the hilarious storyline reason for this to occur it would have been <UNK> br br all i can say about <UNK> is that british horror will never recover from its interminable <UNK> if movies like this continue to be made and shown avoid this movie like the plague although the plague would be a lot more scary br br <UNK> 0 5 br br p s the <UNK> in other reviews that the film remains too intelligent for some are honestly hilarious it is a weak <UNK> when some claim you didn't like it because you didn't understand it the letters after my name make a fool of you not me
<START> i'm watching this horrid film as we speak it is possibly one of the worst movies ever aired in my house i'm sitting here with 3 friends and they agree its not scary its not funny its not dramatic it contains nothing appealing whatsoever we are <UNK> minutes in the movie we've only seen 2 <UNK> only one person has died this movie is one big letdown nothing about this horrible horrible movie has made me want to watch the rest i'm getting a movie hang over i hope that everyone who had anything to do with making this movie dies i don't just mean the actors i mean the director producers the <UNK> from the studio that <UNK> this movie it is in full the worst movie ever it should make the imdb worst 100 movies of all time at number 1
<START> i'd love to write a little summary of this movie's plot but there simply isn't one if you just take a look at the plot <UNK> for this title you pretty much know the entire content of the film sex breasts exploitation female frontal nudity and women's prison 80 minutes of pure sleaze and nothing more escape of the island women an alternate title that isn't even listed here clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial woman in prison classic but it totally lacks the brutality of one <UNK> flicks are meant to blend graphic sexual images with shocking violence but the violence here has just been replaced with more sex director <UNK> <UNK> surely can't compete with <UNK> in the field like jess franco or joe <UNK> and he should have <UNK> to making ordinary soft core flicks the only aspects that slightly look like cult cinema are the resemblance of the <UNK> president with <UNK> castro and the group rape of a minor girl by soldiers the girls are ravishing though and the <UNK> filming location looks very enchanting
<START> from <UNK> lane to 15 park <UNK> <UNK> has indeed traveled a long way if the first one goes down in history as a clean <UNK> the latter will definitely <UNK> a special place as a mature film until you see 15 park <UNK> you cannot imagine feeling thrilled and moved at the same time thrilled to see the director's <UNK> and <UNK> in portraying seriously challenging situations and moved by the sensitivity <UNK> throughout the film it is not a movie that merely makes you feel how difficult life must be for but makes you ask a much deeper question about the reality that you see and believe <UNK> has done a brilliant job in <UNK> this supreme fact of our existence that we all are in some way or other trying to live in a make believe world of our own trying to run after <UNK> called happiness peace <UNK> along with the depiction of a <UNK> mind <UNK> magic has brought forth many little nuances of human relationships as they sustain stress and strain the fact that at times we all lose calm break down make wrong choices be haunted by guilt behave <UNK> and so on is captured with extreme by <UNK> she showed the cruel dilemma which <UNK> had to deal with all her life of having to choose between a <UNK> sister and a normal life with a husband and kids for herself and in the act of always being beside her sister always being a strong persona providing support making <UNK> and so on she <UNK> cut off some of the <UNK> that her sister needed to bloom isn't this a very harsh truth that at times in an attempt to do the best for someone we <UNK> their <UNK> and end up hurting their self <UNK> of course and acting deserves <UNK> as always because had the ingredients not been so good the dish could not have turned out to be so extraordinary <UNK> once again made a masterpiece of a movie for those who <UNK> for some food for thought bravo
<START> i truly despair for when they discuss this joke of a programme as if it's intellectually engaging and <UNK> female <UNK> and independence this show is the biggest insult to women next to all those <UNK> hip hop videos if talking like a bunch of reckless teenage boys over 100 <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shopping for unnecessary fashion and jumping into bed with the nearest male in site is considered <UNK> the fate of western women may be doomed as we speak br br aside from the damage it does to the female gender sex and the city is not entertaining not once has it been funny captivating exciting or original the episodes play out <UNK> each character are factory produced <UNK> who behave in the same manner every episode not once have any of these shallow unattractive women evolved perhaps the worst is lead character carrie <UNK> aside from looking hideous her <UNK> for over analysis of relationships is cringe worthy on top of all this the show portrays men as a bunch of empty headed <UNK> who are unable to commit to healthy relationships even when there is a decent man he is somehow painted as a villain the utter lack of empathy for men is clearly the work of some <UNK> pseudo feminist br br saddest part of the whole show is that these women live unfortunate miserable lives any intelligent woman would never envy them it is a banal show with even more banal characters the nyc tourist board must hate the way this garbage is showing up their otherwise fine city thankfully this train wreck is over desperate <UNK> is seen as the fitting replacement for while <UNK> can be quite far fetched at least it explores women in more multi <UNK> ways plus it treats men more <UNK> and it's actually entertaining
<START> i agree with all the comments posted so far this movie was a waste of time and energy for viewers as well as those who made it terrible cgi awful script stupid plot and hey the setting is <UNK> but it looks like california but the worst thing has got to be the native american angle on this which pulls in every stereotype you can think of from the chief surrounded by smoke the angry warrior people speaking without using <UNK> do not do this thing native american <UNK> playing in thin air etc it just shows such a lack of respect and understanding that i was <UNK> out my hair a native american with any ounce of self respect would have tossed their tv out the window at this trash so in closing i'd say this movie is pretty much an offense to everyone
<START> this sequel to problem child is just as bad as the first one it still teaches kids that it's o k to be bad it's impossible for me to recommend this movie to anyone
<START> finding this piece <UNK> between a stale prequel and a <UNK> 80s on a <UNK> <UNK> saturday program would be misleading it deserves better and definitely uses its talented <UNK> best attributes to its maximum advantage <UNK> and walken team to provide a movie that while perhaps predictable to those familiar with their genre do the <UNK> routine that they are so good at portraying for a chance to ride a psychological roller coaster a la <UNK> training day dive back into the world of early <UNK> tv movies to find <UNK>
<START> i have to say this this is the first movie i'm reviewing on here i didn't finish watching i mean i <UNK> t continue no matter how <UNK> i am for watching things until the bitter end 'the <UNK> of the sad <UNK> proved no match to this viewer vanessa redgrave stars as the strange woman in town who does things like walk through the river with a full set of clothes on anyways a long lost relative comes to visit he's a midget <UNK> well that's as far as i got what the heck was the point of all of this i didn't even bother to wait for michael carradine to come on as i was already <UNK> senseless by the combination of the slow script and having to deal with a midget in a dramatic role i call this coffee table cinema the type of cinema that appeals to just a <UNK> few of you but the others just stay away
<START> barry kane robert <UNK> is <UNK> accused on <UNK> a <UNK> making <UNK> for the war he goes on the run meets patricia martin <UNK> lane along the way and she joins him to find and bring the real criminals to justice br br there are a lot of things wrong with this film robert <UNK> was a good actor but he's totally miscast in this role <UNK> lane is pretty but was never a good actress the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense and <UNK> on longer than needed it wears its <UNK> a bit much but this was made while wwii was in full swing and there's no ending it shouldn't work but it does br br it's full of bizarre lines and characters that certainly hold your interest br br for example lane says to <UNK> while they're falling in love i wish i could have met you a hundred years ago lane pays a villain for getting her lunch and <UNK> and lane join a circus <UNK> briefly while on the run also hitchcock's direction was as always just great he throws in some truly amazing shots and sequences especially the statue of liberty climax br br this is not one of hitchcock's classic movie but is still very good and worth catching
<START> this was really a pleasure to see the dialogue was for the most part absolutely outstanding i thought the women's roles were a little better written which is a nice surprise the performances were uniformly very good too frank <UNK> <UNK> it a little when he goes into his various cons but this might be his <UNK> for what i see as weaknesses in how the character is written he's very good otherwise harry <UNK> does similarly well with a slightly <UNK> character tony <UNK> some of the character's <UNK> scenes slightly ursula burton is excellent as sister <UNK> really carrying the film through some of its weaknesses seymour <UNK> and louise <UNK> are a little underused here though i liked their work as always shirley jones <UNK> jill <UNK> and faye grant are very good also i couldn't help thinking grant reminded me a little of catherine o'hara here <UNK> <UNK> rather tears into her role with reasonably good results br br i wish there had been more of a sure hand behind the camera though sometimes the framing or staging seemed a bit off or awkward the closeups seemed <UNK> or <UNK> used to me and we don't always go from scene to scene as smoothly as we'd like some of the tough guy approach to the federal agent music <UNK> was too over the top for me as well and the few fantasy sequences didn't really work but there are things that were very well done the opening sequence set in buffalo around 1970 for example and frankly all of the scenes regarding church work i suspect the writer and actress liked the character a lot which helps the scenes between <UNK> and <UNK> are very good br br the plot is probably a bit there seem to be a few too many schemes going on at once to keep them all straight at times and the <UNK> got to be a little too much and i was a little bothered by the ending should we really be rooting for their biggest con yet to succeed but the ride along the way is very enjoyable it would be nice to see more independent movies like this one made br br 7 of 10
<START> how much do i love this film now i'm not a fan of bad films but i do love a film that is so bad it's good this is one of those juan <UNK> <UNK> pace has a great butt looks <UNK> on screen and definitely doesn't make a bad turn at his acting debut i believe billy zane is suitably mean and moody though i still constantly feel that there is something more in him i felt it in titanic the look on his face when la <UNK> <UNK> on him for example totally broken shocked and put down fierce kelly <UNK> is a pretty face no seriously i think that's it it's worth catching this to see one really hot guy some big <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> nasty <UNK> from billy laugh at the dialogue <UNK> in the scenery and madness of the whole affair i'm <UNK> go watch it again now yes i bought it
<START> sometimes it is difficult to watch films with subtitles in this case danish but the watching is worth it as the story progresses the reasoning for the choice of two sisters to take care of their father is questionable but their society is different their choice leaves them alone until a french woman comes there may be a question on why the french woman came to their place to stay and this is never fully developed the feast which happens later as a result of unexpected <UNK> from france is a source of unusual pleasure to all who attend and something they have not experienced before it provides a fitting thank you for the given to the guest filmed with a dark aura and the display of poverty it is a beautiful experience for the viewer
<START> and it's only january still i'm sure of it br br by far this is among the worst swedish movies i've ever seen and to be honest swedish movies ain't that good in general it have been claimed to be original and perhaps it can be seen as that for people who never seen a english speaking movie for us who have been to the cinema the last 10 years it can't help but to feel like and <UNK> have been sitting down one weekend going through the most successful movies from the last years and tried to squeeze it all together in to one swedish package what can i say the outcome can just be poor first of all the story is just weak to begin with even worse when it's not just a poor story it's a wish to combine to very poor stories first a failed try to make swedish action la matrix and then combine it with a really bad moral story and if you thought it could not be worse you'll notice all the cool stuff that just have been thrown in there for absolutely no reason at all more than in a bad way trying to show that sweden also can do hollywood movies which we can't nor should try to for example the main plot is tried to made deeper by letting <UNK> play a computer game called storm having absolutely nothing at all with the story or for example how there is a internet side about storm while all the sudden it just is the main characters consciousness really i don't think even <UNK> or can see a point with three quarters of the movie more than just trying to show off poor extra effects for the actors i've got to admit eric <UNK> does a pretty good job except he does the same job the whole movie through even tough storm tries to be a movie about the personal development of <UNK> he does not change one bit in his way of acting <UNK> <UNK> well to be honest i thought he was a fairly respected actor but judging by storm really he just have to be ashamed of this movie his character and his <UNK> lastly eva <UNK> is just beyond critic both her character and her acting the only reasons storm succeeds of not getting a 1 10 is for eric <UNK> and what can i say at least it tries
<START> this was my very first bollywood movie and i found it in the same way many other recent viewers did through ghost world having done a little bit of reading up on the film industry of bollywood this week i understand somewhat why there are seemingly unrelated musical numbers and romance and comedy in a horror film but something for everyone doesn't always add up to a cohesive product br br the ultra <UNK> musical dance number <UNK> ho has captivated the world in a way it probably could not have done in 1965 it's all over the internet now with many folks <UNK> for a good english translation <UNK> does an amazing job dancing take after take making it all look fresh new and fun even when any normal person would be exhausted she rules br br on the beach with miss kitty is a light weight fun and pretty tune in total contrast to the horror plot still i find myself singing it in hindi a week later i found a rough translation br br if you want to live in this life then listen to what i say leave your <UNK> behind and join the party take my advice br br those who want to live live with laughter and singing let your hair down and relax people of this world what do you know come to me and i'll explain br br whoever there is who will see me will stop worrying in this world fish swim <UNK> here and there br br my second favorite number in the film is the <UNK> dream where <UNK> is <UNK> by miss <UNK> dancing the electric <UNK> like <UNK> are just wonderfully tacky as is the entire set of this number online i'd seen it described as what would happen if <UNK> threw up way fun br br is not a good movie as a whole that's why i gave it a rating of 3 it's actually a real stinker of a film with some fun <UNK> musical numbers that have nothing really to do with the murder plot
<START> i saw sea of dust as part of a nyc screening audience several years ago i enjoyed the film at that time so i was a little confused by some of the that had been made since perhaps it's my memory but there seemed to be <UNK> of exposition missing from the version that was shown at the <UNK> island film festival i'm really not sure which version i prefer but i can honestly say that i found something to appreciate it both br br let me begin by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie although it's been promoted as a hammer films tribute people expecting a showdown between van <UNK> and dracula are going to be sorely disappointed there's some <UNK> but no nudity a <UNK> of the british production <UNK> later movies and while sea of dust is filled with gorgeous eye candy it really is shot like a sixties film and features hammer <UNK> ingrid pitt it's not like any of the <UNK> pictures in tone or execution this film is very dark very confusing and at times very funny i don't remember the earlier version being quite as nutty as this one but that's not a bad thing especially the showdown in the black forest that plays like a three stooges short and some of ms <UNK> <UNK> are quite entertaining it's like somebody wound her up and turned her loose br br the <UNK> of this film doesn't lie with the borrowed details though it's in the ideas as an occasional sci fi channel viewer i've regularly taken the network to task for its one note variations on a theme cgi monster kills then gets destroyed sea of dust is so full of ideas that you start to trip over them after a while br br but don't get me wrong i'm not complaining if anything i applaud these guys for making such an <UNK> low budget picture and for having the courage to pack it with so many concepts it's not going to be a <UNK> for people who hate to think at the movies you know who you are but for the rest of us those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror films the predictability the lack of respect for the audience this may just be your ticket
<START> sensitive extremely quiet paced love story between a married journalist and his young and neighbor she too also married they lived their love for a time but the obstacles and the fear of hurting their families and children invites to a <UNK> a <UNK> look on delicate question like love friendship honor and loneliness always present in human lives whether you are an american or a chinese i give this a 7 seven
<START> jamie foxx was the epitome of ray charles after a few moments you stop seeing a film and see a biography played by the great man himself ray charles was truly a genius of music and the movie excellently depicted that no one has ever or will ever write play or record music like this musical giant when he passed the flesh the world lost one of it's greatest american heroes as far as the movie the fact that jamie foxx received a classical music <UNK> to college and could play like ray was an asset to the director what could be better than that you don't have to have a double play piano and then try to split the screen from someone else's hands to <UNK> face it worked beautifully i loved the fact that it also picked up how difficult ray was he wasn't always a nice man you didn't also root for him he was a drug addict a <UNK> and sometimes just plain hard headed but i guess that's what made him genius so i can't fault him for that i pick jamie for best actor
<START> well what's wrong with the title separate lies accused elsewhere of not being exciting it's cunning subtle and a bit poetic of course there's a phil collins song and a james belushi film called separate lives which are <UNK> to here br br but the real point is the <UNK> <UNK> of telling lies at different levels that the film <UNK> ok it's not an in your face hilarious title but then it's not an in your face hilarious film please give british films like this a chance they do try to make people think about important things as here how far do you go to protect your life even if it is a bit rotten against unexpected disaster maybe you tell lies maybe you ignore your loved <UNK> lies that can wear a lot of people out br br american movies on this theme are <UNK> but they usually go much further by involving the use of <UNK> which are not a part of everyday life here in europe br br maybe we're not so exciting over here but we don't expect <UNK> like film titles for films that are not aimed at a massive public
<START> the reason why i gave this movie a 4 was for a couple reasons but this movie was not that bad first off the editing i found too be pretty poor at times the script or what they had of one was not very good and if not for la <UNK> the acting would have been crap but all that aside ha ha i know its like the whole movie its not that bad for an extremely low <UNK> low budget film if they would have gotten more money a little better actors but these ones were <UNK> so it was good and a little more detailed script this movie would be terrific somebody has to tell me this guy was influenced a lot by the warriors by walter hill i mean this movie is exactly like it anyone who has seen both those films will agree with me
<START> it is always difficult to bring a <UNK> pages book down to a three hours film i read the book before and i found the bbc production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible the qualities of the book haven't been lost the dense and lively depiction of a <UNK> family in london in the <UNK> the cold and obscene cruelty in which <UNK> is brought up the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking the unexpected and surprising twists of the story the way the film makes the <UNK> look different at the same scenes when they are told first from <UNK> point of view then from one the main actors do very good and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed with a first <UNK> in a very tender love scene between the two and finally <UNK> all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other because they still love each other br br for each of her books the author sarah waters has thoroughly <UNK> what life was like in british 19th century while in <UNK> the <UNK> it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements in <UNK> the dreadful reality of women <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> of spirits in she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in london and the <UNK> treatment of persons supposed or <UNK> disturbed in <UNK> based on the reading of sources and scientific research this is very well transferred to the film so that the <UNK> scenes show a high grade of historic truth i highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful victorian atmosphere vivid emotions and suspense
<START> this is a classic movie that <UNK> the plight of a man who cannot <UNK> to changes taking place in society and feels more and more <UNK> which leads to violence joe is a worker and he is <UNK> and angry and all he is needs is a <UNK> to <UNK> out which is what the story is about alone joe is quiet together with someone else he becomes lethal and what makes the character of joe even more chilling is that he fully his violence so that to him it's not only not bad it's necessary for joe projects his own violent <UNK> onto those who he considers the enemy and therefore considers himself to be in a war and in this movie the generation gap is portrayed as a war but it is a war in <UNK> mind only because the enemy in this case is in his imagination nobody wants to fight joe but joe feels he must defend himself although this movie was released in 1970 it's message is as relevant now as it was then as society continues to <UNK> major changes which lead to the kind of intense alienation that the movie effectively <UNK>
<START> <UNK> the <UNK> 2002 tv was directed by geoffrey <UNK> for bbc television the basic plot is a coming of age story for the protagonist <UNK> played well by <UNK> <UNK> as a teenager <UNK> works in her family run <UNK> house everyone expects her to stay at home then marry an appropriate husband and settle down to family life <UNK> expects this too br br everything changes when <UNK> meets kitty butler <UNK> a beautiful and talented performer who dresses in men's clothes and captures the hearts of her audience the audience includes <UNK> who is sexually attracted to kitty in a way in which she's not attracted to her boyfriend br br the remainder of the film follows <UNK> to london and through her ups sort of and her downs horrible as a lesbian and sometimes male <UNK> br br as is typical for the bbc every role no matter how small is performed by an excellent actor the bbc has a depth and <UNK> of performing artists that is truly marvelous none of the supporting actors stands out in my mind they were uniformly good both <UNK> and <UNK> are wonderful and their acting carries the film along br br it's always sad to be reminded of how difficult life can be for someone who doesn't fit <UNK> mold for what is normal i know it isn't easy for lesbians even in the u s even today imagine the obstacles to love and happiness for lesbians in victorian england we've come a long way but we still have a long way to travel
<START> an intelligent <UNK> of cold war era <UNK> assured destruction policy up until the conclusion it's a all russians and chinese are <UNK> from the face of the earth saw this one at the <UNK> <UNK> science fiction marathon january 2002
<START> i hate to comment on something i didn't finish but if i spare one person what i sat through for almost an hour before turning it off in disgust it will be worth it br br i decided to watch this with an open mind knowing it was on the bottom 100 br br bad idea i usually love crude humor or can at least tolerate it i love so called black comedies i'm not easily offended either br br it started off okay and quickly went downhill i laughed a few times for example when the main character got stuck in the airplane toilet but that was it and didn't compensate for the strong disgust i felt br br i didn't laugh when the dog got sucked into a jet engine i usually can't see the humor in animals dying except in animal house i didn't laugh at much else of the <UNK> either i turned it off after an incident involving a blind man and a baked <UNK> that i don't care to repeat the details of only that the wave of <UNK> still hasn't passed over me br br simply put it was <UNK> filled and simply not funny with barely any plot this is one of the times when if you don't have something nice to say you should get the word out br br don't say i didn't warn you
<START> the title although <UNK> will undoubtedly remind real horror fans of <UNK> <UNK> immortal classic about a <UNK> of circus freaks and how they were misunderstood by the outside world i can assure you however that this thing has absolutely nothing to do with freaks or even with the art of professional film making in general this movie was recommended to me supposedly because it's raw disturbing and thought provoking despite the low budget production values yeah <UNK> the person who recommended it to me may now consider himself to be my personal <UNK> the low budget factor is correct but that about sums it up freak is dreadfully slow poorly made and every character that gets introduced is downright that includes the freak too two siblings on their way to a new life encounter a <UNK> mental patient who escaped from the transport truck to another hospital and heads back to the house where he killed his mother at age 9 this could have been an interesting slasher with good isolated filming locations but instead tyler <UNK> decided to make it boring and pointless family drama the lead <UNK> attempts to look emotionally <UNK> are pretty laughable and the total lack of suspense and action can hardly be blamed to the limited budget total failure
<START> everything about this film is simply incredible you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child br br i do feel it is important to note this tale is about child abuse don't rent it for your kids thinking it is a fun disney <UNK> film
<START> i liked this movie i'm not a big horror movie buff so i couldn't comment on similarities between this and other movies of this genre but i found this movie quite captivating the story line albeit a little obvious had some genuinely scary tense moments and the acting of the lead female role wasn't bad in anyway br br overall i'm a little surprised at the low rating this movie has gotten i watch a lot of movies working in a video store tends to help and this really isn't as bad as people seem to think i do have some criticism though the final call from the cop was terrible almost <UNK> the dead girl in the bathroom looked liked she was having a little sleep probably from the amount of <UNK> she mentioned she <UNK> and the children's reaction to what was happening <UNK> in me the hope that they were ultimately killed br br hope this helps some people
<START> there's considerable amount of money behind this production so the look of it is very good it includes some interesting appearances by gilbert <UNK> eddie burns and a brief cameo at the beginning by christopher lee there are a few exciting <UNK> and a humorous bit or two the satire on <UNK> the man with no name and is amusing especially when they are given the names of failed <UNK> of the mexico revolution br br the trouble is there isn't any purpose in <UNK> the spaghetti western as is attempted here the key element in the <UNK> is irony which easily <UNK> into comedy in fact the source of all is <UNK> <UNK> which is universally recognized as one of the great black comedies of all time and most <UNK> easily slipped over the edge into real comedy of a very sophisticated variety perhaps the best evidence of this is found in the <UNK> films which are both openly <UNK> and openly slap stick comedy so why bother <UNK> a genre that by its very nature <UNK> itself consequently i found the whole enterprise essentially unconvincing none of these characters were people i would ever care about the story was <UNK> cliché and the production values only reflected the money involved not the passion of the director over all a banal and <UNK> effort to cash in on the phenomenon it <UNK>
<START> bought for <UNK> project vampire is one of the worst movies i have ever seen wooden acting lame effects and a terrible storyline all add up to be a movie you have no reason to even want to see <UNK> is one of those movies that don't even have the good grace to be bad in an enjoyable way instead this <UNK> seems to try to make itself as <UNK> dull stupid and crap as <UNK> possible br br a vampire has created a serum he sells to old people as a life <UNK> and those who take it fall under his control a former lab <UNK> teams up with a nurse to try and stop him someone should have stopped the makers of this rubbish br br no one has any reason to see this movie and i am actually appalled at the human race on the grounds that at time of writing 2 people have given this atrocity 10 out of 10
<START> i haven't seen the more recent which is based on this but i'd bet on this one as the better creation i know of no other movie that has so well portrayed the intricate <UNK> of the drug trade and the <UNK> on drugs i've watched this one at least four times and am enjoying it again as part of masterpiece <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> hard justice is an excellent action movie the whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting for the people who say they don't make shoot em ups like they use to well this one is really hard core david <UNK> is really good and his character takes a <UNK> in the movie he gets hit by the stick over a dozen times gets stabbed in the back and is in a coma for three days and then wakes up and fights again gets beat up <UNK> and is ready for more action his character is incredibly <UNK> charles <UNK> was very good as well and he arguably steals the show wells was good professor <UNK> <UNK> had a short and an uncredited role in hard justice as for the action it is truly awesome with all of the gun fights and the huge stand off like scene in the beginning has cars getting blown up and flipping up in mid air there is so much that happens in the 95 minute run time for the action fans you will be blown away by all of the fire power and fighting that this film has to offer hard justice is a movie that isn't easy to locate and if you are at a video store and you see it for sale buy it up because this movie is big keeper an d plus the box is cool there is a ton of action that has to be seen to be believed look and see if you can find some good deals on ebay half com amazon <UNK> z <UNK> and market place sellers i strongly recommend that any action movie fan who loves shoot and fighting movies and has been disappointed by other movies that have the look like a true non stop action flick but fails to deliver it to get hard justice
<START> it happens often while growing up a hollywood movie <UNK> a youth it not only lasts a lifetime but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career such was the case with the 1954 film entitled the egyptian audience were <UNK> with the sets costumes and great acting of this film so much so other films soon followed in like vain this is the story of a young egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born with such a dubious beginning it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life asking questions the boy sin oh way which means <UNK> that is <UNK> edmund <UNK> grows to <UNK> and continues asking why even as he <UNK> from the school of life to become a <UNK> during his <UNK> years he <UNK> a <UNK> friend named brilliantly played by peter ustinov and victor mature who raises from a simple officer of the guard to commander of the <UNK> his life offers everything from a quick rise in social status to condemned criminal to <UNK> a wondering <UNK> and eventually to a station in life he never expected fine acting goes to jean simmons as merit michael <UNK> as <UNK> as the <UNK> and john carradine as a memorable grave <UNK> tommy <UNK> plays the son of the egyptian in his final years <UNK> that is alone ' finally discovers the answer he had been seeking all his life which he to his son now in the care of his <UNK> friend excellent film
<START> i have always wanted to see the movie because i loved the novel but was warned away because i'd heard that the movie was a stinker it is wrote the script and i could follow it fine despite the fact that i read the novel over thirty years ago br br the soundtrack is <UNK> jarring <UNK> and utterly inappropriate breaking any attempt at mystery or mood in the movie i suspect that the director must take a lot of the blame as even michael caine is terrible in it and he was already doing excellent work in <UNK> a couple of years earlier br br the mysteries <UNK> by the book are not well translated onto the screen i'd love to see someone remake this one
<START> i had known brad at florida state u in the early 70's when he was an inspiring inventive writer who i thought was headed for greater glory br br and that is why i rented this video well well well the time has not been kind to mr i suppose the <UNK> of making a living makes higher aspirations <UNK> another flower whose bloom has come and gone un noticed in the summer <UNK> <UNK> there is nothing more to say and nothing more to add a sad <UNK> to a once <UNK> career as stated above but it is the price one pays for chasing shadows without a firm foundation or goals for <UNK> in life because this movie has no goal no purpose and i kept telling myself what happened to creativity his once shining genius gone gone years of neglect has <UNK> his once shining mind
<START> as a retired <UNK> <UNK> aircraft <UNK> this has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the fact that a teenager could ever get on the flight line much less get into an f 16 is ludicrous the military spends millions on each pilot to make them the best in the world and this movie makes the air force and all its members seem stupid at best yes i know it is only a movie but it conveys a message to the younger folks that we are all idiots and believe me we are not the <UNK> involved in setting up any type of mission are highly involved even in the eighties military computers were too secure to hack by any teenager and the other flaws in this movie make peter pan more believable sorry to me this movie has no entertainment value at all
<START> i don't know how i would feel if i lived in usa i would watch some preview scenes <UNK> i would know sidney <UNK> directed it harrison ford and <UNK> scott thomas starring in i would watch this film as soon as possible without reading any bad review would i be disappointment br br i read a lot of review which is said how bad this film was this is boring long film without passion emotions and it is not interesting harrison is wooden cold the should be cut too serious particularly for harrison ford i am interested in the subject and i like harrison ford in the films which are not actions i like sidney <UNK> and <UNK> scott thomas too so reading the reviews on imdb website then in other sites then in <UNK> in the hungarian movie magazines i was wonder and wonder what the film was anyway there are films directors stars what who i want to see despite any reviews br br i can understand people who thinks this film is boring and cold and has got not any passion but i feel different it is true i liked <UNK> doors the forbidden woman this is a french film i don't know what its title in english or in french basic of these films is development of a love br br i think random heart is a nice and interesting film in its own way br br it may be true that the the <UNK> election and the <UNK> investigation after a corrupt policeman are not written well are not worked out in details but add something to the leading woman and man character after his wife's death and betrayal emotion angry of dutch comes to the surface during his work he will be suspicious and almost lost his best friend then the woman too the film shows two ways to survive the tragedy our wife husband's death and cheating one of them is the woman's this is tragedy but the life is continuing she doesn't want to <UNK> forever what she wants to know what her husband's lover the <UNK> wife thought about her she will not learn never she is forced to behave in this way the <UNK> are comes and anything about his husband may become scandal she wants her daughter not to be disappointment with her father the man is a cop he suffering from the fact he lived in lies he wants to know maybe every men would want to know in this situation when his wife started to cheat him how long had she got lover he needs the woman's help but she doesn't want but the guy is stubborn and steady <UNK> the woman can't stand him because he always steps into her life and she cannot forget their relationship is tense at the beginning then slowly developments a type of silent sympathy which is prefer an alliance against the outside world the tragedy i said it in spite of that they made love in bed however the cop can't stop with investigation can't stop close and can't allow the woman close to him but he starts the love and the woman wants their relationship to continue but it can't the woman realizes it the end is a bit sad but logic and nice at the same time br br it was pleasant for me to see again peter <UNK> i like this man's face sidney <UNK> i hardly knew bonnie hunt but she was good br br i think harrison ford did an okay job his is unusual but at the beginning then finally i believed that the woman liked being at his company in spite of his <UNK> it was pity he had not got any joke but ford has got a good sense of humour a reviewer noticed in <UNK> ford is charismatic against his <UNK> and ear drop and we are waiting for his presence and would like him to smile at us and make an ironic notice but dr jones is not smiling at us but he smiles at the end and it is <UNK> good with the rest i agree i very like him in this role he is good in acting of this a bit rough cool but somewhere in his soul smart cop the character of <UNK> scott thomas is a woman who is determined self confident but she is closed inside a <UNK> tower and she keeps <UNK> from her emotions but she is a really woman who become <UNK> and find support on the cop the two cool reserved people find each other br br maybe the script is not good it is full of common banal sentence but there are some humorous sentences from the woman and movement particularly from the man it is a good film but not for everybody not for the general big audience i watched the females under 18 and males above 45 liked this film better about the latter maybe sidney <UNK> made this film for his age group which doesn't go to <UNK> anyway i advice the people who like energetic plots with action scenes who like only ford's action films miss this movie
<START> i must begin by saying that this is one of the most annoying films i have seen in my entire life annoying factor number one never seeing the son's face for the entire movie and the infinitely more annoying factor that <UNK> <UNK> phone nothing but listening to the phone ring over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over you get my point the old man was being <UNK> but the viewer was too at first the film was interesting to me but it <UNK> very quickly the film may possibly have been good as a short but was definitely not enough to maintain anything approaching feature film length i guess what i am trying to say is that the message about racism which finally put in an appearance during the last two scenes of the movie is secondary to this old mans being <UNK> who cares to sit and watch what is really nothing more than an old man <UNK> <UNK> at someone prank calling him if you've never seen a movie that just gets under your skin and drives you crazy check this one out
<START> a wonderful film in the best <UNK> magic tradition with very far <UNK> analysis of much of the big issues we are just starting to face br br should be <UNK> viewing for all politicians br br take your pick from <UNK> nuclear global climate change quality of life br br reminiscent of <UNK> but with modern twist and considerable humour br br i'm not <UNK> although i've <UNK> there and have good <UNK> friends but i found it totally accessible and also <UNK> informative
<START> i think this tv film was first aired the same week that <UNK> <UNK> played in the <UNK> league final 1999 they run a lot of football related items that week and this one was an absolute standout br br it played on all the clichés that are <UNK> out every season during the <UNK> cup ie <UNK> <UNK> lucky clothing <UNK> name on the cup etc and turned out to be brilliantly funny br br i'm surprised it has never been repeated prior to other big football occasions even now with the world cup just getting <UNK> br br a few previous <UNK> from non football fans have said they still love it but a football fan will find it hilarious imho
<START> once again there's <UNK> government <UNK> stopping at nothing to prevent public knowledge of some <UNK> events in this case the discovery of a new underwater species that could <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> although the creature is no e t he does seem to <UNK> one <UNK> who <UNK> it at all costs not <UNK> it is but an <UNK> of the species and is going to get a lot bigger  and <UNK> this 2005 series had a lot going for it it is family drama sci fi thriller with more than a few comedic moments the characters are believable well acted and well photographed the show holds the attention of course as with any sci fi show suspension of disbelief has to be achieved and i think it is here alas the series crashed after season one so we never get a resolution <UNK> there is a general comment i feel worth making here many tv networks and or film distribution companies <UNK> quite <UNK> seemingly excellent tv series  particularly intelligent sci fi ones now there may be some very good reasons for this although the audiences are treated with <UNK> disdain and rarely told the reasons this in itself is annoying what really gets my goat is that having cancelled the series they then issue the thing as far as it's got on dvd in an obvious attempt to milk the cash cow as far as possible for previous viewers of the series that's ok they know what they're in for but  many of these unfinished series end on a cliffhanger two that come to mind immediately are surface and odyssey 5 if you've heard good things about the series and not seen it you go and buy the <UNK> dvd and end up with an <UNK> plot issue  it makes me very angry i enjoyed surface immensely and didn't realise the poor characters would end up in a situation that looked totally <UNK>  and we'll never know what happened next i believe that there should be a prominent notice on all such dvd issues to the effect that the story is unfinished nowadays i check on tv series <UNK> imdb is an obvious excellent starting point to find out whether a <UNK> series is really complete or not <UNK> beware
<START> i generally like this movie a lot the animation is supreme meaning they took to trouble to <UNK> the hair and fur on animals and people and being an amateur at graphics and animation self teaching myself through books for those who are curious on the same matter i use the program by <UNK> it is a high quality free program that can be <UNK> from the internet i see that the quality of animation shown here is of high standards br br the plot of this movie is good though this movie lacks character development this story is still understandable generally i believe that this movie is primarily should be watched by people who are fans of the game as its plot closely follows the game as for me i do not play the games and therefore i don't have the <UNK> effect it probably does on fans of the game br br for those who like the game i suggest this movie to you and if you haven't played the game i would still recommend this movie to you
<START> the only reason any of the hundred or so users watched this movie was because they belong to the crew were friends to the crew or were obsessive fans of either lance <UNK> or <UNK> lamas i personally follow the cult of lance so i was disappointed to see that despite being the <UNK> it's in name only playing rich criminal <UNK> lance is a joy to watch but all of his screen time is <UNK> to the beginning of the movie <UNK> sets up a <UNK> heist which includes lamas and a bunch of forgettable characters the biggest shock to this viewer was that the pre heist scenes were not all that bad with the exception of somewhat obnoxious and rather confused looking <UNK> who times every line with the <UNK> of a grade school play actress acting was decent all around and none of the lines really made me cringe br br but once the heist occurs the movie falls asleep not only is their plan the most ridiculous thing ever captured on film but it's dragged out for far too long this isn't a very deep movie and you have to fill out your 90 minutes but these scenes are so boring i nearly <UNK> off at two in the afternoon one particular sequence in which we watch each and every one of the characters perform the same task over and over again is especially difficult to get through the movie's name is rapid exchange but the exchange is far from rapid it's overlong and <UNK> to extremes perhaps it would have worked if any of the characters had real personalities but come on there's only so much you can ask out of a straight to video movie airing of showtime extreme br br thankfully there are several laughs intentional and unintentional <UNK> lamas is seemingly a master of disguise which makes for a couple of incredibly bizarre scenarios and lance returns in the film's end albeit for a brief period of time it's a bad movie and i probably didn't have to tell you that myself but it's far from the worst thing i've ever seen i wouldn't put it too high on the list of <UNK> films since he's been in some real gems with greater screen time and either way the movie loses a lot of steam once the heist begins but the best thing i can say for rapid exchange is that the last two films i watched before it were the mainstream hostage and the overrated pretentious crash and this was better than both
<START> i watched this movie last night and let me say it's the absolute worst thing i have ever seen the entire film is a train wreck and it's not the actors it is the horrible script br br spoilers alright eddie loses his job to a monkey his nerdy son is disappointed the bathroom goes crazy br br he gets a free vacation he goes along with uncle nick and the original <UNK> their <UNK> crashes they stay on an island they are stupid and don't even bother to look at the nearby hotel br br ok so that's that what makes this movie pathetic is the humor it is so horrid and stupid you can't even laugh and it's not stupid funny humor either i couldn't laugh the entire thing
<START> hello everyone all i have to say is that human traffic and all of its characters are so real its funny i live in australia melbourne and i'm finally out of the <UNK> and staying out all weekend lifestyle this movie explains everything that is currently going on in the world so exactly that i cant stop watching it i used to be exactly like so my friends said and i hadn't even seen the movie i left the weekend <UNK> behind about 3 months ago after 4 years of intense <UNK> to change my life around i was at a dvd store when i saw human traffic and i remember my old friends going on an on about it so i bought it to see what all the fuss was about i was so into it i watched it 4 times in a row because i couldn't believe that someone had made a movie that explains everything to a t anyways this movie is by far the best and funniest movie i have ever seen its funny because its so truthful in everything that goes on in the movie and is a legend thats all i have to say enjoy 11 10 blew my <UNK> off at how real it was its exactly whats going on in the world <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> a lot br br take care everyone
<START> i consider <UNK> as hitchcock's first american film because the story takes place completely in u s br br there are brilliant scenes in this film statue of liberty scene barry kane jumping into the water from the bridge water fall scene are amazing its not hitchcock's fault that he didn't get the actors he wanted hitchcock originally wanted gary cooper for the leading roles in foreign <UNK> and <UNK> but gary cooper wasn't interested in doing a thriller another reason why hitchcock didn't get big stars was because he wasn't one of top directors although rebecca was a huge success still most of film's success went to producer david o <UNK> for example david o <UNK> got best picture oscar for rebecca and hitchcock didn't get a best director oscar for rebecca hitchcock started getting some attention after foreign <UNK> 1940 but universal gave him a low budget for <UNK> 1942 hitchcock tried to get joel <UNK> for this film because he was willing to work with hitchcock again with a low <UNK> he enjoyed working with hitchcock in foreign <UNK> 1940 but he was <UNK> so the role went to robert <UNK> hitchcock called robert <UNK> a competent performer i thought he did his best he was a less known actor who was willing to play a role when many big actors refused to play the leading male role br br as for leading female role hitchcock wanted margaret <UNK> or barbara stanwyck for the leading role they weren't interested either so universal decided to give the role to <UNK> lane i read in a book that this was one of her favorite films br br i also liked the scene at blind man's house that is my favorite scene if we listen closer to the dialogue in scenes that happen in uncle <UNK> house then we will see how intense it is uncle philip blind man was studying barry <UNK> character the moment he entered his house the moment barry entered his house he heard <UNK> <UNK> through conversation he realized that barry kane isn't a criminal at all we also see his hearing ability through those scenes for example barry hears the sound of a car says is that a car coming uncle philip says 2 cars i think uncle philip was right we see 2 cars in the next scene <UNK> lane did a fine job playing her role she was no big star but i thought her performance was really good another brilliant scene in uncle <UNK> house is the scene where he asks <UNK> lane patricia martin are you frightened pat is that what makes you so cruel i thought otto krueger played the villain brilliantly hitchcock wanted harry carey for the villain but he refused harry carey is famous for his role mr president in mr smith goes to washington i want to mention more about this film but i think my post is getting too long br br every hitchcock film is special in its own way i am sure hitchcock fans will like this film i rate 10 out of 10
<START> ignore everyone else's comments for this movie and watch it on pay cable like i did or rent it you owe it to yourself this film is what movies are supposed to be all about hard to <UNK> and god knows how this was pitched as a high concept but this is one for the angels check it out what have you got to lose
<START> this movie is a mix of a dark comedy and a drama about two guys who worked in a <UNK> shop and wanted to build up their own when they finally <UNK> that dream they faced a new problem there were no <UNK> one day by accident one guy dies in the <UNK> room and a new kind of <UNK> business <UNK> they start selling human flesh saying to the <UNK> it's just and their business starts to improve human flesh sells good oh i forgot to say <UNK> these guys aren't normal there's really something missing in their brains br br the movie has some nice dark humour scenes but it is in my opinion mostly a drama one that shows us what is inside the head of a psychopath what are his motivations to what he does i must confess i was a bit surprised with the ending of the movie because i never expected they could make it without been discovered but that's probably because i see too many hollywood what i mean by this is that in hollywood's cinema we always expect the punishment of the guys which do the bad things there's always a morality protecting the good values in spite of we all know that in real life it doesn't happen this way too many and i liked this movie mostly because of that because it fits in a kind of cinema which is true frontal without fake and which see what is on the other side behind the conventional morality  it just happens in independent cinema especially in the european br br besides <UNK> excellent performances by <UNK> lie <UNK> and <UNK> especially the first one in the roles of the disturbed guys  br br very nice danish film
<START> i just watched this movie on bravo and it was absolutely horrible it has the plot of a shannon <UNK> movie without the nudity the premise was interesting enough a winning <UNK> ticket in a secluded area and people who have reasons why they want the money the characters were trite as were the observations on human nature and greed br br for a movie called class <UNK> it had very little to do with class differences other than the first 20 minutes and the predictable ending this movie could have done a lot better if there had been more characters with motivations to get the ticket and was a who done it br br the acting wasn't fantastic but it's hard to seem believable with such a terrible script lindsey is very cute and i'd like to see what she could do in a better production with a better script she's probably the only reason why i sat through the whole movie br br
<START> sure it is a new take on vampires who cares i would rather the old take if it is entertaining this was not entertaining it was a dull story poorly acted with annoying cinematography save your money don't even watch it on video
<START> one of the most <UNK> movie i thought <UNK> will do a bit of acting but alas all my hope went wrong given that the heroine is 15 <UNK> old <UNK> what did they thought before considering the actress may be its because no wants to work with <UNK> as he is called in the film human <UNK> as many people wrote in nevertheless it was a disappointment i hope the producer doesn't make himself <UNK> by making a part 2 of this as this news is <UNK> around the story was predictable one with <UNK> showing his <UNK> character throughout the movie which i doubt very well br br anyways the movie is good from those people's angle who thinks <UNK> cant do anything wrong 4 out of 10
<START> this tv series is about a foolish and unconventional english gentleman who gets up to all sorts of merry <UNK> br br i remember watching mr bean with my family back in 1990 when i was still a child my family laughed so hard at every episode and the <UNK> of which still come up in our daily conversations twenty years later the memorable scenes which are still in my head include mr bean attempting to get out of his car park shooting out the lights counting sheep and him in the swimming pool we bought all the mr bean videos on vhs no <UNK> how expensive they were it was worth it because we watched them over and over again it is so rare to see a very funny tv series that is suitable for all ages
<START> honestly people who gave this movie a ten would have given 100 for pulp fiction this is the level that we are dealing with here br br the movie isn't bad but no way is it like <UNK> the best movie since pulp fiction some people have incredibly low expectations for movies even those of indie variety personally i found my interest in the movie <UNK> after the half hour mark the plot defies logic and belief you have got to hear the part about why the wife did what she did in order to save her husband yeah right i guarantee that you would walk out of the theatre thinking hmm now that doesn't make sense at all this is one movie in which you really need to suspend all logic and belief br br those who said that the music score is good were probably listening to their <UNK> players it absolutely killed the movie in some parts br br in conclusion watch the movie only if you have nothing particular important to do i give this a three because there is one long sex sequence in the motel which is decent
<START> ok i was bought this a few ago by my brother in law who took me to see get <UNK> in the cinema which the both of use were uber impressed with and watched both get <UNK> and be cool one after another i have read reviews of people that had not seen get <UNK> and thought this film was quite good i just think its another way for film companies to cheat the paying <UNK> all i have to say about this film is wtf after nearly 10 years and <UNK> <UNK> had become a <UNK> the script was basically the same they teamed up travolta and thurman after their success of fiction threw in a couple of big stars plus a shed load of <UNK> and thought that it was going to be good vince <UNK> character was just annoying despite me being a fan of both him and the rock both of the actors were way under <UNK> and unrealistic basically i am glad that this was bought for me as a present as if i had paid money for it i would have been super annoyed
<START> ill conceived sequel the absurd idea of having the killer snowman on the rampage at an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather brings back the spirit of the psychopath returning thanks to a scientific experiment providing foreign elements which life to his <UNK> it's the best i could do to explain this preposterous concept br br i could go into depth about how he winds up at the island in order to <UNK> numerous tourists but i simply find no reason to bother because it'd all be so <UNK> anyway the filmmakers think it wise to kill off the pretty girls not ten minutes after their arrival i mean seriously why worry with even introducing them to us if we can't enjoy our eye candy no longer that this br br the snow <UNK> murder scene takes the cake ice <UNK> from the <UNK> sand so that a victim can fall on them oh and another girl is stabbed with a pair of <UNK> <UNK> br br look i get what's coming to me when i sit down to watch a killer snowman movie such a ridiculous supernatural slasher will either <UNK> your oh it's such a wonderfully cheesy horror movie or have you <UNK> why the hell you're wasting time with such nonsense jack frost has the power to freeze water then how were they able to melt him in the first film and causes the island resort to snow one sequence has jack <UNK> pool water <UNK> a swimming model under the sheet result being her drowning with nowhere to escape oh there's also a recreation of the tongue stuck to the icy pole bit from the christmas story dude br br i gotta hand it to the cast though they're real troopers for trying to make this wretched material entertaining christopher <UNK> perhaps <UNK> returns as sam to face his old nemesis as does <UNK> <UNK> as his wife the attempts at tongue in cheek humor for me at least fell flat but the cast soldiers <UNK> trying to make the most of a very difficult situation with spirited performances they do their best to rise above the pitiful premise and <UNK> dialogue br br a development occurs which <UNK> the danger towards those still around to face off with jack his <UNK> altered water <UNK> thanks to the introduced foreign elements allow him to <UNK> anti freeze and even worse he now can <UNK> through <UNK> jack <UNK> up what appear to be <UNK> which <UNK> to reveal little <UNK> with black eyes mouth and sharp teeth the killer snowman costume and little <UNK> puppets introduced later in the film might produce belly laughs if you are in the mood for such <UNK> but i personally found this junk rather hokey that's the purpose behind it i suppose cheap <UNK> from those willing to embrace this and unbearable the <UNK> <UNK> is an obvious homage to <UNK> where we get a bar scene where the little <UNK> are celebrating in number over <UNK> victims at the resort the weapon against them <UNK> it's explained that when jack went to kill sam in the first film both fell in a truck bed full of anti freeze an <UNK> <UNK> from jack's belly was <UNK> <UNK> chest when he pushed them out a window into the truck bed and i guess in their being being linked by the <UNK> jack inherited <UNK> banana <UNK> or so this is what we are led to believe and in doing so both <UNK> in a sense br br <UNK> such a film as this defies simple explanation it's a film with effects and plot so terrible one might find the presentation enjoyable because of it's many <UNK>
<START> when at the very start of the film <UNK> donald sutherland arrives at the <UNK> family's house and it comes out he is the <UNK> <UNK> for one of the members executed for murdering his mother two years ago your sensation is that you are about to watch a top thriller an innocent man has been convicted and a killer is still around but as the film runs along your disappointment <UNK> inevitably br br ordeal by innocence is a dull and at times even boring film that doesn't raise at any moment nothing interesting happens all along and even the final revealing of the facts lacks surprise and intensity <UNK> you guessed or not br br donald sutherland <UNK> plummer faye <UNK> and sarah miles far from her good performance in <UNK> daughter just pass through their roles and not very <UNK> either br br you won't miss much if you skip this one
<START> thank god for this movie it's a document of talent that three decades later seems even more unique and rare in retrospect br br the music is just extraordinary packed with so much talent in writing performance <UNK> and production that it's absolutely <UNK> the lyrics and vocal <UNK> are incredible the performances by under appreciated talents like <UNK> carter and <UNK> woods <UNK> my spirit every time i hear them while the film may be different from the stage version i prefer the soundtrack to the cast album which i find truly grating and under developed here the <UNK> are filled out and expanded into dynamic pieces that couldn't have been produced in a stage setting br br but the music isn't the only thing extraordinary about this movie the <UNK> of almost hyper <UNK> dialog scenes reminds me of altman films <UNK> with <UNK> musical and dance numbers really works all the talent in this movie directing writing photography editing music choreography casting acting <UNK> art direction <UNK> perfectly into one of the best musical films i've seen br br i think it's amazing how much we know about the characters in hair based on very little information or plot they're not drawn as caricatures but as realistic and very human people we see little glimpses of where they come from but the portrait is completed by vignettes that draw the characters to the surface through accomplished acting directing and editing there's an <UNK> theme of the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> which colors their characters by exposing their reckless macho hippie ideology the scene of home life reveals important details about his psychology and the brief glimpse of <UNK> home tells us volumes about his background through the simple realistic and genuine interaction between claude and presumably his father br br i love the fashion in this movie it <UNK> mixes sixties ideas with very seventies looks one does have to overlook treat <UNK> hair <UNK> it's a document of how <UNK> much of the late seventies was contrary to the conventional wisdom that the era was all about bad taste <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tie was a hot trend of 1979 and the hair and clothing of the singers and dancers particularly those in white during the central park scene mixes up the decades in a way that suggests the <UNK> of the <UNK> themes these elements <UNK> with extraordinary state of the art choreography in a way that enhances the artistry of both br br hair isn't a film that <UNK> cynicism if you come to it with expectations then you're most likely going to be held captive by artists who aren't bound by your rules for me it opened my eyes and ears and spirit to an insightful and passionate musical dialog about war friendship and family that <UNK> its time and is still meaningful and relevant to me to this day
<START> the movie has started the <UNK> spin your car has entered a race against the fox you're behind you can't get in front you figure if i go out i'm taking you with me you smash into the cars <UNK> on the side of the road you turn to hit fox but your aim is bad bang you've gone up the back of a <UNK> and smash you've landed in a <UNK> your car lights on fire you could get out if you wanted but the shame of losing has taken you bang your car blows up everyone looks on in despair some crying the sound of a <UNK> tells you the cops are coming everyone gets in their cars and <UNK> leaving you to burn the <UNK> remains of the cars frame sits there haunting the on <UNK> you're dead br br this is one of the scenes actually its the first scene in the movie there are many more like it as you enter the <UNK> of the fox in his <UNK> out ford terry <UNK> in his crazy and many others in this blast from the past john <UNK> masterpiece running on empty he'll win at any cost
<START> i probably have to blame i sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the title black dragons and revolves on secret wwii <UNK> nazi plastic <UNK> and revenge this film is a dull failure with an incomprehensible structure the actual plot which basically is rather ingenious and intriguing only becomes clear during an <UNK> near the end but the problem is that you stop caring a long time before we see how horror icon bela lugosi <UNK> in a society of prominent american politicians and kills them one by one the story is timed right before wwii and  especially after witnessing the ending  it surely is a premise with lots of potential so it's quite a shame it isn't <UNK> more proper there is however one great dialogue that i can't resist sharing man towards woman do you want to marry me why so i can beat you the only way you'll leave this place it's the only highlight in an overall very boring movie bela lugosi is lovely  as usual  but his spooky performance alone is hardly worth <UNK> this film if you're interested in seeing other <UNK> performances of his in movies with decent screenplays check out invisible ghost the corpse <UNK> white zombie and of course the 1931 dracula version
<START> i cannot believe how perfect this movie is great cg graphics good storyline and the fights oh the fights this movie was great the characters they look real enough to be considered real they definitely resemble the ones from the game perfectly the scene in which well all the scenes made my jaw drop fantastic 10 10 graphics the story perfectly explained plus the way comes to help cloud at many different times in the movie they explain it very well and make your jaw drop from how perfect it is but the repetitive fights do take some story out but that is only a minor thing story 9 5 10 everything else great the movie was just amazing i really do not know what more i can say except that this movie was pretty much perfect i loved it
<START> the end of <UNK> is an important documentary about modern <UNK> on cheap energy and the coming peak in world oil production the film is an excellent introduction to the peak oil phenomenon and includes interviews with experts like <UNK> to vice president dick 2001 energy task force <UNK> simmons author richard <UNK> and actions for a post <UNK> world and author michael t blood and oil the dangers and consequences of america's growing <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> br br economic growth is <UNK> upon more electricity electricity is <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> energy period and <UNK> simmons made a very clear statement he said future growth is not possible and for a guy from his background to say that was one of the most that's like the catholic church saying the earth is round before <UNK> michael c <UNK> br br the peak has happened and now instead of being <UNK> we're now historians kenneth
<START> inspired casting charming and witty throughout much like the <UNK> in the opening moments of the film the story <UNK> along magically until you are emotionally invested in its outcome the city of buffalo has never looked better kudos to the burton sisters and the entire cast for a job well done
<START> i saw this at my city's independent cinema no surprise because no mainstream theatre would want its <UNK> on this train wreck br br the camera work is very distracting the constant shifting and <UNK> could <UNK> a sensitive person to have motion sickness it looks more like a film <UNK> project than a serious movie br br though well acted the characters are unlikeable josh is <UNK> always trying to manipulate situations and people to his advantage without any context to emily and <UNK> relationship she comes off as a whiny insecure girl who's desperate to get married <UNK> is an emotional <UNK> incapable of understanding the <UNK> of human interaction without any redeeming qualities i didn't care about what happened to any of them br br obviously some people liked this movie as the couple sitting behind me were laughing hysterically of course they could have just making fun of it i could hardly blame them for it
<START> i just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one paul <UNK> lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot he would probably say it was easy but he really does a great job and should have won something for it we've had the dvd for several years and my kids boy now 4 1 2 and girl 9 will watch this one over and over and the humor is adult enough that i don't mind having to hear it in the background and i do run to the tv for the really funny parts simple moral message lots of decent action and slapstick bad <UNK> acting goofy to take the edge off minimal bad language and minimal <UNK> jokes make it hard to beat for a family standard
<START> avoid this one it is a terrible movie so what if it is very exciting all it is is just pointless murders and the whole thing with thorn and michael's curse that was the absolute worst thing they could possibly do to the series why couldn't they leave michael's story a mystery he's supposed to be the boogeyman not part of some stupid cult ugh thank god for halloween <UNK> which wiped out halloween 3 6 they all sucked but anyway if you see this movie please expect no more than pointless murders and gore
<START> i purchased this dvd recently and i was totally <UNK> that <UNK> songs sound the same as they did when i first listened to them in 1980 the <UNK> of <UNK> lee alex and neil is so talented that i want to listed to them play again and again br br songs i remember like tom <UNK> the big money the trees closer to the heart <UNK> and the spirit of radio were played and the plus fans there singing along and having a great time and i swear over half the audience was under 25 br br writers who put down rush as far as rush fans like myself are concerned are a bunch of jealous <UNK> who like to taste <UNK> sour cream mixed with <UNK> in a <UNK> br br rush doesn't put on makeup wear <UNK> lip sync wear <UNK> get in trouble with the law and have a band member <UNK> about how long they have been <UNK> all they do is entertain br br i give this dvd a 100 out of 100
<START> james the king is a film that <UNK> me i can't think what its meant to be for it's a story about a young man called elvis played by <UNK> garcia <UNK> who gets an <UNK> <UNK> after 3 years navy service and then goes off to find his <UNK> father and behaves with him and his family it's all rather sick really elvis worms his way into the family by <UNK> his 16 year old sister james it's rather impossible to identify with anyone in this film from here in middle england preacher father and <UNK> <UNK> christian <UNK> i couldn't work out whether the film is meant to be them for their mindless beliefs or is the target the happy family and we are meant to think that's or is it just saying that some people are lost and just hell bent on destruction it's shallow we all know that bad things happen the interesting bit is to learn why but this film just <UNK> depicts a violence without ever the thinking that has led to it the king is such a lost opportunity there are some really interesting questions about honour the warrior code the changing concepts of <UNK> honour killings in indian families and so on honour is a very varied concept but this film just adds nothing to the notion however paul the <UNK> did more than his <UNK> role suggests the dvd <UNK> showed all films in a green only <UNK> and the only way to <UNK> this was to get it sent to <UNK> he did this through christmas i think those <UNK> workers and and paul went far beyond the call of duty and our reward was this dismal film but you might see it differently
<START> the first twenty five minutes stand out as possibly the worst in modern british film director <UNK> william has treated <UNK> original with such <UNK> that he seems to have completely ignored the needs of a cinematic audience thankfully the quality of the direction and editing <UNK> significantly after the first half hour but by then the damage has been done of the actors <UNK> <UNK> and robert hardy wipe the floor with the rest of the cast every time they are on screen the other exceptions are jonathan <UNK> arthur and karen mabel who are given enough <UNK> to deliver their lines with the true comic sense which <UNK> intended the <UNK> leads james and <UNK> mcdowell are in comparison <UNK> and wooden in an obvious attempt to <UNK> every penny out a <UNK> budget the play has been <UNK> updated to the 1990's but in <UNK> with the original script the effect is more of a badly script 1970s tv drama true moments of comedy are few and far between but when they arrive are highly amusing a sign maybe that more <UNK> <UNK> of the rest of the play might have led to a better paced more even film
<START> the film begins with a dandy <UNK> where three <UNK> are quickly <UNK> down by a bounty hunter a bounty hunter who bears more than just a superficial to the man with no name from the clint eastwood trilogy <UNK> of dollars for a few dollars more and the good the bad and the ugly br br immediately after you see this man in a gold train filled with union soldiers naturally the <UNK> is attacked and the soldiers all fight like blind guys so they are quickly <UNK> however in a twist one of the <UNK> <UNK> the gang leader gilbert <UNK> and rides away with the gold soon <UNK> catches up and is about to find out where the gold is hidden but just at that moment the army turns up and kills the <UNK> <UNK> however the man with no name wannabe thinks <UNK> knows about the treasure and perhaps a <UNK> given to <UNK> by the <UNK> holds the key a strange <UNK> also is thrown into the mix all three want the gold and all three seem pretty macho br br overall this is not a particularly distinguished western much of it is the plot some of it is that george hilton a <UNK> despite the american sounding name isn't as interesting as eastwood or some of the other <UNK> spaghetti western stars but most of it is because the soundtrack simply sucks so often the music doesn't even come close to matching the acting and it seems almost randomly added plus it just isn't very good stuff as well this clearly isn't the work of <UNK> <UNK> music master of the spaghetti genre br br overall just a time <UNK> and not a particularly good one to boot
<START> de is based on the life of a real dutch gangster in the movie he is called i have my doubts that events presented in the movie have something to do with what really happened but that doesn't really matter because it failed to grab my attention this movie bored the crap out of me it lacks substance and style the substance part could have been forgiven if the acting was any good and if the director tried to do something original without the substance you at least have to bring some style or decent action don't we need to be entertained it would have helped if the director had seen more gangster movies it is obvious that he didn't otherwise he wouldn't have made this the way he did this movie got a lot of publicity because of a little scandal surrounding and a member of the dutch royal family this scandal has nothing to do with the movie what so ever without it de never would have been successful i am sure of it
<START> michael <UNK> stars as joe armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the u s army in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless martial arts <UNK> which is <UNK> by too many long pauses without action but helped by some high energy action <UNK> as well as steve <UNK> performance
<START> well i got and saw this movie based on the rather high score here 7 1 now and some of the good reviews usually imdb is a good guide when it comes to score though in this case i was very much <UNK> br br the movie is a present day detective story with <UNK> jones as the investigator journalist who <UNK> the death of a construction worker mixed with this is a made up <UNK> novel called the <UNK> set in the 18th or 19th century which also deals with a murder story both story lines are connected through the discovery of an <UNK> <UNK> br br sounds interesting it could have been however this movie horribly fails in a number of areas 1 acting mediocre at best but it is watchable no worse than your average uk sitcom though for a movie one expects a little better especially with a score of over 7 2 music the music used is simply horrible it <UNK> and it is annoying especially the pub music and the music which plays in the <UNK> apartment 3 storyline this is a big joke there are <UNK> plot holes everywhere and even the obligatory love story is so unrealistic that it's almost funny furthermore without going into any detail i can safely say that the ending is absurd and one of the worst pieces of acting and storyline of the year 4 camera work at times camera positions and views are distracting and serve absolutely no purpose to the story br br i'm a bit of a movie fanatic and watch on average 1 to 2 movies a day but this is easily the worst movie i've seen in months don't waste your money or your time on this rubbish
<START> being a huge fan of hip hop and to begin with i always knew i would like this film however i wasn't prepared for just how good the documentary actually is it covers almost all the important aspects of the only element of hip hop which has been there from the very start the story begins in the early 70's and follows the evolution of as an art from up until early 2000 <UNK> will point this out as significant br br the editing is <UNK> on perfect throughout the film aside from the excellent visual scratch techniques which they used the rapid cutting between interviews and the stock footage is excellent giving the film pace when it is needed the sound editing is also very good with some nice sweeping sounds being used to help with transitions br br the absence of a narrator was also welcome we aren't taken by the hand through the story and as a result the audience is able to make their own <UNK> easier each dj adds another side to the story and it is so interesting to hear about the unknown stars of hip hop especially those who were there when hip hop was being <UNK> left right and centre by the music business br br although there are many excellent things about this film i do have a few <UNK> the biggest of these is the absence of several notable <UNK> such as <UNK> and <UNK> jeff and also <UNK> from outside america such as scratch <UNK> and dj noise however if you watch the commentary on the dvd something which i highly recommend producer and director go in to great depth about how they regret not being able to feature them the deleted scenes contain many interviews with <UNK> <UNK> jeff and the scratch <UNK> br br this is definitely the best documentary i've seen on hip hop culture and music it does stop short of showing the true potential of for that i highly recommend checking out the and videos however that is a minor <UNK> i highly recommend this movie not least for the <UNK> soundtrack with excellent music throughout 9 10
<START> i have to say this movie is absolutely amazing i don't understand why it got such a low rating it has romance music darkness and vampires also stuart <UNK> did a great job of being <UNK> the acting was great also normally i am not into that music well sometimes but i have to say in this movie the music fit it perfectly if you like dark movies about vampires this is definitely for you or even if you don't there is a love story to this but all i can say is one word amazing my rating is <UNK> 10 out of 10 anyway i seriously suggest you watch it i remember not seeing this for years i watched it again about a year ago and im addicted to it again lol great movie
<START> don't get me wrong i love most of paul <UNK> movies so it was with sheer excitement i was able to attend at the rolling thunder screening at the <UNK> french <UNK> with surprise movie on the <UNK> <UNK> 2004 of course the surprise movie was the exorcist and most people were there for that i was too the film was then finished but the score so p <UNK> used <UNK> from the return of the king and some other movie i forget was it conan anyways apart from that the movie was the happy few there maybe 200 people were told to please not write about the film on the internet or magazines since it may have <UNK> its chance of getting selected to the cannes film festival then came the film then came the realization that the film might not get selected for the festival because of its quality never in my life had i experienced such a feeling of <UNK> in the audience as people went from being skeptical to <UNK> laughing out loud at the pity full spectacle i couldn't believe how low the author of light sleeper <UNK> blue collar and <UNK> had sunk br br forced over the top acting <UNK> stupid ending black and white moral awful <UNK> worst take on christianity from <UNK> ever not even suspenseful just boring as hell no pun intended and <UNK> at all some good locations but sadly miss used or at least not fulfilling the initial hopes in the end i was 100 times more satisfied by the <UNK> penned rolling thunder and wished my 2 hours back br br don't believe the hype even the john <UNK> movie is more exciting and original oh and the billy crawford casting the poor guy does his best but what where you expecting he's now part of the small club of worst casting mistakes ever i give the movie a 1 5 just because i didn't leave the room but i should have
<START> if imdb would allow one word reviews that's what mine would be this film was originally intended only for kids and it would seem to be very tough going for adults or older kids to watch the film the singing the story everything is dull and washed out just like this public <UNK> print like other comedy team films with roots in traditional kids stories such as the awful snow white and the three stooges and the overrated babes in <UNK> this movie has limited appeal and just doesn't age well now that i think about it i seriously doubt that many kids nowadays would even find this film enjoyable so my advice is don't watch this film if you must watch an <UNK> and <UNK> film almost any other one of their films except for a c go to mars would be an improvement
<START> four young grade school girls witness the murder of one of their classmates during what they thought was just an innocent game the killer is a strange young boy named milo sixteen years later the four survivors of the event re <UNK> under happier circumstances in the same town where it happened they believe that milo drowned in a river shortly after the murder but soon learn that the demonic killer milo has also returned still a young boy <UNK> even after almost two decades br br the cover for this movie makes it look really cool yet i still expected a bad movie to come out of it when i pop in the dvd into my player the menu comes up and makes the film still look cool sadly this movie isn't all that it got my excited about the movie is your average attempt at a slasher film and when i say average i mean just like all those other small budget slasher movies that have never been welcomed with open arms into most members of the horror community i'm talking about you the horror fan in other words you could walk up to any horror fan and the majority of <UNK> would be this sucks br br what mistakes did the movie make first of all the dvd cover art makes milo look really dark but they blow it all by showing his face in the movie in many different scenes he had the potential of being a very freaky character secondly the back of the cover art tells freddy jason <UNK> etc to pack their <UNK> and move on out because milo is so much better why in the hell would you want to say something like that when it comes to a no name low budget slasher film that has obviously failed i mean it just raises your expectations of the movie making it harder to impress itself upon you in a last <UNK> effort to attract attention it says in very big letters from the creator of <UNK> just shows you how low they're going to get as much attention as possible for the movie br br the gore in the movie sucks the director gives you some hideous angles when milo attacks someone the music isn't all that bad and i never once fell asleep during the movie <UNK> i'm still trying to figure out what milo actually is my best bet would be that he is a zombie if anyone else knows tell me rest assured i won't be losing any sleep over thinking about it
<START> author 1 from canada the big problem was the china syndrome claim that if the <UNK> error occurred and <UNK> waste <UNK> out it could burn its way straight through the earth to china a lot of people have made fun of this and if the movie makers meant it seriously then yes it should be made fun of the <UNK> wouldn't make it anywhere near the center of the earth or even the <UNK> rock even if it did make it to the center of the earth how would it come out in china it would have to flow against gravity the rest of the way also china is not the opposite side of the world the indian ocean is br br this point is brought up by the characters of the film saying that of course it could not happen as the core would hit ground water and release a radio active cloud <UNK> down on the population br br before you try to find a weak point in the film you should watch it first don't judge a book by it's title
<START> the only reason i checked this film out was to see the early kim <UNK> that and the fact that my tv guide said it was a gripping suspense and it was three star rated the rating must have come from the man who wrote this drivel because the only suspense in this movie was whether i would finish it or not robert <UNK> turns in what has to be the disaster of his career as a cop who is not even close to being <UNK> at one point everybody is a suspect including a <UNK> old woman if you want to deliberately set out to watch a badly written badly directed badly acted movie then go for it it may make you appreciate fine films by comparison i wish i had that hour and thirty six minutes back
<START> what the hell is this movie about well if i didn't know that son of the mask is <UNK> as comedy i would never have a clue a comedy a tragedy that's the right genre for this yet another so called sequel br br yes i've watched dumb and dumber but i never believed somebody will ever make it's title real in hollywood yes you watch son of the mask and you think 5 minutes dumb 10 minutes dumber 15 minutes dumbest and then after 16 minutes there is only one thing to say i'm out of here br br sorry my <UNK> for comedy crap of the year 2005
<START> spoilers br br this movie was rented as a joke and what a joke it was the film is based on a dog <UNK> who is looking for el the dog <UNK> outfit is so ridiculous it looks like he the <UNK> on his hat and for some reason he shows of his <UNK> by rolling up his <UNK> throughout the movie mostly at night you can see how bad the lighting was they are in a car which is <UNK> lit and they are driving in pitch black often you can see the camera man's shadow on the ground the costumes are terrible the lighting is terrible and the acting is terrible this is a good movie for a laugh maybe
<START> we rented the movie and it maybe the worst movie ever the box they had in the video store had a cool looking monster on the cover but in reality the monster was a creature from the black <UNK> mask awful awful awful you actually might have to rent it it's so bad it feels like you are watching a <UNK> o home movie
<START> well to start with i'm straight up as black as black gets and i can tell you it's very sad when black people think a black movie sucks i can't say i've ever seen a movie this badly directed or a worse story line br br <UNK> is my <UNK> and all but he wasn't feeling this movie at all i don't know how much they paid him to be in this bucket of crap called a movie but i hope it's enough to wash the smell out br br i'm all about supporting a bothers movie but this one was bad really really bad it blew <UNK> in every aspect no real plot story sucked cast couldn't act and the best one there was the white guy br br i almost <UNK> a <UNK> on my way out the door of the theatre half the crowd up and left before it was over i'm still wishing i had too save yourself some pain and go see something else anything else
<START> <UNK> so did they even have writers for this maybe i'm <UNK> but i like a little dialog with my movies and as far as slasher films go just a <UNK> of character development will suffice br br unfortunately the prey provides if you think i'm being <UNK> you'll just have to see it for yourself scene after scene we just get actors standing around looking <UNK> and awkward abandoned by any sense of a script outside of calling out each other's names when they get separated in the woods <UNK> the only instances where these people say something <UNK> is when one character explains the <UNK> <UNK> clearly <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> slasher fare no and another <UNK> an old <UNK> tale that doesn't even have anything to do with the plot wait what is the plot at other times the prey actually has the <UNK> to film its characters with the boom <UNK> just far away enough so that we can't exactly hear what they're saying so we get entire scenes <UNK> the actors are <UNK> deliberately seriously i've seen more dialog in a silent film it's as if the filmmakers sat down at a bar somewhere in in the <UNK> of the '80s slasher <UNK> and one looked at the other and said hey i gotta really sweet idea for a gory <UNK> gag let's somehow pad an entire feature around it and well they did br br to be fair the prey probably had some sort of writer on board i mean somebody had to <UNK> down the scene sequence and label the <UNK> however i am fully convinced that this film did not have an editor of any kind whatsoever there are glaring pauses boring <UNK> and zero sense of pacing throughout the filmmakers don't have anything else in the script to film so they fill out the running time with <UNK> of the <UNK> and <UNK> that inhabit the forest in which our wild and crazy teens are getting <UNK> and <UNK> these <UNK> are all filmed in straightforward daylight in a completely reserved fashion and with no attempt at atmospheric photography if it feels like a science film that's because it is i'm pretty sure this is all nature show stock that's missing is a <UNK> narration from some national <UNK> br br more exciting footage that was <UNK> <UNK> from the cutting room floor a scene in which two men discuss <UNK> and cream cheese <UNK> and another scene <UNK> a supporting character away on a <UNK> for what feels like an entire minute and a half a minute and a half that's a lot of to commit to celluloid to begin with let alone insert into the final cut of the film way to go guys <UNK> and are the real victims of this br br admittedly the film picks up quite a bit of steam <UNK> in the last 25 minutes into which much of the carnage is <UNK> and where a rip off of music for strings <UNK> and cuts in vaudeville great jackie <UNK> makes a fun appearance as a <UNK> park ranger this was his last role if you can believe it and there are some nice gory moments including a <UNK> neck <UNK> and the aforementioned <UNK> the make up used for the killer <UNK> <UNK> aka <UNK> from the <UNK> family movies is also quite effective and makes him look like a strange hybrid of young jason <UNK> and freddy krueger plus if you love wacky straight outta left field endings you need to check out how they wrap this puppy up you'll do a spit take i promise br br usually i love films that are on this level of <UNK> but the first three quarters of the prey are just so <UNK> boring that they pretty much spoil the rest overall this is a largely <UNK> and tedious affair and while it ain't all bad it should really only be seen by slasher <UNK> why do we do this to ourselves anyway
<START> this movie was by far the worst movie i've ever had to endure i couldn't believe that they tried to pass it off as a serious movie it was so bad i couldn't even laugh at it's pathetic attempt to entertain me if you want cheesy horror that you can laugh at rent dr <UNK> instead
<START> as an american fan of the league of gentlemen i had to wait months to finally see this film when it came out on dvd but it was well worth the excruciating wait apocalypse is fantastic funny freaky clever as hell full of in jokes and <UNK> references to the television series basically everything you'd expect from the gentlemen br br the plot has already been discussed in other reviews so i won't bother re <UNK> it although i will say when i first read it i was a bit <UNK> obviously this device fictional characters entering the real world to confront their makers has been used before notably in wes craven's underrated new nightmare and stephen king's dark tower books where king himself was a character the gentlemen have fun breaking the fourth wall though and even add a new element a second fictional world them days soon all three realities have <UNK> together and the result is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> being <UNK> in the middle ages and trying to court queen victoria wood the real league of gentlemen in <UNK> <UNK> being confronted by characters like pauline and dr <UNK> david warner <UNK> an outside of <UNK> church i've heard that some people disliked the king's evil sub plot but i found it hilarious especially character who seemed to be <UNK> <UNK> the witch from series three br br speaking of the characters i was <UNK> to find that although <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> were planted firmly in at the film's core other more familiar characters were given their due <UNK> <UNK> in the beginning was hilarious <UNK> back to the <UNK> more sketch oriented feel of the first series pauline and mickey have cameos no ross though strange although i would've loved seen more of ms campbell jones <UNK> is <UNK> for as are <UNK> and edward all three are used very <UNK> giving their <UNK> screen time an almost magical feel and just what the hell did <UNK> hack up like an obscene <UNK> according to the dvd commentary a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> hair br br the film looks incredible but then what's new the music as always is breathtaking i was thrilled to hear <UNK> new interpretations of the theme music and his slight re working of the <UNK> lovely piece that <UNK> out both apocalypse and the last episode of series three br br i have some minor complaints it would have been nice to see more of the old familiar <UNK> <UNK> and i felt the stop motion creatures beautiful by the way were a bit underused both of these issues however can be justified by the film's budget so they're understandable still as much as i loved <UNK> new church it would have been cool to see the final battle in the high street the <UNK> original vision according to the commentary br br overall apocalypse is astounding especially if you're a fan of the series i can't recommend it highly enough 10 10
<START> some spoilers br br there's nothing in this movie that you haven't already seen <UNK> the net nothing is shocking about this film in the film a man <UNK> a goat there's a <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> face gets burnt off all of these scenes of extreme violence are so fake it makes one wonder why anyone would even want to <UNK> this piece of trash i simply cannot believe i spent hard earned money on what certainly has to be the worst film ever made don't let reviews fool you this film would be a shame for anyone to own except maybe <UNK> who want to torture inmates for a real exploitation classic look to <UNK> freaks or even the more recent doom generation island of death sinks to the bottom of the movie toilet and needs to be <UNK> out of existence
<START> an amazing piece of film that was well conceived and kept me on the edge of my seat brilliantly <UNK> in its timing and the comedy kicked in exactly when the tension needed a release the acting was generally well done the director should've asked alec guinness for acting lessons and the shot <UNK> were impressive as in the hall as billy tries to race to the door in the studio this movie didn't let up since the opening scene
<START> i too found <UNK> to be a brilliant series and one of the finest offerings ever on american <UNK> david <UNK> was particularly effective as edward <UNK> as i recall and the overall conception was spectacularly good the only reason that the series doesn't rate a full 10 10 is for the low budget production values in some areas actual content is absolutely first rate in my <UNK> br br the <UNK> miniseries will be released in the uk on july <UNK> it will be a region 2 pal set but it would seem that a region 1 <UNK> set should be soon in the <UNK> br br if you have a universal player in the us you can order the series right now from amazon uk br br http <UNK> com br br <UNK>
<START> the laughs are few and far between in this dull movie and i can't help but wonder about how this mess ever got made in the first place about the only good thing in this movie is the talent of <UNK> dunne but his best efforts were easily overshadowed by <UNK> obnoxious performance i was able to sit through this without getting too bored but that's probably the <UNK> thing i can say about this time <UNK>
<START> if you've got a box of <UNK> a <UNK> couch a large bowl of popcorn and no social commitment on a friday night this is definitely your movie its romantic its hot and its challenging for most of us gay people religion is just one of those things that we did when we were kids and probably just starred at the alter boy and how cute he was but in latter days you see the struggles of being gay when your entire world revolves around which totally <UNK> being gay the two main cast members were totally hot but at the same time managed to capture your heart and even make me cry i have never cried in a movie which i thought was quite impressive for a b grade movie i highly recommend this flick you will laugh you will cry unless your me and you will definitely <UNK> i love it so much i even purchased the dvd for my collection its truly the most beautiful movie ever
<START> bad personal opinion the folks who made it they knew that when they made it to star in this movie again my opinion you needed to meet three <UNK> 1 you had to own your own <UNK> style clothing and jewelry makes wardrobe both easier and cheaper that way 2 you had to be able to remember and repeat your lines with out cue cards note that i didn't say you had to do it well saves on time and paper work 3 you had to be willing to get naked gives an r rating and thus <UNK> sales want to watch a better movie easy get a camera and some of your buddies together and do it yourself trust me you won't do any worse as vampire movies go well this one sucks and a hint here for people like me who like to look for little <UNK> in movies consider the link between vampires and crosses now take a look at the symbols and names on the in the cemetery portions of this thing were filmed in ed wood couldn't have planned that kind of an accident any better himself
<START> got this the other day from the creators on dvd i saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst family were stopping in a hotel had never heard anything about it after reading it was filmed on beach i just had to buy it i used to take the kids to the <UNK> in the film all the time whilst living in br br 1st off im not a big sci fi fan <UNK> star wars i was really just wanting to see what they had done with this film location i was <UNK> surprised this didn't turn out to be a standard sci fi more like a mix of sci fi and survival horror br br had a good storyline which was different had great special effects for the budget that it was produced with acting was better than average for a low budget film the way they have edited out the whole <UNK> to make it feel like the dry desert planet that they are on was nice br br weapons in the film were realistic and the creatures were cool kinda like predator in mode br br all in all i will buy any future releases from these guys maybe a all out horror next hint hint the extras on the dvd were very informative on giving background for the producers i would like to see some of them shorts included as extras on a next dvd release br br excellent work keep it up
<START> this was a modern tv classic the story goes like this bob has a girlfriend named alicia bob and alicia are in love and want to get married bob has a bud named owen who he works with owen is jealous of alicia he likes hanging around with bob now owen hangs around with bob and alicia bob and owen have a secretary named heather heather is very accident prone she is also if you haven't guessed it is kind of lonely she too hangs around with bob and alicia and owen sometimes alicia wishes bob didn't have any friends br br by the end of the first season it looked like owen finally found himself a real girlfriend bob and alicia went driving on the night before their wedding making out in a tiny car and then getting stuck way out in the middle of nowhere what happened next what about poor heather did anyone get married sorry series ended br br not even a <UNK> from tv guide made fox think twice about putting it back on the air it was a great show with a great cast i loved heather too she looked cool in those glasses and was hilarious i miss this show a lot this is like reading a good book with the ending missing sad
<START> i have not seen such a stupid dumb movie since quite a while it absolutely has no logic no horror doesn't scare you no suspense not thrilling i mean i didn't find even one part of the movie appealing br br i don't know what they were thinking when they made the movie you watch the whole movie to find out that there is a plant that can walk around drag human dead bodies and eat human flesh not just that but it can also talk i e imitate sounds like a <UNK> <UNK> or human talking so its like the plant makes the noise of a cell phone <UNK> so they go after the <UNK> and find out its a plant how intelligent of the plant to setup an <UNK> br br this clearly is the creativity level of a primary school kid bad
<START> after sitting through this film i have decided that it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i knew it the moment i was subjected to three teenage girls screaming and overacting when they <UNK> meet again and then watching the same thing only done by women old enough to be my mom and that was only the first few minutes <UNK> so here are my comments br br 1 middle aged women ridiculous dance moves complete with hip <UNK> and over the top costumes not a good idea br br 2 pierce brosnan could not sing his way out of a paper bag nor could practically anyone else in this pile of <UNK> for that matter br br 3 the songs were so random it was obvious to me that they were thrown willy <UNK> into the incredibly contrived and stupid plot br br 4 my three year old nephew could have written a better script br br i was either cringing or laughing <UNK> during the movie and i normally really like movie musicals of course they are bound to be a bit corny but this was ridiculous what a waste of talent i mean you have great actors and actresses in this movie i am embarrassed for them that this is now a part of their career i regret wasting my money and time on this piece of crap
<START> diane lane mickey rourke rosario dawson thomas jane not a bad cast in my opinion however they were totally wasted in this movie br br there was no real direction there were no unusual turns in fact the whole movie was very predictable from start to finish mickey rourke had a really annoying sidekick who did nothing but <UNK> you from the start rosario dawson was totally wasted and there was hardly any point in even having her character in the film br br i really do believe this is one of those straight to dvd movies that everyone will forget about very quickly which is a shame as the movie could have been so much better
<START> i read the book after seeing the movie and didn't care for it finding it somewhat trashy but trashy books often make good movies and this one certainly could have the story of a teen girl's exploration of her attractive power over boys which she finds as <UNK> stimulating as it is <UNK> and which has an even <UNK> grip on her than it would on a normal girl because it affects her through her this story would have an obvious appeal to the young audience for which movies are made an appeal of one kind to girls and of another kind to boys and i don't understand how the movie makers could be blind to that and turn the story into one with little appeal to anybody br br to begin with take the title which is the best thing about the book it's drawn from a <UNK> also used as an about a person running in fear and <UNK> both blood and chocolate in his mouth one <UNK> as bad as the other this is a wonderful metaphor for the <UNK> state torn between her human and wolf sides <UNK> each but equally <UNK> of both the movie <UNK> with the and instead introduces the character working in her <UNK> chocolate shop i can understand how the <UNK> title might have suggested to the movie makers the <UNK> charged <UNK> of like water for chocolate and led them to want to link the same symbol to werewolves but they didn't so why is it in the movie in the book the characters are in high school or in and out as with the five a teen gang who favor black <UNK> and t shirts and fall somewhere between being the <UNK> <UNK> and her pet <UNK> in the movie they've become <UNK> twenty something in the book the heroine is 16 just of an age to be discovering how her sexuality <UNK> on the boy she wants as well as on herself she's the one who <UNK> the contact then steps back re <UNK> and so on in the movie she's no longer a girl but a woman and the guy is no longer a high school poet on the <UNK> of campus life but a fugitive from the law and a comic book artist to boot it's he who comes on to her in a manner as unattractive as that of her <UNK> cousin she initially puts him off but then gives in as he's confident she will hey you know you want it i would have thought a female director would have taken the chance the book offered to show a female protagonist in an role but no br br in the book the <UNK> clan is driven from their home because of the <UNK> <UNK> behavior in the movie it's because she went for a run she's a great runner prone to kicking off from building walls and both she and her scale buildings in a <UNK> very like heroes of martial arts movies and very unlike wolves or anything resembling them in the book they don't turn into actual wolves but things bigger than wolves in the movie they're just ordinary wolves in the book they <UNK> in howling style with <UNK> of <UNK> this is one of the things that make the heroine aware of the pain her body brings her as well as the pleasure in the movie the werewolves have become magical taking great <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in mid air <UNK> yellow like <UNK> bell it looks cool means nothing br br in the book the clan is a slightly white trashy family that has <UNK> from west virginia to <UNK> in the movie they live in <UNK> but all talk in different accents none romanian in the book nearly the whole pack want to lead normal lives and agree that to <UNK> that and indeed their survival one necessity is to keep their true nature secret from humans and so the characters keep saying in the movie yet the head of the clan is some kind of underground boss but apparently not a crime boss since he <UNK> criminals and has a standing deal with the police who supply him with meat for the pack this seems a big exception to the rule of keeping humans from knowing but maybe the police are considered safe because of their known tolerance for <UNK> and cult murder br br at the end of the book the heroine learns she can't be something she's not when in her effort to live a divided life she gets stuck between the human and animal states unable to be all one thing or the other her boyfriend isn't sure or strong enough to accept her for what she is the pack can't risk having him around and the two are forced to separate in the movie she <UNK> him like <UNK> and they drive off to paris why paris in an ending that's <UNK> faced but not really happy since the conflicts between their <UNK> between her <UNK> remain <UNK> br br but the difference in the movie that <UNK> enjoyment the most is that whereas the book characters behave <UNK> within the realm of young adult novels those in the movie for some reason have been made as annoying as possible every other line is a threat or some other kind of you'll be sorry you don't belong here you won't get rid of me i gave you your chance etc i prefer to steer clear of people who deal in that way br br there have been many good vampire movies never a good werewolf movie had this one stuck to the book it might have been the first br br but no
<START> many people said this was a great movie with hoffman delivering a great performance i went from suspended disbelief to boredom to almost walking out there is no there there br br hoffman does go all out he is committed to the performance but sometimes him playing an affected man looks just like affected actor chewing on the scenery br br no characters in the movie other than capote are much more than <UNK> jack perry shawn the sheriff are all one dimensional br br yes the film shows the manipulative <UNK> <UNK> sides of capote it shows them so many times i started to wonder why do the filmmakers think we need to have everything spelled out and again and again it refers often to <UNK> genius but does not show it it shows him surrounded by fans and but never convinces us why br br but my goal is not to <UNK> the film i am sure others will have other interpretations for me this was a two hour movie that felt like five
<START> samuel fuller knows war and is one of the only directors in american movie history who could accurately portray the horrific experiences of it in a form like the motion picture his <UNK> and <UNK> if that sounds a little odd to mix together work for him as a <UNK> and at the same time he's always out to tell the truth however brutal or put into melodramatic <UNK> it can get <UNK> however deals with the post war experience as we only get in the opening scenes the big boom of war in bold for a point the opening shot is like one big <UNK> point that seems to continue on into the rest of the scenes a dead soldier on the ground the camera pans up we see another soldier shot down in war torn <UNK> simple direct language then fuller <UNK> the intensity with something interesting the title song played over the opening credits as both irony and sincerity and then <UNK> music over a shoot out between americans and the nazis sgt david brent james best is shot the battle goes on and then it transitions to him being treated for his wounds br br it might lead one to believe that this will be a somewhat conventional ww2 flick somewhat in that one usually wouldn't find <UNK> and later on to an extent wagner put into these images but this isn't the case instead fuller makes this a <UNK> <UNK> kind of movie though not at all in the sense that <UNK> soldier comes home injured and so on and so <UNK> instead of really going home brent stays on in germany as he's fallen head over heels for the woman <UNK> susan <UNK> pretty good at pulling off the german accent and wants to work in a smaller capacity in the military so he can marry her what he doesn't realize is that a she wants him more for money so she can get food for herself and brother however this gets complex emotionally at the point of revelation to the slightly naive but heartfelt brent and b there's an underground hitler youth <UNK> called the werewolves who want to pick right up off where hitler ended starting small despite argument within the group by attacking the very government that's now <UNK> in germany to give them as brent describes a blood <UNK> with this plus footage from the <UNK> trials and as narrated i think by fuller himself a quick no punches pulled history of the nazi war crimes piece by piece we get a multi <UNK> look at a society in the dire <UNK> of an immediate post war environment while <UNK> handled it his own way with germany year zero fuller <UNK> it with layers first there's the love story or what is the tragic downfall of a man who can't see anything past what he thinks should be reasonable that it's his wife and a child on the way that he can't leave until the revelation that he's partly been <UNK> baker and <UNK> along with harold as young confused brother perform at with the <UNK> detail to emotions these aren't very easy b movie parts though they could've been that then another <UNK> is the political one the struggle of a society to come to grips with being <UNK> and a mentality which is made <UNK> to be sure by fuller in respect to making the <UNK> a total no gray area thing they're evil particularly when they <UNK> out reason to meet their ends br br and finally there's the <UNK> of style which is strangely absorbing this is probably one of <UNK> films which isn't a bad thing considering it's one of his best written scripts as the characters don't talk simply or in too many <UNK> with the exception of a small scene where two characters talk about the hitler youth as juvenile <UNK> which is actually according to <UNK> autobiography probably another <UNK> to consider in the subtext and the 50s period of movies and fuller shoots this almost in a real european style when he's not going for fight scenes or battles as the editing isn't always very fast and sometimes a cut won't happen for a full minute or longer there's an odd tension that grows out of this especially when there's something said by a character that gets another one wild eyed or suspicious fuller could easily go for a big close up but there's a more sinister cold quality to not moving away from two people in a conversation without a simple over the shoulder deal but when it requires it like the big <UNK> outside the american military office or the <UNK> footage spliced into <UNK> memories of the werewolves fuller can be as stunning <UNK> as ever br br very hard to find but extremely worth it if <UNK> either a fan of the director's or of ww2 movies set in germany or even just a history buff <UNK> is an intellectual experience and a strong emotional one with a cast that is better than expected from a b movie and an attitude towards the <UNK> that is equally <UNK> and thought provoking
<START> the a team is still repeating every day on dutch television around and i still watch it i don't like the a team i absolutely adore them it is just great to see justin chasing the former members of a team brings back memories from the old days when i was young an sweet i would have given you a 10 for excellent but justin looks like he is chasing the former a team members all by himself of course that is the only bad thing on this documentary too bad justin does not look for melinda amy a allen but it is great to see mr t back into action too bad for him he does not show up at the party at the end but that party is too short to laugh again and to see everybody in action again
<START> <UNK> is without a doubt one of the worst comedy series ever i wonder how come there are people writing good comments on <UNK> you watch friends married children if you laugh at that you can never laugh at the stupid jokes and the ridiculous accent of the singer who is trying to make her way in comedy and obviously having no chance whatsoever the actors actresses beside <UNK> are ok so i feel bad for them in a so called comedy show with the least person in the world <UNK> to sum up i suggest this tv show to see how low comedy can get and appreciate the ones that can make you laugh
<START> cameron mitchell plays an actor who is dating a young actress who used to date the head of a movie studio she's too young for both of them at a party when he's lighting his cigarette the studio boss throws a high alcohol content drink in his face and he catches fire in the hospital his face is entirely <UNK> and he still lights up a cigarette he becomes the resident <UNK> of the wax museum and palace where he also lights up <UNK> br br mitchell <UNK> more or less having really poorly done burn makeup on one side of his face that looks like gray and tape and an <UNK> when mitchell isn't smoking he's killing people well he only kills people sometimes since he prefers to <UNK> them with something that puts them in a sort of coma if he doesn't <UNK> it regularly and he never seems to remember they start to move again a little although they're in a sort of hypnotic zombie state not all his <UNK> are people though he evidently does have talent as a <UNK> br br the ending which seemed to have been struck from a much <UNK> print than the rest of the movie is really absurd they seemed not to know what to do and went back to the title for an idea apart from the oddly grainy final shots the rest of the movie is in fairly good shape except for the audio in some scenes which sounds like it was run through a blown <UNK> definitely not one of the better wax museum movies
<START> the acting is excellent in this film with some great actors it was fun to see fred as a young man this is not a comedy it's a drama and the apparently comedic instances are pitiful this is not a comedy it's a drama and the apparently comedic instances are pitiful and some of them appear forced and contrived it's in the script though not the fault of the acting br br the 10 line <UNK> forces me to write some more hmmm loved carole <UNK> my man <UNK> because it is a comedy and while the acting is wonderful the story line and the script itself wins the day carole lombard is pretty and a wonderful actress i will try to watch fred features
<START> if i were to rate this movie based solely on the acting script production etc i would give it one star all these elements are awful i can partially forgive this in light of the film's 250 budget the movie does contain many entertaining scenes mostly those of the unintentionally funny variety some of these include a 14 year old kid stealing and driving a bus teenage <UNK> one of whom is sporting a joy division t shirt getting scared away from <UNK> the film's protagonists by a woman <UNK> an obviously fake <UNK> and an encounter with a plastic <UNK> skull in the arizona desert br br i would have given it 5 stars just for the entertainment value were it not for the presence of that horribly annoying morally <UNK> old <UNK> i had to <UNK> one star just because of her who the <UNK> makes a wedding cake with black <UNK> anyhow
<START> a <UNK> good film considering the circumstances of its production features performances from no name actors that rival the top talent on the planet sadly none have a career br br also features the the god like ability of christopher nolan to write perfect dialogue dialogue is what carries this story which is about a man who likes to follow people for material for his books well shot very well edited even better written and amazingly well performed br br this movie has everything a great film needs except people who have seen it 9 10
<START> sad to say this is one of the <UNK> of john wayne's series of poverty row westerns for lone star productions here he is a united states <UNK> on the trail of a <UNK> known only i kid you not as the shadow br br no it's not <UNK> <UNK> it's some dude who gives his orders through an open wall safe so his men don't see who he is but the voice is <UNK> you'll know within 10 minutes of the film br br and another reviewer here is quite wrong no <UNK> or <UNK> from the audience would have occurred because <UNK> hayes was still playing a variety of roles and he's clean <UNK> here he had not yet found his <UNK> as the lovable <UNK> sidekick of various movie cowboy heroes like the duke br br later on he does lead his men quite openly in the climax so i'm not sure what the point of the original gimmick with the wall safe was i don't think those that wrote this one knew either br br wayne gets <UNK> <UNK> as an indian sidekick here and the relationship is just about the same as an <UNK> lone ranger and <UNK> br br it's all pretty silly if you ask me
<START> i once lived in the u p and let me tell you what i didn't have the idea what the heck this bear walk is i never heard of it the whole 10 years i was up there it was really funny in the beginning but went down hill quickly
<START> being a retired medical health field in the i never get tired of seeing this film <UNK> was a friend of my college <UNK> teacher visited him us during several back in 1958 his writing ability has stood the test of time the hospital is as fresh as it was in 1971 i can watch it every week still find something new so many of the supporting cast members went <UNK> bigger better roles in both tv film george scott made only a few comedies but his timing <UNK> are as good as jackie <UNK> steve mental humour rather than slapstick wins in my book every time and still a family film with only 1 four letter word during entire film
<START> it may not be a 10 out of 10 but for me the jokes didn't fail i've seen it many times when i was younger and again on dvd i believe and i laughed each time the humor is simple and fun this film was just one of many small flicks disney was throwing out at the time i found the parts where the people out of the invisible loop saw people invisible there expressions were priceless great film if the opportunity to ever see this <UNK> i recommend seeing it for a good oh fashion laugh my favorite character in all the <UNK> series would most definitely have to be dean <UNK> i love his voice and hearing him get upset especially seeing his expression at the end was just pure hysterical for me
<START> of course seeing a few boom <UNK> doesn't mean anything does it lord <UNK> ray moore and martin really put this one together didn't they i laughed a lot as often happens in these types of movies but i don't know what i was supposed to laugh at because i laughed at so many other things i am not saying the movie was bad but i will say that a little more editing would have done wonders i am a huge fan of <UNK> so i don't think that it was horrid but i know that the human <UNK> was several times better than this i think that those who can make it through this movie might need a <UNK> 45 or two afterward i mean it really helps you to not notice the boom <UNK> when you watch it again
<START> this is a very sweet coming of age movie very funny and russell <UNK> is amazing those who know him only from gladiator will be surprised to see the range of his acting abilities arthur his character is one of the best <UNK> nerdy <UNK> i have ever watch this movie how can we get it re released in <UNK> format br br
<START> it's a horror story alright but perhaps not as you know it the real monsters in this flick are humans while the monsters are human and prey as weird as that may sound i see this as monsters inc for horror film fans br br sure the effects are of a <UNK> horror film the monsters are there as in any monster based film the gore is there as well there even is a slasher in the shape of dr <UNK> played by david <UNK> i see flash of cillian murphy as dr jonathan <UNK> in batman begins here or is it the other way round and it is <UNK> c who are the bad guys the monsters want mainly to mind their own business off <UNK> humans more or less misguided wanting to join there society br br by the end of the film you actually grow to like the quite little monsters and the dog not perhaps what you had expected from the first few scenes
<START> i have watched this movie at least ten times i do not agree with the previous comments this is a tongue in cheek movie and some of the acting is meant to be stilted men like paul <UNK> are few and far between women like linda unfortunately are a dime a dozen the sad thing here is that although <UNK> relationships like this rarely lead to murder and frame ups it is an all to familiar scenario boy <UNK> girl girl doesn't know he exists they grow up man sees woman he <UNK> about down and out and <UNK> her bottom line she never did love him he came along at the right time and she used him thomas is excellent as the nerdy but adequate paul his portrayal is sensitive and touching madsen is perfect as the femme fatale what really moved me was the final scene paul says he eventually cried but not for linda his wife but for the unknown girl he had watched from a distance so many years ago and <UNK> for and loved and i loved the close up of thomas at the end
<START> preston the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it <UNK> and even showed up on television in the meantime it had gained in <UNK> because pauline the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman <UNK> orson welles screenplay for kane was based on screenplay here as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site <UNK> <UNK> her case br br there are about six <UNK> who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane the <UNK> representing <UNK> the henry clone <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jed <UNK> susan alexander kane and raymond the butler each has his or her different <UNK> on kane <UNK> their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man and of course each also reveals his or her own <UNK> when they are telling their version of <UNK> story this method also leads to frequent <UNK> re <UNK> of the same incident br br this is not the situation in the power and the glory yes like kane it is about a legendary business leader here it is tom garner spencer tracy a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful <UNK> system in the country but there are only two <UNK> they are <UNK> right hand man henry ralph morgan and his wife sarah this <UNK> the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner henry when he <UNK> is talking about his boss and friend whom he respected and loved his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public she sees only the flaws in henry br br typical example although he worked his way up tom becomes more and more anti labor in his later years <UNK> are <UNK> and he does not care to be <UNK> down by their <UNK> henry describes <UNK> confrontation with the union in a major walk out and how it <UNK> him to the <UNK> of his home life but <UNK> wife reminds him how tom used and violence to end the strike apparently blowing up the <UNK> <UNK> killing many people so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black br br i'm not really knocking the power and the glory for not <UNK> <UNK> success few films do including all of orson welles' other films but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end and thanks to the performances of tracy and <UNK> moore as his wife sally the tragedy of the <UNK> success of the pair is fully brought home br br when they marry tom wants to do well in part to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had but in america great business success comes at a cost tom gets deeply involved with running the <UNK> empire he <UNK> it and <UNK> it constantly but it takes him away from home too much and he loses touch with sally and he also notices eve helen <UNK> the younger woman who becomes his mistress when sally learns of his <UNK> behavior it destroys her br br similarly tom too gets a full shock which makes him a <UNK> in the eyes of henry eve marries tom and presents him with a son but it turns out to be <UNK> son by <UNK> son tom jr philip <UNK> the discovery of this incestuous causes tom to shoot himself br br the film is not a total success the action jumps at times <UNK> yet it does make the business seem real note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line and he <UNK> the use of for <UNK> the plans came from a wealthy background so he could bring in this type of detail so on the whole it is a first rate film no citizen kane perhaps but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america
<START> when the circus comes to town and places the <UNK> cage directly over bugs <UNK> home bugs ends up somewhere in the range right between freaked out and <UNK> despite the title bunny it's only at the end when bugs and the lion perform <UNK> but even leading up to that it's quite funny what bugs does to escape getting eaten somehow he always manages to use the other character's weakness against him and then pull any convenient object out of thin air bugs later ended up in the circus in big top bunny i liked this one better as the latter got drug down a little bit by giving the antagonist an eastern european accent i know that it was during the cold war but still i recommend this one br br and with the end we can <UNK> that it'll never be <UNK> <UNK> for this cartoon
<START> fun story of a regular guy with big dreams this low budget film really hits home showing what it is like trying to become an acting success great performances by lou myers and <UNK> neighbor alex i <UNK> alot and even cried a little br br
<START> this is a haunting short film both james franco and rachel <UNK> deliver performances that hurt ring true and stay with you since this is called a tragic story this isn't much of a spoiler but i wanted to change the outcome even though it is right for the story because i had already come to care about these people i can only think of a few short films that have had that effect on me beautifully shot acted edited high caliber work all around even to the use of just the right sound and or music to advance the story the end credit song finished the job <UNK> even more emotion from me this is first rate from beginning to end kudos to the writer director and all involved br br this is my first review of a film in the comments section i promised to do so in exchange for a copy of the dvd the review could be good or bad just my honest opinion this is it and it's the least i can do i am so glad i got to see it
<START> lights of new york was the first all taking feature film coming in at a <UNK> <UNK> minutes and directed by bryan <UNK> of the famous vaudeville family br br the story has two dopey <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> eugene palette yearning for a chance at big city life and getting involved with gangsters and <UNK> booze one of the guys gets framed for the murder of a cop but is saved at the last minute by a gun <UNK> <UNK> br br much of the story takes place in a night club called the night <UNK> which is run by a crook named <UNK> <UNK> who has his eye on a pretty <UNK> who is the girl friend of <UNK> <UNK> gets to do a brief dance and we hear harry <UNK> made up to resemble ted lewis sing at <UNK> in his best al <UNK> style br br the acting <UNK> from good palette and to awful a couple of the actors <UNK> their lines but then keep right on with the scene as noted elsewhere this was intended to be a short 2 <UNK> and was made on a <UNK> budget yet the sound quality is surprisingly good the voices all register clearly and there is a neat cinematic touch in the <UNK> death br br the film was a box office smash even though it was shown as a silent film where theaters were not <UNK> for the new sound technology no one expected this little film to gross an amazing 1 3 million it briefly made stars of <UNK> and <UNK> and certainly launched palette on his long career as a star character actor br br co stars include mary <UNK> as the mother robert elliott as the detective eddie kane as the street cop and tom <UNK> as a thug
<START> george <UNK> the women remains one of the <UNK> gems of 1939 hollywood's most golden of golden years the film <UNK> and <UNK> and it's absence of males was a subtle touch hardly noticed because of all the fine entertainment br br flash forward we see fifth <UNK> in new york city in front of <UNK> large crowds <UNK> along the <UNK> but <UNK> off the shot reveals only well dressed attractive and young women <UNK> than i am legend the visual concept continues inside the store and later at a large fashion show what nyc fashion show doesn't have at least 5 gay men the no men rule is <UNK> down our throats creating an alien world off balance and distracting br br enter meg ryan first seen digging in her garden wearing a ridiculous get up complete with her retro <UNK> and <UNK> arms i immediately <UNK> with her husband and could understand why he looked elsewhere later in the film she <UNK> into an older jennifer aniston look and keeps her arms at her sides this seems intentional as if to say look i can still be relevant <UNK> character is loaded down with a <UNK> of miss matched friends insert sex and the city comparison here who if it were real life would despise each other <UNK> <UNK> plays the power bitch who during the course of the film realizes her life's dream doesn't really make her happy <UNK> <UNK> smith is the power lesbian all with no use for any of the men who aren't there debra messing is some sort of baby factory that eats a lot eva <UNK> is an odd choice for the bad girl to say the least she looks fake acts fake and any humor she tries to demonstrate falls flat someone's comment on here that she looked <UNK> gender was spot on other various stars show up to <UNK> the furniture on this titanic br br the only thing that would have saved this would have been the brilliant casting of jennifer aniston and angelina jolie they could have named their price <UNK> their <UNK> firmly into their <UNK> and pulled off something very clever and <UNK> but no hollywood thinks of itself way too highly for that kind of exploitation instead we're given this thing that <UNK> along <UNK> with no <UNK> entire sections of dialog from the original are lifted and <UNK> down into a scene with awful results at one point ryan <UNK> something along the lines of this isn't a 1930's movie no meg it's not
<START> this film shows a serious side to the often thought of as gore fest works of fulci not a lot of blood and guts here but a fine tale about murder and the lives affected by it br br a real find considering it was made in 1972 and will soon celebrate its <UNK> <UNK> br br check this one out but be warned it is hard to find br br ron
<START> honestly i loved michael although there were give me a <UNK> i need to take a <UNK> parts it was cool i think everyone did a great job in this film and nora <UNK> is in my ok list of directors br br it's nice to see john travolta as a pot <UNK> angel it's not very often i see one in a movie some people might call this a boring movie but for me i loved it angels and all
<START> fred astaire is <UNK> with rita hayworth one year after their big hit for columbia you'll never get rich that was the movie which put hayworth on the hollywood map yet her performance in this wan romantic musical hardly gives a suggestion why she was so suddenly popular down <UNK> <UNK> way a <UNK> hotel owner demands that his four daughters marry in order of age one may think film takes place in the 18th century but no it's modern day 1942 astaire is an ex <UNK> turned <UNK> who goes back to dancing to earn some money getting mixed up in <UNK> a letter writing admirer to <UNK> stone cold society beauty fred <UNK> at rita with a <UNK> smile but she's so <UNK> like lip <UNK> to her songs like a wide eyed wind up doll that all romantic sparks quickly <UNK> they do dance together quite <UNK> however and the <UNK> <UNK> score is <UNK> but not too bad from
<START> possible spoiler br br if you were making a serious movie involving a powerful but aging father with three apparently <UNK> daughters featuring actors of the highest caliber with great cinematography and a beautiful <UNK> setting now where would you go with it why you'd fashion a modern tragedy after king <UNK> of course br br that's what i was expecting that certainly wasn't what i got what i got was <UNK> minutes of feminist tripe one long <UNK> about man's <UNK> to woman why there wasn't a decent male in the entire story br br you see early on where this film might be headed but you can't believe anyone would waste all these fine actors and <UNK> on that trite scenario you just want them to get on with the king <UNK> theme but it never happens and there's the real tragedy if you ask me br br aside from the <UNK> of glorious rural <UNK> about the only thing worth watching in this film was that wonderful <UNK> british actor colin <UNK> practicing his <UNK> accent now there was a treat br br 3 10
<START> a long time ago in a galaxy far far away sound familiar water has become the most precious <UNK> this has got to sound familiar and a small minority control its distribution what a surprise just have a heart attack and die from that surprise a group of ice pirates water <UNK> oh wait that last one's been used try to discover the route to a <UNK> <UNK> supply of water with a lovely but spoiled princess en <UNK> and a group of villains in pursuit br br this movie has the potential to be a really great comedic parody star wars david lynch's <UNK> but was just not handled correctly it goes for i believe the term is low brow humor it doesn't really succeed in being all that funny which is a shame since it has <UNK> <UNK> ron <UNK> and robert <UNK> hence the three stars who aren't exactly <UNK> in the acting department br br definitely a rental and definitely have a drink straight up
<START> one of the most poetic narrative films ever made is nonetheless a difficult film to immediately like i love this movie but i recommend seeing some of john ford's other westerns before taking a look at this one the first time i saw it i was 18 years old and i hadn't seen too many other westerns and i hated it i thought it was incredibly boring i kept waiting for something to happen it took several years for me to love this picture first i fell in love with westerns in general the traditions characters landscapes ways of talking etc and that made me realize when i saw again that a lot is happening in it after all br br i also was simply a more experienced <UNK> at that point and had learned to appreciate visual storytelling and to listen to what each image was telling me is a very visual movie by one of the most visual of directors working near the peak of his career br br the movie is a celebration of a way of life and its subject matter is more emotional and interior than other ford westerns actually that's not really as accurate as saying that rather it has a lot less exterior action than the other westerns the other westerns have exterior action and interior emotion it quite beautifully places its mormon <UNK> in the context of nature there are many shots of animals and children not for any surface narrative purpose but for <UNK> this idea that is why the movie can be called a poem it isn't about the surface story which barely exists nearly as much as it is about an emotional idea and it gets this idea across through composition editing sound and music in fact one could argue that this is a <UNK> form of filmmaking because the images directly express the emotional idea of the film rather than having to first service a story br br give this movie a chance and allow it to exist on its own terms not the terms of other westerns or other movies
<START> it seems like if you are going to post here it going to be a 10 star rating nobody ever seems to dislike anything well i am honest some don't like that but here we go rachel ray show is just plain awful this show reminds me of the snl character linda whatever if she had a cooking whatever show i must say i liked rachel on the food network on 35 40 a day but i am sorry she does not have enough life experience to make her interesting day in and day out give me ham on the street anthony interesting folks but most of all i find her annoying she actually told a member of the studio audience to shut up yes in a kidding way but shut up is shut up and who cares about her pet stories sorry rachel you been cancelled
<START> all right there's no way to this the plot was ridiculous the premise was ridiculous the acting was <UNK> the effects were laughable and all of the <UNK> scenes appear to have been filmed in new <UNK> central park that having been said there was something about this movie that i couldn't walk away from maybe it was the atmosphere or maybe it was the evil super <UNK> or the amazon br br anyway i'm not one to sit on the <UNK> and <UNK> without pointing out a few redeeming qualities so here they are br br a violent off shoot of the women's <UNK> movement is portrayed in a wilderness setting central park of course and all of the <UNK> young men out there will be very impressed furthermore some of the scenes in which certain characters lose consciousness are <UNK> dramatic you'll note that i write dramatic rather than convincing br br all i can say is that some people like b movies and i'm one of them if you're one of them too then give it a go cheers mr <UNK> this is one for the ages
<START> i'm so happy i recorded this on vhs tape when it was featured on master piece theatre this is a movie i can watch again and again like living in the early <UNK> in england isn't hard enough is born with a <UNK> lip and is <UNK> from birth the people in her village accept her somewhat but always fear that she is from the devil's and are quick to turn on her especially when a lot of bad luck <UNK> her family she is strong and courageous but <UNK> away from a traveling weaver who catches her eye partly because she fears <UNK> and also because she thinks he is so <UNK> that he should have a wife who is as lovely as a lily is a modern man who does not believe in the <UNK> of the time and he speaks his mind and follows his heart the movie stays true to the original story by mary <UNK> and is riveting from beginning to end
<START> alfred hitchcock shows originality in the remake of his own 1934 british film the man who knew too much this 1956 take on the same story is much lighter than the previous one mr hitchcock was lucky in having <UNK> that went with him from one film to the next thus keeping a standard in his work robert did an excellent job with the cinematography and george editing shows his talent ultimately bernard <UNK> is seen <UNK> at the magnificent royal albert hall in london at the climax of the picture br br james stewart was an actor that worked well with mr hitchcock in this version he plays a doctor from indiana on vacation with his wife and son when we meet him they are on their way to in one local bus and the intrigue begins his wife is the lovely doris day at her best she had been a well known singer before her marriage and now is the perfect wife and mother the film has some good supporting cast brenda bernard miles daniel alan <UNK> among others do a great job in portraying their characters br br although this is a light hitchcock one can't dismiss it as a failure the man who knew too much is a change of pace for hitchcock's fans
<START> this film had it been done properly has so much potential parody films are always funny and people tend to like them because they're light hearted stupid and silly but fun this film was funny in some parts but it could have been a lot funnier the acting itself was ok from all the actors but i wasn't satisfied it seemed a tad empty and my summary title says it all about the effects proper green screens weren't used for this movie backgrounds were added in after which just looked terrible no wonder this film went straight to dvd lol it wasn't all a total loss it is funny and will give you a good laugh at it not with it most of the time
<START> this is basically a <UNK> comedy with somewhat odd pacing due to some dramatic elements for michael j fox and paul <UNK> it was their first film fox had previously been in a short lived tv series and a tv movie br br since the movie is basically a race <UNK> hunt type movie like <UNK> run it's a mad mad mad mad world or more recently rat race there are no main characters instead there are groups of characters splitting the screen time and allowing for tons of mini plots usually these kind of movies are a way to <UNK> the maximum amount of stars or semi stars onto a film br br this one has teams with one being the primary team which fox belongs to who are the only characters to be developed their plot is more of a stereotypical disney about a college boy not paying attention to his younger brother who he thinks of as a lazy punk since they are forced on a team together along with the older brother's girlfriend they are forced to work together since this is the main plot it gets the most screen time br br some of the other silly plots stand out the blue team is about an overweight rich kid whose dad just wants him and his <UNK> friends out of the house they end up with a cool <UNK> van which had an on board computer in 1980 to instantly solve the <UNK> plus play video games with the time saved one member stephen <UNK> went on to play dr on st elsewhere and later was on <UNK> 5 i'll also admit that i still laugh when <UNK> while trying to a word <UNK> <UNK> comes up with this is much funnier than bart <UNK> in my opinion br br the other three teams have plots that are somewhat linked together the green team is a bunch of frat boys with mostly beer jokes which <UNK> into a breakdown for one when the hunt leads to the <UNK> blue <UNK> <UNK> they get a chance to <UNK> the red team with two <UNK> and two fun loving twins the white team of <UNK> are lead by eddie who was previously in grease but went on to play a critical computer geek role in <UNK> and later tim sidekick in some of the <UNK> series br br if you grew up in the 80's then there are some classic moments in the movie that bring back memories the early video <UNK> from back when they were cool is always a plus in my mind look for paul <UNK> and his quarter shooting guns there is also a <UNK> golf course and a roller disco br br the movie is actually an okay family movie simply because profanity is almost non <UNK> and the small amount of sexual humor is completely innocent the odd pacing thanks to the yellow <UNK> cheesy dramatic moments will put parents to sleep while their kids can giggle at giant <UNK> at fat <UNK> oh they actually have a special <UNK> <UNK> that must be it right
<START> they must be i'll list them so that you can check them off one by one br br police regularly leave <UNK> of millions of dollars of cash and drugs just lying around because they don't have evidence <UNK> br br when you get shot you always <UNK> the same way and fly back the same way even though there's never a mark on your body br br police are not able to identify the sound of gun shots and don't think anything is suspicious when an undercover <UNK> phone call during a high level drug and money deal is cut shot by that gun shot br br bad guy <UNK> can hit <UNK> with one shot but can't hit a big <UNK> martial artist with 100 br br if you rocket <UNK> a car in a car park the next three cars in a line will blow up <UNK> in 15 second <UNK> br br further to the last point all the cheap cars are always <UNK> next to each other br br the smoke that is caused from the firing of the rocket <UNK> is much greater than the amount of smoke caused by four cars blowing up br br virtual reality games that are a long long way ahead of anything any other <UNK> company can produce fit on five <UNK> <UNK> br br virtual reality games that are a long long way ahead of anything any other <UNK> company can produce have graphics that look like windows 3 1 screen br br <UNK> <UNK> can be read even after they've been shot up br br semi drunk guys in bars <UNK> watch the news when they're at the pub and have a deep understanding of american modern military history agent orange and the family trees of high <UNK> military officials however they're only able to <UNK> their points using dialogue that sounds silly coming from anyone over the age of seven br br even though fights appear to break out almost <UNK> in a bar that bar has only one staff worker who both <UNK> the beers and handles security of course he knows martial arts br br gold <UNK> regularly make the simple transition to corporate <UNK> of <UNK> companies in a matter of years br br a woman who works for a computer game company knows everything about how to beat a game she's never played <UNK> constantly about her great games and can <UNK> off facts and figures regarding her <UNK> rivals but she didn't know that they <UNK> almost all the other companies in the field in large corporate br br bad guys always die in slow motion always br br wives tell their husbands that they're pregnant by raving about their man's bravery in killing bad guys br br wives do large amounts of their husband's police work this might explain why she <UNK> and complains so much every time he has to go to work although it doesn't explain why she <UNK> him so much every time he gets up in the morning and she can read about his murderous <UNK> br br it's fairly typical for a police officer to be involved in <UNK> kill tons of people on three separate occasions and stop a variety of multi million dollar illegal deals in a week br br when trying to lose a car that's following you it's wise to continue driving under the speed limit and if you're following a cop subtlety is not important you can him for miles then park right next to him he won't notice br br all cops are experienced martial artists br br it is possible to kick a guy four <UNK> in distance br br people scream or <UNK> in pain when they are <UNK> or kick yet when they have their arm broken they don't make a sound br br bad guys clean their <UNK> <UNK> with their <UNK> and then leave them in their pocket for many days br br pieces of wood when <UNK> with one sharp blow <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in six or more places simultaneously br br the photo and listed special features on the back of the dvd case don't necessarily have to be on the dvd the advertised <UNK> <UNK> why not no menu at all the advertised scene <UNK> why not have the whole thing as one scene chapter and not need an <UNK> likewise it's ok to use the <UNK> and title in the tag line and not be a rip off in any way br br with all of this i'm in shock that 12 out of the 15 top credited actors never acted again
<START> while not for everyone <UNK> is a delight to watch with tongue planted firmly in cheek the likeable character of jack simpson played by mick is <UNK> the local for free parking and making a couple of dollars on the side selling the parking space to work colleagues when the <UNK> club members need to raise some money to save their club they call upon jack to join their <UNK> team and play competition <UNK> br br filled with aussie charm the <UNK> wit of mick is showing through he also co wrote the script reminding this viewer of his earlier work in radio perfect aussie casting with bill hunter as jack's <UNK> mentor stan john clarke of the games fame as the ruthless businessman and rival <UNK> club owner <UNK> <UNK> with samuel johnson as jack's <UNK> dave and <UNK> lucy as the jaded journalist nancy br br initially i figured only fans of would like this flick but judging by the number of the blue <UNK> set <UNK> the cinema <UNK> this is a film for everyone
<START> i would like to start by saying i can only hope that the makers of this movie and it's sister film the intruder directed by the great <UNK> <UNK> auteur that is know in their hearts just how much pleasure they have brought to me and my friends in the sleepy north eastern town of <UNK> br br from the opening pre credit sequence which manages to drag ever so slightly despite containing a man crashing through a window on a <UNK> the <UNK> destruction of a silence lab the introduction of one of the most simultaneously annoying and <UNK> bad guys in movie history and costume design that jean paul <UNK> would find <UNK> and <UNK> make no mistake this is a truly unique experience early highlight an explosion get used to it plenty more where that came from followed by a close up of our <UNK> heroine and the most hilarious line reading of the word dad in living memory and then the theme song br br yeah this deserves its own paragraph sung by <UNK> written by people who really should wish to remain anonymous it makes the songs written for the rocky films sound like <UNK> this is crap 80's hero motivation <UNK> at an all time high with choice lyrics such as its only me and you its come down to the wire and much talk of having to cross the line it'll make sense in time our hero cares little for the boundaries of <UNK> police work <UNK> not to mention the <UNK> <UNK> the film's title <UNK> at this point anyone wishing to switch off officially has no pulse br br our hero is <UNK> cop peter <UNK> brilliantly by intruder star peter o'brien the of the title the man's bull in a china shop approach to crime fighting and particularly his less than <UNK> undercover work truly leaves much to be desired but he is without question an entertaining guide through the mean streets of downtown <UNK> with local sleaze ball connection captain johnny in <UNK> as well as <UNK> own waste of space partner in fashion crime sylvia <UNK> who does little so many highlights so little time the slide please arrogance of <UNK> not all too convincingly <UNK> case against chief baddie greg <UNK> intruder fans will know <UNK> slimy bastard craig <UNK> as the monstrous john white <UNK> name eh no oh well the x marks the spot location map stupidity our hero taking horrible advantage of heroine tina during a moment of weakness on her behalf the latter turning up at a <UNK> operation dressed like a member of a particularly flamboyant dancing <UNK> and believe me that barely covers it br br there wasn't even time to go into the plot revolving around the hunt for a drug <UNK> system and a kidnapped professor with an <UNK> but commendable amount of national pride or our hero turning up at a funeral dressed as if an extra on boogie nights or the absolutely hysterical between captain johnny and two guys have never made more heavy weather of buddy buddy <UNK> than these <UNK> the <UNK> was possibly too subtle me thinks br br ah it <UNK> off people and you never thought scenes of <UNK> destruction and general mayhem could be so unbelievably boring but the character interaction is <UNK> the dialogue truly priceless and the incompetence on show somehow endearing oh and the shoes people watch out for the shoes
<START> tv <UNK> <UNK> wells jane fonda and her radical richard adams michael douglas are at a nuclear power plant when a serious accident happens the plants <UNK> play it down but adams has filmed it all wells and adams try to get it on the air but the corporation that runs the plant <UNK> it plant executive jack jack lemmon realizes there are serious problems and <UNK> have been he tries to get executives to believe him only they know it wells adams and find all their lives are in danger br br i saw this in a movie theatre in 1979 i was only 17 and it scared me silly to make matters worse the three mile island accident happened around this time making the movie all that more real seeing it over 20 years later it doesn't scare me but it still is an excellent film it works as a mystery a gripping drama and an expose on the nuclear power industry fonda with red hair has one of her best roles as wells she perfectly conveys her character's growing suspicion and horror when she realizes a nuclear disaster could happen lemmon is as always excellent he starts out believing in his company and the job and slowly starts to unravel when he starts finding things out he was rightfully nominated for an academy award for this douglas is good but he has a small part and is completely overshadowed by lemmon and fonda br br a really great film one of the best of the 70s don't miss this one
<START> a young man falls in love with a princess but then has to go to battle to save her father's kingdom while away he accidentally kills an enchanted animal which brings a curse upon him he becomes a beast and begins to kill even his own <UNK> when nobody returns to the kingdom from the battle the king <UNK> the land of battle cursed and <UNK> anyone from going there one day a rebel who wishes to marry the princess decides that it's time they <UNK> into the cursed land to claim it for the king and the king agrees when they reach the land the king is captured by the beast and the rebel returns home to lie to the kingdom that the king has been captured and killed he assumes the throne and <UNK> to marry the princess but the night before her wedding the princess escapes to the land to go and battle the beast herself it is only when she gets to the cursed land that she begins to realise that her father is still alive and that the beast may not even be that evil after all sadly her <UNK> lead her to pay the ultimate price in their revelation

<START> a lot of people give this movie a lot of crap and all of it's really <UNK> people give this movie a hard time either because it's such a sick subject or they <UNK> on some technical aspect of the movie no one else <UNK> when they watch it if just by looking at the cover you think this movie will make you uncomfortable don't watch it however you'd be missing out on one of the better cinematic experiences of the late 1990's despite what anyone else says br br dee <UNK> is wonderful here as captain <UNK> the depths of insanity he <UNK> to play this character has to be beyond words and is much <UNK> than any one of us would have to be willing to go the acting here is wonderful the film itself beautifully shot the subject may be a bit too much for many to swallow but it's still well worth your time if you haven't seen this movie check it out
<START> what could have been an excellent hostage movie was totally ruined by what apparently looks like a bored director there were so many directions that the movie could have taken a vampire slash fest was not one of these the last 45 mins or so results in the movie being an absolutely ridiculous waste of time and sex machine you gotta be kidding me the acting talents of the likes of juliette lewis and harvey keitel not to mention george clooney are completely wasted in this nonsensical movie br br the director robert rodriguez known for his other gory flicks including el <UNK> <UNK> once upon a time in mexico and the very recent sin city really holds your attention with the well executed first half which leads you to believe that you are in for an entertaining time but then apparently for no reason and without any <UNK> the madness starts there's even feeble attempts at parody and comedy truly <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> like cheesy semi porn <UNK> as horror this one stars <UNK> sometimes sara st james the <UNK> <UNK> also seen in the erotic house of wax and that family favorite nude <UNK> party she is now a <UNK> in surrender <UNK> line up of talentless <UNK> starring in pointless soft porn exploitation flicks head of the family actually tries to be a real <UNK> a con man and a tramp try to get said husband off ed they turn to a large <UNK> evil genius in a wheelchair and his family of moronic <UNK> who uses mind control to send out zombies to do his <UNK> <UNK> said genius has a giant head hence the clever title of the film that's about the extent of the film's humor but basically it's an excuse to show off the ample talents of <UNK> and <UNK> laced with some of the dialogue can be herd what the heck is <UNK> <UNK> and just plain stupid this titular thriller will <UNK> appeal to the breast of drive in theater but no one else the <UNK> says avoid the devoid unless <UNK> looking for a rent on cheesy t a horror night <UNK>
<START> hi being able to speak <UNK> i found this very funny and was able to all the jokes that one might not get due to language <UNK> the fight scenes are spectacular and it's a good movie however i have my criticisms first of all i find that it is not as good as the first one project a go and see that now reason is spoilers ahead don't read on if you haven't seen the film because in project a jackie ends by fighting his enemy the man he is sent to kill that is what he has been <UNK> to do all the film and the showdown is spectacular but in a ii <UNK> he fights chan the showdown scene between jackie and his nemesis is not long enough and the bulk of the action is against the men they are not nearly as bad enough and have only played a minor part in the film in relation to jackie so though their fight sequence is spectacular they are not the ones jackie is hunting throughout the whole of the film so thus leaving the viewer slightly <UNK> however this is just my humble opinion so don't take it word for word go and see it yourself it is a great film in it's own right take care and hope your admiration for jackie grows yours sincerely ian ps you know the police chief in a ii he's the same guy in first strike nice to know he's still going strong
<START> although this was a film of only less than forty minutes it is one of best directed and acted stories i have ever seen it <UNK> in less than 45 minutes what most films cannot in more than 90 br br it is the story of two brothers one 18 and the other 10 they come from a poor farm family in <UNK> both are caught up in war and the conflict of duty <UNK> love of family br br it brought tears to my eyes especially because the entire film is so well acted and directed plus it tells the story of so many wars where one serves and the other left behind br br i can fully recommend this film as beyond superb
<START> it was <UNK> by a previous poster that the military would not be <UNK> to the police in a disaster as depicted in the film in fact the military role would be to supply aid to the civil authorities when <UNK> to do so the civil authorities would retain in <UNK> the army would need 48 hours or so to <UNK> themselves there not being much army presence in london especially with current overseas <UNK> even then they would be <UNK> on calling in the <UNK> br br as for <UNK> we were given the impression that it was a full <UNK> <UNK> department in its own right even reference to a met police <UNK> division in fact <UNK> stands for <UNK> office <UNK> room a it's just the room where the <UNK> or meet their <UNK> to discuss the current <UNK>
<START> well this may be one of the worst movies ever but <UNK> there are some nice t <UNK> in it the movie is a very bad spoof of the blair witch project and should be watched only by those wanting to see some t <UNK> and no point other than to <UNK> them
<START> an annoying and talentless american documentary maker learns of a legendary br br south african monster the half <UNK> tradition says that it is a half human half <UNK> creature with the closest parallel being that of the werewolf of european tradition rather than focus on the creature the film follows the <UNK> of the film crew there is little action or suspense until late in the film this problem is <UNK> by numerous irritating characters <UNK> a <UNK> amount of even more irritating talk the basic premise is wasted since it is <UNK> by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew br br perhaps the director was influenced by the approach of the blair witch project 1999 or the last broadcast 1998 regardless the film fails on most levels avoid at all costs
<START> i have recently seen a string of <UNK> movies and this film managed to together all the worst aspects of this kind of film you get very little appreciation for the <UNK> <UNK> or the monster that they face while the characters are clichéd spiritual guy leader with tragedy in recent past etc and the ending was just weak it really annoyed me that the director kept shaking the camera or showing almost total darkness to create atmosphere i have read that this movie gave a real representation of <UNK> and yeah i imagine that <UNK> are dark showing near total <UNK> for half the film really brought that home i quite enjoyed the descent which for my money had better acting showed more tight <UNK> situations better monsters and had a good ending br br spoiler br br the monster turns out to be some guy whose plane crashed and parents were killed leaving him to grow up in the <UNK> he seems to have developed super strength and speed but why is never addressed maybe the same force that <UNK> their torch <UNK> caused this but during the film whenever someone is killed you get the impression of something large with <UNK> that tears up each victim see how much blood <UNK> the walls but in the end its just some dude with a fur <UNK> over him and a mask i would be willing to overlook this if great heights of suspense were reached but this was hardly the case then he starts <UNK> the last remaining and roll credits almost <UNK> bad i thought sometimes a film is <UNK> bad you can appreciate it and maybe have a laugh but this films fails to take itself lightly as well br br you watched it you can't <UNK> it
<START> maybe being a government <UNK> is not the most glamorous way of making a living but it's still a way to make a living however after watching this movie one may come away believing that every government <UNK> is a lazy <UNK> <UNK> paper <UNK> who lives exclusively to <UNK> of his next lunch break not exactly a pretty picture but this is the picture that the audience has to endure when watching what is nothing more than another tedious <UNK> <UNK> action movie just what the doctor ordered right how many more of these movies has hollywood made one thousand two thousand the formula for making these movies is so beaten into the dust that by now it should be completely <UNK> the locales change but the plots remain the same and with the same shallow character development and the equally shallow acting as trained performers are asked to <UNK> into pseudo cartoon characters and act <UNK> this movie seemed to run on <UNK> when will this movie end i repeatedly thought to myself <UNK> <UNK> was totally unbelievable as a cia <UNK> but what has to be one of the great of <UNK> an overweight russell <UNK> plays a cia <UNK> please note that in this movie the on site <UNK> is lean and mean while his desk <UNK> <UNK> is fat this is called stereotyping what was the casting director thinking why not have jack nicholson play an overweight office clerk or nicole kidman play a <UNK> department store <UNK> and the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary license could afford it credibility an obviously non arab american mr <UNK> trying to pass himself off as an arab speaking <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> all kinds of hair brain schemes that are doomed to failure trying to out think and real <UNK> who are completely by his laughable arab <UNK> trying to romance a palestinian woman while in the middle of <UNK> a highly sensitive and complex espionage mission etc by now you get the point next time try casting an actual arab in the role not even the most naive movie goer can believe all that there should be a rough balance between the protagonist and antagonist in this movie the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves the story in <UNK> next stop for this movie dvd land and oblivion and one other thing don t let this movie <UNK> you from working for the government the pay may not be great but the <UNK> benefits are excellent a critical fact that this movie conveniently <UNK>
<START> martin first film offers an exceptional <UNK> answer three years later to <UNK> <UNK> more conservative on the <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> immensely from an <UNK> marlon brando who inadvertently disguised <UNK> offensive theme of trying to justify <UNK> names as kazan did eagerly before the house un american activities <UNK> edge of the city boasts a young john cassavetes and an <UNK> sidney <UNK> daring to confront issues that <UNK> failed to acknowledge namely <UNK> rights and race relations br br edge of the city <UNK> <UNK> into this then unknown territory and although the quite appealing black protagonist <UNK> may seem a bit hollywood simplistic the courageous struggle against <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and violence has hardly aged at all one wonders how shocked initial 1957 <UNK> were at such a bold presentation of white black relations if some of the <UNK> didn't leave the theater early they must of left <UNK> if not offended br br the last reel of the film will still surprise audiences as it refuses to sink into expected clichés including those that <UNK> <UNK> only the most jaded viewers will not realize what a radical and entertaining film edge of the city ends up being br br what's most disturbing about this lost classic how it sadly remains <UNK> on any format for reasons that remain quite <UNK> this film should be required viewing in high school or college history classes across the country yet one can only find it on obscure late night tv if ever at all
<START> don't forget the lover on the side she is a karen parsons is delicious she is wonderful in acting and beauty and style it's just his job ho well now here is a show that the writing slugs you in the gut and while your <UNK> over kicks you in the butt in <UNK> <UNK> wife the associate writer producer she said when they were watching the for up coming <UNK> shows at an abc network party she looked at her husband after the preview for 'the <UNK> played and said this doesn't look like anything else that is on this network you guys are in trouble meaning it <UNK> very good but it's not looking like the regular happy people fare or over hair <UNK> drama that they abc are regularly comfortable putting on the from the time i saw this after the first episode finished i made sure that i didn't miss that time <UNK> next week i was instantly addicted to the job cutting wit and cynicism outrageous situations and laughter rolling writers makes this series a hit br br then i felt anger and a feeling of being let down that the show just <UNK> off the air i wondered what executive made that decision to tear down a major comedy <UNK> for their network br br i talked to other people about it some knowing some not but i know that the stupid network didn't promote this hard enough or i should say visually enough if they had it would have run at least 3 5 seasons maybe even six i just believe that knowing network short <UNK> and being overly <UNK> to one or another that they missed the boat with this one there was so much room for <UNK> it had barely just begun the situations were funny and serious fast and sometimes slow though not much it kept a good pace some years later i finally found it on dvd new for 50 00 to me it would be worth 1 000 00 to have this in my entertainment library i watched in <UNK> as i went through both seasons again for the third time on dvd and the ending episode was going into a total serious drama segment with them <UNK> a murder victim it was better than most of the drama and <UNK> shows on the air now they went into the scenes as serious as a heart attack and as believable did so as if not even skipping a beat just like it was meant to be serious i am so impressed with the that and <UNK> shared in the story lines and scripts br br in another outrage of the <UNK> i learned that the beautiful wardrobe of <UNK> ties and expensive suits with pressed shirts and ultra stylish <UNK> was all sold to the movie made for cable in the cut 2003 for only four hundred dollars thats it i'm sick did you see what they all wear for each show a good over coat alone could run that much br br this was denis <UNK> at some of his finest i recommend this great cop for east <UNK> or wherever you are in this country i even heard that people from ireland were joking with <UNK> the episode repeating lines back to him from that one because they saw it over there a superbly <UNK> comedic new york <UNK> cop show
<START> i just finishing watching <UNK> <UNK> that i ordered from my library i remembered it vaguely from years ago and wanted to watch it with my son anyway the movie was less than 2 hours running time and i thought it was much longer when i first saw it the back of the vhs box states that the <UNK> a nazi file whose secrets could destroy the free world forever the <UNK> were supposedly on a <UNK> mission to retrieve the demonic document there was nothing even spoken about <UNK> this document also the box says that the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on human blood that would make this a horror movie and there was also nothing revealed in the movie about this i can't remember the details when i watched this years ago on tv but could the back of this box actually be true maybe the 3 hour movie revealed more details br br just wondering if anyone knows anything about this
<START> i've been watching buffy the vampire <UNK> and really didn't begin to love the show until season 4 started this episode <UNK> was view by me alone in the dark just after midnight with my windows open and the wind blowing through <UNK> by an after storm the writers of this episode did an excellent job <UNK> the heck out of me i was in awe the entire episode which i just finished 2 minutes ago amazing doesn't touch the surface of what this episode <UNK> with almost no dialogue if you've never given this show much thought at least watch this episode if this doesn't impress you then no episode probably will br br btw my heart is still racing
<START> seven months since a <UNK> viewing of faces i finally found a <UNK> dvd copy of <UNK> first feature shot on a <UNK> in manhattan and in his acting <UNK> on ad <UNK> sets shadows was the <UNK> of months of <UNK> <UNK> in which the mostly amateur actors developed bonds with one another invented their characters and polished their techniques to give their filmed performances just the right <UNK> of spontaneous <UNK> this intimate approach led to some incredibly daring work in e seymour <UNK> <UNK> his hands down <UNK> <UNK> throat in an attempt to revive her from an as the actors' utter conviction here <UNK> <UNK> honest moments like <UNK> and tony's post <UNK> <UNK> of their relationship and ben's <UNK> at a black woman's touch as a <UNK> of his racial confusion and self loathing a <UNK> production in the best sense the out of sync dubbing and sound recording and the cinematography and up close camera <UNK> build an <UNK> atmosphere that perfectly suits <UNK> nuanced vision of human relationships as <UNK> works in progress marked by desperate emotional <UNK> and <UNK> attempts at communication and understanding charles largely improvised jazz score is an ideal <UNK> to the film's vision of living by the moment a <UNK> by which cassavetes worked and seemingly lived
<START> oh you pilots are such men they don't call it the <UNK> for nothing honey dialogue like that is just one of many reasons why the airport <UNK> or if you saw it in the uk where it dragged its heels getting released there airport <UNK> the <UNK> was the last and by far the least of the series the disaster movie was in dire <UNK> in the what with the <UNK> having offered much unintentional hilarity and beyond the <UNK> adventure when time ran out and city on fire simply offering much boredom and the desperation to find a new spin on the genre is all too apparent here this time it's a conspiracy plot with susan news <UNK> discovering <UNK> boyfriend robert wagner has been selling arms to terrorists and the north <UNK> naturally she decides to tell him everything rather than make the story public but he her off by explaining i'm a very rich man i have everything in life i could ever want why would i that by doing something so incredibly stupid just in case she doesn't buy that line rather than say hire a hit man to kill her on the ground he decides to do things the smart way by planning to destroy the <UNK> while she's flying to <UNK> via paris i've done a lot of things i've been ashamed of but i am not a murderer he insists <UNK> on his way to a guided missile to destroy the plane so nothing incredibly stupid there and when that fails he sends a jet fighter after it and when that br br don't even think of looking for anything resembling logic here this is real bottom of the barrel stuff that even the studio gave up on and <UNK> as a comedy in the us after critics laughed it off the screen where the previous three entries all had the look of glossy big budget <UNK> this small screen friendly effort the only one not to be shot in 2 35 1 widescreen doesn't even manage to make the <UNK> look good which is quite a feat tv veteran david <UNK> rich presumably got the directing gig because he was fast cheap and had previously directed tv movie disaster in the sky where peter <UNK> <UNK> airplane found itself unable to land due to <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> which was not intentionally at least a comedy despite the presence of a young billy crystal in the cast and seemed like the natural choice for what looks like a tv movie that somehow escaped into theatres when no one was looking br br cast like a bad episode of hollywood <UNK> stars are in very short supply this time round and most of the few vaguely familiar faces seem to have been rounded up from <UNK> and <UNK> sitcoms <UNK> <UNK> gives the hollywood career that one last shot as the pilot happy fish don't ask george kennedy moves from the executive <UNK> to the co <UNK> seat in the hope of reminding people of the other movies while the rest of the ensemble includes a couple of veterans of the

future oscar winner and screenwriter of <UNK> and the <UNK> eric roth hey everybody has to start somewhere although in his <UNK> it was producer <UNK> lang who came up with the plot still what do you expect from a film that credits stunt and ends with a shot of the <UNK> flying off into the sunset amazingly in one of those won't admit defeat moments studios used to be prone to universal shot another 20 minutes or so of footage a couple of years later to include in the network tv <UNK> not included on the dvd sadly its box office failure led to the fifth entry in the series the laugh riot that would have been airport 1984 <UNK> never getting off the ground even more genuinely <UNK> it was the <UNK> used in this film that crashed in france 21 years later br br oh and if you're wondering what <UNK> says to her <UNK> in spanish when it's not allowed on board it's what do you think don't worry when the revolution comes i promise you will fly on anything you want i promise what a shame my love what do they think they are
<START> oh man i hated this movie granted the site locations were great but that's about the only positive thing i can say about it now i'm going to state right at the beginning that i am very critical of the way weapons especially <UNK> are both portrayed and handled in movies being a war flick portrayal was fine but the shoddy weapons handling in the movie would have never been <UNK> by a real seal team the acting was more wooden than my first the equipment carried or lack of it was laughable and the dialogue was shall we say lacking in anything interesting well with the exception of the journalist which was actually <UNK> watching this movie was comparable to watching with woody <UNK> where each scene was so bad you just couldn't turn it off because you had to see if they could get worse with the next scene like they certainly did the scene in the water where after shooting the first of the enemy they blow the damn boat up thereby having to face possible drowning made me laugh so hard that for a <UNK> i almost thought it was worth waiting through the movie for then charlie sheen decided to drag the surviving enemy down to the depths of the ocean the way it was filmed with the many camera cuts it looked like they went down about 80 feet nice continuity there before <UNK> his throat was so damn stupid i was stunned then again so was the whole damn movie i enjoy action movies but not this one note the version i watched was a tv version pan <UNK> i can't imagine that made a difference except for making the whole thing <UNK> shorter
<START> i remember really liking batman returns when it came out in 1992 but now i think that this is the best of all the batman movies even over christopher <UNK> terrific 2005 batman begins and definitely over the seriously over hyped overrated 2008 the dark knight i originally remember thinking that the 1st batman w jack nicholson was the best and i still love it but i think that this movie really hits the nail on the head the 4 main characters batman penguin <UNK> and max are all vivid and memorable you really get to see what batman bruce wayne is all about in keaton's terrific characterization keaton is the best batman not kilmer clooney or even the up and coming <UNK> who was exceptional in <UNK> and could have stolen top <UNK> from keaton had his character not been destroyed by <UNK> hack film making in br br danny <UNK> as the penguin is disturbing scary hilarious and lethal <UNK> is great and doesn't need scenery chewing to give great performance like <UNK> joker the viewer can actually sympathize with this <UNK> <UNK> and his plight to fit into normal society i had never really been big fan of michelle pfeiffer until this film but this is definitely my favorite performance of hers <UNK> kyle is goofy and odd at first then when she is transformed into <UNK> she is simultaneously sexy and scary a total deadly <UNK> also i feel that keaton and pfeiffer have more chemistry than keaton and basinger from batman they form a tragic love story and christopher walken as is well as always christopher walken br br batman returns more so than batman is more confident and focused it is assured film making from beginning to end the way burton introduces the <UNK> heartbreaking <UNK> grabs you from the very beginning the first 5 minutes are among my favorite <UNK> to any film danny <UNK> music sets an ominous foreboding tone that <UNK> the rest of the film it is a <UNK> from the original batman and a great one br br then flash forward 33 years to the present day <UNK> and we are introduced to powerful businessman who wants to build new power plant in <UNK> during same scene we meet meek <UNK> under confident secretary <UNK> kyle and not long after all this is the film's exciting opening action sequence as batman must battle the <UNK> red triangle gang a fun yet lethal group of <UNK> and circus performers penguin sets plan in motion to attack the <UNK> christmas celebration kidnap in the chaos and force him to help re introduce him to society meanwhile <UNK> discovers criminal plans and so he kills her by <UNK> her out his high rise office then she is <UNK> by cats br br sound convoluted yes but burton never claimed to be posing a realistic story he has created a world where the viewer can accept that things like this can happen a dark <UNK> world comprised of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who deep down only want acceptance and to fit in confident storytelling if you ask me br br the action scenes are few and far in between but they are all exciting entertaining and nail biting they aren't there just for show the way some in batman are and they all make sense the climactic scene with <UNK> army <UNK> into the center of <UNK> with batman in on <UNK> <UNK> and sidekick butler alfred michael <UNK> in a welcome return from the original <UNK> batman is <UNK> solid heart <UNK> fun br br i also love the <UNK> <UNK> setting which adds to the super dark cold feel of <UNK> batman world i also love the way burton slowly introduces to us the batman toys without <UNK> them down our throats each toy is appropriate for that moment in the film and we are compelled to accept them for their purpose and although dark returns is still a funny film <UNK> penguin has many funny lines so does <UNK> the batman <UNK> <UNK> are extremely stimulating and humor filled as well a great ensemble all in all batman returns is a tightly woven tale of the dark forces at play in tim <UNK> fun comic book world
<START> fun entertaining movie about wwii german spy julie andrews falling in love with american pilot rock hudson while trying to get secrets from him for some reason this was attacked by critics and <UNK> by the public in 1970 i can't see why it's beautifully shot has wonderful costumes and interiors and exciting <UNK> <UNK> also it has andrews doing a strip <UNK> strictly pg material and singing a beautiful song <UNK> in the dark the movie does have problems andrews and hudson did not get along during the shooting of this and it shows their love scenes lack spark and they have zero sexual chemistry still they turn in ok performances the film is a little long even in the <UNK> min director's cut i saw and gets way too dark and serious at the end still worth catching try seeing the directors cut the other one runs half an hour longer
<START> i agree with the other 9 and 10 star reviews i saw this at the south by <UNK> film festival in austin of the 20 films i saw 7 were really good and this was the best one for me i'm a sucker for movies that have plot devices where characters go through <UNK> that totally change their lives the excellent acting was mostly done by people involved in tv or it was their first movie it was written and directed by jay <UNK> this was his debut as a director <UNK> day job is apparently as a <UNK> <UNK> for lots of famous films <UNK> the was a total delight and extremely funny in spots this is one movie where i would buy the dvd and re watch it truly a high <UNK> from me well done jay yes give up your day job
<START> the best thing and that's pretty good about the black castle is that it's a black and white gothic <UNK> featuring a murderous mad count which was somehow made in <UNK> the star ostensibly is the british actor richard greene a capable leading man who reminds me of an earlier version of roger moore the villain is a mad count played by stephen <UNK> who does a credible job except when he's called on to laugh <UNK> <UNK> around in the shadows is a long boris karloff in a decidedly secondary role of an aged doctor who may or may not be the salvation of our hero br br it's the middle of the 18th century in <UNK> and sir ronald burton greene is determined to find out what happened to two close friends they disappeared in the <UNK> of the castle <UNK> to count karl von bruno <UNK> deep in the black forest it seems that sir ronald and his friends had been <UNK> in <UNK> a brutal plan of von <UNK> in africa three years previously involving slavery and <UNK> the count was left not only with failure but with a <UNK> on his face and a black <UNK> he now wears to cover a ruined eye von bruno <UNK> revenge and it seems he might have been partially successful so under a false name sir ronald <UNK> for a hunting <UNK> from the count and off we go by <UNK> through a dark journey of storm and howling wolves to the <UNK> castle it's a <UNK> mass of stone <UNK> and corridors shadowy huge <UNK> and creepy <UNK> that lead to <UNK> <UNK> cells a torture chamber and a great pit filled with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it also is filled by the <UNK> lovely blond sensitive wife <UNK> paula who sometimes is billed as rita and by the <UNK> two close friends played by those two actors we know from the fifties who <UNK> in being <UNK> in costume john <UNK> and michael there is a dangerous <UNK> hunt forbidden kisses <UNK> servants wooden signs <UNK> and <UNK> in the cold wind and poison in a cup not the least doctor karloff has a special <UNK> filled with a drug which will so slow the <UNK> functions that death will seem to have occurred the risk is that well when the person <UNK> ten hours later he'd better hope he's not already nailed shut in his coffin br br surprisingly for all the clichés the black castle keeps moving <UNK> along the movie takes itself seriously but it's competently enough made to keep our interest even if we wind up sitting back with a smile while we watch it's even <UNK> in a way to realize there are strong echoes of the most dangerous game when burton realizes just how crazy von bruno is he becomes even more determined to bring von bruno to accounts and naturally he has fallen for <UNK> von bruno crazed by vengeance yet <UNK> and capable is a man who loves the hunt and is by the kill hollywood's second creative rule has always been if you're going to steal steal from the best it's first creative rule of course is if you're going to steal steal from the best and then turn it into the black castle is a nice bite of <UNK>
<START> good show really good acting and the director takes us swimming through his storyline in an interesting unpredictable way especially since essentially it's two people in a room it doesn't race through like many modern films but doesn't drag either is <UNK> enough to believe her in the now of her character which is still involved and not going back on her choices so it is believable without the need for her to show us a deep self examination of her soul <UNK> has the delicate balance of weight innocence and class to pull off very well a bit grainy on the film quality but it fits the tone of the story could use a little <UNK> on the hair and makeup end of things but definitely worth watching
<START> i don't want to spoil the movie for anyone but this <UNK> life's reality in so many ways and if you are really honest with yourself you will <UNK> with it in <UNK> in at least a few of the scenes br br the acting is not only believable but convincing in a way that one to the characters moreover it's funny without trying too hard at it br br and yes i truly believe a sequel is <UNK> here see the movie you'll understand why br br highly recommended especially if you like movies that have a real message
<START> good attempt at <UNK> the unconventional topic of may december romances however the treatment is totally unrealistic sure sixty year old men can and do fall for younger women but they're usually adult women with whom they share common interests and values and <UNK> not neurotic immature near <UNK> girls of course there are exceptions and they come close to being called <UNK> sorry <UNK> but it's not credible that a sane and accomplished would throw away a comfortable family life and become a joke to his peers all for an 18 <UNK> old that doesn't have a practical thought in her head and that behaves like an unstable <UNK> from a mental institution you don't have to have a <UNK> in psychology to see that <UNK> character is <UNK> by sex and that the young woman has <UNK> <UNK> and daddy issues br br as for the recurring scene of <UNK> <UNK> on the edge of a cliff <UNK> suicide that's about as close as he comes to having anything in common with by behaving like a smitten teenage boy br br on a positive note the actors did a good job and cinematography good
<START> i really do not joke when i can honestly submit that this film is not suitable for sunday night viewing on br br the underground scenes are just awful when london is supposedly under of water robert character is drab the police outfit reminds me of something kate moss threw up and <UNK> looks very very old in fact i am worried that he may have had suffered a stroke whilst filming br br the father of robert <UNK> who was <UNK> all has obviously been <UNK> too many and whilst he has a major part in this awkward journey he deserved to be killed off way way before he was caught pretending to be kate <UNK> titanic whilst <UNK> over the <UNK> <UNK> br br i'm sorry film lovers but avoid at all costs
<START> the problem with this and with all vietnam war films is that they're all too biased <UNK> films overlook the fact that the vast majority of u s soldiers were heroes while films overlook the fact that a lot of the soldiers did indeed commit atrocities like the one in this movie this film sucks it's time for a movie that is neither nor <UNK> nor liberal nor conservative but completely <UNK>
<START> this columbo episode is one of the better and perhaps one of my personal favorites the cast includes rosemary's baby john cassavetes as the <UNK> his wife played by <UNK> <UNK> gwyneth <UNK> mom and his mother in law played by myrna loy one of america's greatest leading actresses in film of our time anyway i disagree with anybody who <UNK> against this film this episode is one of my favorites because you have an excellent cast who do a superb job in performing i love watching columbo with his beloved dog who he never names in the series this time the episode focuses in on classical music at the hollywood bowl one of l a 's <UNK> of course columbo becomes as interested in classical music as he does anything else involving a crime
<START> very sadly i can relate to this movie as i'm 17 and have yet to be <UNK> so i really feel for <UNK> it's been a while since seeing this film but to write this review i re watched it and remembered everything i loved about it br br drew barrymore is a great actress and this role suited her really well at the time the chemistry between sam and <UNK> was really good and michael <UNK> was an excellent actor in this br br i loved the storyline too as i said up there i could relate and it's rare you find a film you can completely relate to br br all over i loved it 7 10
<START> <UNK> of the accuracy of facts <UNK> queen is a true story its true because the themes it deals with hold as much truth today as they did way back in 1994 this movie is violent powerful and thought provoking the protagonist is a woman of flesh and blood whose <UNK> brought out the best or worst out of her keeping the <UNK> aside there is no doubt that character from a young girl of 8 who is married off by her father to clear a debt pun intended to a gang leader who goes on to become a leader of the lower <UNK> has evolved into a champion in her own right her portrayal is so powerful that the viewer is even willing to forgive her for a massacre br br i can understand if the western audience is not able to appreciate this masterpiece <UNK> queen needs to be in the indian context and not just checked out in stereotypes i may not be able to sell it on its universal appeal but its certainly a must watch for the indian audience its a shame that the movie had a <UNK> overtly <UNK> release in india br br <UNK> queen is the story of a woman who fought against two odds in india being a woman and that too a lower <UNK> her rebellious nature and inability to just give in caused her the most horrible experiences in life which only went on to <UNK> her into a self <UNK> <UNK> she <UNK> to violence with violence and <UNK> become the <UNK> woman society wanted her to be call it divine justice or failure had she killed a single person she would have been <UNK> she killed 24 and got <UNK> respected and <UNK> br br p s whoever found her character psychotic needs to be <UNK> at 8 by 10 men at a go and <UNK> naked then they should be asked how normal do they feel
<START> this movie was pure genius john waters is brilliant it is hilarious and i am not sick of it even after seeing it about 20 times since i bought it a few months ago the acting is great although <UNK> lake could have been better and johnny <UNK> is magnificent he is such a beautiful man and a very talented actor and seeing most of <UNK> movies this is probably my favorite i give it 9 5 10 rent it today
<START> rented this one by mistake thinking it was another film with the same title and realizing that i had rented it some time before br br quick plot line a couple <UNK> of an artist and photographer rent a studio apartment in los angeles from joe <UNK> still <UNK> the fact his brother martin sheen could actually act they find a bed in a forgotten room but the bed is haunted by a nasty looking serial killer from the 1930's and his last victim their ghosts inhabit the couple first <UNK> their sex life but eventually becoming more menacing br br what ensues is cheap r rated sex scenes cheaper thrills and kind of a waste of time
<START> here's another pleasant surprise whenever i hear a movie is being remade i cringe movies such as gone in sixty seconds and the day of the get remade and the results are less than stellar so when i heard that the italian job was getting remade i expected it to be bad br br well i had the opportunity to calm down read some reviews and finally see the movie and was <UNK> wrong granted it's not original and predictable but it's sure fun from beginning to end you are taken on one very fun ride the scenes with the <UNK> are great and the characters actually enjoy themselves br br so even if there are some flaws who cares as long as it's fun br br overall 8 out of 10 the only points lost are maybe the a few details and a slight lack of realism but you'll be having so much fun you won't even be given a chance to stop and notice
<START> before you dismiss my post as not getting it let me say i'm one of the biggest richard kelly and the twilight zone fans out there <UNK> <UNK> is one my all time favorites and i even thought tales had it's moments i'm a huge sci fi fan i was very excited to see the box couldn't wait for it to come out br br having said that the box is terrible behind drag me to hell this was the worst movie i've seen in 2009 and it just simply will not end whenever you think you've reached the end another change in the plot and you're off to more torture i was actually <UNK> in the theater by the end of the film i could hardly take it anymore br br the biggest problem with the box no matter how you slice it or try to justify it is that it simply makes little sense trust me i got it i understood what was going on but that doesn't mean it makes a lot of sense looking back on it take the <UNK> for example the main couple cameron diaz and james <UNK> playing norma and arthur lewis diaz loses her <UNK> at her job then <UNK> to her husband that they are living paycheck to paycheck well sell that f ing <UNK> your husband is driving then they live in a beautiful 2 story house in a nice <UNK> <UNK> is working what seems to be a high paid job at <UNK> and diaz is an accomplished teacher and yes <UNK> drives an overly expensive car but they are somehow living paycheck to paycheck no need to press the button just cut down your high <UNK> lifestyle a bit the movie would have worked better if they showed the couple <UNK> and in serious debt instead they are seemingly desperate for money all the while living what i would call a <UNK> lifestyle like i said you can understand what's going on yet it still makes little sense that's a rare combination br br there was an awful scene in a library that i feel will go down as one of the worst segments in movie history terribly acted too by the way it was idiotic illogical and out of place i can't even begin to fully describe it actually so i will move onto a subplot that involves nose <UNK> and body possession by aliens yes i'm being serious unfortunately a kid is in <UNK> class with a wicked and smile on his face a sinister smile that seemingly goes by completely <UNK> by everyone in authority at the school he starts asking diaz personal questions literally embarrassing her in front of her class no punishment is given to the kid whatsoever he didn't even get asked to stay after class for a talk then diaz is at a party and the same kid is one of the hired help <UNK> shirt <UNK> and all i don't know many alien possessed kids who appear to be in junior high that also <UNK> as a bus boy at parties <UNK> by teachers and school officials but we found one here see what i mean you can understand it completely but it still makes no sense a rare <UNK> like many things in the movie the kid comes and goes no real explanation about him no ending to his character moving on a lady then approaches diaz in a <UNK> store telling her that experiments are being ran secretly and her family is one of the test subjects well hmmm if aliens possess the powers where they can take over a body remotely and the aliens don't want to help diaz then who was taking over this <UNK> body and giving diaz advice again the lady was trying to help diaz and the aliens weren't interested in helping diaz so who the hell was controlling her body never explained never talked about again no nothing it goes on and on and on like this for what seemed to me like 2 weeks it would not end i wonder if this movie <UNK> a massive re shoot at some point it was poorly edited <UNK> accent was there one minute gone the next sub plots began but never ended the numerous push backs of the release date obviously shows the problems the producers had with the finished product it's truly a train wreck br br pass on this one there's no redeeming value in it whatsoever 3 out of 10 just because i like diaz and sci fi but it probably deserves a 1 out of 10 br br thanks for reading br br <UNK>
<START> br br i thought that this movie lacked the building dramatic suspense the first movie had this is hard to accomplish when the film takes place over a week the original movie lead up to the final climatic scene over a period of a year and it still was less violent than the sequel one good thing about this film was the movie went by relatively quickly because the plot seemed rushed when <UNK> best friend died there was no funeral mentioned in the movie another bring down was the involvement of amy irving all her scenes brought down the movies pace the dialog in this movie was terrible it in no way reflected the way kids talk in conclusion this movie could have been a hit but fell apart after the opening scene
<START> this is a truly great and beautiful movie the underlying theme of this movie is the innocent child heather graham as struggling to make her naive wishes for how the world should be make sense while being <UNK> beaten down by the real world it's not an unhappy movie though exactly the opposite it's a funny movie with a sad side but just thinking about the movie makes me feel so happy near the beginning of the movie beautiful vulnerable confronts a drug addict attempting to break into her friend's car she reasons with him convinces him to seek help and gives him 30 as a start at the end of the movie he <UNK> to pay her back explains that he is off drugs doing well and he thanks her i can hear the <UNK> <UNK> of course that would never really happen this movie doesn't take place in the real world it takes place in the world we wished we lived in the sad part is realizing we don't live there the happy part is knowing there are people wishing we did
<START> i thought the this film had an interesting name and just might have proved thought provoking but was i wrong this film was boring especially in the beginning and the middle parts i cannot comment on the ending because i just couldn't stand watching the whole film the premise of <UNK> a student <UNK> just because he walks into your lab makes no sense this student had an interesting type of moving robot in his apartment and sadly enough this non living thing is more interesting than the characters in this film so if you are having trouble with sleep then i recommend that you rent this film
<START> i watched on movie theater at my city my friend took away me and i was really curious what would be it looked like well i must say this movie was not a horror may be we can say that is ok here i go anyway but there was a lot of shooting acting dramatic theatrical and storytelling problems i can understand because of director is very young and is his first feature film ok directing of this film was not pretty bad i see unfortunately due to the <UNK> placed on the film by its extremely low budget the visuals are often as murky as the storyline and there is no powerful gothic scenes as a horror movie it really fails no scares at all and it is quite muddled and boring some people say is an art movie but i could not see a laughable terrible and off art movie like that so how can we say it is an art movie just funny
<START> i had high hopes when i went into the theatre having seen the trailer i was as hyped as the next person to see great talent participate in the making of a story with a beautiful premise br br however it's disappointing to see this talent laid waste by the poor composition of songs the words are <UNK> and cheesy probably because it was composed with a more western theme i wouldn't find it difficult to imagine the same <UNK> with french or english lyrics in <UNK> they just sound strange br br the musical items were also cut together badly far too quickly to be enjoyable and the shots of the actors looking <UNK> lasted far too long br br the special effects are the next disappointment suffice it to say it is highly obvious where the special effects start and stop br br it's not <UNK> <UNK> and it's not in the mood either <UNK> of the occasional and very similar slow <UNK> theme altogether and hour too long to tell a simple story
<START> i was pleasantly surprised by how good the movie was whether you're a gore fan or a suspense fan you'll love this i used to dislike horror movies considered them stupid but anyway it happens i make exceptions i find something really extraordinary in this film rarely have i ever seen a film that has scared the crap out of me but i tell you the truth this film gave me <UNK> down my neck unlike most horror films this one cares about the development of the characters i highly recommend this film and i'm glad that asylum are finally bringing out good horror movies these days br br i recommend enjoy
<START> mike <UNK> film charlie <UNK> war set in the 1980's tells the story of how the title character played by tom hanks managed to <UNK> a <UNK> war with the <UNK> by way of <UNK> the <UNK> forces of course we know how well that turned out in the long run but thankfully the film does not <UNK> over the unpleasant after effects br br the cast is star <UNK> with tom hanks and julia roberts being among the most <UNK> stars in hollywood as a bonus you've got the versatile philip seymour hoffman in a <UNK> memorable supporting role one for which he received a not <UNK> oscar nomination i'm not much of a fan of roberts but hanks is always <UNK> nevertheless i can't quite buy into him as a drug using <UNK> although the real charlie wilson seems just as <UNK> likable as hanks apart from the big three though there's not much worth <UNK> on even from a recognizable name like amy adams br br the story is engaging and is <UNK> by a fine script from aaron the verbal interplay between the main characters is excellent and is chock full of memorable lines the later events set into motion by the war are not ignored though the <UNK> scenes <UNK> wilson seem to me to be too earnest to achieve the bittersweet feel which was likely intended on the whole <UNK> direction is <UNK> and follows the action of the script admirably br br this is a film that like charlie wilson himself has flaws but is nevertheless <UNK> likable certainly recommended for fans of the three stars and for those looking for an engaging political drama with a light hearted feel
<START> alexandra <UNK> wrote a horrible sequel to margaret <UNK> masterpiece book published in the 1930's margaret <UNK> <UNK> sold out their rights and for big bucks allowed alexandra <UNK> to write a piece of junk book even worse than barbara <UNK> romance novels i was a huge fan of margaret book and the fake sequel by alexandra <UNK> was written just to cash in for money br br although i always admired the acting talent of <UNK> kilmer and timothy dalton this is a really terrible film the script is horrible and full of clichés ann cameo as belle <UNK> is so awful i wanted to slap her br br the only worthwhile thing in the movie is sean bean who gives a masterful <UNK> performance as the sexy <UNK> villain lord <UNK> sean <UNK> performance is along the lines of the man you love to hate and portrays an <UNK> sex symbol br br but sean bean is only in the first half of the movie so you then have to be tormented with watching an incredibly long 6 hour movie with an <UNK> boring script br br don't waste your money on this film unless you are a hard core sean bean fan and just watch it for his wonderful performance
<START> the regard of flight written and performed by bill irwin is a true classic theatre piece which translated quite well to the small screen full of quick and <UNK> dialog and some of the best physical comedy of the decade it is head and shoulders above 99 of comedy as it is presented today i am sure it will one day take its <UNK> place with such great shows as the and waiting for <UNK> why it isn't available on dvd yet is a mystery and a tragedy
<START> if you see the title a sex odyssey in the video store beware the cover has <UNK> wells and three other 80's porn stars and has a <UNK> of 1986 if you're like me and i hope you're not you'll think 80's porn <UNK> wells alright <UNK> it was made in 1974 and has dubbed german stars there's nothing <UNK> wrong with 70's german porn but it's not my cup of tea and it's nothing like what the cover leads you to believe you're getting once i got past my rage about the blatantly misleading jacket i watched it anyway it's a bad bad movie sorry i guess i didn't really get past the rage
<START> shot entirely on location in <UNK> the man with the screaming brain is a hilarious love story between two rich ugly american types and a murderous hotel maid gypsy br br william cole and his wife jackie arrive in <UNK> on a business trip and catch a cab driven by hustler things start to go awry when the maid murders and william and a mad scientist <UNK> a piece of brain in <UNK> head robots eventually become involved as do <UNK> with broken fingers head <UNK> bruce campbell riding a pink <UNK> with <UNK> little <UNK> and all of me style physical comedy by a character at war with a voice in his brain who controls half of his body br br the man with the screaming brain is an incredibly funny film it has the most hilarious tracking shot i have ever seen when bruce <UNK> character fresh from the lab and complete with giant <UNK> <UNK> and blue hospital <UNK> runs into a square and scares a crowd of people and a falling down the steps murder scene that had the entire test screening audience screaming laughing the whole thing is a damn riot from beginning to end and i would recommend it to any fan of physical comedy bruce campbell or b movies in general
<START> i feel that this movie is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who actually care about each other they may have faults but <UNK> and put downs have no place with these girls try to find that on tv or in the usual movies it is a breath of fresh air to see girls being feminine wearing beautiful feminine dresses and shoes contrast that with the <UNK> in stores today i e <UNK> and faded <UNK> and <UNK> etc the story line has an evil thread running through but that is what makes it more realistic and interesting i know that it is animated but it still gives you a feeling that families can stick together and come out okay i would recommend this movie for boys and girls alike
<START> set in 1976 for no apparent reason other than to keep the set <UNK> busy 'the <UNK> was directed by richard kelly and stars cameron diaz and james <UNK> as norma and arthur lewis a young couple who are supposedly struggling <UNK> even though they both have successful careers she as a high school teacher he as an <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> virginia research center they have one child walter sam oz stone br br one day the find a <UNK> on their <UNK> containing a black box with a big red button there is a note from a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that he will return at 5 00 <UNK> to explain about the box br br the mysterious <UNK> <UNK> played by frank <UNK> shows up at the <UNK> time <UNK> in an elegant row suit he is polite but <UNK> however his most noticeable feature is his face half of which appears to have been blown off and <UNK> attended to <UNK> is the only thing worth watching in the movie however he is unfortunately <UNK> by his own makeup which resembles that of harvey <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> aaron from christopher <UNK> 'the dark knight ' it's like the elephant in the room one can try to ignore it but it's more than a little distracting br br <UNK> explains that he will return in 24 hours to collect the button if during that time they decide to <UNK> and push the button he will give them 1 million cash the only catch and it's a big one is that somewhere a stranger will die it might be across town it might be on another continent however <UNK> <UNK> them the victim will be someone unknown to them as a show of good faith he leaves them with a crisp 100 bill theirs to keep whether they push the button or not br br arthur and norma are skeptical believing the whole thing to be a <UNK> or an elaborate <UNK> however it isn't long before they begin to wonder what would happen if they did push the button would they really get a million dollars would somebody really die weary of the <UNK> norma <UNK> the button nothing happens however their initial relief gives way to alarm when <UNK> shows up the next day with a <UNK> full of cash they decide to call the whole thing off however <UNK> tells them it's too late you've already pushed the button he explains as <UNK> <UNK> pulls away arthur notes the license number which he later discovers is <UNK> to the <UNK> national security agency br br at this point the film begins to <UNK> deeply into territory as the secondary characters start <UNK> <UNK> and flashing peace signs meanwhile the town becomes <UNK> by <UNK> slack <UNK> <UNK> in bad shirts who start following arthur around like an advance <UNK> party for a race of zombie alien <UNK> arthur eventually becomes trapped by the menacing in the library where <UNK> <UNK> wife shows up whom we haven't seen till now and informs arthur that in order to get out of the library he must step into one of three <UNK> <UNK> of cheesy looking digital water effects <UNK> happens if i choose the wrong one ' arthur asks seeming far less <UNK> than he ought to be under the circumstances and certainly far less <UNK> than the audience is by this time <UNK> <UNK> ' the <UNK> says <UNK> br br arthur steps into the middle <UNK> of digital <UNK> effects and after a brief absence suddenly appears still in his water <UNK> <UNK> over bed when she wakes up and sees him the water bubble bursts and arthur <UNK> onto the bed in a shower of water which oddly enough continues to <UNK> from the <UNK> water <UNK> just out of camera range while a <UNK> <UNK> and diaz flop around on the bed br br it's confusing i know br br we eventually learn that <UNK> was once the public relations officer for the <UNK> until he was struck by a lightning <UNK> that destroyed part of his face he was <UNK> dead but later came back to life having been transformed into a sort of superman who now serves 'the ones who make the lightning ' and whose powers have <UNK> him to take over the cia the <UNK> and <UNK> all by himself br br and what is the point of all this rubbish apparently <UNK> mission is to subject humans to a kind of biblical character test e g the of to determine whether humanity is worth saving if enough people pass the button test by <UNK> to push it <UNK> god like <UNK> will spare the race unfortunately those people who do push the button such as norma and arthur must be <UNK> for their moral <UNK> to which end they are subjected to a series of dreary <UNK> or the <UNK> <UNK> that play out like one of those <UNK> movies ' except without the entertaining gore or the benefit of a coherent plot br br 'the <UNK> represents the sort of pointless mental masturbation that <UNK> philosophy students like to <UNK> on about after a few beers richard kelly's tedious exercise in <UNK> eventually <UNK> under the weight of its own <UNK> the tortured <UNK> of <UNK> ideas eventually as with the mixing together of too many colors into a meandering gray goo of a film as insipid as one of those in flight movies the plot of which suffers no more or less from having been interrupted by a <UNK> <UNK> br br there is a point in 'the <UNK> where arthur who is a technically minded guy becomes curious about how the button works opening up the unit he is disappointed to find nothing inside br br having seen the box i know exactly how he feels
<START> laura <UNK> plays a magazine photographer who is sent to africa for a photo shoot there she is met by a couple and other swinging couples they all stay at this huge very <UNK> hotel with a gigantic swimming pool one night they have a pool party complete with real live native dancers it's very un politically correct and very <UNK> later <UNK> finally has her photo shoot which turns out to be in one of those drive through stay in your car <UNK> albeit the photography is gorgeous throughout the film <UNK> is going after every man she meets the photography is very well done in this film there are scenes with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and ancient ruins the film is worth seeing for the soundtrack by <UNK> alone
<START> while it comes no closer to the tarzan of edgar rice <UNK> than say the johnny flicks did it does have it's own peculiar and entertaining <UNK> on the story its a well done tarzan movie nice scenery good photography <UNK> continuity and a tarzan yell that <UNK> the one described by <UNK> the players all perform well the only bad points i found were i think related it moves slow in places that slow movement makes this picture to long it could easily have been 15 to 20 minutes shorter which i think would have helped with the natural flow of the plot line and the character development but the rest of the film works well enough to carry it over these two rough spots and still leave the viewer satisfied with the flick short version of all the above its a very good tarzan movie
<START> although <UNK> bogart got star billing in king of the underworld i'm willing to bet he didn't thank jack warner for it in fact this film was one hollow crown br br king of the underworld was supposedly a remake of the paul muni film dr <UNK> but given <UNK> bogart was in the cast the character is written more like duke in the <UNK> forest he even has an english writer along in the person of james <UNK> br br kay francis and john are a pair of married doctors and pulls off a <UNK> bit of surgery on one of <UNK> henchmen <UNK> a man who <UNK> good work done on his behalf and gives 500 00 and there's more where that came from if he plays his cards right who has a gambling problem sees a good way to get some <UNK> <UNK> br br but when he's killed in a raid on the <UNK> <UNK> francis is also thought to be involved by the law and the american medical association no matter how much she <UNK> her innocence it's no good and she and her aunt jessie move to a small town to get away from the <UNK> br br of course the <UNK> and bogart and an <UNK> leslie howard like writer in <UNK> all meet up with her again but kay is <UNK> and <UNK> to say the least br br <UNK> character was ridiculous no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better parts he's a gangster who both shoots down people without mercy and gives his henchmen just for laughs he's concerned about his image and therefore kidnaps writer <UNK> to ghost write his autobiography and of course <UNK> enough to burn him in all 48 states and then let's kay francis completely <UNK> him hard to believe he was king of anything br br definitely one of the lesser works for either of the stars
<START> i loved this movie i'm shocked and disappointed that it never made it to the theaters every story was better than the last much better than the much hyped scream series and i know what you did last summer and way better than the terrible urban legend i'd recommend this film to every horror fan
<START> this could have been good but sadly its too anthony <UNK> jr has a grudge please i wanted to like it love shark movies someone should have asked my opinion before they wrote this ha ha the shark is cool but the story lacks alot
<START> i've always liked barbara stanwyck who was perhaps the hardest working lead actress of the 30's and 40's although few of her movie roles are memorable today she is remembered most for the tv show the big valley stanwyck worked so much because she was <UNK> it seems that she would accept most any role and make the most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many an ordinary picture gained credibility by her presence br br and so it was for christmas in <UNK> a very ordinary effort whose plot <UNK> <UNK> and isn't even really about christmas it does however have stanwyck and dennis morgan as well as some supreme character actors including sydney <UNK> and s k so there are plot twists and funny moments which undoubtedly seemed more real in 1945 than they do today to begin the plot concerns a magazine writer stanwyck who the <UNK> readers believe is a domestic <UNK> married with a child and living on a farm in <UNK> but who is really single lives in new york city and knows nothing about cooking or could anyone get away with such a fraud even then apparently and even the owner of the magazine <UNK> is <UNK> although one would think that he would have long since seen though the deception but the story moves on and stanwyck <UNK> a sailor recently survived from his <UNK> ship morgan and <UNK> <UNK> friend s z find themselves spending christmas in <UNK> at a farm <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> boyfriend <UNK> <UNK> you can imagine all the possibilities there are for this as the fraud <UNK> as it must <UNK> wants stanwyck to marry him to <UNK> the <UNK> but one wonders how she can stand him at all morgan and stanwyck fall for each other but he is supposed to be engaged and she is supposed to be married regardless they begin what seems to be a make believe affair dancing cheek to cheek and stealing off in a horse drawn <UNK> meanwhile the incredibly naive <UNK> character who has seen stanwyck and morgan go off together but still doesn't get it sees one of the neighbors take back a child that has been borrowed as part of the deception and calls the cops to report a kidnapping stanwyck and morgan are arrested for stealing the <UNK> and the <UNK> begins to <UNK> br br at this point the movie is funny as in ridiculous or absurd not funny ha ha and it <UNK> ends like screwball comedies always did the good guy gets the girl and presumably they live happily ever after br br i watch this movie every year at christmas to enjoy these character actors at their best in a story that reflects way it was in 1945 and because of a long held fascination with barbara stanwyck thank goodness it was set at christmas or like 95 percent of <UNK> movies it would have been long ago forgotten and we would not get to see it each year <UNK>
<START> this has got to be the worse move i've ever seen it was not only boring it was gag me with a <UNK> dumb <UNK> ya find the actors on a street corner who did the special effects for god's <UNK> i could have made a better movie with my cell phone and if that wasn't bad enough you even had extras at the end of the movie so we could see just how stupid the actors are in real life who ever did the makeup for the aliens must have spent 5 at your local used costume store and called it a day and who in the world wrote up the movie description on the back of the dvd case should be shot it's not even 1 8 of what it is described as that description is just to suck people in to buying renting or paying a ticket to see it no wonder there was never a trailer to it ya would have drove them all away br br bad actors 5 br br special effects 5 50 br br fake fire 1 <UNK> cigarette lighter br br time spent watching this movie total waste i should sue ya for my time watching it
<START> i was fortunate enough to record this wonderful drama both parts when it originally aired on masterpiece theatre i loved it but lost it then one day while going through old tapes found it again i recorded it to dvd and watched and wow i still love it the leads are excellent and my only complaint is i wish we had seen more what a man and she's so strong and wonderful living in a time and age where her <UNK> and how she deals with it is seen as unfortunate and evil even her own brother tells to her face that he doubts that a man will ever have her sigh unfortunately my copy is not the greatest with wear and tear over the years and i too would absolutely love to own this on professional dvd if it ever happens
<START> i thought maybe maybe this could be good an early appearance by the re animator <UNK> combs many to old horror movies the troma label on the this movie could be a gem i thought wrong br br is a boring <UNK> half <UNK> homage to the fright films of <UNK> the story is an old one young people breaking into a house getting drunk making love and <UNK> with things that shouldn't be <UNK> with the <UNK>  recycled slasher film formula is used here this time with a thought to be dead actor named conrad doing the killing in fact the performance by the actor <UNK> <UNK> is the only redeeming quality of this film he does the <UNK> dracula style character very well but as for the kids its not so good with combs only having a minimal part br br the film lacks entertainment value and only features one cool character and one or two scenes that can hold your attention i do not recommend this film unless you are desperate for something to watch and this is the only movie left at blockbuster
<START> dean book <UNK> is one of the finest books i have read sadly the movie is a sad caricature of the book the <UNK> middle aged hero and the lonely <UNK> with whom he finds a meaning to his life are converted in the movie into a couple of silly teenagers the stoic security agent and the <UNK> sheriff are combined into a <UNK> villain you get the picture the <UNK> have taken a moving tale of love horror and adventure and converted it into a z grade horror flick aimed very poorly at the teen market br br buy the book and enjoy many hours of reading it will be far far more rewarding than watching the movie br br
<START> i was delighted when i saw that my husband rented <UNK> of passion i love <UNK> films we both loved the movie we both couldn't stop laughing we especially enjoyed the scene in which the <UNK> is shooting a photo novel and while supposedly being <UNK> by a killer with an electric <UNK> is told to answer the phone and say i can't talk to you right now i'm being attacked by a sadistic serial killer if i survive i will call you back that would make a great answering machine message come to think of it we also loved the lady telling her new found beloved i went to an orgy after the concert but i couldn't stop thinking of you i'm waiting to use that line on <UNK> <UNK> of passion is a <UNK> farce with plenty of high <UNK> hilarious dialog and eye candy for everyone the film has aged well the 1980s costumes and <UNK> add to the <UNK> i would give it a 10 out of 10 rating but i am giving it a 8 for two reasons the first is the scene which involves <UNK> which includes a shot of a lady <UNK> herself totally unnecessary and it brings down the tone of the film to hollywood gross out comedy for a moment the second is the suggestion that is sleeping with her father shocking yes but again it ruins the tone of the film still i would recommend the film to anyone who wants a sophisticated <UNK> and fun time
<START> ingrid bergman playing dentist walter <UNK> faithful <UNK> who <UNK> a little crush on her boss is absolutely wonderful in this film she handles the witty <UNK> in the script with <UNK> and steals a terrific scene where she and goldie hawn talk in a record booth <UNK> monologue is a front but her face tells you she believes in it with all her heart matthau is an odd choice for the leading man he's too old for goldie hawn and too <UNK> for bergman not to mention too <UNK> to be a dentist but i liked the way he tries hard to please goldie and stumbles around trying to free himself from a lie hawn who won a supporting oscar is just as fresh and <UNK> as she is today this bedroom farce isn't terribly sophisticated and <UNK> reminds one of any <UNK> besides but it's a welcome relief from the <UNK> teen oriented comedies they turn out today <UNK> flower is a lovely sigh from
<START> is one of the most fun and enjoyable low budget films i've seen in quite some time director jeff smith who also served as co writer cinematographer and editor definitely shows his love of under appreciated 80's horror films with this movie anyone who loves the cheesiness preposterous situations wacky and stereotypical characters of 80's horror movies will definitely love this very tongue in cheek homage to the past br br definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some it has all the excessive violence and gratuitous nudity that is reminiscent of those entertaining 80's horror movies we all love i had a blast watching from the 80's outfits that the stereotypical characters wear to the blood splatter to the goofy tone i just couldn't get enough
<START> this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the cast was fantastic but the movie itself was horrible it was so awful i had to register just to say how bad it was br br i watched this movie and i wanted to break it every minute i watched it could have been great had a great premise if you're going to rob an <UNK> car and there's a homeless person which sees you you have to do what you have to do for the main character to decide to get a cop killed and kill his friends and co workers after the homeless guy was already dead it's just ridiculous and yes i'm sure there will be <UNK> to this about how his conscious got to him but come on br br the main character <UNK> out the bottom of the <UNK> truck no one saw him he blew up the <UNK> of money and grabbed and dragged the cop right behind the other guards and no one saw him he was able to get back in the <UNK> car and no one saw him this movie had potential but blew it br br you couldn't pay me to watch this movie ever again don't ever watch it <UNK>
<START> i caught this movie on the sci fi channel recently it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as b list horror suspense films go two guys one naive and one loud mouthed a take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a freaky make shift tank truck hybrid decides to play cat and mouse with them things are further complicated when they pick up a ridiculously <UNK> what makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie unlike so many others the two guys are likable enough and there are some good chase suspense scenes nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror slasher buff definitely worth checking out
<START> <UNK> incident is a curiosity for several reasons it will be obvious from the start that it was made long before anyone ever thought of political correctness although the ward bond character <UNK> the edge with maybe we can communicate with them after all they're humans too type of dialogue his part stands side by side with the preacher to communicate with the martians in war of the worlds in fact it's uncanny the title is curious too use of the word incident contributes an importance and sophistication to the film that probably didn't hurt the contrived assortment of characters and linda fancy dress and hat are wonderful dated touches that make <UNK> incident a cool western <UNK> from the mid fifties

<START> i'm sorry but i can't agree that this was a good movie yes it looked good visually but it's the story that drives the movie and i must say the story sucked big time how in the world did they manage to slip some of those plot holes past the critics better story and i would've gave it a higher vote but i was impossible to do that and still be able to live with myself i have always been a fan of scary movies and the previews really had me fooled all the scary scenes were shown in the previews and why did the family that got killed stay to haunt the house why did the father come back again why did he decide to kill in the first place why were the kids the only ones to see the ghosts first to many questions not enough answers if i could've gave it a zero i would've
<START> walt disney's 20th animated feature was the last one to be <UNK> by the great man himself he died in late 1966 and is not generally considered to be among their very best <UNK> the main problem is that on the surface the film seems merely to be the <UNK> version of either lady and the tramp 1955 or 101 <UNK> <UNK> both of which are certainly more beloved by fans even so being both an animation and cat lover i <UNK> this reasonably <UNK> <UNK> in which a <UNK> female cat voiced by eva <UNK> and her three little <UNK> are thrown out onto the streets of paris by a wealthy lady <UNK> <UNK> 's greedy butler luckily they meet a <UNK> alley cat phil harris who <UNK> them on the journey back and are further aided along the way by a <UNK> jazz band led by <UNK> <UNK> and two helpful and <UNK> dopey dogs meanwhile at home edgar the butler <UNK> his supposed inheritance and the mouse and the horse do their bit to help their fellow <UNK> pets legendary entertainer maurice <UNK> was <UNK> back from retirement to sing the title song which includes a <UNK> in french and band <UNK> in a <UNK> number wants to be a cat
<START> rarely have i seen a work of literature translated so badly to the screen the hysterical cast of b movie and sitcom extras simply make the characters seem like bad jewish stereotypes the worst of all is melissa gilbert who you hate from scene one and never develop any sympathy for performances like this should be noted and used against actors who wish to work again all in all a seedy low budget made for tv film of the sort that gives made for tv films a bad name

<START> br br very dull <UNK> adaptation of <UNK> amusing satire the hero is portrayed not as a likeable loser but a merely <UNK> <UNK> most of the rest are pure caricatures with only helen putting in real quality and providing something of the <UNK> wit the period setting is <UNK> up as if it were the 1920s not the post war period of horror comics and roll a real dud even by the standards of bad uk tv br br
<START> just watched for the first time although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a <UNK> south and a <UNK> creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances as an <UNK> seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer not just the lessons found in <UNK> is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded the thread concerning the vietnam war rings true even today well worth a look
<START> why do the powers that be continue to cast jennifer lopez in unbelievable roles she was excellent in <UNK> and pretty good in money train which both cast her in roles where she could basically be herself however roles like this just draw the line i could never see lopez as an fbi agent see out of sight for that <UNK> performance but as a <UNK> give me a break br br basically lopez plays the aforementioned <UNK> who is involved in virtual reality experiments in which she enters the minds of her patients in order to help them sort out their issues when she enters the mind of a <UNK> serial killer to help save one of his victims she breaks all the rules to try and crack the insanity of his inner mind br br <UNK> acting here is typically below average i can't get over that high pitched <UNK> of a voice she has she's no julia roberts but yet she comes across on screen as though she believes herself to be on the same playing field well she's not even in the same stadium sure she is a very sexy lady however that isn't going to carry a film and it certainly doesn't carry this one with anybody else cast in her role for this film it would have been excellent especially if it was cast with someone who could lend more credibility to the character br br having said all that this film is visually stunning the colors are fabulous and the story line isn't half bad in a b movie kind of way the audio here is superb as well this movie <UNK> some points for the fairly original storyline and major points for how it looks and sounds unfortunately the acting and poor casting bring it down a few <UNK> br br my rating 6 10
<START> we have moved far beyond this <UNK> <UNK> into a forbidden area drug addiction for the 1950s as such the film may seem dated the man with the golden arm served its function is <UNK> back a <UNK> of the <UNK> of society an eye opener to a southern country boy in 1955 when i first viewed this film in the theater after some serious consideration about being too young i was allowed to go it was powerful and affecting then and still maintains some sharp painful moments of the soul stripped naked as a movie depicting the loneliness at the core of being it succeeds br br filled with angst frank sinatra in his best role creates a vulnerability that makes him sympathetic to the viewer he conveys his <UNK> and in a beautifully restrained performance as a voice of common sense in the dead end urban jungle kim novak as molly is quite good she is compassionate and yet stands on solid ground the interaction between sinatra and novak is really good darren <UNK> plays a slimy character and does it very well <UNK> parker is superbly irritating and painfully insecure in her role of the pathetic the crippled wife of sinatra arnold is another unlikely survivor of the street regarded as pitiful and despicable his character <UNK> provides <UNK> comedic moments br br the music is almost the star of this film brooding frenetic moody poignant elmer <UNK> score perfectly <UNK> the tensions of frankie spiritual weakness and physical need for heroin <UNK> theme is bittersweet and captures <UNK> what the film depicts visually i know of no other soundtrack that effectively <UNK> the tension and defeat within a man as effectively as does this one
<START> i have been looking forward to the release of this dvd and it's follow up female prisoner <UNK> grudge song for some time i very much enjoyed the first two movies of this series after just watching this film i would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three br br all three of these movies were directed by <UNK> what is great about them though is that even though they all feature the same lead character wonderfully played by they are each vastly different from the others br br the first movie female prisoner <UNK> <UNK> is more or less a typical women in prison movie but the character of <UNK> is very intriguing very reminiscent of the anti heroes of many spaghetti westerns and the director often used some very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material br br the second movie female convict <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a real tour de force not so much a <UNK> movie as the bulk of the film has <UNK> and six other escaped inmates on the <UNK> br br this movie female prisoner <UNK> beast stable is the third in the series and the last one directed by <UNK> this one plays out as much more of a crime drama once again our heroine is on the run but this time out she has managed to maintain a certain amount of <UNK> in her life relatively speaking anyway she gets a job she finds a place to live she makes a friend on the outside but of course everything has to unravel eventually <UNK> beast stable has a more straight forward story that is told at a more <UNK> pace than its predecessors but i found it to be engaging from beginning to end and don't worry there is still plenty of <UNK> to go around in this movie but i think these movies <UNK> most exploitation films because the more disturbing elements are played in a <UNK> tone rather than being used exclusively for in your face shock value yes there were definitely moments in this movie where i <UNK> <UNK> but i didn't feel that they <UNK> from the value of the story well maybe a time or two one thing i have greatly enjoyed about these films is the continued build up of <UNK> <UNK> with this entry character development is used much more <UNK> than in the previous two we get to see that she is much more than just a stone hearted vengeful <UNK> br br as i mentioned earlier in this review a fourth movie followed it also features as <UNK> but had a different director without giving anything away i want to mention that <UNK> beast stable ends in such a way as to make a sequel completely unnecessary the fourth film is still quite good but it seems to play as a superfluous <UNK> to a mind blowing trilogy br br i would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in out of the ordinary films <UNK> beast stable can be enjoyed as a stand alone piece as can the first two movies but i would also recommend watching the others first if you have not already done so
<START> a few years ago i saw the <UNK> of green by the same director my feelings about both films are in fact the same beautifully shot but terribly slow and boring i saw this film in a sneak preview and left after half an hour couldn't stand it anymore how can one make an interesting film about people who are constantly telling each other how happy they are and how perfect their lives are i had a fantasy about a forgotten american g i still wandering around in the <UNK> jungle who was not aware the war had ended how he would suddenly pop up in the film and would start <UNK> his at the characters in the movie the red of their blood would make a beautiful contrast with all the green plants in the film so i was not very much <UNK> by this film time to leave
<START> apparently a massive head wound is the cure for homicidal <UNK> turning a murderous <UNK> into a lovable and <UNK> dog <UNK> also this ones for the ladies it seems that the front gate of a psychiatric hospital is an overlooked hot spot for meeting potential mates those are just two of the approximately 23 <UNK> we're supposed to accept for this movie to have any meaning i love movies and i believed as i'm assuming many americans do forgive me if i'm wrong that hollywood turned out the best product i've come to learn how sadly naive and <UNK> i was and 2 how much more sophisticated european asian cinema is in comparison to its american counterpart br br i watched this allegedly disturbing psychological thriller the night following a viewing of a japanese movie called suicide club as the camera faded on walter happy little family enjoying some quality time around a prison visiting room table not to mention the <UNK> voice over <UNK> the virtue of doing the right thing i suddenly had an <UNK> i had just finished watching a movie that left me feeling as though i'd just had a glass of water when i really wanted a beer my <UNK> was <UNK> but it was strictly <UNK> the premise was mildly interesting but the story itself with its <UNK> <UNK> how do we explain her finding the book we'll just say something like or did the book find her they'll buy that <UNK> plot holes why did take the <UNK> predictability and obligatory happy ending turned out to be just another hollywood hack job additionally the casting of jim carrey was at any moment i felt he was capable of breaking into some <UNK> from one of his stupid comedies or in living color jim carrey as a <UNK> hard boiled police detective who enjoys bondage and rough sex didn't buy it for a second br br you want disturbing deeply disturbing watch suicide club the story <UNK> the mysterious mass suicide of <UNK> school girls the film opens with a group of <UNK> high <UNK> <UNK> about on a subway train platform we then watch in horror as they line up hold hands and happily throw themselves in front of a fast moving <UNK> train needless to say much chaos ensues that's as far as i'm going to go with the story line because i encourage the reader to see the film in fact i'm not sure if i could outline the plot even if i wanted to what begins as a straightforward mystery quickly <UNK> into a <UNK> of grotesque imagery did i understand the movie many of the foreign films my girlfriend has introduced me to so naturally i thought it was bad but this one <UNK> in my mind i went to bed thinking on the film and <UNK> the next morning and looked it up on imdb i read some of the viewer comments and was <UNK> at 1 the insights others had derived from the film and 2 the fact that i had so thoroughly missed the whole point of the movie i realized that i was so used to being <UNK> fed the message from hollywood that when confronted with a film that actually required the viewer to actually think for themselves i was totally it's as if i had been <UNK> to check my brain at the door of the theater br br am i saying that suicide club is the greatest movie ever made of course not it has its flaws many of which were reported <UNK> by the imdb reviewers am i saying that all american movies are bad and all foreign movies are good course not my point is that there's a whole world of film making outside of body of work that <UNK> the viewer forces them to think and that don't <UNK> plot twists follow a strict linear sequence and above all don't insult the intelligence of the person watching i look forward to <UNK> my mind while exploring this new world of film that doesn't do the thinking for me
<START> if you are looking for a modern film version of buster <UNK> or johnny <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> white <UNK> <UNK> or cunning black <UNK> while saving the animal kingdom this is not the movie for you this is a <UNK> of the tarzan legend from its beginning in intelligent adult terms it is beautifully filmed and faithful to the edgar rice <UNK> stories br br tarzan is no action hero but a man torn between two worlds the natural and the <UNK> in a stunning performance christopher <UNK> portrays this angst with absolute realism if he slips up just once the cat will be out of the bag the audience especially the adult audience targeted by the film will laugh and the film will completely lose its grip it will <UNK> into the cheesy depths but <UNK> never lets that happen forget what you may think of him in other movies when i saw this film at the theater on its original release i thought he deserved an academy award br br the supporting cast is uniformly excellent as other <UNK> have noted i disagree with most of them in that i didn't find anything wrong with <UNK> <UNK> performance i wouldn't have nominated her for an academy award the role is <UNK> but she is completely up to it such as it is i don't know why her voice was <UNK> either br br the cinematography of the african segment of the tale is absolutely beautiful it captures both the beauty of the african wilderness and the exotic expectation it holds in the collective imagination of those who have never been there the scenery is lush and exotic and the colors are vivid br br but this is also a period film and the cinematography also <UNK> depicts victorian england the countryside the city and the interiors the costumes are outstanding the soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or <UNK> br br there are some disturbing scenes especially for animal lovers but no more disturbing than a few scenes in dances with wolves this is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature <UNK> in the young lord <UNK> convincingly portrayed by christopher <UNK>
<START> better than the original the <UNK> <UNK> rising manages to pull off a funny comedy with good acting fine special effects and comedy that <UNK> the <UNK> knowledge base and do so on a low budget i've seen many low budget films that have been terrible and almost none that have been as good as their high budget counterparts this film blows most mainstream movies away parts are a bit weak the bit with the pirates and ninjas while funny goes on a bit long without explanation and takes you out of the movie for a bit but overall this is a very strong film br br i'm very happy to say that i bought this film as soon as i saw it and brought it home br br any chance we can look forward to another feature <UNK> movie from these guys
<START> i have to admit that i absolutely loved this movie of course as i'm sure you know that in the middle star frankie and the ever so sweet amanda <UNK> the amanda show starred in this children's comedy as two friends that i'm sure that we can all re late to the movie is about a boy jason shepard frankie and his friend amanda going onto an adventure in hollywood br br spoilers ahead br br as it begins jason is a typical 14 year old boy whom lies to get around every day life's problems one day jason is hit by mr wolf the big bad director <UNK> english paper is stolen by wolf and begins the adventure along with to earn his father's trust back they fly to hollywood in search of wolf to get him back frankie and amanda do all sorts of crazy stunts to get wolf back and all he has to do is call <UNK> dad and tell him he stole his idea but the end is no real surprise being the good and wins br br the story is cute and fifth grade <UNK> but what do you expect it's rated pg i really <UNK> this is one of the years best family comedies not only is the <UNK> acting great exceptional casting well written but it's good clean fun it made me laugh as well as fall in love with it's innocent message i highly <UNK> it and would like to disagree with that someone who gave it a zero out of ten the unemployed critic isn't unemployed for nothing i give it well i voted a ten out of ten a perfect
<START> when you first sit down to watch this movie keep in mind that you are about to see something you've probably never seen before keep in mind that this is a movie where they obviously spent insane amounts of cash on explosions and not enough on acting or anything else for that matter the crazy thing i noticed is that every character is completely over portrayed and it seems most of the time anyhow that the film had been <UNK> to make the characters move faster i wonder if the hong kong version was dubbed too i understand the cartoon had this but it doesn't work for live action it just looks odd as if the camera crew decided to act because they couldn't afford real actors br br the english version is horribly dubbed and the character's words do not match the mouths at all i would have subtitles but since this is a kids movie and since some kids cannot read well i'll let it go but there is something extremely odd about this movie it's supposedly a kids movie but there's a lot of material about sex rape and <UNK> which isn't exactly for young western audiences in the <UNK> they have different laws and sexuality in children's movies is much more accepted but parents be warned there is a scene where two characters talk about rape multiple scenes where people say <UNK> and a scene where this insanely young japanese girl does a sexy dance for one of the <UNK> <UNK> and shows him her breasts who was this movie made for anyway br br oh and the special effects are laughable you can tell the spaceship like things that bomb the village are cardboard <UNK> or animation i wasn't sure that look unconvincing even to a kid the makers of this movie left out a lot of cool things from the cartoon simply because they couldn't budget the kind of money they'd need i didn't like how the names of all the characters were changed it made me wonder if this movie was made by the same people as dragon ball z br br i don't really this movie to anyone kids adults or dragon ball z fans it's just a poor representation of the cartoon and obviously one will be able to tell that this movie was rushed and no care whatsoever was put into it i won't even get into the <UNK> just wait until the end credits at the still picture that sits there for 2 minutes most of the shots are not framed correctly at all and the movie just seems made by amateurs grainy film quality too br br just all around horrible br br
<START> it's been said that some directors make small budget pictures look like blockbusters albert <UNK> makes small budget pictures look like high school a v project films this film was pretty much lacking in all <UNK> practically every scene drags on <UNK> the experimental lighting and camera work is terrible rob lowe apparently <UNK> being <UNK> with acting and the poor drab euro pop numbers stop the movie to a dead halt on the plus side burt reynolds does a pretty good job with what he's given which isn't much mario van <UNK> is surprisingly decent and ice t puts in another of a long recent string of b movie gangsters not <UNK> worst work urban menace but certainly not his best mean guns
<START> man kills bear man becomes bear man bear meets bear man bear stays man bear after meeting bear the end seriously that is the entire plot to this movie yes i <UNK> it to an extreme but you get the picture i just wish i maybe had not have seen it br br the <UNK> <UNK> to is a native american indian that kills a mother of a <UNK> and while that can be touching it certainly lacks to really draw in on the potential conflict between the two parties plus there was a certain <UNK> of the two <UNK> in the film but that is beyond the point br br overall very much under par certainly needed a lot more to be entertaining maybe more laughs from the secondary characters and more drama between the two main bears thats what <UNK> bad films from the good ones d
<START> one of the worst movies i saw in the 90s i'd often use it as a <UNK> when viewing other films at least it wasn't as bad as <UNK> <UNK> three absolutely pointless segments all featuring the director playing himself and he's not that interesting a whole segment about this <UNK> going to the doctor another that features him riding around the countryside on his <UNK> for three interesting minutes and another fifteen <UNK> ones br br the only redeeming factor was that the <UNK> scene was set to keith <UNK> <UNK> me to go home and <UNK> that marvelous album the best thing you can say about the director actor <UNK> is that he's got great taste in music
<START> there is a lot wrong with this film i will not lie i will say that most of the problems feel like they <UNK> from a budget that was chopped out from underneath the flick and some bad hack job editing br br this is not office space do not go in expecting office space levels of comedy it is very funny though it is a mess but very funny at the same time a funny mess of a film in the way that <UNK> is funny a mess of unrelated funny scenes filled with some very annoying unfunny scenes br br it works as a whole though and it certainly deserves a wide release this is the best commentary on the wal mart <UNK> mtv nation you could hope for the very fact that a film is exploring the idea that dumb people are <UNK> at an <UNK> rate while the intelligent people are not is great in my book not very politically correct but worth at least some debate
<START> the film chaos takes its name from 1988 pop science explanation of chaos theory what does the book or anything related to the content of the book have to do with the plot of the movie chaos nothing the film makers seem to have <UNK> the book obviously without understanding a thing about it looking for a theme to united the series of mundane action sequences that the flimsy string of events that acts in place of a plot in the film in this respect the movie resembles the canadian effort cube in which prime numbers function as a device to the audience so that the <UNK> of the plot will not be noticed in cube a bunch of prime numbers are tossed in so that viewers will <UNK> their lack of understanding to lack of knowledge about <UNK> the same approach is taken in chaos <UNK> <UNK> from books are thrown in make the <UNK> of the bad guy in the film seem <UNK> clever this of course is an <UNK> condescending treatment of the audience and any <UNK> viewer of chaos who can stand to sit through the entire film will end up <UNK> how could a film so bad be made <UNK> as a novel the story in chaos would probably not even make it past a literary <UNK> <UNK> desk how could at least hundreds of thousands and probably millions of dollars have been thrown away on what can only be considered a waste of time for everyone except those who took home money from the film regarding what's in the movie every performance is <UNK> in save for technical <UNK> it would be astonishing if more than one take was used for any one scene the story is uniformly senseless the last time i saw a story to <UNK> it was the production of a literal eight year old among other massive shortcomings are the following the bad guy leaves hints for the police to follow he has no reason whatsoever for leaving such hints police officers do not carry or use <UNK> <UNK> of the bad guy have no reason to act in concert with the bad guy let me strongly recommend that no one watch this film if there is any other movie you like or even simply do not hate watch that instead
<START> this is my favourite columbo martin <UNK> excellent plays twins one of whom may have committed a murder this columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it peter falk is on form as usual in this episode written by steven <UNK> who also wrote <UNK> by the <UNK> my second favourite episode the supporting cast are great especially julie <UNK> very under rated and <UNK> nolan as the house keeper that columbo just keeps on <UNK> the <UNK> of martin characters in this is <UNK> that was the <UNK> of leonard <UNK> character in mission impossible coincidence or a steven <UNK> joke

<START> interesting story and sympathetic treatment of racial <UNK> son of the gods is rather too long and contains some hammy acting but on the whole remains a fascinating film br br story about a chinese passing as white starts as leaves college after being insulted by a trio of brainless co <UNK> he <UNK> on a world tour to discover himself and ends up as secretary to a british playwright claude king in <UNK> <UNK> he meets beautiful wagner <UNK> bennett and they fall in love but when she discovers he is chinese she goes <UNK> in a memorable scene br br plagued by guilt and love goes into a mental spiral and makes a few attempts to contact after his father dies he takes over the business <UNK> and <UNK> chinese <UNK> as a symbol of his hatred of the white race that has <UNK> him after a san francisco detective tells him the truth about his birth makes the decision to honor his chinese father and mother br br and i agree that one reviewer here never saw this film declares her love for sam before he tells her of his recent discovery and that makes all the difference in this film br br and bennett each have a few scenes where they chew the scenery but on the whole this is a solid and interesting drama frank <UNK> is good as the nice college pal claude king is solid as the playwright <UNK> flowers has one scene as an <UNK> indian and e <UNK> warren is the chinese father dorothy <UNK> is nasty alice not so good are <UNK> as <UNK> father and mildred van <UNK> as <UNK> also note the gorgeous blonde to the right of at the <UNK> table what a <UNK> whoever she was
<START> this extremely bargain basement <UNK> kung fu hybrid was in my country released by a questionable dvd label that usually speaking just <UNK> with the transfer of pure crap onto disc so that wasn't exactly a <UNK> <UNK> several other titles were released in the same series like the black six the black <UNK> and the black godfather and judging by all their low ratings and negative reviews none of these belong to the elite of the 70's <UNK> hype neither <UNK> jackson is a pretty lousy film completely lacking a significant plot but featuring far too many laughable fighting scenes and horrible acting to compensate apparently roger corman  never too embarrassed to make some easy money  assigned two of his most loyal <UNK> to rapidly <UNK> a simplistic story that would appeal to fans of both oriental kung fu movies and contemporary trendy <UNK> flicks the result h <UNK> and dick miller came up with was <UNK> jackson the tale of an <UNK> <UNK> black babe traveling to hong kong in search of her missing brother she quickly discovers he was killed by a criminal network of drug <UNK> and <UNK> to avenge him mrs jackson smoothly <UNK> into the underground and encounters macho <UNK> helpful undercover agents loads of vicious kung fu fighters only one <UNK> for sure they all want a piece of ravishing body in one way or another i sincerely doubt movie concepts get any more <UNK> than this but  unfortunately all the other aspects suck too the battle scenes are overlong and moreover <UNK> staged <UNK> bell and the other poor <UNK> try really hard to stare <UNK> and assume a tough position but eventually all they ever do is kick in the air and <UNK> leap across rooms the cinematography is horrid the soundtrack is vastly disappointing whatever happened to soul music the few dialogs are poorly written and the acting performances are inferior speaking of which <UNK> bell is undeniably a beautiful woman but still she can't hold a candle to <UNK> <UNK> or pam <UNK> there's only one really good and memorable scene in <UNK> jackson namely the famous hotel room battle where bell entirely naked except for <UNK> repeatedly switches the light on and off whilst kicking the hell out of some <UNK> amusing scene i just haven't figured out yet whether it's thanks to the light switch <UNK> or <UNK> perfectly shaped breasts
<START> the <UNK> of <UNK> second feature is that like the work of a poet he portrays the very soul of humanity and lets it <UNK> on the screen beyond the scope of most other indie films out there chop shop is wise <UNK> the very best of the great cinema of the ages we can look back at the works of <UNK> and <UNK> and compare work to theirs and yet chop shop is fresh and <UNK> to modern society we can see the <UNK> of a master here  a certain sense of beauty style and content all <UNK> together in a film that reminds us what it means to be alive instead of focusing on the side of nyc we so often see we live and breathe with our young hero <UNK> in the <UNK> point  a fascinating quasi sub world of our culture  and yet it's a very very real place trying to stay <UNK> <UNK> has to support himself and his older sister watch this film and feel the sense of raw spiritual understanding that leads us toward  all with profound and <UNK> realism
<START> yes in this movie you are treated to multiple little <UNK> on the attack in apparently a very warm climate so yes this movie is definitely not to be taken seriously it is in fact a much worse movie than the original as at least with that one the whole production looked like it cost more than a couple of bucks and a video camera to make it has its funny moments but really playing off the <UNK> of your movie and making that be your intended laughs is kind of weak film making if you ask me you can not come up with a good story your effects are going to really be bad hey let us just make the movie look as bad as possible with horrible one liners and we have our movie the first one at least had a somewhat credible story as the snowman in that one attacked during the winter and not what amounts to a resort it also had better effects too this one is just a step or two ahead of hobgoblins as far as the monsters are concerned and you really want to be more than a step a two above a bunch of hand puppets still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea <UNK> being taken out by the mighty frost actually i am just kidding but really it was the funniest part of the movie
<START> i like seeing linda blair playing in an actual horror movie again i had been disappointed with her in most everything since the exorcist movies which i loved what was up with all of those nasty b movies she did br br david on the other hand all i could do is laugh he is not cut out to be a horror movie actor david needs to stick to knight rider or <UNK> br br all around this is an awesome movie even for the eighties this was an awesome film it has horror action and drama it is a suspenseful and i loved the way linda blair turned out
<START> a horror picture set ultimately to parody but still in it's play out could scare a few of those that are or easily disgusted when they see whats under their skin i laughed at it though it was easy to <UNK> the true killer and his acting didn't help this only led to <UNK> looking even better <UNK> is not much of a horror picture for those foreign of the genre but those contained should get a few unintentional laughs and an interesting peak at german horror cinema 6 10
<START> was a show that used to be on during the last hour or so before it was time to sleep about ten or so years ago it was a contrast to a lot of the kid type of animation i was watching at the time i was still a minor <UNK> for disney and looney tunes stuff and most saturday morning cartoons were still on the run off of the peak from the days of ninja <UNK> and batman but also around this time i began to recognize that the more raunchy mature surreal obscene and though i didn't know the term at the time satirical cartoon shows were more creative than the stuff i was used to around the time of <UNK> and butt head <UNK> and <UNK> and even the <UNK> were hitting tv sets via mtv usa put out two shows one of them was weird science and the other was i've always remembered a few key bits from the show and some of the lines are very <UNK> to those who haven't forgotten it completely luckily i found a tape recently with about six episodes i taped long ago and the jokes stayed very fresh and the delivery of the jokes are rapid fire a lot of the time in the better episodes br br in the voice department the choices in talent are top notch for the story lines which are usually just an excuse for crude fascinating parodies of pop culture politics movies and tv shows music detective mysteries and the dysfunctional family unit jason alexander is a wonderful choice for and his performance is a comedic <UNK> from his days on seinfeld even if there might be some similar characteristics here and there also the voices of <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> and deadpan <UNK> <UNK> as the hilariously inept <UNK> and nancy travis as the sex <UNK> obnoxious sister in law <UNK> all contribute in a full amount along with some great writing even when a joke isn't sure fire the wit behind it <UNK> the animation style while a far cry from some of the computer enhanced product of today is inventive and often abstract it has that home made gritty quality that <UNK> and butt head or south park would later have and like those shows if you're a little kid i mean little as in younger than i was watching the show you may not understand most of the jokes i e there are enough stripper and <UNK> references to fill two shows sometimes but it's inventive to catch if it's on tv late at night and it functions rather well in that time <UNK> one can only hope for a dvd box set br br so to no one who's barely or even never heard of this program here's a general note think of this show as if <UNK> <UNK> met up with walt disney and decided to go to <UNK> part of vegas with a free mini bar and make a collaboration in the vein of luis <UNK> and the simpsons combined not to mention it's by the group that did <UNK> strong a
<START> so i rented this movie hoping to learn about the <UNK> republic of <UNK> and the <UNK> of its independence from <UNK> rule i was excited to become familiar with the figures involved in its history mainly and i wanted to see how the new government attempted to bring together the various groups <UNK> colonial rule the political motives behind each one the reasons behind decision to give the its independence and also how the united states and the former <UNK> were involved sadly all of my questions went largely unanswered my belief is that this movie was made by people who through a passing <UNK> with the story of the fight for freedom saw a story filled with drama and emotion and decided to exploit it they then <UNK> to try and stuff all the dramatic points into a storyline briefly filled them out with dialogue went to the set and shot it i could be wrong but if so it's all the <UNK> because then the makers must have simply become too tied up in getting everything in and ended up <UNK> over all details in an effort to create an <UNK> history whatever the reason the fact is that the movie could be a <UNK> of sentence long statements and facts <UNK> on the screen the film goes through each major <UNK> and tells the viewer point blank the main idea of what's going on completely over the actual details in favor of getting across the big things for instance there is the scene when is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by in the situation the soldiers have three possible <UNK> one that <UNK> with one that <UNK> and one that stands in the middle <UNK> and yet <UNK> orders there are three soldiers that speak in the scene <UNK> lines that show their points of view then to avoid dealing with the actual tensions that these <UNK> <UNK> bring up the <UNK> simply inserted some random shooting more army guys show up and they just end up beating everyone up this is the extent of the of the movie most of the time each character simply states their basic motives the other characters respond with theirs and that's that there's little telling through actions even the things they say are direct the point of <UNK> it's hard to believe that the people represented actually acted like that also in the trend of this <UNK> things like political tension between <UNK> is reduced to simple <UNK> of the fact we never learn what these <UNK> are what they're fighting for their power basically anything except that they exist the characters likewise are one dimensional and flat unfortunately i don't know whether was actually a freedom fighter <UNK> devoted to ideals of <UNK> but after an hour or so of the movie i certainly didn't trust it to tell me so the like many developing countries has a complicated and important history especially in the period leading up to and after independence but the telling of these <UNK> will not be useful unless there is recognition of the <UNK> of the situations fails to give proper attention to these details and ends up telling the viewer little except the most general of <UNK>
<START> in a not totally successful attempt to be taken seriously and move into <UNK> films mr hughes gives us this film about a young married couple true it's got every cliche in the book in it silly fantasy stuff and all that but more importantly it's got elizabeth <UNK> br br clearly the best actress to have ever appeared in a john hughes film she lends a weight to it that <UNK> the sometimes silly material kevin bacon and his hair is pretty good as her husband but <UNK> steals the movie with her quiet true moments of honesty the <UNK> <UNK> fun that worked so well in other hughes films falls flat here like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9 but keeps telling them when you are 15 and you wish he'd find some new material but i keep going back to performance because it's truly moving mr hughes most interesting films to me have real actors in them some kind of wonderful breakfast club and when his material <UNK> up against a true talent some wonderful things can happen if only he'd trust that it doesn't have to be <UNK> up with the silly fantasy stuff
<START> <UNK> <UNK> can carry off anything but this is still a shallow one dimensional movie it's nice to look at so are the actors and if you're into drag queens i guess you might like it a lot but the plot and characters are as thin as cardboard it's one of those politically correct movies that <UNK> everything else in order to make a <UNK> seem warm and <UNK> it gets a lot of <UNK> out of bitchy dialogue which is amusing in this <UNK> form i guess br br ninety percent of the action is <UNK> around in <UNK> costumes in <UNK> situations the dramatic content is a token <UNK> they hardly try to get you to take it seriously
<START> hollywood has turned the mafia in to a production line of <UNK> ranging from the banal to the excellent and despite some good acting and a reasonable script much of which is for a change true this home entertainment effort has to fall slap bang in the middle br br the script is not only obvious all of the <UNK> boxes end up being <UNK> but spends a lot of time trying to create a <UNK> of the best of other people's work the godfather being the most obvious but there are other references too i won't bother <UNK> them nevertheless it is a good taste <UNK> the producer seems to set a <UNK> for <UNK> and murder one at least every twenty minutes and the ending is weak and so what i am told there are various versions of this production so that maybe that is just the version i have seen br br gangsters don't make money they take money usually by fear some seem more in to the murder and mayhem side of the business than making money they were the ones that were the first to go in real life and here you can't make money with a gun in your hand says charlie <UNK> <UNK> at one stage one of the smarter gangsters although all things are relative he was a skilled white slave <UNK> and a drug dealer before being <UNK> home to italy br br the old school <UNK> were picked off by the new <UNK> who wanted the power and the money for themselves and to break free of the straight jacket of italian <UNK> power rarely doing business outside themselves the young knew they needed to be allied with other groups most notably the jews who knew how to money and this is at least <UNK> and acknowledged what isn't made so clear is that most immigrant groups had their own <UNK> but most of them made their money and went <UNK> and why not who wants to die in jail br br joseph was a ruthless man prepared to kill if needs be but not an unfair or stupid one his story was tragic in that he could have made money in the over ground world and he showed a special skill in avoiding getting killed with a little bit of luck attached naturally br br despite the range of respectable names and three actors in the title role bruce <UNK> martin <UNK> and tony there isn't the charisma or the talent to bring us in and feel anything we are merely passive <UNK> in a life we are glad not to have lead the people shown here were born in to a cruel world but their only mark was to make it <UNK> br br if you can't get enough of the gangster genre that will be better than watching godfather 1 2 for the <UNK> time and it is even better as basic entertainment than the horrible misfire that was godfather 3
<START> at the heart of almost every truly great crime thriller is a carefully considered <UNK> planned out high stakes super crime which 9 times out of 10 is committed by a bunch of likable grey scale morality <UNK> for who life isn't fair for whom getting back at the man is well something worth cheering for first time screenwriter james v <UNK> script for <UNK> gets this half right he made extra double sure that we've got nothing but sympathy for the recently <UNK> iraq war veteran <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> short who's about to have his house taken away by an evil bank brother i've been there and he gave <UNK> a good family friend in mike matt dillon who is super nice and gets him a job at the <UNK> car company that he works at with lawrence <UNK> and some weird french dude jean reno these guys like to have fun and play pranks but they are also serious <UNK> car guys too so that means they carry guns and are tough br br after a short while as one <UNK> watches <UNK> one might start to think as i did that maybe just maybe this is going to be some kind of awesome tongue in cheek <UNK> heist movie with some on the nose characterizations that move the story along its natural course <UNK> up the personal stakes of all involved in hopes of <UNK> a really really clever plan with lots of potential <UNK> sh <UNK> moments i mean the music alone is <UNK> heist movie gritty edgy beats working <UNK> as we're treated to close ups of characters who say things like as a matter of fact i do and are you crazy for 45 minutes or so the movie had some serious genre flick potential br br then things start to really stink these <UNK> these idiots have no plan there's no ok here's what we're gonna do scene no <UNK> no <UNK> no black van or <UNK> masks despite their <UNK> as can be seen in a trailer no these guys are going to steal <UNK> million dollars from their own <UNK> which are only being <UNK> by <UNK> contact over the radio despite being <UNK> with some fancy big deal <UNK> and they aren't even going to sit down and discuss it hell mike only tells <UNK> about the plan the night before which is completely ridiculous but of course got his house to think about so as long as mike promises that <UNK> one will get hurt ' he's on board guess what though somebody gets hurt why because besides driving the <UNK> into an abandoned factory to hide the money they have no plan that was it that was how far they thought things out so naturally things start to unravel these cats deserve everything they get for being so <UNK> br br this script frankly feels like it's like the product of some bad <UNK> game <UNK> car robbed by its own guards go despite some half decent <UNK> that could have maybe taken the film in a few interesting directions the story just completely falls apart and pretty soon nothing makes sense or is even remotely plausible br br when filmmakers don't have a cool hook for their heist their characters seem stupid and <UNK> and when characters are stupid and <UNK> it's hard for an audience to <UNK> in them and their story and when that happens any suspense <UNK> out the bottom of the movie leaving a laughable hollow <UNK> br br skip it 3 10
<START> i like movies about quirky people one flew over the <UNK> nest is maybe my all time favorite so one can imagine i had a blast with this one it's definitely not one to watch if you want to walk off smiling this movie is unpredictable and intense some scenes are downright frightening even after multiple viewings because this kind of stuff really can happen it will most definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole ride and after you see the ending if you're not deeply disturbed you really should check yourself for a pulse br br the acting was phenomenal <UNK> with her rather extreme case of <UNK> shifts from quirky cute to utterly terrifying sometimes appearing so out of control that she looks like the undead seth was great too the focus of the movie definitely does not fall nearly as much on him as it does on <UNK> though he happens to be the one that <UNK> the most momentum as a <UNK> character br br it's a classic love story with some unconventional twists and it's also my favorite love story next to true romance there are two bad reviews for it up here but one of the people who gave such a review didn't have his facts straight and admitted to not seeing the whole film while the other was just looking for some hollywood thrills without the deep characters and perhaps was a little thrown off by the apparent <UNK> of the plot seeing as the end goal revolves around stealing a black <UNK> head from a toy store the point is that this movie is not for those who want to see something normal or lighthearted this one is messed up and indie as can be and won't let you go until the heavy climax
<START> this is definitely a girl movie my husband found it utterly boring but i think this is a really sweet movie it's amazing to think that just a note can bring so many people together this is a great get away for anyone who loves a cute funny romance
<START> as other posters have commented this was a very very bad movie keeping it kid friendly fx was low class they should of spent the 1 on a coke as is typical with these d movies most victims die and leave a mystery except for one lucky soul and of course the lead hope the money was worth it for really really big step down from <UNK> 5 nice to see what happened to buck rogers but damn this was low even for him ' it was so bad and on the older actors you could even seem to tell that they thought it was bad also don't watch br br warning spoiler below br br this thing chased down everyone it was after and yet <UNK> got away that was pure <UNK> and the ending how in the hell did the kids end up right there with him that was just too much stupidity
<START> i am obviously disappointed so i'll be brief and won't waste your time first off the plot was uninspired at least the animation was even worse we're in 2008 for god's sake and it looked like a version of g i joe i won't even bother <UNK> the actors' performance and the dialogs or maybe i will 'cause i just saw that in order to post a comment over here you need 10 lines where were we oh yeah the performance well it was totally flat lacking passion and talent if i am <UNK> now as for the dialogs just like the acting no memorable quotes nothing that someone wouldn't expect let's just hope the movie will be decent at least
<START> with documentary films the question of realism always <UNK> up how much of the film is real and how much is manipulated by the film maker in little <UNK> needs to fly <UNK> is far too absorbed in telling the story of a man telling his own story to even address the question of realism versus <UNK> from the beginning <UNK> role as <UNK> is obvious luckily he is a master <UNK> little <UNK> is the finest most engaging documentary i have ever seen story is enthralling and <UNK> efforts at <UNK> putting <UNK> through the <UNK> of <UNK> his story on location while it is being filmed are very effective the story that <UNK> tells is real but <UNK> is ever present wrenching <UNK> commentary from the realism this film is a must see for any students of documentary film and or of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> one should not be too critical about the director's second feature br br i really like the camera work of as mr shawn pointed out he had a unique way of looking at things br br however <UNK> a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful images remember he has not got any education of any sort i don't think english is the common tongue in cape town <UNK> worse still looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14 br br any way if you overcome above mentioned <UNK> you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work
<START> it's amazing to think that this movie came out only one year before star wars but seems a million years behind it in sophistication and special effects actually the art direction and set design nice victorian space ship aren't bad it's the monster costumes that are the most laughable resembling the guy in a rubber suit monsters from the lost in space tv show the evil cave man makeup reminded me of some of the aliens from ancient twilight zone reruns br br the script is stilted and outside of peter <UNK> comic relief the acting is pretty miserable too this movie is only recommended if you really enjoy bad <UNK> sf and the music <UNK> a horrible 70s experiment with <UNK> that doesn't fit the time period of the film and which sounds like someone rambling with a and a 2 track tape machine
<START> these writers are trying to re create the characters they have on <UNK> in a different <UNK> however the characters they are stuck with have no charisma or acting ability not to mention the writing seems poor and <UNK> these guys are trying to create something that would be good if the writing wasn't so disgusting which is leaving the shows only <UNK> to be two attractive teachers that that are barely keeping it alive the humor in this show seems like it is trying to target an audience with an i q of 40 or below another reason why this show is becoming a failure could be that the writing on the show <UNK> is excellent and this show has to follow it up leaving the viewer in an odd position not knowing whether to cry or to just lose hope in new sitcoms all together this is just my opinion but i think these guys should stop now before they <UNK> themselves anymore than they have already
<START> has been showing for a good few months at movie theatres in <UNK> and today i finally got round to seeing it i didn't really know what to expect at all but was very happily surprised it is a crime comedy of the same <UNK> as snatch etc and it manages to nicely balance elements of suspense with comedy the style of the film is established early on with cheerful music and the <UNK> narrator who makes <UNK> direct to camera odd the first time but subsequently fitting naturally br br with my less than perfect spanish i still found the plot and dialogue easy enough to follow and plenty of the comedy is <UNK> my <UNK> girlfriend was laughing a lot at the various portrayals of people from different <UNK> and social classes which did pass me by somewhat but for instance a well acted portrayal of a pompous idiot in a position of power is funny in any language br br i think it is to this film's credit that it has something of a global <UNK> i wasn't often reminded that this was <UNK> that i was watching yet it is important to note that many wealthy do live like some of the characters in this film and it is not a <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> or <UNK> society in any way just a <UNK> portrayal as is any film supposedly portraying a <UNK> situation culture br br i don't know how much of the comedy would be lost in subtitles but if it comes to your country definitely go check it out it is a very slick and enjoyable movie with great elements of black humour and all in a tightly <UNK> 90 minutes
<START> this movie made me so angry here i am thinking that here's a new horror movie one w a sense of intelligence then the movie starts the scenery the delivery of lines the costumes the fake gore must i go on there are porno movies out with better dialog than this i understand the concept behind indie movies but my goodness this wasn't just indie this was a high school book report shot w a camcorder the cast are all friends relatives this is 1 movie that was doomed from its beginning maybe if it was 1982 instead of the new millennium this movie could fly but it seems to me that someone hung a rock around this neck it was sinking at a constant rate of speed
<START> <UNK> willy was not the first cartoon to feature mickey mouse the first film to star america's friend was plane crazy plane crazy was released may <UNK> <UNK> in hollywood california in the silent movie format <UNK> willy was released november 18th <UNK> as a sound movie it was also released july <UNK> <UNK> as a silent film thus making <UNK> the first sound film of mickey but not the first film for the little american mouse while many game shows have used the question what was the first appearance of mickey mouse the true answer is plane crazy not <UNK> willy these dates can be <UNK> on imdb under release dates
<START> when taken as a whole for its ideas and <UNK> of the current 2 party system and political process i think this is a great film granted the movie was not the comedy i expected but once i got over that this film really made me think so much of what we see and hear in regards to any election is such a joke there is in particular a debate scene in this movie that i felt was a masterful critique of our political <UNK> and how <UNK> are discussed at them i encourage anyone who thinks our process is fine to go see this film if you want something to laugh at however robin williams and christopher walken are not their usual <UNK> in this movie they show us that the truth hurts not that the truth is funny
<START> this begins a series which i'll hopefully keep up every week end of films that came out during my childhood  in this case it's one i've only managed to catch now it was clearly intended as the last word on the subject which basically had been <UNK> to the level of <UNK> over the years however in its <UNK> <UNK> for a serious minded approach a sure measure of which is that the protagonist is never once referred to by the name he's been known all this time the world over the film makers rather lost track of the fact that the thing was intended primarily as entertainment consequently we get a decidedly <UNK> representation of events  with more care given to <UNK> period <UNK> than in providing a <UNK> <UNK> environment for its <UNK> jungle hero even so christopher <UNK> rose to stardom  as did another <UNK> <UNK> mcdowell playing his love interest named jane of course  with the title role which he handles enough under the circumstances however ralph richardson to whom the film is dedicated this being his <UNK> song steals every scene he's in as <UNK> natural grandfather who in spite of showing obvious affection for his long lost <UNK> can't bring himself to forget tradition in an effort to understand his <UNK> the hero in fact is much more comfortable <UNK> with <UNK> even <UNK> after having gone back home to save his <UNK> from <UNK> the film is otherwise very good to look at with cinematography by stanley kubrick regular john <UNK> no less features an appropriately <UNK> score as well as remarkable make up effects by rick baker  and while essentially disappointing as a tarzan outing <UNK> considerable value nonetheless as a <UNK> picture of its day
<START> america's next top model is a great reality show in every sense it has a great <UNK> has great guests a great production and some of the best professionals of the <UNK> world <UNK> for something they hadn't achieved yet present a true america's next top model of course this is not something easy to do therefore usa and the world already would have 10 top models and fighting between themselves in this cruel world br br but it's obvious that its intention is not to present the america's next top model but yes the america's next pop model the show gets together a bunch of models without any experience with different personalities and big personal professional and financial problems giving them a chance for bringing to life a dream or to make their lives something worthy it's obvious that <UNK> banks uses all that for her advantage she gives the dream but in exchange for that she <UNK> audience and more popularity anyway she deserves it because she is intelligent and if i might say that a <UNK> to this kind of show <UNK> also is a great <UNK> and knows how to give based opinions <UNK> herself of other models and <UNK> of foreign versions of the next top model franchise in brazil as an example <UNK> <UNK> is its <UNK> and once upon a time top model she doesn't have even 1 10 of professional skills which keeps <UNK> banks on the top <UNK> have professional and personal knowledge about what she says and she's a great mentor because she not only <UNK> but she points the mistake and teaches the right way with wisdom br br the show doesn't suffer from big problems it does and <UNK> what it promises during the <UNK> the models chosen to work on the show in fact are not the best unknown models of entire country because <UNK> banks <UNK> with the difference and she is right because she and also good part of her audience believes that it's time for the <UNK> world to change some straight <UNK> during the <UNK> she and her team really makes fair where the weakest go away and the promising ones have new chances to prove their <UNK> but must be fast to do that otherwise they lose it br br other very interesting thing is that <UNK> also knows to decide who should or shouldn't win even when she's against people's opinion she knows that whoever wins will be famous but has a very few possibilities to truly be a worldwide recognized top model at the same way she knows that some times the second place is more valuable than the first because 1st place wins the title but second doesn't gets the title <UNK> hardly she makes mistakes when she decides the future of any model during the show br br after 9 <UNK> the show is getting a little tired with some old ideas it's time for <UNK> to change some things and lines because it's getting boring and comparing to the <UNK> <UNK> we can see that she's getting bored too so she needs to do that if she wants the show to live a little longer br br anyway the show explores the fashion and <UNK> world but it's also entertaining for those ones that live outside all of that it gives the opportunity for some girls and also the market and also gives great <UNK> for those ones from the audience who shares the same dream
<START> now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda it came no wonder for me that this is admired by most american viewers and hated by europeans this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round <UNK> work is ground zero etc etc br br you have been warned it doesn't even have guilty pleasure entertainment for those <UNK> iq 0 human beings br br i wish i could enter negative values anyone
<START> in russia the ordinary teenager vera lives a life with her <UNK> father and her <UNK> mother without working and waiting for the calling for a technical course of <UNK> <UNK> her brother victor <UNK> lives in <UNK> with the family of his own and occasionally visits his dysfunctional family and vera being always motive for arguing when vera meets the student of university <UNK> <UNK> they fall in love for each other and decide to get married <UNK> moves to <UNK> house but lives in conflict with her father this relationship leads the family to a tragedy br br i have just seen vera and i liked a lot this deep family drama i am not <UNK> with the life style in the former but there are some unusual <UNK> that i found very interesting the first one when victor tells vera that she was conceived not because her parents wanted to have her but because they wanted to move to a larger apartment another one when the family goes to the beach in a truck many difficulties of <UNK> family and their friends the <UNK> in the park and other situations <UNK> in the movie are common in third world countries this low budget movie is very well directed and the story is very profound and real the cast has great performances and the actress is very beautiful in the cover of the brazilian vhs released by <UNK> there is information that was the <UNK> of playboy magazine i am not sure how precise are the subtitles in portuguese since many long sentences spoken in russian are limited to short translation in few words my vote is seven br br title brazil a vera the little vera
<START> while boris is off to fight in war against the germans for his mother russia his beloved <UNK> marries his conniving cousin mark <UNK> in a moment of weakness shortly after her parents were killed in an air raid over <UNK> through various trials and <UNK> <UNK> will <UNK> word or letter from boris no matter how long it takes holding hope that he will return to her br br powerful piece of film making boasts simply incredible <UNK> work by cinematographer <UNK> some of the many <UNK> framed moving shots include the scene where the camera follows <UNK> through a crowd of loved ones saying goodbye to each other as she rushes through the mob of bodies to say goodbye to boris and doesn't quite reach him even as we watch boris looking <UNK> into the <UNK> without luck the sequence after the air raid where <UNK> walks up the standing stairs <UNK> up the destroyed building she once called home and the scene where mark makes his <UNK> move on <UNK> as another air raid continues just outside the building as wind <UNK> the <UNK> and flashes of light inside are just two of many examples where <UNK> shows his genius at framing images that will last forever on film but without the power and tragedy of the story regarding how war can forever shape the destiny of a couple who <UNK> deeply love each other this film couldn't hold up with the beauty of the visual alone together however we're left with an amazing film simply a haunting masterpiece from the soviet union after <UNK> <UNK> his last breath i feel <UNK> just have such a great film
<START> i was not very excited to see this movie in the first place but a group of us decided to go see it on opening night i felt like getting up and walking out and attempting to get my money back 20 minutes into this film i felt that the movie was very boring uninteresting and not true in many aspects including <UNK> i tried my best not to fall asleep during the movie as i watched one of the worst horror films i have ever seen the scary movie series was scarier than this movie the sad attempt to pull in a gothic girl an <UNK> business man and 15 year old geek and some random guy into a video game that kills you is a bad plot to begin with then they try to throw in a very horrible love scene where the main character kisses another girl after saving her 10 minutes after his girlfriend was murdered the theater was packed when the movie started by then end a little over half of the people had left before it was over if you feel the need to waste only 1 hour and 16 minutes of your time seeing this movie prepare to feel cheated
<START> at first i thought it was bad because i had great expectations for this movie but after giving some thought it is that bad i was almost caught up in promotion of bad stars in bad movies new generation of actors and actresses not to mention bad script writers are bringing the industry down at the moment im still trying to figure out how it gross so high normally you cant lose in a movie with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> forget jackie he's past his peak but then i <UNK> figure it out when twins was on the cover it is cheesy campy very corny i try to laugh from some of the jokes but not only is the effect very minimal but the jokes are very recycled and not funny im sorry i bought the movie the only reason why some people think it is so good is because they are <UNK> into the hype that the twins are cute and everybody likes them and that everything they make is good and funny and that if you like twins then you are up to date br br sigh i miss the good hk movie days when jet li and stephen <UNK> movies dominated the box office br br movies from <UNK> china are much better than this and they are shot for lower budgets
<START> i was expecting to view a more exploitation style of film but unfortunately this turned out to be just a badly made low budget action flick that just doesn't have the talent for that story is about a very beautiful woman named <UNK> marshall heather thomas who's boyfriend rick jeffrey combs works for a secret agency and he has invented a motorcycle that is bullet proof and can shoot <UNK> and rockets and has a helmet that can shoot <UNK> as well the head of the agency martin <UNK> has made a 5 million dollar deal to sell it and sends two hired thugs to kill rick and <UNK> and collect the bike a tall blond thug named <UNK> <UNK> robinson and his partner <UNK> dawn <UNK> manage to kill rick but <UNK> survives while at home she discovers a video tape that rick left describing his invention that helps <UNK> on what to do next br br spoiler alert br br <UNK> is being chased by several agents and she gets caught and tortured but doesn't talk about where a piece of the motorcycle that is needed but she gets help from a federal agent named waters <UNK> <UNK> where they end up using the motorcycle for a bloody shoot out br br this film is directed by fred <UNK> ray who has made his career out of making ultra low budget exploitation films but he made a dire mistake here by leaving out the exploitation aspect and trying to make an action film aside from a quick shower scene at the beginning there is no nudity and the usual <UNK> that viewers are <UNK> to seeing in a ray film is no where to be found i don't think anyone was expecting thomas to get naked but she doesn't wear one sexy outfit not that it stopped me from <UNK> her in those tight <UNK> and <UNK> her near perfect form but ray really blew it in this case like all of his films the cast is fun to watch and many familiar faces have roles like robert <UNK> <UNK> hall <UNK> <UNK> tim <UNK> jr michael reagan and russ <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> robinson died shortly after this was made and it's his last acting effort and the film is dedicated to him you have to wonder why <UNK> would waste him time with such junk like this but i was interested in the casting of combs in a very rare romantic role is thomas any good in this film who cares i think she showed that she could have become a popular b movie <UNK> if she wanted but it never did happen ray wastes everyone's time with this effort although the cast is fun to watch but he left out the elements that make him an enjoyable filmmaker
<START> i was <UNK> between this movie and <UNK> but chose <UNK> due to it's amazingly high imdb rating i must say now what a disappointment i expected a certain amount of gratuitous violence but i also expected a lot of witty dialog i got a huge <UNK> of the former but not nearly enough of the latter i felt <UNK> the ratio between violence to plot is very important and i think this movie gets it totally wrong and the plot it's that believable or really all that entertaining either save your time and money i can't believe what this rating says for the gory and violent tastes of the modern masses
<START> first and foremost i would like to say that before i watched this film i considered myself an accepting individual someone that cared about others appreciated others found no barely any judgment against other people and this film has i think changed my life or viewpoint dramatically when i watched it i didn't know particularly what it was about i knew it was about some type of forbidden relationship but other then that i was clueless and as i began to see what was taking place between these two wonderfully depicted characters i was in shock disbelief confusion and surprise the first time i watched it i was blind blind to their love to their <UNK> to their connection to their as human beings to their relationship i watched it a second time because i finally figured out how <UNK> i was being saying to myself and others oh i accept all types of people and try not to judge them while still judging this wonderful and amazingly insightful story because of my fear i suppose the second time i watched this film i opened those eyes of mine that had stayed closed the first time and really looked not at the type of taboo relationship part that i'd heard about all my life but simply at two human beings in love and i loved it i loved the storyline i loved the slightly broken yet strong individual people in the film i loved the sharing of feelings and i loved the strong bonds created it is a really eye opening beautifully done film that made me cry at times and i hope that people who read this and are going to watch the film eventually remember that everyone deserves love no matter what shape or form it is presented in
<START> looking back at the career of alfred hitchcock it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and <UNK> man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary he was for the film industry it is likely a sign of how ahead of his time hitchcock was always attempting to push the <UNK> and never <UNK> along with a film made simply for the purpose of being entertaining but always with a deeper more poignant motive on his mind strangers on a train one of hitchcock's first and more underrated hits is a perfect example of these traits an entertaining and suspenseful story even when viewed over 50 years later yes but so carefully and intelligently constructed it stands today as a masterpiece in film technique br br arguably one of the <UNK> suspense thrillers strangers on a train may come across as slightly dated in certain aspects but it <UNK> every bit of superbly crafted tension as it did back in 1951 if perhaps slightly less shocking the brilliant use of cinematography and lighting as well as quick careful editing are what really make the film stand out drawing out every possible <UNK> of tension and <UNK> the audience's focus even in slower scenes if there was ever any doubt of what a simply masterful filmmaker hitchcock was simply watching five minutes of strangers on a train should be enough to <UNK> such sentiments every shot is so carefully chosen and constructed all serving to drive the storyline ahead in a particularly innovative fashion sadly enough there are certain moments in the story which are out of place enough to jar our focus away from the superb cinematography and editing bruno being able to reach down to the bottom of a <UNK> <UNK> is simply unbelievable and the figure of a stereotypical old man <UNK> under a wildly out of control <UNK> provides unintentional comedic relief in what is meant to be the film's most tense and engaging scene these are only brief moments but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film br br but what really makes strangers on a train stand out is the story premise as hollywood films of late run the risk of <UNK> <UNK> further and further into the <UNK> of turgid <UNK> after <UNK> it's wonderfully refreshing to see a 50 year old film with a premise which actually comes across as smart and original sure it's fairly straightforward but the concept of <UNK> murders is simply one that would not fly in films of today's day and age which makes it all the more entertaining to watch the film's brilliant screenplay keeps the action flowing at a swift pace while providing us with some wonderfully memorable lines all the while one can't help but notice the deeper themes hitchcock is <UNK> to throughout as well especially the concept of darkness in <UNK> heart demonstrated by elderly ladies being fascinated and <UNK> by the <UNK> of murder as well as <UNK> own <UNK> attitude towards death <UNK> also works in many moments of dark humour bruno popping a child's balloon with his cigarette is priceless and irony shooting suspenseful scenes in happy easy going <UNK> such as the iconic carnival scenes to create an even more eerie atmosphere this may be a suspense thriller yes but to overlook the brain <UNK> beneath it would be simply <UNK> br br the <UNK> figure of bruno <UNK> to perverse perfection by robert walker sadly in his last film role but easily stealing the film from his very talented fellow cast members is without a doubt what makes strangers on a train so memorable as the character is a marvel to behold here we have a simply superbly crafted villainous figure all the more intriguing by how ordinary and <UNK> he seems rather than <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the hero at every possible moment bruno is a calm controlled psychotic mess he speaks of murder in such an <UNK> tone yet <UNK> a passionate <UNK> in his eye when discussing different fashions of killing people bruno could seem to represent the id as <UNK> would put it the inner darker and <UNK> aspects of mankind it makes an interesting contrast to the hero figure guy haines and how bland and uninteresting he seems almost as if to drive home the <UNK> of evil being much more interesting and appealing than constantly <UNK> to do the right thing br br yet despite this implied message <UNK> still twists our emotions enough that we root for guy at every turn and cheer at each new <UNK> he is forced to overcome it's a testament to actor <UNK> <UNK> talent that despite robert <UNK> villain easily stealing the show <UNK> hero still comes across as sympathetic still commanding our support even when falling prey to being a far less compelling character superb support is given by ruth roman who manages to overcome the <UNK> and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure <UNK> rogers giving a stunning performance as guy's <UNK> manipulative and <UNK> first wife and patricia hitchcock proving that she is far more talented than being simply the director's daughter would imply the superb cast headed by a simply wonderful walker really bring the film to life adding so much more merit to the film than simply hitchcock's breathtaking <UNK> br br all in all strangers on a train may still come across as slightly too dated for certain viewers but it's still a shock how modern and appealing to contemporary audiences seems considering it was released half a century ago once again hitchcock proves his <UNK> <UNK> of tension and film technique and the film's surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is alone worth a viewing highly recommended to anyone wishing to <UNK> a brilliantly made but superbly entertaining film experience br br 9 10
<START> as with some of the best films and series i stumbled across this quite by accident it was late a storm was in full force outside and i was sitting <UNK> on the <UNK> when i <UNK> past a channel that was just about to show one of the episodes i intended merely to watch a couple of minutes while waiting for the commercials to be finished on another channel before switching back to some or other sitcom about an hour and a half later i remembered my resolve and was so happy that i hadn't done that needless to say i made sure i saw all the other episodes br br john hannah has been brilliant in almost everything i have seen him in and he does not let down here either all other cast members do a stellar job too my personal favourite aside from john hannah of course is gerard murphy br br the only negative side to this series are the limited amount of episodes only 8 with himself and an additional 1 with someone else i would love to see <UNK> back on the screens though it would have to be with
<START> having seen the uncut version i thought this film was beautifully made it captured my attention from beginning to end the tension was wonderfully conveyed <UNK> man portrays the typical <UNK> family with accuracy in its presentation of secrets and lies even the religious culture the human tendency to keep up appearances and maintain a pure reputation is shown with stark <UNK> in gloria <UNK> character there is not a little scene in this film that does not have a purpose the cinematography is excellent and the writing brilliant br br although the plot is great i personally found that the twist at the end the revelation to do with character was not as much of a shock as it should be but then maybe that's just me because otherwise <UNK> man is a very cleverly made film br br the casting was good to begin with but and acting were the <UNK> on the cake not one to miss if you're looking for a <UNK> film that will surprise and <UNK> expectations thumbs up to the director
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is one of my favorites however mister is not one of his best his <UNK> <UNK> role seems forced and even unpleasant rather than funny the film itself is <UNK> with <UNK> sentimentality in addition the viewer is presented with numerous ham handed references to religious faith and u s <UNK> that come off as over <UNK> rather than genuine <UNK> <UNK> does his best with a poor script edmund <UNK> plays yet another <UNK> <UNK> and is given nothing to do the child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film his sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a like low voice unusual for someone of his age however once you've heard it you've heard it and you don't need to hear it again unfortunately he is in the majority of the film's scenes i find this child so irritating that i fast forward whenever he shows up since he has a lot of scenes in this film this means that i fast forward through a lot of the film there were and are so many talented child actors it's a pity this film doesn't have any of them in it still <UNK> <UNK> in the traditional broad hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing
<START> i really wanted to like this movie but the pacing was just way too slow br br it was a nice story but it was really like watching a slug race br br the movie would have been better served if it had some more action i don't mean anything grand but at least something in the background br br it could have also been helped by songs that set the tone mood of the more lengthy periods that were absent of dialogue br br it's been about 10 years since i've seen it so i may have to give it another chance br br 3 10 or 1 2 out of four
<START> this is by far the best movie i've seen in a long while it is a wholly original and beautiful plot it is not boring nor is it too dramatic the characters are <UNK> and realistic but it does not take away from the story line the fact that is not in english is most likely the final touch the end leaves you <UNK> in a way i've never experienced in a movie before br br i wish i had found this movie earlier br br more lines br br more lines br br more lines a lot more lines c'mon i'm done
<START> one of the best movies i ever saw a classic matrix movie for many years i have been trying to get it on vhs or dvd to no <UNK> the german movie tv industry still prefers to let valuable cultural <UNK> and this is fassbinder after all <UNK> away and collect dust in some archive rather than <UNK> it <UNK> and make a lot of money with it if that is what <UNK> them instead of the promotion of creative thinking though the once told me if i paid <UNK> 200 00 to check the <UNK> non and then <UNK> 8 per minute of <UNK> plus the cost for the <UNK> then they will consider preparing a single copy for me some way to sell something the same problem we have with many other tv movies or series like so die and others excellent tv series never to be heard of again germany wake up br br update from march 2007 last year i finally could get a dvd copy from the of the for about 50 euro great
<START> oh how i laughed during those first couple of scenes this silly little film about an 11 year old who carries a gun steals cars <UNK> stores <UNK> houses <UNK> money from other kids burns houses shoots rats buys drugs <UNK> drugs to his mother and his friends and then kills a guy what a great comedy but it wasn't intended to be a comedy it was intended as a social drama how can this be the events in this film are absurd and ridiculous the characters are all stereotypes right out of a 4 year <UNK> comic strip induced immature imagination the dialog is laughable people talk like morons it's a very dumb film br br the first scenes are indeed very funny for all the wrong reasons but the unintentional hilarity of the idiotic premise runs out after a short while and after that the laughs come only rarely by that time the viewer can't believe what he is seeing and is alternately amazed and bored by what follows if he has at least half a brain cell br br a short film but feels like an eternity the film actually is a seriously intended attempt to show the world of a young <UNK> while imitating movies vastly superior to it like fun there is just such an air of <UNK> about everything the kids the adults everyone lacks credibility both in their actions and dialog the kid in the lead <UNK> his way through the film as though he had seen all the jimmy cagney movies at least a hundred times and typically enough the kid isn't portrayed as a <UNK> of evil but instead as a misunderstood little artistic talent but of course every young <UNK> is misunderstood society made him bad poor child br br the film is embarrassing a collection of stale occasionally hilarious clichés put together to make a movie that lacks intelligence and meaning the intellectual level of the film is zero
<START> a few buddies and myself have the strange <UNK> of seeking out really horrendous and utterly obscure for a good reason horror flicks and then subsequently watching them under the influence of mind <UNK> goods like alcohol and or soft drugs surely a lot of people do this but they watch movies like the godzilla remake whereas we torment our eyes and brains with stuff like the <UNK> <UNK> horror and <UNK> this is a <UNK> bad movie we open <UNK> with bag <UNK> music during the opening credits this is of course to emphasize extra to us dumb viewers that the story is supposed to take place in the scottish highlights and not in director larry <UNK> texas for that exact same reason the cast members are seemingly also <UNK> to <UNK> tremendously and talk with talk with atrocious accents the american marine <UNK> <UNK> george <UNK> arrives in <UNK> <UNK> with some brand new and highly sophisticated <UNK> equipment to track down the <UNK> of the legendary monster in the lake meanwhile there are many other parties hanging around the lake like a group of kids on a science camp what a boring way to spend your vacation retired army <UNK> looking for a <UNK> plane that crashed in the lake during wwii and a bunch of thieves and failed scientists that are the <UNK> egg you would think that these numerous sub plots bring some diversity and excitement in the plot but unfortunately that's not the case <UNK> <UNK> horror is an overall boring flick with only a couple of noteworthy elements the monster itself for example is a delightfully cheesy creation with cute eyes and a <UNK> breath his teeth also glow in the dark which is quite useful when you're dumb enough to go out on a boat ride in the middle of the night near the end of the film the remaining cast members were more interested in the lost <UNK> plane than in the monster so it was about time to wrap it up <UNK> <UNK> horror is carefully recommended in case you're a fan of bad b movies from the 80's but be advised that it contains an <UNK> of senseless dialogs and a <UNK> rushed ending that makes it look as if the film suddenly ran out of budget
<START> this is one of the best romantic movies i have ever seen especially girls who can identify with nicole will love it not only because of the handsome dalton james i also liked the music very much a highlight was land of the sea and sun from man so watch the movie and enjoy it
<START> duck of death needs to watch this film again as his major criticism is completely <UNK> the film never once forgot about the time <UNK> and it was mentioned <UNK> in a couple of places the crew were never shown having conversations with mission control that didn't <UNK> the time <UNK> rules br br one thing i did think was a bit far fetched was the amount of risk involved would a crew land on a planet on which pressure suits would only last two hours i doubt it would a <UNK> space ship go into a <UNK> <UNK> i doubt it would humans land on a moon that was being <UNK> with huge amounts of radiation i doubt it also the ship seemed overly <UNK> would a ship designed like that risk atmospheric flight to slow it down i doubt it would it survive being hit by <UNK> <UNK> i doubt it i think in both cases the <UNK> on the structure would be too much but all in all the unlikely scenarios were <UNK> by some nicely done special effects good editing and production and some good acting especially by the actors portraying the <UNK> commander and the russian
<START> this is the second and best in the hunting trilogy what makes it the best is the clever dialogue br br bugs do you want to shoot me now or wait till you get home br br it was kind of funny how they kept that going through out the short
<START> very odd this seems like a very average movie to me if not slightly less it is brilliantly shot but together with the performance of r lee <UNK> that's about the only redeeming aspect i found in the movie which consists of two separate parts br br the first part covers the basic marine training which watching it in 2007 comes off like something i've see a <UNK> times before in dozens of other movies and series and it's not particularly gripping after 30 minutes i got the idea and wished they could just get on with it the <UNK> sergeant is about the only believable character while everyone else seem to be just cardboard cut outs the general acting is <UNK> <UNK> and the screenplay is devoid of anything interesting and consists of little more than the sergeant shouting the boys make it through their training and end up in vietnam oh and the fat weirdo shoots the sergeant what a surprise probably in the mistaken belief that it was actually the scriptwriter br br so one hour passed and nothing worthy of note happened nothing br br then we have the vietnam part br br it opens with a <UNK> scene where <UNK> of stars and <UNK> are bored and are making small talk to pass the time at first i thought they were re <UNK> some movie scenes from old films it sounded pretty bad but no they were actually <UNK> their script lines then the camp is <UNK> some 20 <UNK> enter the camp through the main gate too bad for them they are being dropped like flies because they simply walk into several <UNK> gun <UNK> with no means of cover is that normal behaviour were the <UNK> all <UNK> if so how come the us didn't win this war during the first two months of engagement the rest of the movie continues with even more completely illogical war scenes br br furthermore the whole plot is altogether pointless none of the characters inspire much sympathy and the story is frankly rather <UNK> it shows little more other than some war <UNK> <UNK> up with a platoon with some guys getting shot because they are <UNK> morons and who also seem to think that somehow a <UNK> hole in a wall will protect you from bullets br br what was the message of this movie that people died in vietnam that people are animals in war situations that if you want to <UNK> of really dumb people you send them to a war zone or that somehow in vietnam <UNK> can actually burn br br i'm sorry but if this movie deserves an 8 3 then apocalypse now deserves a <UNK> 3 br br 5 10
<START> just before dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film the backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like friday the 13th the burning and madman just before dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick the cinematography is gorgeous the acting is top notch the heroine of the film is not your typical <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> is a girl but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival she's a step behind not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend does the primal notion of survival kick in there's a subtle transition that gradually focuses on the final girls hidden sexuality <UNK> that alongside her will to survive br br just before dawn isn't for everyone but for the slasher fan it's as close to perfect as you can get the killer s are very menacing almost like it's a game to and murder anyone who crosses their territory the end scene is a bit off <UNK> for the first time viewer it may be a little shocking i'd recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the backwoods slasher even non slasher fans will find something to like about it the setting is eerie and makes one feel uneasy the death sequences aren't particularly gory but i'm not sure the film needed gore see it
<START> dan <UNK> gives a sincere and colorful performance as the great <UNK> dean his handling of the character is very true to life and captures the flavor of <UNK> background and limited education the film of course centers around <UNK> <UNK> rise to fame and his sudden trip to the <UNK> with an injury he chose to ignore much to his regret his wife is <UNK> portrayed by joanna <UNK> who gives a very down to earth quality to the woman who loved and supported the <UNK> who rose to a <UNK> height so quickly the portrayal of later career as a <UNK> is honest and <UNK> <UNK> his troubles which <UNK> from his poor education and his colorful language both on and off the air <UNK> was quite a character and daily has <UNK> life into his story with admirable skill if you enjoyed this film i recommend the comedy kid from left field 1953 <UNK> daily plays a down and out has been <UNK> <UNK> by his young son billy <UNK> daily again <UNK> out a <UNK> in a completely satisfying manner i <UNK> recommend pride of st louis to baseball fans everywhere
<START> having recently purchased <UNK> marlene <UNK> dvd collection i was somewhat reluctant to watch golden <UNK> the idea of a 40 something marlene <UNK> as a gypsy in a war time romance seemed unusual and implausible i should not have worried with all the professional talent that went into these old movies it's hard to miss really the movie was a joy to watch it's a classic br br the most interesting thing about the film was <UNK> who pulls off the gypsy role perfectly the makeup lighting photography and her performance all add up to make a really startling and memorable character i had never seen <UNK> play a good woman convincingly before but she does here she played a lot of heartless <UNK> in those great <UNK> films so it is refreshing to see her in a more down to earth relaxed role playing an exotic but very human character br br overall a very nice romance the love story is believable optimistic and the happy ending is extremely satisfying
<START> as i mentioned in other comments i became a real big fan of david <UNK> ever since i saw him in american ninja 3 the guy is great doing martial arts has some kind of charisma and is a cool looking dude on screen he went to the <UNK> department ever since his debut and has remained as one of the king of tv movies until 2001 where he apparently stopped making movies now one thing is watching cyborg cop or hard justice which are crappy clichéd movies but real fun to watch <UNK> they're <UNK> bad if that has any sort of meaning but another thing is watching a tasteless piece of boredom like total reality i mean this and crisis are the two biggest pieces of horse dung this guy ever did i wouldn't recommend this not even to the biggest hardcore fans if i had known this and crisis were going to be so f g crap i wouldn't have spent the 3 or 4 <UNK> they cost me total reality is just as boring as crisis although <UNK> it starts promising a group of military prisoners in the future are given a chance to stop some kind of disaster in the past i'm sorry i didn't really pay much attention to this <UNK> and they only have 24 hours to get back or something like that if they don't they're stranded there forever the poor director who <UNK> this tries some humorous clichés like the <UNK> arriving on earth and not knowing what a truck is for example wow hilarious the movie follows up with david <UNK> <UNK> up with some earth girl for the rest of the flick this bored me so much that i had to force myself to watch it in like 3 or 4 <UNK> to at least make use of the 4 or 5 <UNK> it cost me that's <UNK> every time i tried i fell asleep and if you get a movie with david <UNK> with just one crappy 10 second fight scene in it then that's the final touch which would contribute to you throwing it off a hundred foot cliff so as never to see it again i wish i could meet the director of this pile of poo on the street and i swear to god i'd ask him back for <UNK> 5 <UNK> i'd also love to meet david <UNK> to ask him why in god's name did he choose to star in this poor excuse for a movie don't even bother with this film i mean it from the bottom of my heart not renting <UNK> it and specially not buying it
<START> totally forgettable and almost unwatchable if you enjoy bad acting thin plots and predictably weak <UNK> pull up a chair of passing interest to see bridget fonda look a like <UNK> <UNK>
<START> it doesn't surprise me that the makers of this hopeless movie couldn't find a uk <UNK> and then had to release it as a free dvd with a sunday newspaper the <UNK> could clearly see what the film makers and the sunday newspaper couldn't that this was one movie that just wasn't going to <UNK> its costs br br since it's a thriller about <UNK> it would have helped if they'd picked a lead actor who could <UNK> properly rather than the <UNK> <UNK> jones who appears to <UNK> <UNK> as and it would have helped if the dialogue hadn't been <UNK> by <UNK> locations or scenes <UNK> with distracting and inappropriate music the plot is ludicrous the lost charles dickens story supposedly helps our hero solve a series of modern murders but so would a copy of <UNK> adventures of <UNK> since the link between dickens and jones is more non existent than <UNK> and we have the ridiculous premise that a would be <UNK> journalist who lays his hands on a previously <UNK> dickens <UNK> would take several days to read it just so that flashbacks to dickens can continue to be played throughout the movie as if they had some connection to it which they don't i mean if you found a new dickens <UNK> wouldn't you just go somewhere quiet and read it the film ends with one of those surprise revelations that have become mandatory since the sixth sense but in this case it doesn't so much surprise you as insult your intelligence if the film is suddenly going to turn supernatural at the <UNK> hour then revealing that <UNK> jones is a robot might have been more acceptable it might not have seemed so turgid if the film had been stylish but it isn't and in several places it appears decidedly amateur there's a scene where a table is laid with a 60's jump cut technique but they haven't made sure that the person actually laying the table is completely out of frame between the cuts consequently you can see things changing at the edge of frame when you're really supposed to be watching things changing at the centre of frame a good rule in movie making is if you don't understand how to do a technique then try something else br br the real <UNK> is why anyone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie in the first place
<START> the robot vs the aztec mummy was one of the <UNK> and least believable films i've ever seen o k i can buy that the woman in the film is a reincarnation of a virgin that was sacrificed to an aztec god what i can't buy is that the incredibly phony looking mummy and the even worse looking robot when you want to watch a film like this you want to see lots of fighting action but the robot and the mummy fight for about a minute total probably worst of all was the <UNK> de los <UNK> art they had in the credits it's the worst i've ever seen avoid this one if possible
<START> this film is one of the best of 1986 with creepy yet intriguing performances from <UNK> glover and dennis hopper the reagan years were pretty bleak for a lot of people not just teenagers but this flick really captured the desperation and despair well directed with great script apparently based on a true story i don't really see any weaknesses in this the opening shot was brilliant br br keanu reeves was decent for a change and miss <UNK> was right on the money hopper had three other great performances that same year blue <UNK> texas chainsaw ii and <UNK> i imagine this has a cult following and i wonder how this picture would fare if it was re released super stuff
<START> by 1950 john ford had already fully developed the ideas and <UNK> that would form the core of his most successful westerns always present for example is a strong sense of community most <UNK> captured in the family of <UNK> 'the <UNK> of wrath 1940 ' within these <UNK> even amid ford's <UNK> themes of racism and the <UNK> spirit there's always room for the smaller human interactions the minor friendships and romances that make life worth living master 1950 ' came after ford had released the first two films in his <UNK> trilogy  <UNK> 1948 ' and <UNK> wore a yellow <UNK> 1949 '  and it covers similar territory only without the military perspective and more <UNK> the strong lead of john wayne ben johnson and harry cary jr are fine actors but they feel as though they should be playing second <UNK> to somebody and ward <UNK> <UNK> mormon elder while potentially a candidate for such a role isn't given quite enough focus to <UNK> fit the bill br br in master ' ford seems so comfortable with his tried and tested western formula that any character development is largely <UNK> over ben <UNK> romance with <UNK> <UNK> is treated as an <UNK> more than anything else and harry cary <UNK> charming of a mormon girl is so <UNK> as to be almost nonexistent in the final film leaving one to <UNK> the survival of deleted scenes only in charles charismatic and shamelessly villainous uncle <UNK> does ford try some different and it works even with his being surrounded by a <UNK> of <UNK> hammy slack <UNK> <UNK> where ford does succeed is in <UNK> the <UNK> of three distinct races of americans  the values <UNK> the <UNK> horse <UNK> the eccentric travelling  into a cohesive community of <UNK> looking towards a bright future this apparent harmony is thrown into <UNK> by the arrival of uncle gun <UNK> <UNK> who exploit the <UNK> of the western frontier but ultimately lose out to the noble <UNK> who only ever drew on snakes br br ford reportedly considered <UNK> master among the favourite of his films and perhaps this has something to do with the absence of big names like john wayne or henry fonda armed only with his stock selection of usual players ford is able to generate a sense of community by avoiding placing focus on any one character though most of the <UNK> still remain completely anonymous despite being undoubtedly well made i can't help feeling that this film only does well what other ford pictures did even better the terrific <UNK> of the the western frontier was presented more beautifully in <UNK> wore a yellow the romances and friendly <UNK> among community members took greater <UNK> in the early relations with native americans only hinted at here were more thoroughly examined in 'the <UNK> 1956 ' the bold <UNK> spirit of the early <UNK> was explored more <UNK> albeit by henry <UNK> and george marshall in <UNK> the west was won <UNK> ' is pure john ford but it isn't a landmark
<START> my website www <UNK> lists this pick as the worst movie of all time here is an <UNK> br br if i were <UNK> down to a chair and forced to watch this movie over and over again i couldn't imagine hell being any worse jim <UNK> plays a three handed crazy guy bent on destroying the world apparently starting with cinema now let's face it no one expects a whole lot from a <UNK> movie but this <UNK> drivel had me dry <UNK> for <UNK> minutes not a laugh not one this is not <UNK> or this is not even mindless it is evil do not rent this it may destroy your dvd player do not even buy the vhs from a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bin to use as a blank tape it is the worst film of all time period i mean it really
<START> i saw this version about a decade ago and have been looking for it ever since i just recently found an original vhs version and purchased it for <UNK> 00 sounds crazy but if you like me consider it as one of the best the broadway musical stage has ever produced you wouldn't even think twice br br why it's just a little over paying for a broadway ticket today i really hope they re release this in dvd form soon it's a piece of musical theater that screams to be seen by all
<START> i just watched this film and i have to say it surprised me it was very well done with good acting and a deep look at high school students from japan in adolescent love br br the look and feel is a lot different from many movies and you can easily get into the film much of the emphasis seems to be in the story itself which is extremely subtle the main theme and relations with other characters are a bit complex but the the overall sense of realism and <UNK> still pulls you in br br a main draw back is of course those who like something simple which is not here you have to be open to many things including a new culture to get more into the film br br i did enjoy this film though it is worth watching
<START> taking into consideration the chan films that would follow this isn't bad plenty of stereotypes beginning with the black man in the beginning and when the police captain orders that every <UNK> in town by rounded up a parade of stereotypical characters enter the scene including <UNK> of the three stooges charlie seems to move quickly around the city going from <UNK> <UNK> to the w village in a flash the ending is silly an obvious toy airplane is used as it climbs through the sky and then nose <UNK> ed wood couldn't have done it better the final scene is absurd as the murderer will obviously <UNK> himself in his attempt to quiet the one person who knows his identity overall it is worth watching
<START> jack <UNK> finally gives something besides his usual wooden indian performance he played the epitome of the <UNK> <UNK> storm the <UNK> fi <UNK> military idiot the <UNK> before all else even humanity this great film showed the of boot camp to it's <UNK> 4 stars
<START> spoilers br br oh sure it's based on <UNK> dick totally obsessed and it <UNK> him it's a total <UNK> the movie starts off rather well but by the end of the film everyone else is destroyed and the main <UNK> mind is a blank br br the supposed half sister is never convincing some very poor lighting effects music is interesting but little else it took me over a month to finally finish the darn thing i suppose if you like being john <UNK> you might like this but where as <UNK> was a great movie that i just didn't want to watch again x is a movie i just hate to high hell the only possible excitement in the film is the incest sexual scene towards the end of the film hopefully <UNK> not thinking of catherine either br br this movie is severely boring depressing and poorly directed not highly recommended if if you like french movies go watch <UNK> rivers instead br br 4 10 br br quality 5 10 entertainment 1 10 <UNK> 0 10
<START> even after nearly 20 years apart the original members of black <UNK> have not lost a thing in this concert they perform their best songs from their <UNK> 1970 1978 including n i b war pigs and paranoid br br also included is priceless <UNK> footage with interviews and <UNK> into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet the comments of <UNK> tony <UNK> butler and bill ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous <UNK> performances br br a must see for all <UNK> and <UNK> fans
<START> this movie is everything a <UNK> d fans can hope for director liam lynch <UNK> with the d is a <UNK> of epic proportions of course you need to understand the humour and format of <UNK> d when i saw it there wasn't too many laughs from the audience but the reason is not a lack of humour or intelligent jokes this movie seems to have been released on to an unsuspecting public that haven't themselves with the musical duo this movie does stay true to it's roots for the few of you who have seen the hbo tv series and heard the album they have not forgotten what their audience loves like the tv show people have noticed from the trailer the <UNK> and apartment scenes and of course the open <UNK> nights that each <UNK> d episode would start and finish with the soundtrack is phenomenal and each song blows you away br br and dave plays a fantastic devil br br this is the perfect movie for those of you looking for a hard time and a <UNK> musical
<START> young writers young auteur young cast <UNK> of producers what could go wrong everything even lame is too good a description that suggests that three of four legs were <UNK> when actually none of them were barely enough recycled <UNK> for a 48 and a half minute television hour <UNK> stretched to ninety minutes the audience was talking back to the screen so bad was the story dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence locker how many thousands of times has this been done on television bad cops frame good cops again how many times there was not an original shred in this entire <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> made a <UNK> effort to prop up the lack of script drawing the only laughs of the entire movie and the thought of he and claire danes working from a real script with a grown up director and photographed by an actual cinematographer <UNK> me note to screenwriters buy one of those story <UNK> it can't possibly be as bad as ripping off bad television note to auteur there are shots available to you other than closeups even the lovely and interesting face of claire danes eventually grows tiresome in <UNK> note to cinematographer apprentice yourself to a professional for a few years you have much to learn note to color <UNK> at the lab at least try to <UNK> the auteur and the cinematographer that they don't know what they're talking about note to claire i hope this paid for your new <UNK> it's time to get some professional management and start actually reading the scripts before <UNK> on
<START> i first saw the opening of otto <UNK> and <UNK> on tv probably some time in the early 80s and my younger self found it a bit slow despite the timeless music i turned it off br br last night an extremely rare <UNK> together print screened at the l a <UNK> and it was a bit of a revelation the performances are strong and memorable dorothy <UNK> brings a great deal of vulnerability strength and subtle at least by today's standards <UNK> to her part sidney <UNK> is said to be uncomfortable with the movie but his performance is terrific as is pearl <UNK> even better are sammy davis as the amoral cat like life and <UNK> peters as the bully crown br br still i'm no fan of <UNK> earlier <UNK> and far easier to see carmen jones and <UNK> is far superior to that less controversial film though that may have to do with the fact that the source material is also far superior br br as seen last night this is a <UNK> but far from perfect work not all of the moments quite come alive and there is some <UNK> in the way the film mixes the overtly stylized <UNK> row set beautifully done by oliver smith with actual locations also even to my rather <UNK> ear some brief portions of the score seem <UNK> <UNK> br br moreover while this doesn't detract from the achievement of the filmmakers <UNK> decision to film almost entirely in wide shots with no close ups and occasional medium shots no doubt rendered it unwatchable on tv <UNK> and <UNK> and may doom it even on widescreen dvds if it gets the <UNK> it deserves on smaller screens we won't be able to make out the many details that are crucial to the way preminger staged the film br br also the mix heard last night was odd many of the <UNK> particularly on the opening <UNK> seemed <UNK> soft and were overwhelmed by the <UNK> music perhaps this can be fixed in a <UNK> br br there is the issue of the film's racial politics personally i see nothing wrong with it at least in a contemporary context at the time when so few films depicted strong african american characters this may have seemed an unfortunate choice for a big budget hollywood film and while there may not be much <UNK> here these are recognizable human beings that are not racial stereotypes these are operatic characters who make poor choices because that's what tragic characters do that alone made it a giant <UNK> forward at the time br br in a modern context where strong and heroic african american characters are less rare though still not common enough these characters seem nothing more nor less than human they truly could be poor and people of any ethnic background br br <UNK> politics aside the original work is undoubtedly one of the truly great achievements of american music and theater <UNK> davis <UNK> peters and yes pearl <UNK> were all amazing performers who we'll never see the likes of again this less than perfect but still solid film clearly deserves to be seen and <UNK>
<START> the abc <UNK> up it's <UNK> company for another unrealistic representation of rural australia yes folks it's all there jeremy <UNK> an actor of little talent fire hero <UNK> <UNK> plays craig in the bush <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> town slut <UNK> by brother joe i think then there's uncle <UNK> the big daddy of lost springs uncle scenes are like <UNK> williams on speed only saving grace is russian actress <UNK> as loony <UNK> she is great i can't understand why john waters took the gig as <UNK> psychologist husband must have needed the money i expect still he won't last long as and will be having it off suit just watch this <UNK> to see how bad an aussie show can be frankly i'm ashamed
<START> did you find the title funny oh you didn't well that's because you're uptight learn to laugh because if you're not laughing you're not living so please lower your standards regarding to what you believe is funny to that of a mere <UNK> now do you find it funny still no ok that's because you're full of yourself and get offended too easily if you're not laughing you're not living and if you don't like me then send me hate mail so that i could write another review and state how much hate mail i get and try to twist this into making it seem as if i am a bad ass are you laughing at my hilarious title yet still no ok that's it you are a racist you have to laugh or else you are a racist why else would you not laugh oh it's not funny no this can't be why i want it to be funny so <UNK> it is laugh damn it please please ok that's it where's my <UNK> and pen and where's my richard <UNK> dvd's i need to write some jokes for my show br br and scene thank you thank you br br this is basically what you'll get from <UNK> for about 23 minutes please do yourself a favor and change the channel when this <UNK> show comes on even basic cable channels have things <UNK> better than this i'm not even saying this because i hate him i'm for real this show is like watching grass grow not sure though at least grass doesn't steal jokes i'm honestly trying to save your time i even tried watching his show i told myself maybe he isn't that bad but no he is i completely zone out when i watched his show i tried to collect myself during the commercial break and focus on the show but i couldn't i <UNK> out again i think i was thinking of something more interesting like re making my bed or <UNK> my <UNK> before i knew it the show was over yeah it's that bad br br here's my final thought there's so many things you can do with 30 minutes besides watch this guy shout about nothing for half an hour don't watch a show that tries to <UNK> racism in your face in vain i can support shows that try to ease the tension of the race wars but this guy just provides more racism rather than stop it
<START> i don't know about the english version of this movie but the norwegian translation is the funniest movie i've seen in many years the characters say so many funny things and make so many weird references to current events that i'm amazed they kept having more <UNK> like the architect who can never say the name of the wizard correctly it becomes things like <UNK> i x and which is norwegian for foreign affairs br br like the word many of the <UNK> does not give any meaning in english and probably not in french either so the <UNK> must have made up their own jokes and done so very well of course they have a very good base to build on with a film that's simply comical from beginning to end br br recommended in all languages with a good translation
<START> i recently saw this at the 2007 palm springs international film festival the film's title and in fact much of the outline of the film is from the robert graves poem beauty in trouble jan directs a screenplay by <UNK> from a story by and the story begins in 2002 when <UNK> is hit by one of those devastating 100 year <UNK> that destroys the household of <UNK> and roman and their two children <UNK> adam and <UNK> because of the <UNK> conditions where they now live <UNK> is life threatening works and runs a chop shop out of the garage they live next to shady <UNK> runs him <UNK> of the law and one of his <UNK> victims becomes <UNK> with <UNK> is a wealthy businessman who <UNK> his time between italy and the czech republic and offers to care and her two kids <UNK> is <UNK> mother who lives with her common law husband called uncle <UNK> played by <UNK> in probably the film's best role <UNK> out this excellent cast is as mentally fragile mother who gives any money she gets to the local religious <UNK> there is a lot going on here for a small film and it's good story with a great script and a lot of comic relief <UNK> provides the music score with additional music from czech singer and irish singer <UNK> there is a lot to like about this film and i would give it an 8 0 out of 10 and recommend it
