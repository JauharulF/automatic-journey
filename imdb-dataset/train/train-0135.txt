<START> unfortunately the movie is more concerned with making lame social commentary on a real event but doesnt have the balls to legitimately document what happened the constant rhetoric of how violent video games are not to blame i get the impression ben coccio is an avid gamer or how media and music is completely devoid of influence is the obvious message we even get a laughable scene of the two boys burning all their cd's talk about subtlety but the movie only gets away with it because its 'fiction' nice try yes its a great idea to relieve media of influence but how do we know the kids that have actually planned and executed a school shooting werent influenced by media or video games we dont and we wont with this movie because once again these kids are smart enough to completely relinquish the media yet dumb enough to scorch a nazi symbol on the ground haha i somehow dont think so br br the movie bats you over the head with its portrayal of the normalcy of the families its almost doing a disservice to think that there wasn't a serious flaw in the family dynamic of kids that have actually gone out and shot their fellow schoolmates why is everyone so concerned with making killers seem normal when they are so obviously not a completely false and phony depiction
<START> for those of you who've never heard of it or seen it on a e cracker is a brilliant british tv show about an overweight chain smoking foulmouthed psychologist named fitz who helps the manchester police department get into the heads of violent criminals it's considered to be one of the finest shows ever to come out of england and that's saying something and was tremendously successful in england and around the world back in 1993 br br now the original stars have re teamed with the original writer to knock out one more 2 hour episode i've loved this show ever since i'd first seen it over a decade ago the dvd box set holds a place of honor in my collection and i can quote a good deal of fitz's interrogation scenes practically word for word the idea of robbie coltrane reteaming with jimmy mcgovern for another tv movie about fitz filled me with absolute glee br br i'll start with the good one of the many things that impressed me about the original cracker series was how quickly fitz was defined as a character five minutes into the first episode Â with his lecture throwing the books into the air his drinking and his cussing of the guy after him on the gambling machine queue Â and you knew simply knew who this character was you could feel him clicking in your mind the kind of click that only happens when a great actor gets a great role written by a great writer br br coltrane of course remained great throughout the show but i always felt that some of the later episodes Â those not written by mcgovern Â mistreated the character br br so the good news is this fitz is back as soon as you see him in this show Â making incredibly inappropriate comments at his daughter's wedding Â you'll feel that click once again it's him petulant one moment and truly sorry the next always insightful sincere to the point of tactlessness but brilliantly funny in the process if you love this character as much as i do you'll be delighted with how he is portrayed in the movie and this extends to judith and mark in fact everything having to do with the fitzs is handled perfectly br br the problem i do have with this movie revolves around the crime fitz is trying to solve in standard cracker fashion we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes Â the suspense lies in seeing fitz figure it out in this case we have a serial killer who is out for american blood and the reason for this unfortunately is not due to any believable psychological trauma Â rather it seems that the murders are here simply to allow the writer to display his personal political beliefs br br it's difficult for me to write this as i truly believe that jimmy mcgovern is one of the greatest writers in the world nor do i have a problem with movies that are about current issues or movies that take a political stand but in the cracker universe we expect to see the characters behaving like human beings not like caricatures instead the americans in this movie are all depicted in an entirely stereotypical fashion they're know nothing loudmouths who complain about everything treat the locals like crap and cheat on their wives Â one of them even manages to do all of the above within less than 5 minutes i honestly thought i'd mistakenly switched channels or something br br but it doesn't stop there we get constant reminders of just how badly the war in iraq is going Â reminders that have nothing whatsoever to do with the story and appear practically out of nowhere the killer is so busy ranting about how bush is worse than hitler that he almost forgets to get on with the killing but more to the point he is such a mouthpiece for the writer's political views that he forgets to act like a believable human being and thus we Â as an audience Â don't buy his sudden transformation from a happy family man to a tortured serial killing soul br br i can't say that this ruined the show for me Â it's was still good tv better than almost everything else in the genre mainly due to once again coltrane but its constant politicizing made it impossible for it to be as good as the real cracker classics like to be a somebody Â an episode that was just as issuey but one that was handled with far more subtlety and psychological depth br br two other small points panhandle not being around is a disappointment but what's worse are her replacements the entire police department Â which for so long filled with such great characters is now full of vanilla completely interchangeable cops who lack any and all personality how you could drain coupling's richard coyle of personality is beyond me but it is indeed missing here br br also there are couple of moments where the show lost its believability for me one such instance revolves around fitz having to narrow down the entire population of manchester from 1 million to a hundred based on some very strange criteria french windows how does the computer know if i have french windows Â he not only succeeds in doing this but he succeeds in less than an hour i don't think so br br so all in all i was a little disappointed it's recommended viewing but remember to leave at least some of your expectations at the door still if there's new series to come after this it would all have been for the good i'm convinced that mcgovern can still write great stuff and maybe now that he's got his politics out of his system he can go back to writing about people
<START> on the face of it this should be a great film a great cast a plot with many possibilities and one of hollywood's finest behind the camera for the first time br br however its clear why it was another 8 years before spacey decided to try directing a movie again this movie fails on so many levels in a film where there is not much action and most of the scenes are shot in a couple of locations it is imperative that suspense and continuity are provided by the director not so here the great cast is horribly under used none more so than the great late john spencer the plot is so run of the mill and nothing you haven't seen in a hundred other tv movies there is so little character development you end up not caring for any of the protagonists at least we know spacey has a lot of mates and clout in hollywood studios to get away with a poor flick like this
<START> this complete mess of a movie was directed by bill rebane the man partly responsible for the truly infamous anti classic monster a go go as i was nearing the end of the cold i came to the unbelievable conclusion that this film was in fact even worse than that 60's shocker the story Â such as it is Â is about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to their remote mansion to play a series of macabre games whoever manages to last the pace and survive to the end will win 1 000 000 it's a very simple plot but rebane still somehow manages to make proceedings verge on incomprehensible things happen characters are completely forgotten about nothing makes too much sense and then it ends weirdly i mean what the hell was that ending all about exactly i guess you are left to draw your own conclusions production values and acting are without question of a pornographic movie standard in truth pamela rohleder shelly isn't even that good she is so unbelievably terrible she's compelling sadly the same thing cannot be said about this crap fest as a whole it's just a bargain basement rotter
<START> i saw this movie last year in media class and i have to say i really hated it i was in year 10 and aged 15 so that may have has something to do with it but for english this year year 11 we had to read animal farm also by george orwell aside from the fact that the book is based on the revolution my opinion is that it is a terrible book and i also hated it br br but 1984 i think it was the most disturbing movie i have ever seen and i think that george orwell is one of the most deranged people ever to live on this planet i'm sorry to everyone who loved his work but i unfortunately did not the themes in the movie were well portrayed but the way the whole movie was set and the events that took place within it were not to my standards this is only my opinion and i'm sure many many other people thoroughly enjoyed this film
<START> this is without a shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie steven seagal has ever made and that says a lot don't get fooled by the rating it's way too good this abomination hadn't even been worthy of a 0 10 rating if such a thing existed br br absolutely no plot br br worst action scenes ever and there aren't too many of them either br br seagal doesn't do anything himself including the fighting talking lots of dubbing and so on as always br br seagal is fat lazy and couldn't care less about this movie something which is very obvious all the way through br br take all the other garbage dtv movies seagal has made multiply them with each other multiply this with a thousand billions and all the badness you then get won't even describe 1 of this absolute crapfest
<START> i love this show now i'm not a big fan of many science fiction shows so if it bares any resemblance to them i didn't notice i like the storybook quality of the cinematography i even like the love story even though as i am enjoying it i wonder in the back of my mind how the heck that part of the story can truly develop seeing as ned cannot touch chuck or else well you know i even like chuck i don't find her annoying at all and i generally hate overly sweet nice perfect characters i even like the narrator's voice even if it bothers one of my family members and bares some resemblance to some walgreens commercials i could nitpick about all the other things about ned's predicament and how the writers are going to address it in the future but i just rather watch and wait and see what tale the writers weave
<START> i really thought this wasn't that bad not a great work of art but dermot m was the stronger performer by far patricia arquette was overacting much of the time he was actually playing cello which was very impressive and his lines were never forced besides he is an incredibly beautiful man really sexy add that to the talent and most anything he's been in is a lot more tolerable he always gives his all even if some of the projects he's been involved in didn't quite hit the highest mark not the fault of the actor in most cases he's unfortunately been in some strange films that just didn't resonate at the box office always with a list actors but just not always a hit but he is worth every penny of any dvd rented or purchased see the wedding date with debra messing one of his best overall films worth every penny if you haven't seen it yet do then you'll understand that quote
<START> some movies are repellent but still fascinating pulp fiction others are simply boring this movie has an almost unique feature of being both utterly repellent and totally boring by the end i didn't care about any of the characters i just wanted all of them dead so i could get out of the theatre
<START> i saw the film and i got screwed because the film was foolish and boring i thought ram gopal varma will justify his work but unfortunately he failed and the whole film got spoiled and they spoiled sholay the cast and crew was bad the whole theater slept while watching the movie some people ran away in the middle amithab bachan's acting is poor i thought this movie will be greatest hit of the year but this film will be the greatest flop of the year sure nobody did justice to their work including ajay devagan this film don't deserve any audiences i bet that this film will flop br br finally this movie sucks
<START> my kids picked this out at the video store it's great to hear liza as dorothy cause she sounds just like her mom but there are too many bad songs and the animation is pretty crude compared to other cartoons of that time
<START> ridiculous fluff that compounds its error by trying to have meaning joan this time as a congresswoman agatha reed chairwoman of a committee dedicated to investigating the high cost of food says congresswoman reed the housewife has been getting it in the neck too long i'm going to keep fighting long enough so that the american family can take a vacation once a year see a movie every week and feed an occasional peanut to an elephant she's all business but becomes all gushy when she is awarded an honorary degree from good hope college where she was expelled for the crime of having stayed out all night the parallel to joan's real life is unmistakable here as it is in all joan movies the degree causes much consternation on campus that would make it the most broad minded institution in the history of education Â but joan is unaware of this as she arrives the college president jim merrill played by robert young at his handsomest happens to be joan's former teacher Â and lover it was with him that she spent the night out all those years ago but joan felt it was better to just disappear rather than try and explain to the skeptical college that they were about to be married naturally this high profile event will be covered by life magazine Â and who does the photographer turn out to be yet another of joan's old lovers Â this one she hung out with in china during the war and he thinks joan might be headed for trouble with her old flame eve arden playing joan's assistant woodie is at her butchest and most smart alecky in this movie Â with her flippant and unnecessary remarks that would make you dismiss her from her job if you didn't like her so much but you not only like eve in this as in all her roles you adore her she is so droll and no nonsense you'd like to pay her just to hang around and be one of the boys when joan cries upon arriving at her alma mater eve tells her it looks fierce but joan says that maybe others only see a collection of buildings she joan sees youth Â herself at 18 eager expectant Â a little frightened asking 'what is life what am i ' but of course if we actually go into depth about joan at 18 the truth may be a little different br br for me this is the major problem in watching any joan movie you can call her characters whatever you want to but it's always all joan all the time so since what we're always seeing is joan being herself it's easy to dispense with character's names it's just that it gets confusing when joan tries to tell us something patently untrue like her description of herself at 18 Â when we know that at 18 joan had already been around the block several times many men would have described her as eager and as far as being expectant she had already had several abortions at this point but that's a personal problem and i digress but i simply wanted to explain why i say things such as Âand then joan doesÂ this or that or we see joan as when we are not literally watching a home movie br br there is an unintentionally hilarious moment in which joan is given the clara bow doll that she left behind in college Â quick arithmetic tells us that joan and clara were contemporaries and this is a transparent ploy to make us believe joan is much younger than she actually looks it fails what also fails is an attempt at early 50s political correctness in the story joan has written a book about free speech and made a film no not the one about the plumber and she attracts the attention of an early 50s campus radical dr pitt who is about to be fired for his views which are shockingly similar to joan's this is where the movie mysteriously becomes a morality tale Âa weak one to be sure but perhaps the only thing that keeps it from sliding into oblivion
<START> i have been a hindi movie buff since the age of 4 but never in my life have a watched such a moving and impacting movie especially as a hindi film in the past several years i had stopped watching contemporary hindi movies and reverted to watching the classics teesri kasam mere huzoor madhumati mother india sholay etc but this movie changed everything it is one of the best movies i have ever seen i found it not only to be moving but also found it to be very educational for someone who is a first generation indian woman growing up in america it helped me to understand my own family history which was always something very abstract to me but to see it feel it and understand it helped me to sympathize with the generations before me and the struggle that indian people endured the film helped to put many things into perspective for me especially considering the current world events i never thought that a movie could change the way i think like this before it did the plot is fantastic the acting superb and the direction is flawless two thumbs up
<START> i didnt think it was possible but i have found film worse than 'body melt' this film is really really bad and what makes it worse is that its another australian film br br shot on what looks like vhs and with a terrible 80's rock soundtrack it just keep getting worse and worse which is hard to believe seeing how bad the beginning is skinned male hanging up side down in a white tomato sauce sprayed room anyone br br and why do their accents keep changing from bad new york drawl to prissy english then pure aussie and it happens to the whole cast br br this film also claims to have won some film festival on the cover i believe it was the utah film festival this has to be a lie because no one in their right mind would nominate this for anything perhaps the golden rasberries but i thinks its too bad for that aswell br br come on guys this film has to be number 1 on the bottom 100 it has to be ten times a bad as those films already on there br br well done to the film makers of this trash for proving there is a reason not to see films 0 10
<START> me and my sister saw the premiere last night it was so good we were glued for the whole thing hahaha i think i'm hooked for the season they have some really good actors in this thing the head coach guy and the player that likes pete were very good and the plot has already got me but i don't really understand how they'll keep it stretched for a whole season there will probably be some big twist tho i cant wait till tuesday finally jeremy sumpter who is he i can tell hes going to be big he was soo good we fell in love with his character right away cant wait for the next episode go jeremy br br 'aimee
<START> after reading the book i loved the story watching the movie i was disappointed that so many changes were made it is understandable that books and movies differ but it was two different stories only the names and some of the book's story remained read the book and you'll have a better understanding of the movie the book gives you a better development of the characters these characters are extremely interesting and make you care about them the locations were indeed in line with the book's descriptions some characters not included television has microwaved so many great books and stories this is a perfect example of that input from the author doesn't always insure a good movie but it can help sometimes

<START> although a film with bruce willis is always worth watching you better skip this one i watched this one on television so i didn't have to plunk down cash for it lucky me br br the plot develops slowly very slowly although the first 30 minutes or so are quite believable it gets more and more unbelievable towards the end it is highly questionable if a seasoned soldier like lt waters would disobey direct orders and even if he would if the rest of his platoon would they know he puts them in direct danger and they know they will certainly die if they follow him but what the heck he is our lt so let's do what he says despite the direct orders remember br br still there are some nice scenes in this movie they somewhat save a village where the total population is being massacred by the rebels well they save a dozen villagers or so the rest was already killed the strange part of it that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind they rather go on foot maybe because the roads are unsafe but there was no explanation for it anyway i think this was what earned the movie the one point i gave it br br what made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt or killed themselves only near the end they loose a few comrades and that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly 500 or more can you believe that br br they fight of an army of so many kill hundreds of them and only loose a few of themselves and they have rounds and round of ammo never run out of it grenades and claymore mines an m60 machine gun and even an rpg where do they get this stuff carrying it around or what they even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels and this laptop has a battery which goes on for days really who think up this crap br br i guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots you give this movie a high rating if not skip this one it saves you time
<START> this movie is an incredible piece of work it explores every nook and cranny of the human mind focusing on the characters relationships with the people around them stellar performances all around this one had me weeping for about half an hour straight spend some real time with this one
<START> i appreciate movies like this smart and well crafted entertaining absorbing well acted and nicely directed nobody even pacino is chewing the scenery trying to stand out one of the film's most effective moments aielo pulling over at his beloved off ramp is chilling precisely because of its restraint br br not as good as say quiz show city hall is of a similar cloth engaging the mind as well as eye ear and heart why such well hewn entertainment flops at the box office is anybody's guess br br you know pacino does chew it up in one particular scene but precisely because it's required great scene too
