<START> seeing as the vote average was pretty low and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was just ok i didn't have much expectations when renting this film br br but contrary to the above i enjoyed it a lot this is a charming movie it didn't need to grow on me i enjoyed it from the beginning mel brooks gives a great performance as the lead character i think somewhat different from his usual persona in his movies br br there's not a lot of knockout jokes or something like that but there are some rather hilarious scenes and overall this is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch film br br very recommended
<START> good actors and good performances can't mask a pointless script bad dialogue and patterns of behavior spiraling into nothing you'd care about the most interesting character is david berkowitz no character development no growth no interest just some suffering for no particular reason teaching us nothing and not even bothering to entertain
<START> julia ross nina foch agrees to take a position as a secretary with the rich hughes family to get over her boyfriend leaving her almost immediately she is drugged and shipped off to the family's estate in cornwall when she awakens they keep telling her she's marion hughes has been mentally ill and keep her locked up but why you'll probably guess why but won't mind because this one is fun br br along with the narrow margin and face behind the mask this is one of the best b pictures ever made b pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars it's just as long as it needs to be only 65 minutes is well directed fast paced and exciting it only stumbles at the end which i found a bit too implausible to buy br br foch a good actress is just ok in the lead but dame may witty is great and george macready is excellent and frightening as the villains well worth catching a perfect example of how you can make a great movie on a small budget
<START> first of all i firmly believe that norwegian movies are continually getting better from the tedious emotional films of the 70's and 80's movies from this place actually started to contain a bit of humour imagine actual comedies were made movies were actually starting to get entertaining and funny as opposed to long dark depressing and boring br br during the 90's and 00's several really great movies were made by a 'new generation' of filmmakers movie after movie were praised by critics and played loads of money it became the norm br br then came united br br minor spoilers it's just simply not funny not once not ever but the thing is we think its funny because we're used to norwegian movies to be funny especially with a cast like this with a few really funny comedians but they neither say nor do anything funny where's the humor show me the humor is it the awkward clerk played by harald eia is it the overacting totally ridiculously unrealistic football coach is it the commentaries by arne scheie the movie is just not funny br br but thats not my main rant about united that namely is the predictability and it is here i fear that norwegian comedies have come to a standstill since i have seen this in many other movies as well all the time you just know its going to end well all characters are exactly as they are presented in the start of the movie and everybody gets exactly what they deserve in the end there's absolutely no room for surprises at all br br all in all i can say that i sat with a bad feeling after seeing this movie it was the one movie that made me realize that we probably need some new blood in norwegian movie making again br br rating 1 6
<START> i heard about this film and knew it wasn't real good but i started watching the film on my film channel and was interested this could be a really great darkly black satire on todays morals in media the small featurettes on every contestent were good it build up to something i wouldn't wanna miss but when the so called show starts everything becomes implausible cheap and rather silly here's where the writer should have added something that would make people think but instead it's wrapped up and assuming people are this dumb br br the ending is so bad i give it a 1 even if the film starts of promising
<START> finally i got to see the infamous ice age apart from maybe not being as dead funny as i'd hoped for after seeing the brilliant teaser there is not a bad word i can say about it sure it's not as glamorous as a disney production besides it is fox's 1st attempt at a full length cg movie but it's got immense heart and on some occasions like the look in manfred's eyes after we see the sad glimpse of his past i found myself on the verge of tears but when they reunited the baby with its father i just couldn't hold them in anymore a movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sappy and clichÃ© and manages to bring more than the best out of it the end result being one of the most touching animated creations i have ever seen great funny looking characters that quickly grow on you and great voice talents as well and many funny memorable scenes especially from scrat's behalf make the movie more than enough reason to give it a go plus the dodo scene which is my personal favorite funny scene of 2002 br br i honestly don't get it but for some reason it really looks like cg animation will be taking the upper hand in the future but if it just means that there will be more movies like this one and who can forget pixar's creations then i don't really mind at least for now 9 10
<START> the makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the characters as they suffered through this horrible ordeal the horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just actors playing parts i have never gotten so immersed in a film as i have this one burt reynolds and jon voight were never better on screen as well as fine performances by ned beatty ronny cox bill mckinney and though he appeared only briefly james dickey the man who authored the book upon which the film is based as the sheriff of aintry it is somewhat disturbing and kids of course should be shielded from it but this is great dramatic cinema
<START> great movie especially the music etta james at last this speaks volumes when you have finally found that special someone
<START> personal taste rules when it comes to talking about movies such as this treasured little gem way back in the eighties the early eighties i discovered this movie like so many released at the time night patrol bad manners or even king frat the artwork and blurbs on the back of the covers tempted and teased you br br of course being of an age movies like that i have already mentioned as well as stuff like screwballs and the many others captured the imagination and thankfully many years later i still remember some with fondness and some with disdain the many movies that help maintain my love of such genre as parodies or pastiches br br made many years after the huge success of animal house and having seen how it had fared down through the years i now know that there would be no way this movie would ever eclipse the box office bucks obtain aforementioned nor would it linger in the memory much like that of national lampoon's vacation br br to be honest not everything that has carried the national lampoon logo has been a wild success however to me class reunion remains one of my all time favourite movies with instantly recognisable characters such as the aloof bob spinnaker played to perfection by gerrit graham so good in charles band's terrorvision still lingering in the past glories of his youth or how about stephen furst's brash and ballsy turn as the high school lazy drunken sex crazed bum hubert downs br br sweet as which makes me ponder as i already said personal taste not withstanding people can be so cruel so it will never win any awards or be compared to the like of its's peers within the comedy world it does have some merit being one of the earlier scripts penned by john hughes who would later go on to do one of my own favourites of his work weird science as well as having a wonderful theme title sung by the great gary u s bonds br br what more can i say it's a movie just waiting to be rediscovered time and time again
<START> well where to begin i guess i can start with the general complaint regarding the way in which this film is marketed call me ignorant for not knowing of schneebaum's book before viewing the documentary that has been based off of it and decide that i have been living under some kind of a rock but don't blame me for picking this movie up since the title and the description on the box makes no note of the fact that this documentary is actually a companion to said book yeah i felt quite stupid after viewing this little flick seeing as how the reason as to why i sat down to watch it in the first place was to get a good serving of a modern cannibal tale i mean am i a fool for expecting this film to actually cover most of its story on the behavior of cannibalism in jungle tribes i certainly didn't expect an hour and forty five minutes of one old geezer kissing his own ass by whining about every little detail of his dull and worn out life i certainly didn't expect the insipid directing and i most notably did not foresee myself laughing so hard at tobias schneebaum and all of his off putting glory br br schneebaum is indeed unlikable the old man just rambles and bitches the entire film making the whole picture a personal tale of his even though he isn't even that interesting a character to fill a story oh really he was a cannibal ninety percent of the movie is focused on next to nothing regarding schneebaum's dirty past the only time that we really get to see some cannibal action is when tobias finally breaks his little silent treatment about what happened to him in peru and say that he had a small piece that's it folks ninety minutes of bull later and tobias schneebaum is a cannibal by three inches it's like calling a movie the life of a true don juan only to see that the only the time the protagonist of said film did something sexual happened during college when he once played just the tip unbelievable br br the directing is indeed superbly ghastly as there is no flow or rhythm to the story that is being told alright i understand that i didn't read schneebaum's volume before watching his celluloid tale of it but i can still recognize some bad pacing and even worse editing one minute schneebaum is talking about cruise ships and tourism and the next he's going on and on about how he can't drive and then jumps to talking about some dead relative or some failed and miserable saga in his life i mean jesus can you at least slam his back story to the first part follow up with some stuff covering his homosexuality and then end it off with a hearty look into his visit to peru also i don't particularly care much for schneebaum's insipid little quips on life and living but i at least implore the old man to keep consistent with his ramblings if i hear a guy talking about how he prefers life in the jungle i don't expect him to suddenly bitch and moan about wanting to go back home twenty minutes later absurd br br another note on the directing is the random clips from the story at hand to the small little television appearances in which our hero has appeared while some might find the clips to be fancy little breaks from the story the director has overused the gimmick and broken his entire film into pieces by seemingly attempting to place most of the efforts of telling the story on the old reels br br the bottom line here is that tobias schneebaum is a fraud pure and simple i know that i haven't read the book but i'm still holding on to the argument that this film is totally useless by noting that a good film must stand on its own this documentary relies way too much on the assumption that the viewer is already an avid fan of schneebaum's work and instead goes on from that assumption like a supplemental disk found on a dvd schneebaum is both arrogant and bitchy striking a sour combination when mixed with the fact that his story is remarkably un riveting if you're looking for a solid piece on the nature of humans and cannibalism turn away because keep the river to your right is an embarrassingly hilarious self serving rant over a man who is long overdue for a straight jacket and a gag
<START> this movie had me smiling from beginning to end partly at the humor partly at meg ryan this is the perfect character for her and always because it's just one of the best feel good movies i've seen hopefully the dvd will be out soon
<START> this is how i feel about the show br br i started watching the show in reruns in 2001 br br i enjoy the show but it had too many faults br br i hate the michelle joey characters br br stealing story lines from old tv shows they even stole from the partirdge family then in 1 episode the partridge family was mentioned br br actors playing different roles in different episodes mtv martha quinn the most notable doing this especially when she played herself in 1 episode br br the michelle character could not take a joke but then they had this little kid act out revenge to her sisters for a joke by them on her br br story lines that came went in 1 episode joey getting the tv show with frankie annette never heard from it again after that danny all of a sudden playing the guitar 1 episode he is coaching soccer 1 episode he is coaching softball baseball 1 game you are out huh danny br br jesse joey keep getting jobs really quickly with no experience only in a tv show br br i did like the d j stephanie characters wish jodie sweetin could have learned from candace cameron bure had a clean non drug adult life
<START> some movies you just know you're going to love from the first few seconds this is one of those movies tracing it's roots back to double indemnity and the postman always rings twice in the 40's this was a great example of modern film noir in the 90's nick cage plays the down on his luck main character who gets entangled in a husband wife murder plot and his luck goes from bad to worse to even worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people town violence and threat of red rock west lots of twists and turns great performances by cage hopper and walsh an hypnotic slide guitar musical backdrop and seamless directing make this a real joy favorite line when cage looks at the empty gas gauge in the get away car shakes his head and says f in' story of my life
<START> from the beginning of the show carmen was there she was one of the best characters why did they get rid of her the show not the same as before its way worse br br the best episodes were with carmen in them you can't replace someone from the beginning that is like south park without kyle or child's play without chucky it's not right the niece who replaced her is just ugh awful she doesn't fit into the storyline at all she was one of the main characters and the niece can't replace her she was an awesome actress way better than the niece get her back or you'll lose a ton of viewers
<START> my evaluation 8 10 br br i like a lot this movie compare to today brainless movie just action and special effet and nothing new about ideas soylent green ask to something that today doesn't exist anymore to think br br well it would not a big surprise a day human eat cookies which are create with body of human with all what happen on this planet and to see how people are so indifferent to all this kind of future is possible br br sure this movie take some age but the idea behind the movie is actual again rich at paradise other in the hell well a luck today they are tv and idiocy like reality show br br tv is a good wash brain it's pity to see that intelligence of human have not progress like technologies since writing all stop br br if you like reality show this movie is not for you if you believe all politician same too if you don't like ask yourself question about now and future well never look this movie
<START> the unborn tells the tale of a married couple named virginia brooke adames bradley marshall jeff hayenga who have tried for the last five years to conceive virginia has had two miscarriages since then is desperate to have a child they visit dr richard meyerling james karen for help after he is recommended by some of their friends dr meyerling says he will be able to help them have a child dr meyerling operates on virginia it is soon confirmed that the surgery has been a success virginia is pregnant at first everything seems perfect the marshall's couldn't be happier but their picture perfect lives don't last for long as virginia's pregnancy develops problems she becomes moody acts totally out of character she receives a worrying phone call from beth jane cameron another woman who has undergone dr meyerling's procedure who claims that meyerling is in fact using his patients for his own sinister ends is in fact a disgraced genetic researcher virginia begins to question just what is growing inside of her br br produced directed by rodman flender i actually thought the unborn was a decent horror thriller it's definitely not a sci fi film as the imdb would have you believe that pleasantly surprised me the script by henry dominic tries to be different it must take some credit for that at least the unborn goes for psychological horror rather than cheap scares bad special effects it's got quite a clever story that works plays on basic human fears it moves along at a fair pace although it's not exactly an action packed film by any means the climax was good seemed a fitting way to round things off the warnings about messing around with genetics seem even more relevant today than it must have been back then maybe flender knew something the rest of us didn't on the down side it lacks some exploitation elements is at heart a dialogue driven film mostly focusing on one person so it can get a bit dull at times also i have to mention it what on erath was that grinning black skateboarding dwarf all about eh br br director flender does an ok job the unborn is far from the most stylish or visually interesting film ever made but it's good enough the atmosphere is good there's a fair bit of tension as what virginia has inside of her dr meyerling's sinister plans aren't fully revealed until the last possible moment disappointingly the blood gore is almost non existent which in a way lets the film down because in retrospect nothing really memorable happens the unborn relies on good storytelling which is fine but in a week i doubt i'll remember too much about it br br technically the film is ok i'd imagine that the unborn had a pretty low budget but it's well made even if it's a little bland forgettable the baby creature is actually a decent special effect has fairly realistic facial movement the acting is good this was one of the first acting jobs credited to friends 1994 2004 star lisa kudrow i have to be honest i don't like friends i don't even know who she was in this so i can't tell you how she did br br the unborn is a good horror thriller that deserves to be more widely known seen it's far better than a lot of low budget crap that litter video shop shelves if your a horror fan are looking for something a bit different something slightly more intelligent thought provoking than usual then i think you could do a lot worse than the unborn followed by a dumbed down sequel the unborn ii 1994 which i watched straight after this check my review out if you want
<START> the lives of the saints starts off with an atmospheric vision of london as a bustling city of busy quaint streets and sunshine i was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere but it gets bogged down in a story that goes pretty much nowhere br br othello works for big fat mr karva his crime boss step dad at least i think that is what he is supposed to be because it's never really defined but he does drop kittens into deep fat friers so trust me he's a prick doing scrappy little errands while his skanky girlfriend gives daddy hand jobs one of his colleagues is runner a black dude who is always dashing from a to b until the day he comes across almost mute homeless child who grants him his wish of being able to stop running runner dumps the lost boy in othello's flat where he promptly starts granting more wishes keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled karva has the boy kidnapped but he isn't sure of what would really bring him happiness is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another hand job either way i don't want to see the little boy grant him the second br br it just takes ages to get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes the ending tries to be shocking but since there's hardly any back story on investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audience br br writer tony grisoni a favourite of terry gilliam tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell ironically if he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film as it is we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouths who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy who's origins are never revealed that's just plain irritating br br aside from sporadic moments of atmosphere and a moody score this film has little to recommend
<START> if you look at corey large's information here on imdb apparently there's a movie called reload in production as of june '08 in which he's playing a character named sebastian cole br br first of all how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel and second didn't sebastian get killed at the end of loaded br br i watched this in the wee hours of the morning when i was battling insomnia and so i was drifting in and out while it was on i'm sure i missed some plot points but overall it seemed really weak large's performance was for me one of the stronger parts of the film i'm also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls since i thought the actress playing brooke was pretty but not exceptional
<START> during a kurt weill celebration in brooklyn where do we go from here was finally unearthed for a screening it is amazing that a motion picture from any era that has weill gershwin collaborations can possibly be missing from the screens the score stands tall and a cd of the material with gershwin and weill only underscores its merits which are considerable yes the film has its problems but the score is not one of them ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy and fred macmurray cannot quite grasp the material then too the 'modern' segment is weakly written but the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark as does the work of the two delightful leading ladies joan leslie and june haver both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work as a world war ii salute to our country's history albeit in a 'never was' framework the film has its place in hollywood musical history and should be available for all to see and to find its considerable merits
<START> welcome to movie 17 on the chilling classics 50 pack where we'll see that's right another movie that makes absolutely no sense seriously this movie had me so confused at the end i thought i was rewatching at dawn they sleep the plot seems simple enough well that is until 3 seconds into the movie where a girl supposedly killed a cat and then um explodes i have no idea what happened and that was before the title screen that's really sad when i can't even tell what happened in the first 3 minutes br br anyway it stars a photographer with a big mustache who finds this girl after dumping his other girlfriend on the way to take pictures of something somewhere so we get there but not before somebody steals their jeep to drive it 200 feet out of the way towards a town suspicious nah so they decide to stay at this deserted village with one old lady and then blah blah stuff happens and blah blah talking the guy with the mustache goes out in the fog for some reason even though the old lady tells him not to he gets lost and then finds his way back br br oh i forgot to mention this is all after an incredibly pointless 20 minutes of them staying in the house of a guy who looks like that buggy eyed guy from casablanca then they leave there's really no point to this scene it's really just padding if you cut it out no one would have noticed or cared br br but sadly that was actually the best part of the movie wait let me rephrase that really sadly that was the best part of the movie because the rest is so confusing that i had to look on imdb to find out what happened but of course no one else knows so i'm sol br br seriously the last 30 minutes of the movie were some of the most mindscrewing moments i've ever seen on film they dressed her up in a dress he gets kidnapped then released he runs back to the house then at the end the witches are in the house and it ends seriously i have hardly ever been so confused in a movie i mean as bad as movies such as war of the robots are at least they make sense this movie doesn't even make the attempt to be coherent the ending was as confusing as the end of at dawn they sleep and the plot was much more boring this movie gets a 1 just for its sheer i have no idea what happened in this movie ness witches mountain gets 1 confused movie watcher out of 10
