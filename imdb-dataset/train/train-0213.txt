<START> this 'movie' has to be the biggest pile of steaming c p i have ever br br seen what more can i say than bad bad bad bad bad bad there is nothing to save this 'movie' and i pray that they never even talk about making a sequel if you are thinking about watching this then you should know that the storyline is that two garbage men get dragged into saving the earth movies like men in black has been torn to shreds and put back together to make this 'comedy' but have totally failed please avoid this movie save yourself
<START> ''the 40 year old virgin'''made me laugh a lot i don't care if it is considered to be a very sexual comedy i just enjoyed many of the jokes and scenes present in this movie steve carell is perfect as the virgin nerd andy stitzer and i think the scene where andy has his chest hair removed by wax one of the coolest specially because it is real many of the actors and actresses present in this movie are well known or already famous by the way br br andy stitzer has a peaceful life he is a little bit strange and collects lots of toys but seems harmless one day while playing poker with his friends of his work they discover that andy is in fact virgin and he is already 40 years old after this surprising revelation all his friends are trying to make andy sleep with a woman the problem is the confusions in which andy gets in specially now that he is really starting to like trish a woman he met when she was buying a dvd player in the store he works at
<START> this dreadful film assembles every asian stereotype you can imagine into one hideous package money grubbing devious japanese business men send goofy but loveable policeman pat morita to recover industrial secrets in detroit here he encounters a down at heel jay leno who promptly refers to a murder victim as a jap and calls morita tojo it's all downhill from there
<START> the last of the blond bombshells is an entertaining bit of fluff judy dench plays elizabeth a newly widowed woman at loose ends she has spent most of her life being the dutiful wife and mother but has never been truly happy br br shortly after her husband's funeral elizabeth is having her regular lunch date with her stick in the mud children when she spots a street performer this sparks memories of when she was a member of an all girl swing band in london during world war ii we soon learn that the band was not exactly all girl as the drummer was a man dressing as a woman ala some like it hot br br elizabeth pulls out her sax which she has been secretly practicing throughout her marriage and joins forces with the guitar playing street musician elizabeth is far more talented than the guitarist and the money begins to flow in she doesn't take any money as she is wealthy and doesn't need it her playing is strictly for artistic fulfillment br br elizabeth is seen one day by patrick ian holm who was the drummer in drag of the band it seems that patrick was and still is quite the ladies' man and elizabeth being only fifteen at the time was the only band member who did not experience patrick's talents other than drumming br br elizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to get the old group together once again to play for the granddaughter's school dance thus begins a delightful trip down memory lane combined with aspects of a humorous road trip movie all topped off with some really good swing and blues br br i guess i'm at the age in which i really enjoy older actresses doing their stuff and this film is a treasure trove as it not only stars judi dench but she is supported by none less than olympia dukakis leslie caron and a host of seasoned british character actresses this is all topped off by the extraordinary voice of cleo laine br br yes it is fluff but totally delightful and exceedingly entertaining fluff
<START> don't say i didn't warn you but your gonna laugh probably enough to hurt your stomach sure it's got some blood splattering all in good fun though so it's got no budget who needs a budget when you got a script like this br br take the time and check this out well worth a two hour viewing if everyone could laugh as much as i did during this movie the world would be a much happier place to live br br
<START> when i saw the trailers i just had to see the film and when i had i kinda had a feeling that felt like unsatisfied it was a great movie don't get me wrong but i think the great parts where already in the trailers if you catch my drift it went very fast and it rolled on so i was never bored and i enjoyed watching it the humor was absolutely great my first contact with a sloth or something like it
<START> as in amelie recent french films seem to be taking a stereotypical male female relationship slant centered on a female finding her one true love in this case desperation leads to a convict which leads to her evolution into a mob prototype clever and surprising story in many ways except that the female is there to support the male br br for those of us that don't speak french the subtitles are a little quick but not unreasonable br br the soundtrack as seems to be increasingly the case with european films is great and in perfect sync with the film's variations nothing seems forced visually it reminds me of various urban horror movies there's a wes craven in chicago feel to it
<START> to be fair i expected car chases in this film there was only really one but apart from that 'freeway' was a great movie which i am glad to own on dvd the only really big names in the cast are homicide's richard belzer as the radio psychiatrist and b movie villain par excellance billy drago as the revelation quoting freeway killer but the rest of the cast generally give good performances i especially liked how darlanne fluegel gave her character sunny a bit of guts she could have been a helpless victim character but she is fully rounded as she seeks out drago with the help of bounty hunter james russo br br russo i'm afraid comes across as rather wooden but then again the character he plays frank isn't very well fleshed out save for a back story sunny is given by his former commanding officer the tone of menace is kept up superbly throughout the film and the atmosphere of the lonely la freeway at night with the killer prowling its' length in his sinister grey sedan is an excellent way of building tension and the music used to underscore the film is suitably composed i don't know why there are some people who hate this movie so different strokes for different folks i suppose but i absolutely enjoyed 'freeway' and i can strongly recommend it
<START> he is the quintessential narcissist and manipulator in this case portraying attorney and murderer tom capano br br kathryn morris is sympathetic as victim anne marie fahey but in the beginning is a bit too much the victim we are sorry for the situation but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization of several other women including rachel ward as well br br the sad part is where she is actually getting help with her self esteem issues and capano actually had her psychologist killed pretty hard to believe but this was based on a true story br br there is a cameo with olympia dukakis excellent as capano's mother all in all an interesting story because it is based on a true murder and you will want to read ann rule's book to get the accurate details 8 10
<START> i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me to tell the truth i think that the younger kevin dillon was hot hahahaha but i also thought the girl was stupid to go along with the cop and that was wrong what he said to her before his death i was inside you i think that's what she gets for doing what she did with him and how is he going to tell her that she's too young when he never cared how old the other girls were now i don't think i myself could ever trust a cop like that but to tell the truth it was pretty obvious it was him even if he was wanting to become a cop i would still be suspicious of him either way and that was funny when she sprayed him in the eye in the store hahahahaha she was still stupid for going into the warehouse again by herself and so was the cop who died hello it's called back up sometimes these movies make me mad when people act stupid and do stupid things but that's what i think an thought about the movie
<START> wonderfully put together i wish there was a follow up to this documentary to follow up with the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others lost there should be a part two a real one it was great the film wasn't long enough i would like to know why the creator of the film did not follow up this is so important to the community period well if your are reading this please consider doing another documentary of this sort i am really tired of hearing from naive writers how aids and men go together when they don't actually its the hetero's that we need to look into this film didn't even bother to mention hiv or aids and i was so glad for that i really appreciated the break downs and definitions too thank you s much for allowing this film to exist
<START> portrays the day to day stark reality of survival on a ranch in the old west outstanding acting by both principal actors this doesn't even feel like a movie you feel like you're there animal activists should beware many scenes are obviously not just realistic they are real
<START> besides planes trains and automobiles and uncle buck this is john candy's funniest movie when he gets hypnotized with the playing card similar to the manchurian candidate and becomes a horny guy who does not know what he is saying he makes two very memorable quotes both deal with the male anatomy the love scene involving grocery items has to be seen it cannot be described br br
<START> this movie is a brilliant lesson on japanese history set in at the end of the tokugawa shogunate shortly before the shogunate lost a big battle against the loyalist who wanted the emperor back on the throne to rule japan really i had to read a lot of history to get the entire background br br shintaro katsu also known as the original zatoichi gives a superb performance as izo okada one of the four hitokiri human slayer of the bakumatsu he is a simple samurai who looses all of his wealth in order to have a good life he becomes a retainer of takechi hanpei played by tatsuya nakada ryonosuke out of sword of doom hanpei is a ultra nationalist politician who lets his band of hitokiri assassinate a lot of high ranking pro west politicians in order to achieve his political goals izo okada follows his leader without really questioning what they are doing as long as he has money to go and drink and spend at his whore okada's killings get more and more brutal in the course of the movie and he is proud to have a reputation based on fear wherever he goes br br it is a splendid portrait on the life of a simple samurai who gets caught up in political affairs and is really to naive to realize what is happening first after being betrayed and tortured and always having talks with sakamoto who is a samurai who rejects violence does he change his ideas and views on life but too late br br watch the movie to see the end of izo okada br br shintaro katsu and the rest of the staff give a brilliant performance each actor reaches up to their role the sword fights a very unique and fast probably faster than several movies nowadays br br check it out if you have the chance
<START> the night listener is probably not one of william's best roles but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie i can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before some people maybe won't like the slow pacing of this movie but i think it's the great plus of the movie it is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year 2006 it has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content dramatic feeling this is no americanized movie neither is it a predictable movie you just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be this is no excellent movie that has everything but hell it's a damn good and very original movie
<START> this is one seriously disturbed movie even though the boys deserved some of what they got the sadistic gruesome executions were slightly over the top the only character showing some conscience early in the hunt was killed off before he could offer some help to the sad plot br br at the beginning of the movie there looked to be some promise of a mediocre affair but this was just a ploy to lull the viewers into a false sense of security before the joy of what was to come br br the only thing that could have saved the movie for me was if jack nicholson had jumped out of the bushes and yelled and where is the batman kim basinger could have screamed br br now that would have been cool
<START> well magic works in mysterious ways this movie about 4 prisoners trying to escape with the help of spells written by another prisoner centuries ago was a superb occult thriller with a surprising end and lots of suspense even if it had something of a theater play almost everything happens in the cell it never got boring and it was acted very well in the tradition of cube you felt trapped with the characters and even if they were criminal you developed some sympathy with some of them only to change your mind by the twists the story takes some happenings catched you off guard and there was always a touch of insanity in the air altogether intense and entertaining and as i didn't expect anything a friend rented it it was a positive surprise
<START> predictable hackneyed poorly written foolishly i reasoned such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit i guess competition amongst actors is so intense these days and will only get worse that one cannot pick and choose much any more early on we were given an inkling who was was instrumental in the assassination and we had it rammed down our throats ever since the movie lacked intrigue giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder some of the discourse was frankly embarrassing it's hard to believe anyone would even consider let alone commit to the spending of tens of millions of dollars to make this tripe
<START> a truly dreadful film i did not know initially that this was a kiwi effort but very soon i started to realize that all the characters were speaking with hardly disguised kiwi accents under the fake american ones why did it need to be set n america anyway it could have been set in nz and then the actors could have used their normal voices surely someone in the production team could hear the dreadful attempts at speaking with american accents a bad bad film i am surprised it has lasted this long how did it make it out of the can it just seemed like a very poor attempt at a segal willis type action man flick a total waste of money if there was any taxpayer money in this piece of trash i would be leading a revolution to have all the money put back into the treasury i am still reeling get it pun reeling at the absolute garbage i have just seen why did i continue to watch well i am a movie fanatic and cant help myself
<START> i have to admit i have always found it difficult to watch an antonioni film from start to finish at the first try and even for this one i ended up watching it in three parts on repeated occasions in the end i realised perhaps it was better that way because it forced me to stop thinking in the usual terms of plot and just enjoy the scenes one by one br br the first part seems a lot more fragmentary which is not a bad thing it just requires more of an effort to follow when it gets to the desert scenes all efforts are repaid in full the stunning cinematography is only a part of it what really makes it all unforgettable is how the landscape is made into an overwhelming presence the silence and vastness of it the sense of sadness and freedom the way it fuses and contrasts with the two young characters the desert is dead but at the same time it feels less distant and alien than the urban scenes in the first part the dance between the airplane flying over and the girl's car makes for a series of great shots the love scenes in the desert are simply beautiful it is hard to imagine this kind of approach from a film of our times there is of course something very stylish and studied about them but at the same time they manage to express a sense of natural spontaneous innocence that is very rare these days it all feels loose and unscripted thanks also to the understated acting but that is the result of a maniacal attention to detail and form which comes to its climax in the series of explosions at the end a really mesmerising spectacle it just leaves you in awe br br i don't really care for some the usual objections boring well yes it is if you want all films to follow a classic plot development and be packed with action twists but then if all cinema was like that that would be truly dull and sad pretentious maybe but when that kind of ambitiousness is coupled with actual skills depth and style pretentious is a compliment the political criticisms make the least sense to me i don't see the point of approaching a film like this with ideological blinders or worse patriotic requirements it just defeats the purpose perhaps it's true that like a previous commenter remarked antonioni viewed these young 'hippies' and the politics of protests and riots with the police with the fascination of a foreigner but i think that adds something rather than detracting from the film it's not true that hippies did not exist in italy at the time think of the '68 protests like in france although they were obviously different from the american counterpart and in some ways even more militant but his interest in this film was not narrowly political the events seem more like a pretext for a film whose appeal has a universal timeless quality br br a special mention for the fantastic soundtrack amongst other things this film along with easy rider is probably one of the main earliest precursors of the contemporary 'artsy' music video as well as the concept of a film soundtrack that would stand on its own but unlike the former it uses music in a much more subtle way blending it with the landscape rather than the action br br if you want traditional narrative in a film then don't bother if you want to be stunned be patient and you won't regret it
