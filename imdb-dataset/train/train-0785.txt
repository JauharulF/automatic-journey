<START> in my book basic instinct was a perfect film it had outstanding acting on the parts of stone douglas and all the supporting actors to the tiniest role it had marvelous photography music and the noirest noir script ever all of it adding up to a film that is as good as it will ever get br br this sequel is the exact opposite it cannot possibly get worse bad acting and a lame script combined with totally inept direction this is really bad boring annoying the only thing that somewhat keeps you concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene that is an exact re enacted copy of the original these copies are so bad they make you laugh and i laughed a lot in spite of myself because it was like watching the demolishing of a shining monument the only thing that is good in this horrible mess are the excerpts of the jerry goldsmith score of bi1 michael caton jones and the half wit responsible for the script even included the there is no smoking in this room dialog in the interrogation scene and yes she sends her attorney who is now a solicitor away br br i am sorry i have seen this awful film that should have never been made it does damage to the original so bad is it the only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery and i am sure ms stone afforded the best surgeon money can buy can do a good job but can obviously not restore the perfection of the original and what concerns the human body applies to film making too there should be a law don't ever make a sequel to a perfect film
<START> just watched the film for the 3rd time and enjoyed lindsay crouse and the rest of the cast just as much as before it just keeps getting better and better you simply have to marvel at the carefully measured way of speech the slow deliberate action everything being exactly in place br br truly one of the great ones and definitely my all time favourite
<START> i saw this movie the other night and i have to honestly say it's one of the worst films i've ever seen the acting is fair but the plot is totally ridiculous a killer is born because of all the energy used to make the movie and if the film is burned the killer will die how unbelievable is that the characters were underdeveloped to say the least for example all of a sudden the man mentions aren't you trying to complete the film because your mother couldn't so we're supposed to go along with this we had no idea it was her daughter until half way through the film the movie really didn't spotlight on anyone we didn't know anything about the main people who survived except ringwald's character was a whiney actress the guy was on the set when the people died and raffy wanted to be a director like her mother not truly diving in to know who they are seemed things were rushed to just get to the killings the whole plot is entirely too weak for my taste and i was extremely disappointed anyone who enjoyed this piece of crap obviously needs to learn a thing or two about film making i can't believe anyone would agree to star or even work on this picture it's not funny it was not scary and was cliche through the entire film i found myself predicting what would happen before each scene which believe you me wasn't hard at all to do it's a disgrace and i'm deeply sorry i wasted an hour and a half watching the mess 1 10
<START> i purchased this film for 5 in a bargain bin at my local video store for one reason only chase masterson but i should have crumbled up the five thrown it in a toilet and flushed the film is about a bunch of twenty somethings that peaked in high school and reunite on the anniversary of their idiot friends death who got drunk and wandered into the woods and died there problem is a reptilian monster is hunting them down one by one the acting is abysmal these worthless people were apparently cast offs on shows like 90210 and dawsons creek the directing was on par with a twelve year old and the script was probably done by a thirteen year old the entire set looks like someone's backyard in malibu the people on here that have praised this film are obviously friends of the director and or actors avoid this pile of garbage at all costs
<START> bend it like beckham is a film that got very little exposure here in the united states it was probably due to the fact that the movie was strongly british in dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with football soccer here which some may have trouble relating too in the u s it's unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserved much more coverage over here i think the basis of the storyline following a dream is something many people can relate to and in the end bend it like beckham proves to be a good feeling film with a source of inspiration and really good acting i was not overly excited about seeing this film initially but now i regret not seeing it sooner i highly recommend this movie
<START> to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the exact opposite i realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesn't mean it is a terrorist thing it also show's how people give the muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad muslims out it doesn't mean we are all bad we just try to live 1 day at a time like how hard it was for amair to get on a plane and how he used words like blow up or yaser saying we'll blow away the competition and people took it the wrong way being a muslim i know that stuff like this don't usually happen but they do and many people think bad things about muslims or afghanistan or iraq its not right things are not like that people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act i am glad a show like this came on the air there are many shows that piotr muslim people as terrorists many people do find them funny to my opioion it is ok to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair but it is done to often and really gives muslin people a bad name
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen i was deceived into thinking it might be good because a couple of my favorite actors are in it now i want to punch jason schwartzman in the face for taking this role i was physically ill after watching this film i really don't understand hollywood sometimes there are so many people trying to break in that i'm sure you can skim off the top and get the very best that way the worst movie you make is equivalent to ferris beullar instead of this sludge the gags like the hair doll and blatantly ripping off jeans commercials added to the humorlessness of the film glad i avoided this film and watched it on tv this proves that you should avoid january releases at all cost
<START> this is not a bad film it is not wildly funny but it is interesting and br br entertaining it has a few funny moments cher gives a good br br performance in a role that is very opposite her real life self her br br performance alone is worth the watch if this movie had come out br br today it would not have been nominated but by '80s standards it br br was excellent
<START> this film was totally not what i expected br br if this film was called something else no one would even notice the difference between the two br br its really strange because i cannot see the point the prequel and sequel lets just say don't make sense the don't even match maybe i am naive but ain't a vol 1 vol 2 meant to match up br br carlito was in jail in the 1st one and dies in the original and in the prequel he lives and don't go jail br br the plot was ok but they should have changed round some actors and some of the story line and the name of the film and it would have been a good film br br i really expected it to end like the other one started br br if some one has a opinion on this post it please
<START> a stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman so obsessed that he loses perspective and common sense an evil magician approaches him and informs him he can give him great wealth that he can use to win the lady's heart if he agrees to give him anything he wants that's within their room the dumb guy agrees and the magician steals the man's reflection out of the mirror and bad things naturally occur as a result br br if this film had been made just a decade later i am sure i wouldn't have been so charitable in reviewing and scoring this film after all the film's plot is a bit vague in spots and the acting is at times a bit stilted however when you consider that in 1913 full length films were rare and often only 20 to 30 minutes long plus the whole idea of a complex story like you get in this film is very unusual as stories were very short and broadly acted so given the limitations of the time this film is pretty good and is one of the earlier horror films known
<START> playwright sidney bruhl michael caine has had a series of flop plays after a huge hit he receives a play written by a student of his clifford anderson christopher reeve which is fantastic it's so good sidney says he would kill for it will he br br a thinking man's thriller it was originally a play and it shows it's mostly on one set and all talk but i was never bored it's very well written with plenty of twists and a good cast working full force caine is just great as bruhl another one of his great performances reeve is surprisingly very good i never thought much of him as an actor but he's really good in this role dyan cannon does wonders with an underwritten role as bruhls' wife irene worth is also good and quite funny as helga ten drop a psychic however her accent did get on my nerves director sidney lumet does very well with his one set the camera is always moving and keeps your attention going br br extreme spoiler dead ahead my only complaint is that two gay characters in this movie turn out to be raging sociopaths and it also contains one of the most unromantic kisses i've ever seen but these are mild complaints br br a very good thriller critics hate this movie for some reason and it seems to have completely disappeared since it premiered in 1982 that's too bad it deserves better
<START> these were over 80 minutes of semi unexpected boredom first i was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that then reaching 70th minute i was convincing myself that it's only a few more minutes and i lasted to the very end which i'm kinda proud of as i consider watching this movie as a great test for human's patience and crap tolerance was it worth watching at all well as i wrote above if you want to test yourself give it a try and if you're strong willed enough you may even last to the end the movie lacks coherence and characters seem to have no common sense at all all happenings in the movie you can be sure you saw somewhere before and they seem to be put in this movie just to fill the film reel
<START> bad movie saw it at the tiff and the movie gives me a sense of 'been there done that' it reminds me alot of the movie blow expect the blow was actually interesting br br this one story told two ways and both times it is not told that well br br
<START> a strange mix of traditional 80s smartassy chevy chase type every ten lines you get a funny one farce and sickie black comedy mildly amusing in spots but utterly tasteless there is a skiing sequence that includes the fakest looking back projections since on her majesty's secret service
<START> this is the most cliche ridden and worst romantic comedy i have ever seen every scene is cringe worthy and the two lead actors corey and danny are soo annoying corey is very dumb and naive and should have never listened to danny's false promises br br neve campbell and the killer from urban legend are the only redeeming qualities in this poor attempt of a film danny dean paras looks in his late thirties and the girl he's trying to bed corey looks as if she's still in college br br here in australia this film is called too smooth there is nothing smooth about this film at all 1 10 avoid
<START> i'll have to add dissenting comment here various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao hsien i e one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years unfortunately this isn't quite accurate the film plays out rather like a film school graduate's attempt to emulate these masters all the pieces are there the beautiful backdrop the vaguely minimalist dialogue the slow swaying camerawork and male leads in particular who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par the dialogue is leaden the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical chekovian i e very predictable plot the results are at best tedious and at worst painful i couldn't help but see the blue danube river scene for example as verging on genre parody although the smoggy looking springtime sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it while the setting is elegant and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of flowers of shanghai the film is not in the same league visually in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave and i can't recall the last film i walked out of i'm guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldn't care if you'd like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i'd recommend anything by the above two directors for example in the mood for love or flowers of shanghai both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping the former with chris doyle and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this it's not often mr hoberman leads me astray and perhaps you'd rather listen to him but don't say you weren't warned craig br br
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have seen to date the best part was christian j meoli leonard attempting to act jumping up and down outside the bar kind of like i wanted to do on the dvd to spare the rest of humanity the agony of watching this shitty film it has a great cast so you keep watching waiting for it to get good i mean with sean astin andrew played his part perfectly did a great job too bad it was in this film kyra sedgwick bevan ron livingston chad renÃ©e zellweger poet they put her name on the cover she has a total of 1 line and less then 4 seconds in the whole movie br br if the cast had any dignity they would go out and buy all the copies of this film and burn them along with writer director george hickenlooper and writer john enbom
<START> i love anthony hopkins as an actor so i was very interested to see how he would do as a writer director i could not have been more disappointed by this move the movie was so disjointed and the cinematography was so over done to the point i wanted to pull the plug out of the wall the actors were very good but it was such a waste of talent not all actors are cut out to be writers or directors and clearly mr hopkins falls into this category of all the movies i have ever seen in my 50 years this is absolutely the worst movie ever please do us all a favor mr hopkins and stick to acting which you are excellent at and leave the writing and directing to those who are talented in those areas if i could give this movie a rating less than one i certainly would
<START> this is a kind of genre thing meaning you either like the 1950s musicals or you don't if you do you'll love this personally i prefer the 1930s and most of the '40s musicals with the dancing talents of astaire and rogers and eleanor powell bill robinson ruby keeler james cagney shirley temple and so forth but the songs of the '50s the slower dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade all turn me off br br this film is a case in point the first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me by then the story didn't have much appeal either the presence of deborah kerr is another minus i don't think i've seen a movie she starred in that i liked including this one where the goody two shoes english teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave siam i which she had br br however divorcing myself from likes and dislikes there is no denying this rogers and hammerstein production has a lot of appeal to many folks particularly those who liked the sound of music a decade later there are similarities in the r h musicals thus if you liked the julie andrews flick you should like this too br br this is a lavish production with yes a capital l this is the kind of big production musicals you rarely saw after that generation you also get the dubbed singers unlike today where the actress isn't able to really sing so marnie nixon comes to rescue of kerr as she did with natalie wood in west side story and audrey hepburn in my fair lady br br yul brynner is king mongkut and is the stereotypical traditionalist the kind filmmakers always portray in a negative way he isn't progressive as the left wingers like the say but the education teacher kerr as anna leonowens will set him straight secular progressives of today always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer however yul is good in this role and even employs some comedy along with his more bark than bite character justifiably he is the big star of this film brynner had magnetism even in the magnificent seven yul was the one cowboy who mesmerized the audience br br in summary it's a fine movie for its day and millions of people enjoyed it i'll leave it at that
<START> johnny dangerously is a sort of hit and miss comedy that has it's laughs and huh but i suggest to give it a chance i think it is greatly over looked not too many people give this movie a chance it does work just think of it as a little parody of goodfellas michael keaton is very funny in his role and he does it well johnny dangerously is a gangster who wants to go higher in life he just works his way up from the big bosses to a beautiful wife and of course like a lot of the mob movies someone wants him dead 90 of the jokes get a laugh like i said give it a chance just take your favortie gangster movies and mix a comedy in you have johnny dangerously br br 7 10
