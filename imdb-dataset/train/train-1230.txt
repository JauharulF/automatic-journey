<START> the only thing about this film that bums me out is that the dvd is so expensive it's too much for my budget at the moment or i would purchase it because the film is a good example of film noir and i enjoy watching richard widmark jean peters and thelma ritter br br criterion produces great dvds but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much that's the case here for an 80 minute black and white mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary cinematography wise br br the story is the story here as opposed to visuals actors sound sets etc as a pickpocket widmark inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering peters' purse say that three times everyone but peters is a believable character in this movie widmark the cops the u s agents and the communists and especially ritter as moe an informant she and widmark are the stars of this film br br peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by falling in love with widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her only in world of film too bad because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it br br this an average film noir which means good but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of 25 35 for that price one could do a lot better in the film noir market
<START> just about everything in this movie is wrong wrong wrong take mike myers for example he's reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasn't changed since his snl days over ten years ago he's doing the same cutesy stream of consciousness jokes and the same voices his cat is painfully unfunny he tries way to hard he's some weird type a comedian not the cool cat he's supposed to be the rest of the movie is just as bad the sets are unbelievably ugly and clearly a waste of millions of dollars cardboard cut outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street alec balwin tries to do a funny great santini impression but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent there's even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity paris hilton that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a dr seuss story avoid this movie at all costs folks it's not even an interesting train wreck i hope they'll make horton hears a who with robin williams then we'll have the bad seuss movie starring spasitc comedian trilogy
<START> kay pollack the man behind this movie is a real great man who tries to share his life philosophy in different ways he has written a bunch of good and well written books about how to control your senses and keep your soul happy the message in most of his books and this movie is about that your thoughts in fact is what causes your problems and that the reason of your anger hardly ever is caused of what you think of the main message is that you can choose to be happy but hardly ever do that br br to watch this movie and learn something very important on life you have to keep your mind very open and l i s t e n to all the hidden messages or guidelines to get through life which most of the parts in this movie contains if you listen and watch watch it with your ears br br you won't learn the meaning of life but you'll learn how to live and get the most out of it br br so while watching please keep in mind br br the mind is like a parachute it doesn't work unless it's open
<START> i was about 7 when this dire monstrosity of a film was released in the uk it was advertised on the tv in the summer of 1977 for weeks as if it were some incredible blockbuster film it was actually the first film i ever saw at a cinema and i was put off going for years to come the following week i was invited to go and see the new film star wars and i declined to this day i have never seen it in protest at having to watch sasquatch seriously even at the age of 7 i could tell that i was watching garbage it's just so bad it's almost unbelievable rambling nonsense that should never have made it to a cinema i was however amused to read all these years later that the director never directed again just as well as far as i'm concerned avoid at all costs
<START> pop quiz you're a part of the modern armed forces in peacetime on routine manoeuvres and you find yourself thrown back in time with a chance to change history what do you do well if you're a hollywood studio you change the japanese g i s in g i samurai aka timeslip to the crew of an american aircraft carrier have them debate stopping the attack on pearl harbour for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no one reminds you that japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this sonny chiba movie but unlike its hollywood counterpart the final countdown this sees its premise through thrown back 400 years into the japanese feudal wars its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope of getting back lies in provoking history by trying to change it by joining with a warlord to conquer the country Â cue lots of tank and helicopter vs samurai action including a very impressive unrelenting 25 minute battle sequence featuring a cast of thousands inflicting serious damage on each other and yes there are decapitations br br of course things don't go as planned and even superior firepower doesn't stand up as well as hoped to thousands of soldiers even before that the soldiers are falling out with each other into those who want to go home those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and pillage for the hell of it impressively directed and surprisingly well thought through the soft rock and country and western songs are sometimes a distraction especially when they feature english lyrics sung by japanese singers who audibly can't pronounce the words let alone speak the language but it's a forgivable flaw in a surprisingly good sci fi actioner br br optimum's uk dvd is a good transfer of the uncut 138 minute version
<START> all hype what better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can't release their film through a mainstream distributor consequently they do it themselves otherwise the hype of the film doesn't justify the content in the film the story is absent and could easily be a short the acting is poor but the animation and music is pretty good otherwise don't waste your time don't believe the hype however if you have the chance to see the film for free do so then you won't have to waste money still the filmmakers do a good job of pressing their story and creating cliffhangers with their self indulgent mini series otherwise they're one hit wonders who never had a hit
<START> in the ravaged wasteland of the future mankind is terrorized by cyborgsÂrobots with human featuresÂthat have discovered a new source of fuel human blood commanded by their vicious leader jÅb lance henriksen the cyborgs prepare to overtake taos a densely populated human outpost br br only one force can stop jÅb's death marchÂthe cyborg gabriel kris kristofferson who is programmed to destroy jÅb and his army br br in the ruins of a ransacked village gabriel finds nea kathy long a beautiful young woman whose parents were killed by cyborgs ten years earlier now she wants revenge they strike a pact gabriel will train nea how to fight the cyborgs and nea will lead gabriel to taos br br five time kick boxing champion kathy long has all the right moves in this high speed adventure that delivers plenty of action also stars gary daniels as david and scott paulin as simon
<START> in the first howling we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized the plot in that film made some sense a tv reporter investigates this and attempts to uncover the truth she ends up having to kill many of them including her boyfriend who becomes one then she shows the world that they do exist by transforming on live tv the special effects were just laughable in the first movie and they don't get any better in this one whether it's the transformations or the bad puppets or the cheesy computer graphics showing the superpowers br br the plot line isn't all that bad they must kill the leader of the werewolves for some reason this won't destroy all werewolves and it really doesn't end the threat from werewolves as it they just want to kill her i think there was some cloudy reason for this but it really gets lost in the film br br after the film ends we have a 10 minute montauge of the movie we just watched and every other scene is one where the female werewolf leader rips off her top exposing her large breasts while some devo esquire band plays to a crowd of werewolves br br the only thing that makes this movie even watchable is christopher lee
<START> there are no spoilers in this review because everything was already shown in the movie's trailer i am trying to be balanced in my review because i strongly support local movies but i can't help but support the backlash against this movie it is slow boring and bordering on pointless even the almost nice and believable moments were immediately undercut by painful clichÃ©s and bad acting vernetta lopez and wong li lin whom i usually love were only passable in this movie it felt like the director was trying to make a melodramatic tv soap then got carried away and decided to put it on the big screen the leap years should come with an ra rating rated awful but it hasn't changed my faith in local movies more good films will come so long as more films like these don't get made
<START> i actually quite enjoyed this show even as a youngster i was interested in all sports and that included horse racing it was always going to be difficult to make a series based on racing corruption and at the same time get permission from the race tracks to record filming about this controversial subject one episode i particularly remember centred around a horse expected to win a big race that looked a bit off colour a syringe was found on the stable floor and everyone thought it had been drugged but nothing showed up in the blood tests all too late they realised the horse hadnt been doped but had had its knee cartilage removed like running a car with no oil and the engine seizing up the horse broke down with tragic consequences
<START> felt mine was while watching this but it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film not that makes a lot of sense anyway as others have mentioned this was one of karloff's last films and it's only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all it's sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low grade rubbish like this marginally boris did get off slightly better than poor old bela lugosi but not by much br br boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together the strident background music doesn't help and distracts from any lucid moment apart from boris the rest of the mexican cast are dubbed into some strange clipped english monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies br br at a guess i think it's edgar allen poe's 'house of usher' that this is taken from but you'd be hard pressed to find a great deal of poe in the finished article br br still there are far better films out there with boris karloff at his best search them out and give this a wide berth unless you want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too
<START> trapped buried alive brings us to a resort that has just opened and is soon to close br br we start with a guy in gear blowing up drifts to avoid the possibility of avalanches somehow that doesn't make sense anyways he's about to blow away one particularly big one when he notices the resort is open despite his best efforts higher authority tells him his day is over br br soon as everyone expects an avalanche hits br br look i'm not gonna reveal any more all i can say is this was a b movie designed for the family channel which i just saw it on and the fact it had no commercials proves it's a b movie anyways it's a pretty decent film but it's partially unreal br br firsthand when people are buried by ice and snow they're buried not just traced by powder or what about a cd for a screwdriver it's not possible and finally what i can't stress enough is that an explosion cannot stop a avalanche guaranteed br br furthermore it's worth a rental or a tv viewing but not owning 7 10 br br the movie is rated pg but maybe it should have received something a little more strong a boy nearly loses his foot in an elevator but his leg is cut around the ankle a guy is toasted by electricity and diesel and in the weight room dead people are laying around br br enjoy
<START> nightmare weekend is proof positive that some people are so desperate to be 'in the movies' they are prepared to do almost anything br br i'm not referring to the countless women who seem quite happy to appear completely starkers in this dreadful piece of trash after all the naked female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of no i'm talking about those who are more than willing to co star with a badly made hand puppet called george now that is embarrassing br br a bio electronic being created by brilliant scientist edward brake wellington meffert george who looks like a demented felt clown with green wool for hair is the artificially intelligent interface for an advanced computer system that operates a revolutionary device a silver sphere about the size of a golf ball that when ingested can reverse character disorders br br edward's personality altering experiments have been successful on lab animals but the cautious scientist is reluctant to carry out tests on human subjects fearing that there may still be side effects his evil assistant julie debbie laster however has no such qualms and proceeds to use three beautiful young women as guinea pigs inevitably they all turn into hideous killer mutants br br with bargain basement special effects a cast totally devoid of talent and a plot that is almost impossible to follow i took notes as i watched the film and even then i am not entirely convinced that my synopsis is accurate nightmare weekend is a complete and utter disaster that not even several soft core sex scenes and a touch of gore can rescue br br this film also features one of the most irritating characters i have ever seen in a horror movie tony bruce morton a walkman wearing idiot who bops away to crap 80s music in a manner that makes me look like justin timberlake in comparison
<START> this is one of the most atrocious rewrites i've ever viewed if they want to make a movie with a lousy story they should refrain from giving it a title of a fine book there is hardly a relation between wolfe's book and this movie other than the title i don't mind changes if they help a story flow on screen at least the changes shouldn't hurt the final product the last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing the actors are miscast the director and or screen writer obviously could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon br br if you've seen this movie and disliked it try the book if you've seen this movie and liked it read the book
<START> back in my days as an usher private lessons played at the 4 plex i was working it was a sleeper hit selling out friday and saturday nights for several weeks i never got around to seeing it but saw that it was on cable this last weekend so i decided to give it a shot what i witnessed for the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies i have ever seen and one that made me terribly uncomfortable to watch br br the basic story is a teenage boy lusts after his sexy maid sylvia kristel she too seems to feel an attraction towards the boy but for more sinister reasons so we get scenes of the boy watching her undress and her inviting him in to watch and it goes from there br br eric brown as the teenage boy has to be one of the worst actors i have ever seen his scared reactions to every time sylvia takes off a piece of clothing or when she touches him are horrible i didn't laugh a single time during this piece of junk br br and let's not get started on the subplot of the maid and chauffeur planning to extort money from the kid let's just say it involves faking a death burying a body i could go on and on but it gets more ridiculous br br the sex scenes are the worst i have ever seen even though eric brown was older then he looked the fact is he looks like a baby it appears he has no idea how to kiss a woman if that was acting then maybe i should re think my criticisms of brown and it just came too close to bordering on child pornography to be erotic i have never been so turned off by a sex scene even though miss kristel is quite beautiful with and without clothes br br spoiler warning i must make mention of the last scene to me it's just plain sick but i can remember audiences cheering as the film freeze framed and dissolved into credits our hero returns to school and begins a flirtation with one of the female teachers he asks her out for dinner and she gives him a look as if tom cruise has just asked her out she nods affirmatively and he walks away smiling at the camera in triumph give me a break yes i am sure teachers all over would just risk everything for a plain looking teenage kid br br i will never understand the appeal this film had in 1982 certainly it was more then the nudity because there were plenty of teen sex comedies with nudity that bombed at the box office and to think that these same teenagers that cheered that movie 22 years ago are now working their way up corporate ladders and possibly helping to run this country that is a scary thought
<START> hey everybody i've got an idea we found this egg shaped thingie from outer space so why don't we thaw it out and open it up yes i know that would be the dumbest thing a scientist could do and it could be filled with contaminating bacteria or viruses unknown to earth and could potentially wipe out the human race but hey i want to know what's in it and nobody tell nasa they might take it away from us wow this thingie gives off vibes yes really strong ones on contact so don't touch it but it's okay to cut it open hi there handsome check out my nips later that day do not open uh oh we have to run all the way to the lab and tell them not to open it because we don't have phones or radios or intercoms even though we have a gazillion dollars worth of other equipment here i've never seen such organic technology yeah lemme take this stick and stab it i'm getting out of here i don't care if i do kill the other 6 billion people on earth nobody's nukkin' me look it's the friendly aliens from the abyss they want us to come with them the end
<START> the internet database lists this as a tv show and yes it was a series on mtv shown on the oddities program after the head and before aeon flux if i recall correctly but the version i watched this time was a vhs tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes br br you have the story of the maxx julie winters sarah and mr gone the maxx is a super hero or a bum julie a social worker or a leopard queen sarah a girl who should listen to less of the smiths and mr gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on and then there's the other weird creatures br br i use or with maxx and julie because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams maybe they're all real or dreams maybe one of the characters doesn't exist maybe only one exists and dreams of the others you'll have to wait and find out br br i had the comic books before the show came out and it was one of my favorites the artwork was spectacular and the story was original unlike anything you'll find in superman or batman it will bend your mind and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive and the show used basically the same exact artwork only now it moves and the same story guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced this was the best show to appear on oddities hands down br br if you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip this is a show to check out it's donnie darko before there was ever such a thing br br the most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series but i don't say this in disappointment by keeping it simple they have sealed this movie in gold and kept it free from the blemishes brought on by successive failures
<START> i have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film i even got the rental company to give me my money back because i argued that they perpetrated false advertising br br it's not enough that the movie itself is a p o s but the cover art is what sold me i've done better make up effects on my children at halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art can you say raccoon eyes br br i'm not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details but come on the movie's main character is an l a cop who was born and raised in alabama but has a german accent it's beyond insulting
<START> teamo supremo are three kids consisting of their leader captain crandall rope girl and skate lad all with their own battlecry buza chika woopa and outfit and moves they work for the governor kevin and were recruited after wishing to be heroes and playing at that game they lead normal lives as well and have family and school duties but most of the action takes place away from school fighting villains the villains all have rather unique and singular traits such as mister vague and his men who never seem to know what their plans are but act anyway from an evil robot to a wicked baron the three have to encounter them and stop their evil and often strange plans to gain power take revenge etc br br the animation itself is quite nice and smooth but the style appears to be simple on purpose the backgrounds have overlapping colour and the buildings seem futuristic the music is quite nice and the show isn't too bad altogether although the style isn't my favourite br br the plots are almost always nonsensical and ridiculous but after all this is a cartoon and one can't blame them for that however this would not be in the same rank as fillmore or pepper ann
<START> many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with the mortal storm or casablanca everyone is entitled to compare films they choose but the similarities of the mortal storm and watch on the rhine are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the nazi juggernaut while the main comparative point brought out with casablanca is the seeming unjust treatment of humphrey bogart in 1943 by the academy of motion picture arts and science because they chose paul lukas instead for the best actor oscar it does not strike me as totally wrong lukas had a good career in film both here and in england he is the villain in the lady vanishes and this performance was his best one bogart had more great performances in him than rick blaine for instance he was ignored for sam spade in the maltese falcon and roy earle in high sierra two years earlier both of which were first rate performances and he would not get an oscar for his greatest performances as fred c dobbs in the treasure of sierra madres the writer murder suspect in in a lonely place and captain philip francis queeg in the caine mutiny afterward he got it for charley in the african queen i think that bogie should have got it for the role of dobbs but it did not happen but lukas was lucky he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career few can claim that br br to me the film to look at with watch on the rhine is based on another play script by hellman the searching wind they both look at america's spirit of isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s the searching wind is really looking at the whole inter war period while watch on the rhine set in the years just proceeding our entry into world war ii deals with a few weeks of time therefore it is better constructed as a play and more meaningful for it's impact br br the film has many good performances led by lukas as the exhausted but determined anti nazi fighter courier davis as his loyal wife wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to lukas being the center of the play's activities coulouris as the selfish conniving but ultimately foolish and ineffective teck lucille watson as the mother of davis and geraldine fitzgerald as coulouris' wiser and sadder and fed up wife and kurt katch who delivers a devastating critique as the local embassy's gestapo chief about coulouris and others who would deal with the nazis it has dialog with bite in it and what it says is quite true it also has moments of near poetry witness the scene towards the end when coulouris is left alone with lukas and davis and says the new world has left the scene to the old world hellman could write very well at times br br given the strength of the film script and performances i would rate this film highly among world war ii films
