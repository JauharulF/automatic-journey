<START> che part one was a fascinating experiment which did not only tell a very interesting story but it also tried to do something different with the biopic genre che part two is the excellent culmination of this experiment br br this movie offers all of the same attributes from the first one from the extraordinary performances specially from benicio del toro to steven soderbergh's brilliant direction without forgetting its intention of breaking with the conventional rules from the biopics that is what i admire from soderbergh's experiments they always try to do something different and unusual and they succeed most of the times br br the final message from this film is perfect and it includes everything we have been told about che guervara's life the only fail i found on che part two is that a few parts felt a bit irrelevant br br in summary i give che part two a very enthusiastic recommendation because as the first one it is a brave and fascinating experiment which challenges the spectator and leaves us thinking
<START> i felt brain dead i'll tell you this is the worst film i have ever bought in my ignorance i thought this was the peter jackson film of the same name the performances are so terrible they are laughable the special effects have not stood the test of time and look dire the script promotes that kind of tv movie stare into the middle distance kind of acting the cast look as if they have been taking lessons from joey tribbiani they have one look each and stick to it plus i have never been confused by a movie until i sat down to watch this the is it a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration sets in within a few minutes avoid like a plague
<START> i watched this movie when i was almost quite a kid and naturally was moved to tears by this story of a fox family the fantastic scenery at hokkaidÃ´ the excellent storytelling and last not least the wonderful soundtrack provide a rare intimacy with the protagonists i am still searching for some copy of the gorgeous soundtrack to german viewers it might be useful to know that the defa dubbing is the only one worth listening to i taped both defa and br but i keep viewing the first one only
<START> singleton has some serious issues he has to come to grips with i get the feeling that he thinks he is pretty smart however this movie is almost comically transparent and self righteous in addition there are a bunch of might makes right messages like when our local nazi jerks get beat up i mean who in their right mind is going to root for a bunch of nazi jerks however he way singleton portrays the fight is downright silly and seems to be designed to show us more the superior fighting qualities of the black protagonists than anything else there is another bad guy in reality a drunken frat boy who rapes one of the movie's protagonists in this instance i think that singleton actually does a nice job portraying what is probably an all too common situation when the woman involved asks the frat boy to use a condom and he either does not have one or does not want to use one in any event he does not accede to her demands that he stop and he proceeds to have intercourse despite her pleas i think that this type of rape is all too common and in fact many uniformed people refuse to accept the fact that it is even a rape well no means no this is a rape which probably occurs a lot in universities across the country br br having established the rape how does singleton deal with it when the frat boy tries to call the woman her roommate refuses to put the victim on the phone at which point the frat boy calls the roommate a black bitch the aggrieved roommate appears to appeal to a counsel of ice cube et al who then proceed to physically humiliate and abuse the frat boy into repeated and prolonged apologies to roommate for his racist remarks however the apparently in singleton's mind lesser crime of rape is not mentioned again no one really should feel sorry for the frat boy however singleton seems to be sending a dual message that a racist comment is a greater offense then rape and in any event violence is justified against jerks br br what is so ultimately so disappointing is that this movie could have truly been about something important but singleton while no doubt a talented director does not appear to have the maturity or depth to pull of something of this magnitude
<START> shame on julia roberts and john cusack they are so talented and should not have had any part in this movie the storyline was dumb and predictable the jokes were not funny the romance was not really romance i was all too happy when this movie ended
<START> this is an excellent film with an extraordinary cast and acting i was very disappointed with the academy awards when this didn't get the oscar for best film and for best actress woopi goldberg it certainly deserved it in any case take a look at it i am sure you will enjoy it very much
<START> witty quirky genuine surreal butterfly wings one could ask what all of these words best describe and some those in fuse with the international film community may quickly say happenstance but others may jump aboard the more american train and immediately yell the butterfly effect strangely i would be one of those screaming for that sci fi kutcher film mainly because none of those words that i initially mentioned at the start of this paragraph accurately depicts the tautou feature that i witnessed sure we all loved her in amelie and thought she was the daughter of jesus in the da vinci code but in this film first time director of a feature film at least laurent firode doesn't give tautou the opportunity to shine sadly he gives nobody the opportunity to really demonstrate themselves because he is too delicately caught up in the moments of random chance to bring this film to anything but just a shimmer never a true boil firode has ample and i use ample as a small word moments throughout this film where he could have built us a fantastical story a genuinely whimsical fairy tale of love and coincidence but instead he fell face first into a mud bucket of chaotic intertwining that overwhelmed us with inconsistent characters and a story that left us gasping for less br br tautou's beautiful face adorns the cover of this box but do not be so taken immediately as i did in assuming that this was going to be another monumental journey into tautou's french cinema tautou is in this film do not get me wrong but one could argue that she is not at the center of this story firode's job is to create a series of random events that eventually will lead to an audience friendly albeit confusing ending which exemplifies that meaning of refreshing melodrama he utterly utterly fails firode fails by giving us the audience too many characters with too many characters he gives us too many random interventions and by the end you don't really care who is who or what is what or how is how your main focus happens to be centered solely on the ending credits and the time destination of their arrival tautou could have saved this film from the disaster it was if only firode would have given her the center alas he did not but attempted to seemingly force a group of 12 through a theoretical film hole about the size of a penny it just didn't work and we were left with a jam in which we were completely stuck br br firode fails because he focus' so intently on the minor details that for one of those rare film occurrences he actually forgets the central focus i can say that there was no defined central focus to happenstance in the beginning he attempts to create one with our two supposed main characters discovering that they share the same birthday and their horoscope promises love by the moonlight but we never go back to that throughout the film instead again we are bombarded with new characters stuffy scenes and meaningless drivel obviously chosen to direct us away from an actual story and more into a world full of ifs ands and buts i couldn't do it i couldn't believe this film writer firode yes the same guy directing this garbage uses a technique so primitive in this film that i immediately felt like ending it immediately he must have been assuming that many of us were incapable of actually following the storyline or the scientific premise because he grabs the aid of a homeless person to actually fill in the respective blanks i didn't need this nor do i think firode needed to belittle his audience in this matter while there were other elements that just didn't seem to work for me at all again felt like a jumbled parisian collage of shredded paper this was the icing on the cake i don't need my hand held through films br br i will give this film one star for credit this is a rather difficult genre to master successfully time travel films are especially hard because of the innumerable amounts of possibilities that are never accounted for but with happenstance it works because firode semi explores the different avenues while i will counter with saying that he does not do it well it did make for at least five full minutes of enjoyment i liked where firode was headed with this film he had a genuinely diagramed story but the final execution just blew this film to shreds firode could have saved this film if he would have strengthened his characters while lightening up his premise and story i think my overall mood of this film would have changed if just these two simple directions were taken oh how i only wish i could time travel back to the production of this film to show firode the errors of his ways br br overall for the first time and probably last this was a tautou film that i must say utterly disappointed me from the choppy opening to the apathetic ending i just felt that happenstance failed due to firode's leadership and horrid marketing marketing is something that i didn't mention before but why would anyone purchase this film thinking that it was an amelie 2 per the title released in hong kong and why would you place tautou squarely on the cover knowing full well that she wasn't carrying this film at all i believe that from the first minute that passed on my dvd player this film was in shambles while i will applaud his subject everything else was well below the level of mediocrity i cannot suggest this film to anyone br br grade out of
<START> i can't see the point in burying a movie like this in sulfuric sarcasm when it is in no way intended to be anything more than a vehicle to entertain children and prepare them for the next line of merchandise to beg madly about br br this is a fun movie my children sat quietly through the entire thing and loved every minute of it granted the villain is a bit over the top with his silly costume and maniacal laugher but this is a lot more easier to take than the dark gloomy and very morbid pokemon 3 br br my children have been watching pokemon since it started and they are soon getting to the ages where they will put off the childish things and move on to others i am glad that we got to enjoy this together
<START> what more can be said i have not been this fascinated with a young actress since cate blanchett burst upon the scene over ten years ago and although both blanchett and blunt have played queens now seems to be the benchmark for up and coming actresses the roles are complete polar opposites br br simply put if you are looking for high passion compelling drama and machiavellian intrigue this is not the movie for you this isn't to say that the script or direction was bad its just that the subject of the film did not lead too dramatic a life when compared to other notable royals like elizabeth i anne boylen henry viii henry v henry ii and elainor of acquitane these are people whose lives were the stuff such as good soap operas are made of and whose policies and decisions altered the course of british and in most cases world history victoria in contrast ascended the throne without incident she quasi governed a nation that was fast becoming a global power due to industrialization and the rise of the navy her state had a stable government led by competent and dynamic politicians and she married young had a harmonious family life the facts of her life are not the sturm und drag such as powerful dramas are made of br br the heart of the film aside from the attempt to dramatize her stultifying upbringing and the machinations surrounding her throne is the story of the one thing that was truly shocking and surprising about her reign a love story marriage made for financial or political reasons is with reason not necessarily the place to look for world shaking passion yet victoria will always be remembered in history as being sort of a patron saint marital fidelity happiness and ideal family life thus central to the film is the budding love of victoria and her prince albert i was very taken with rupert friend's characterization of albert whom he portrayed as a kind patient somewhat earnest and maybe a touch naive young man looking to do good in the world and help in short he is a good man with a good heart not the most dynamic figure to base a drama around but as that is not the point of the story that does not matter the heart of the character shines through thanks to friend's understated yet earnest performance br br as for the queen well emily blunt is sublime her beauty cannot be denied but she is more than something pretty to look at her face is like quicksilver because of her expressiveness the slightest arch of the eyebrow glance of the eye or slight wry smile delivers so much again this is not a bombastic performance of heavy speeches and impassioned pleas its not that kind of movie but what ms blunt does do with the role is show the simple humanity of the character with potent subtlety br br for example we see the joie de vivre that has been kept in check by victoria's mother miranda richardson and her scheming adviser lover conroy expressed in the simple things like victoria trying to sketch her dog we see her delight and fascination upon first meeting albert by her eyes being continually drawn to him we see her nervous and overwhelmed when addressing parliament upon her ascension and my favorite scene of all in the film we see her nervous happy and hopeful as she steels herself to do what really most women never have to do in their life ask the man she loves to marry her a proposition so ridiculous for those times and some would say now that victoria bursts out in nervous laughter before she can even say marry me again this is not a movie for over the top larger than life expressions but more a study in the subtleties of a character and making the little things say so much br br so overall i judge the film by what it is and what it tried to do and as such i give it a 7 i felt that some of the politics could be better explained and that some very fine actors were wasted with little do and little character development namely miranda richardson as the duchess of kent and the characters of conroy and lord peal again the film need not have spent a large amount of time on those characters but a little more exposition would have helped to explain the political environment also i would have loved to have seen more of the adjustment to married life between victoria and albert but that may be just my greed for more scenes between friend and blunt br br in summary don't view this film in terms of a historical drama but for what it really is a love story between two characters that happen to be historical figures i give this film a solid 7 for wonderful lead performances brilliant costumes and scenery and the magnificent victoria of emily blunt and anyone who has any shred of romance left in them you will be touched by the end of this movie god save the queen
<START> before cujo there was lucky the devil dog in 1978 on halloween night the movie devil dog the hound of hell premiered a story of a family getting a new puppy from a farmer who just happen to be in the neighborhood selling fruits and vegetables because their dog skipper was killed coencidence everyone loves the new dog but there is something strange about him br br it isn't long until the father mike barry richard crenna first blood starts to notice his wife betty yvette mimieux where the boys are jackson county jail snowbeast is different and his kids charlie and bonnie ike eisenman witch mountain and fantastic vourage and kim richards witch mountain nanny and the professor hello larry tuff turf also have changed does the dog have something to do with it he's determined to find out and do whatever it takes to save his family br br this movie is great because it has ike and kim playing a darker side of themselves than what we saw on those witch mountain movies this is one of the many 70's made for tv horror movies that was actually scary for a made for tv horror movie the music was creepy and even the ending which i won't tell made you think br br this movie also stars ken kercheval cliff barnes of dallas and r g armstrong who couldn't stay away from devil movies remember race with the devil br br it's worth watching
<START> i've seen the blob several times and is one of the better low budget alien invasion movies from the 1950's br br a strange meteor lands just outside a small town and an elderly man goes to investigate this a strange jelly like substance then attaches itself to one of his arms and a young couple who saw the meteor land arrive in time and take him to the local doctor's where the old man then gets completely absorbed by the mass the doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass is getting bigger when these incidents are reported to the police they don't believe the young couple and accuse them of making all this up they finally believe them when the mass now huge turns up in the town's cinema and everybody runs into the streets screaming it then attaches itself on a diner with the young couple and some others inside the blob is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers at it and it freezes which is its weakness it is then transported by plane to the frozen wastes of the arctic and disposed of there but it is only frozen not dead br br this movie has a typical setting for its period teenagers and a small town the blob has a good rock and roll style theme song at the beginning and the movie is atmospheric throughout br br the sequel beware the blob followed in 1972 and a remake came in 1988 but this is the best of the blob movies br br the cast is lead by steve mcqueen the great escape and is the movie that made him a star and aneta corsaut plays his girlfriend i'm not familiar with any of the other stars br br the blob is a must see for all sci fi fans fantastic br br rating 4 stars out of 5

<START> rating 21 by the film snob see our blog what to see next for details on our rating system br br here's a movie that will have you clawing at your own face in an attempt to earn release from the on screen tedium br br you'll not be wringing your hands nor rolling your eyes nor sighing into your popcorn no indeed for a movie of this averagousity only clawing at your own face will do br br when you begin to claw your own face as begin you must start in at the lower portion you'll need your upper portion with its handy tear ducts intact for the truly tear jerking third act which may bring you to your knees if you haven't clawed your way clear of the entire theatre by then br br in a season celebrating joe six pack and hockey moms as the new gold standard for leadership and foreign diplomacy permaybe a movie this tedium will be welcomed as a thing that anyone could create watching it however is a much more dangerous undertaking br br here's our story br br sidney young the london publisher of a fourth tier celebrity entertainment magazine is just about to see his magazine go under he needs a miracle and what he gets is a phone call from new york city in the usa br br the publisher of sharp's magazine clayton harding played by jeff bridges says come work for me with his own employees carrying out the fax machine out of his apartment office in the background saying yes is a no brainer br br soon sidney is at work in new york city doing allllllll the wrong things his interviews consist of asking broadway musical directors if they are 1 jewish and 2 gay br br he kills the pet dog of sohpie maes the industry's hottest movie star when she leaves it in the magazine's offices during a business luncheon br br this is a spot of bad luck for everyone for among other things sidney imagines that he is in love with maes before he wakes up to the dunst character br br worst of all he totally alienates alison olsen played by winsome scripting confusion by kristen dunst a colleague assigned to show him the ropes of the magazine and the big apple we have of course been to a movie before and so we know how this relationship is going to end up this is therefore why we'll need intact tear ducts for the movie's third act br br the problem with the thing is the script just never jells excepting for the one tear duct set piece in which true love prevails br br publisher harding is supposed to be a son of a bitch who also wants to just throw the whole job over the script never comes down firmly on one or the other sides of this dichotomy however and bridges is left to twist and waffle in the breeze br br alison olsen is supposed to despise sidney young but whenever he comes up to her as he does constantly she makes a point of engaging him in conversation instead of attempting to discourage his existence br br the comedy of early scenes is built around a piglet destroying an expensive hotel room and then taking the elevator downstairs to urinate on the expensive high heels of a celebrity at a cocktail reception br br the hot starlet maes confesses that she is attracted to young because he is wounded the character never shows us why he is wounded however this is yet another resultant of the movie's mortally wounded script br br at one hours and fifty minutes this thing feels longer and more deadly than napoleon's retreat from moscow it is uninspiring unfunny unredeemable and not even rentable run away
<START> we rented the dvd hoping for a good western the film was pretty and the scenes reasonable but the ideas were very bad here are my problems with the film br br in the first part why exactly did the bad guy kill the mine owner not really connected to the movie except to establish how bad he was and to have a hideout br br the bank employee gone bad just acts too poorly to convincingly decide to hire killers to off his employers at least keep us guessing no character developed at all for the bank owners or the bank employee br br very long delay in much of anything happening br br absurd premise that martin still needed to see the judge after the gang confessed to killing the in laws even more absurd that he confesses to judge and judge will not listen to the sheriff guy even more ridiculous that martin his hung and rope breaks then the sheriff takes him at gunpoint to finally head back to his town and save his wife from the bad bank employee wouldn't he just return after the quick dispatch of the gang to save wife and arrest bad bank guy just send the judge a note that gang confessed before being killed on trail overall very sad acting and no point to movie
<START> quirky independent theatrical christian slater these are all teasers that made me look forward to spending an hour or so discovering a jewel of a film boy was i disappointed julian po never gets over itself the film is relentlessly self conscious i found myself unable to suspend disbelief for even a moment the overdone obviously theatrical sets the overdone obviously theatrical acting the overdone obviously theatrical directing well you get the idea br br allegories do not need to be delivered sledge hammer style and it's hard to feel much of anything for julian po because we never know much about him the ridiculous girlfriend the annoying townsfolk the idiotic clergyman the bratty kids why would anyone particularly anyone with a life long ambition to get to the seaside slater's character decide to stay in such a dismal place
<START> another excellent arnold movie this futuristic movie has great action in it and is one of arnie's best movies arnold is framed as a bad guy in this movie and plays a game of death this movie is excellent and a great sci fi action movie i've always liked this movie and it has to be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time 10 out of 10 perfection
<START> this movie consists of such great emotion especially with its outstanding soundtrack that coincides with the film tom cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm to make films and to entertain this movie was not the best the first time i watched it but after about 3 more times i decided that this is one of the best films that i have ever seen it takes place in new york and progresses on through his lifestyle he discovers a delimma in his life with his girlfriend diaz he goes through a state of depression and then an outgoing blend of imagination this film was beyond my expectations and is one of cruise's best films ever
<START> iq is a cute romantic comedy featuring two great actors that seem to click well on screen plot is a typical guy wrong for girl guy gets girl format but makes the solid point that one must love with the heart and not the the mind addition of albert einstein and his band of geniuses provides excellent comic relief overall a good movie not great but good
<START> david h steinberg 's script seemed initially having some real smart points that could've made good romantic comedy but but but oh dear what did ever happen in the way br br i'll tell you what happened originally it's animal house 1978 and porky's 1982 although that was long time ago but those are the pioneers the godfathers of the new genre the crude teen comedy then the 1990s came after important instances that became smash hits repulsive ones am i add such as problem child 1990 dumb and dumber 1994 the nutty professor 1996 and there's something about mary 1998 which i think slackers is affected by there was the top of the era and the prophet of the next era the one and only american pie 1999 which's undoubtedly and incomparably a genre's icon after that i think every comedy of that kind got to be that highly filthy cum laude nasty to be admired by the youth otherwise it might be out of fashion br br i believe that slackers had a smart plot first as a script then its makers got to add some real big amount of rudeness filthiness strangely shameless sex to be made at those days as easy as pie like they had to fill every scene with freely elements such as masturbation oral sex urination etc just to look a la' mode they're wholly unnecessary elements to the story but surely they are so necessary to make the profits and to catch the latest vogue in making teen comedies the problem is in how all of that has replaced already any possible comedy in it br br some of its moments looked literally horrible and that as you see is the point it's all in jason schwartzman 's looks and performance memorably disgusting to the utmost so the ambition transformed from being that romantic comedy into making what wasn't done before of pure skinning images to be more like a horror where you're asking all the time what nastier would happen vomiting farting etc these are the easiest combination to create a comedy nowadays br br though even if you hated it you've got to love something mostly for being bold for me it was only gina gershon cameo's scene anyhow they designed it as a whole to achieve being outrages for outrageousness like an adolescent's naughty dream though the majority of it was near to anybody's nightmare br br what made me sad is that this one at its core was a real potential work and not another cheap another stupid comedy as it eventually managed to be remember well the details of stealing the exam the first 2 minutes so the movie's main plot weirdo trying to reach a girl by blackmailing cool guys through the pattern of boy loves girl and girl loves another boy because save that it's nothing but a candidly schlock it dealt with its material the tacky way bunch of dirty college boys who got nothing to do but making mawkish quip out of anything would do it ended up as being and i'm sorry to say it a smiling sh t br br at its end it said something can you imagine about how it's the time and the place too for the impostor or the slack to win totally like this comedy itself it sounds good ending yet for totally another better movie which could assure my opinion about this one as smart one once and it doesn't need much to understand that this movie's makers were the real slackers maybe being stupid is a way to be smart in hollywood but even if the final result here wasn't at least witty by any sense of the word br br p s its scriptwriter david h steinberg who wrote the story of american pie 2 as well has a main page at the imdb where you'll find under the additional details his usual plot keywords which are sex vulgarity crude humor they just forgot to write urineing while showering or baring 70 year old women
<START> this is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the cameroon the sisters in law are female lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully prosecuted husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a muslim council it is rather long about two hours but fascinating in terms both of the individual plaintiffs and defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court rooms presided over by female judges it will leave you as it left me with many questions about exactly how this change occurred how and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the cameroon have the several cases featured in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their spouses was the granting of a divorce by a muslim court against the express wishes of the husband a one time event i'm not suggesting that the film makers could have answered these questions they made the movie two years ago not yesterday and the movie they made deserves a wide audience
