<START> contains spoilers br br i did not like this movie at all br br i found it amazingly boring and rather superficially made irrespective of the importance and depth of the proposed themes given that eventually we have to die how should we approach life in a light way like tomas in a heavy way like tereza or should we find ways not to face that question like sabina how much is fidelity important in a relationship how much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones how much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our country br br unfortunately i haven't read kundera's novel but after having being let down by the movie i certainly will i want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation which is my guess or if it was dull from the beginning br br i disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece i simply don't see the reasons why what i see are many flaws and a sample of them follows br br 1 the three main characters are thrown at you and it's very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices br br 2 the secondary characters are there just to fill the gaps but they don't add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary br br 3 i did not like how tomas was impersonated nothing is good for him he is so self centered and selfish he is not human in some sense but when his self confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone i did not find the interpretation credible br br 4 it's very unlikely that an artist like sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968 on top of that the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions which sounds strange to me a how can tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer b how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed br br 5 the fake accents of the english spoken by the actors are laughable and i am not even mother tongue moreover the letter that sabina receives while in the us is written in czech which i found very inconsistent br br 6 many comments praised the movie saying that prague was beautifully rendered i guess that most of the movie was shot on location so it's not difficult to give the movie a eastern european feeling and given the intrinsic beauty of prague is not even difficult to make it look good br br 7 i found the ending sort of trivial tereza and tomas finally happy in the countryside far away from the temptations of the metropoly distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living detached from their professional lives die in a car accident but they die after having realized that they are happy indeed so what had they died unhappy would the message of the movie have been different i don't think so i considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience br br 8 the only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters you see them for almost three hours but in the end you are left with nothing you don't feel empathy you don't relate to them you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say br br 9 i hated the stop the music in the restaurant scene which some comments praised a lot why sabina has got such a strong reaction why franz agrees with her i really don't see the point the only thing you learn is that sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality that's it what's so special and unique about it br br after all these negative comments let me point tout that there are two scenes that i liked a lot that's why i gave it a two br br the naked women photoshoot where the envy the jealousy and the insecurities of sabina and tereza are beautifully presented br br the other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of prague by the russians tereza pictures taken to let the world know about what is going on in prague are used to identify the people taking part to the riots i found it quite original and tereza's sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayed br br finally there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally designed in such a way that tomas types are going to like it and tereza ones are going to hate it if this is the case i strongly doubt it though then my comment should be revised drastically
<START> i just read the comments of tomreynolds2004 and feel i have to jump in here i understand he doesn't like the film but his reasons are not evident my feeling regarding this film is that it is not afraid to travel the darker roads of loneliness failure disappointment and sorrow each of these two people as portrayed have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire sentimental and sappy i really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances i have every reason to dislike jane fonda for her vietnam era actions but personal feelings apart she is fabulous in this role robert deniro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities this is the first i have seen deniro using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and i really like it this film was a big surprise when i first viewed it and i look forward to seeing it again
<START> five across the eyes ain't worth one off the wrist i must admit at one point i was really worried for about 30 seconds nobody made a noise and i thought my speakers had blown or that i had gone deaf with the constant screaming and high pitch yelling me and the speakers are ok now thanks for asking funnily enough that was the best bit of the film br br i won't waste your time telling you the plot read the other comments for that br br if you have bought this dvd but not yet unwrapped it don't take it back and demand your money back i've wasted mine don't do the same br br i was actually shouting at the telly they're over here in the car look for the camera lights and get the camera man first i have left the swear words out but you can guess where they go br br if anybody would like to buy this film it's really good it's yours for a ten quid
<START> i caught sorrows lost at the new york film and video festival and i guess i had some high hopes for this film sadly this is just another visual fx calling card the story is pretty lame the bad lighting and camera work along with the less than great editing and music all make the film seem low quality br br is it really too much to ask that fx shorts have better stories and have the rest of the technical production be on par with the fx you can't just get away with cool fx in shorts anymore it's been 5 years since 405 made a big splash at least that short quick cool and was even a little funny none of that can be said about sorrows lost
<START> i am decidedly not in the target audience for this film i am a man nearly 50 who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film this happened quite by accident with the discovery of a movie called clerks late one night on television the first two things i noticed about that film were that it was 1 technically amateurish and 2 brilliantly written when i read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was clerks i started to get interesting when he said his main influence was the station agent a movie i'd seen on dvd a week prior i decided i had to go and check it out the result could be described along the same lines as clerks although the two films are nothing alike content wise both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing whereas clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation less like me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy he's always running one way or another filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones the themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant i can tell from watching it that not much has changed since i was growing up young men still have the same problems they always have the writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular crafts wonderfully honest characters and has them do completely believable things as far as indie cinema goes this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint but from an artistic one it is very close
<START> i'm embarrassed to be writing this review i say that because those of you reading it will know that i sat through the whole thing and that is embarrassing to admit even to strangers but i just had to warn those who read the viewer comments on imdb before they watch a film not to watch this one it's the least i can do this is a bad movie trust me the plot is goofy the acting is amateurish and the directing camera work sets costumes etc are all second rate let it go
<START> ruth gordon is one of the more sympathetic killers that columbo has ever had to deal with and the plot is ingenious all the way around this is one of the best columbo episodes ever mariette hartley and g d spradlin are excellent in their supporting roles and peter falk delivers a little something extra in his scenes with gordon
<START> this movie rates as one of my all time favourite top 10 movies many people seeing it for the first time and knowing little about many of the themes in the movie probably won't understand why i find it so enthralling so i will try to explain br br the movie is very rich in historical detail and cultural insights and while it has a few minor anachronisms they are completely forgivable the story is a retelling of the famous duel between the monk benkei and the young prince yoshitsune on gojo bridge during the fight according to legend yoshitsune bests benkei and the monk becomes the prince's loyal retainer this movie is a revision of that story however and involves war dark prophecy and political maneuvering br br one of the main themes in the movie is mappo which is the prophecy by the buddha that after 1000 years his teachings would fail and the world would fall into chaos it was believed in heian japan after the eruption of mt fuji and the civil war between the taira heike and the minamoto genji that the world would fall into anarchy and everything would collapse it is a time of demons br br next you have the way in which the movie resolves the issue of yoshitsune's sword training by the tenku raven goblins of karuma defeated clans often escaped into the mountains and disguised themselves as demons to scare the locals off this is said to be where ninja clans began historically yoshitsune's depiction in gojo nicely accommodates all of this br br then there is benkei and the various strains of buddhism depicted including a lot of esoteric buddhism of the shingon sect these are all depicted quite accurately and just to add a little extra the movie manages to convey the power of meditation and ki energy in a way that makes it integral to the story i e it uses magic realism to add an extra dimension to the film but does it in such a way as to make it tactical and menacing br br all in all it is filled with fascinating tidbits and rings surprisingly true to life for the period the scenery and the costuming are also completely unmissable and very authentic the soundtrack is great very brooding and ominous i also thought that the actual acting performances were surprisingly good benkei is a great brooding anti hero shanao yoshitsune is depicted as a young man testing his limits and growing increasingly drunk on his own power and tetsukichi the scavenging sword smith makes for and interesting depiction of the common man and his less than flattering opinion of the killers who fancy themselves his social betters br br as to the plot to see why it is so good i really suggest you dig up an old book on japanese history and see how this retelling turns an almost lighthearted robin hood vs little john story into a gory tale of intrigue violence and infernal karma
<START> the comparison to sleuth the earlier stage play turned film is obvious and upon my first viewing i too thought sleuth was better but deathtrap has at least for me many more repeat viewings in it than sleuth br br i purchased deathrap in the bargain bin at wal mart figuring that it had caine and the underrated reeve and was worth the 6 bucks it was one of the finest dvd purchases i could've picked up br br it's one of those best kept secrets that movie buffs always are always delighted to discover and it's totally worth repeat viewings br br though laurence olivier and michael caine turned in bravado performances in sleuth i was doubly impressed with christopher reeve as clifford anderson reeve rightfully associated with his now legendary portrayal of superman stole the show in what should've been an oscar worthy performance i've always felt reeve was a type cast actor who didn't get much of a chance to shine outside of the superman films and a few other flawed but entertaining films like somewhere in time but this film shows that his potential was truly tapped and put to use thank goodness br br i absolutely relished michael caine's performance he was glib deliciously manipulative and sadistic and watching him work with reeve and dyan cannon was an absolute pleasure in fact it was thanks to this movie that i got into a michael caine phase and started renting as much of his stuff as humanly possible br br as for deathtrap there's enough juicy dialogue in here to fill up its memorable quotes section unfortunately much of the dialogue would inherently spoil the immensely entertaining plot br br it's really really hard to talk about the movie without spoiling important plot points that are infinitely more fun to discover on your own needless to say it's a must see but for me it was the greatest and most rewarding blind purchase of all time br br repeat viewings are a must br br and it deserves to sit alongside sleuth on your dvd shelf br br i'll leave you with this beautifully written quote from the film i wonder if it wouldn't be well just a trifle starry eyed of me to enter into such a risky and exciting collaboration where i could count on no sense of moral obligation whatsoever
<START> i have zero interest rap and in ghetto culture i'm white and like classic rock however that did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy its pretty much a sequel of this is spinal tap in the sense that it is the same movie just about rap instead or rock yet it's hilarious there are many funny jokes but not without a few jokes that just fall flat the characters are all very funny and believable i watched just because it made me laugh at 3 a m and any movie that can do that warrants at least a test screening one of the reasons why this movies was so funny was that it makes fun of rap from a different rap today is concerned with the wrong things and get by with studio noise and little talent this movie comes from a time where rappers deserved more credit overall it's a funny movie with many jokes about racism sex and music culture among the more obvious themes of humor this is highly recommend for any fan of this is spinal tap they are essentially the same movie just about different worlds and yes the same jokes work in both movies
<START> i am a huge huge fan of john cusack samuel l jackson and tony shalhoub i'm slightly less fond of stephen king but i like some of his work br br this said i should have loved 1408 br br possible spoilers after this point br br i walked in eager i walked out disappointed br br this is not the fault of the actors shalhoub and jackson both have very small roles because the premise of the movie puts cusack in the guy in a locked room scenario br br this wasn't a bad movie but i can't call it a good one either it was a muddied mess that had moments of ouch that's just wrong combined with moments of ouch that's just painful and moments of oh now that's just unfortunate with very little continuity connectivity between them eislin's father shows up once and there's no seeming connection to the rest of mike's personal life that we see displayed while he tries to survive the room br br a previous commenter described the olin enslin argument as worth watching and i very much agree but other than that aside from some clever musical cues the room almost playfully torments enslin a little bit and gives him one chance to get out before upping the ante at which point it gives him the one hour countdown clock and the titular line from the carpenters we've only just begun it's mostly stuff jumps out at you when you least expect it type horror that was fun when i was fourteen and surrounded by friends my age clutching each other in the summer while jason stalked camp crystal lake br br the rest of the movie was let's make him relive some of his most painful experiences mindgaming with let's animate the paintings in creepy ways clichÃ© cheesiness br br end spoilers br br i expected better from this movie with stephen king's name attached to it as well as the actors i mentioned above br br we never find out the origin of the evil we never get to see the evil defeated though we can presume maybe it was defeated br br and the ending was just a jarring what moment br br wait for it to come on cable i wouldn't have minded paying for it as a matinÃ©e but i'm feeling a bit shortchanged for having paid opening night prices for it
<START> the 1997 low key indie dramedy henry fool would seemingly have been a secure choice of movies no one would bother to revisit for a sequel a rumpled dissipated drifter thomas jay ryan strolls into town his anarchistic rantings and delusions inspire a nerdy garbage collector james urbaniak to write poems while henry half heartedly tries to boink the guy's sister parker posey as the poet prospers henry declines nothing special about any of the characters or the story a pitch for harold and maude's ghost would have been quoted higher odds of ever making it to a screen br br but parker posey ain't the semi official queen of the indies for nothing' so when writer director hal hartley came up with a new incarnation for his cast a film was born though we catch up with the same characters many years they're in a completely different sort of dark comedy this one's laced with espionage henry may have been an international spy and possible double or even triple agent for years before meeting the others he's either dead or in hiding from agents and authorities of many countries everyone wants his rambling incoherent journal which just may contain coded secrets that could destabilize nations and economies posey's fay is either the wife he left to go on the lam or his widow depending on who's telling the truth fay's efforts to find henry and or the hotly contested journals include a globe trotting gauntlet of multinational hit persons and henchmen at every turn she never knows who to believe or trust nor do we br br while herding these unlikely characters into jason bourne jack ryan territory hartley's script retains the ironic deadpan humor of their first appearance steering clear of slapstick in exposing them to physical menaces his sly lampoon of the paranoia duplicity and musical chairs alliances of today's geopolitics starts to crumble towards the end even so fans of the first movie will be pleasantly surprised by the novelty of hartley's recycling methods 5 18 07
<START> the best thing i can say about this film is that it is well paced it did not fall flat the next best things are the supporting performances by the actor playing foppish groom to be edward the always marvelous holland taylor and the actor playing taylor's husband the actor helping to critique messing's potential outfits in an early scene brings a delightful absurd yet winning quality to the proceedings okay that's about it on the positive side br br dermot mulroney whom i adore is far more believable expressing contempt for messing than in any scene where he's attempting to be either businesslike or supporting as others noted he appears to have no emotional investment in this enterprise other than wrapping it up as quickly as possible messing on the other hand sincerely tries to carry the film and to create the illusion of chemistry with mulroney she is adequate doing so but is simply not strong enough an actress to pull all of this off without help give her an e for effort and a c for achievement given mulroney's indifference the one thing that could've helped messing would have been a brilliantly cavalier irons esquire performance from the actor playing her ex fiancÃ© jeffrey instead his performance is weak kneed mewling and feckless br br if i tried to analyze this one any further i'd obviously be paying more attention than most of the people involved it's harmless enough to pass time if you have nothing else to do and less obnoxious and less creative than the wedding singer but you're much better off watching my best friend's wedding again
<START> fulci experiments with sci fi and fails usually in his non horror films we still get sum great gore but not here sum very funny scenes like when the prisinors are forced to hold onto a bar for 12 minutes and if they drop they are electecuted the guy falls and and has some kind of fit on the floor for about two minutes until his friends who were struggling to hold on anyway lift him off the floor the city is an obvious model but not a bad one and the end explosion is at best laughable and dont get me started on the terrible battle scenes br br 4 10
<START> at first i thought the ring would be a more than normal movie with it's ordinary plot how surprised was i of course the plot is simple one girl is in love with two men but hitchcock brings it to us on a silver platter with laughter and fear with compassion and anguish the way he depicts the popular crowds of the fair the strength of the attraction of the girl to both men the tragic elements that come together with techniques that open the mind to most of his greatest movies north by northwest the rope etc the master did it great even before his thirties
<START> on one level this film can bring out the child in us that just wants to build sandcastles and throw stuff in the air just for the sake of seeing it fall down again on a deeper level though it explores a profound desire to reconnect with the land i thoroughly empathized with the artist when he said when i'm not out here alone for any length of time i feel unrooted br br i considered andy goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists i'm familiar with his works mainly through his coffee table books and a couple art gallery installations but to see his work in motion captured perfectly through riedelsheimer's lens was a revelation unfrozen in time goldsworthy's creations come alive swirling flying dissolving crumbling crashing br br and that's precisely what he's all about time the process of creation and destruction of emergence and disappearing of coming out of the void and becoming the universe and back again there's a shamanic quality about him verging on madness you get the feeling watching him at work that his art is a lifeforce for him that if he didn't do it he would whither and perish br br luckily for us goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography otherwise with the exception of a few cairns and walls they would only exist for one person
<START> this is an action western james steart leads an all star cast in the scenic northwest which is filmed in great splendor the scenery and costumes are great there is action and adventure stewart plays a wealthy cattleman who runs afoul of a crooked government in the old nothwest br br the main drawback is the stereotypical cynic that hollywood has always made into a hero even when this movie was made the cynic was the stereotypical hero and the one stewart portrays really has few saving graces he is kind to his two partners and that does give him an extra dimension of credibility and likability br br however he is so piggish to everyone else it is hard to really care for him or to accept him he is much like the one dimensional spaghetti western characters cut not that bad br br still the minor characters are quite enjoyable walter brennan royal dano harry morgan and others make this worth watching
<START> i read the negative comments before viewing this film and undeterred went ahead and started watching i admit that i had to rewind quite a few times as the film is incredibly complex involved and full of detail that is a good thing but also quite unexpected in this culture of car chases explosions gratuitous sex and general violence that substitute for plot and character development in fact what a welcome departure however i am so used to not paying a lot of attention to what i watch br br this film is chock full of character development and plot line the kind that we used to analyze when i was in high school it requires actual mental participation on the part of the viewer what a nice change i would compare it to 'all the president's men' in terms of generic subject matter that is it is a mystery about intense misconduct on the part of elected officials and those with enough influence upon officials to essentially 'own' them br br unlike 'all the president's men' this film makes an effort to give a couple of the characters actual personality in this sense the movie is a character study like 'the negotiatior' with samuel jackson and kevin spacey in that movie their characters are both city employees and the plot is extremely intense yet the plot is dependent on the ability of their characters to cooperate with each other trust each and ultimately unite together against the corrupt police department there is more gun fire in this film and the specific plot is different but generically there are many similarities br br i will say that city hall requires a whole lot more concentration in fact i was struck how parallel it was to past and present political scandals i've seen in my life going back to watergate the thing is the public knows that something is wrong for sure but following the details is hard to do this movie is not even close to being as complex as real life but it actually is realistic to life in its complexity i think that is one of the reasons that previous posters have criticized the film unrealistic expectations br br if one watches this knowing what they are about to see and are up to the experience it really is excellent i watched it 3 times in a row the acting is superb and the directing is flawless the weakest link is john cusak's accent
<START> i saw this in theaters and absolutely adored it geoffery rush gave the best performance as a super villain that i have ever seen since gene hackman as lex luther kel mitchel and paul rubens were a match maid in heaven this film also introduced me to william h macy who is now one of my favorite actors hank was great as the blue raja and i especially loved that the character wasn't really british the scene with him and telling his mom that he was a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes i loved the fact that the bowler talked to the ball some of the funniest stuff involved stiller and his character mr furious's false rage and the fact that his threats and one liners were all gibberish and that they never made any sense i could barely stop myself from applauding when he said fraculater freinken puss was said but one of the things i most enjoyed was that captain amazing actually dies in the movie i highly recommend this film for any occasion and i give it my own personal two thumbs up
<START> while i have never been a fan of the original scooby doo due to its horrid production values it appears like shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by hanna barbera without a doubt scrappy doo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children and this includes the teletubbies as well as tommy the tapeworm whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the scooby doo characters with it whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show i think death is preferable the bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny annoying and grates on the nerves and this is only in the better episodes after many years it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess i can see why in the live action scooby doo movie they made the villain scrappy doo since practically everyone hates him
