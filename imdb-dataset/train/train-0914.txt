<START> within the first few minutes of this dutch thriller we learn that krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps sans underwear fantasizes about murdering his roommate tries to steal a magazine from a news stand and lusts after a studly young man he meets at the train station and he's the hero of this nonsensical movie that is all dressed up except for krabbe in at least one scene too many but has nowhere to go the basic plot is very simple but is dragged out to nearly two hours before reaching a pointless conclusion verhoeven has a nice visual flair but resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations overt symbolism and gratuitous gore when he runs out of ideas
<START> one of those el cheapo action adventures of the early 1980s that used to fill video rental stores solely to be taken out by adolescent boys in the hope of a cheap thrill br br woeful down market attempt to cash in on the death wish phenomenon by substituting a moderately attractive woman for the visually challenging bronson acting is terrible sets are cheap the baddies are well bad identification with any of the characters is unlikely br br only redeeming feature is modest amount of gratuitous female nudity a smattering of which is full frontal other than that you can leave it
<START> i think lion king 1 1 2 is one of the best sequels ever as if not the best out of the three lion king movies in the movie timon and pumbaa tell us where they came from and having trouble fitting in with others such as timon having trouble digging tunnels with other meercats timon and pumbaa journey off into finding their dream place and find it and soon find it and also simba who they raise but soon they must choose between their dream place or helping simba face his evil uncle scar and proclaim his right as the lion king of pride rock filled with wonderful new characters like timon's ma julie kavner and uncle max jerry stiller i think my favorite character was uncle max because he was very funney and was voiced by a funney comedian jerry stiller the father of ben stiller disney was smart to cast stiller in that role filled with wonderful characters animation and story and music lion king 1 1 2 is in my opinion the best of any sequel and better than simba's pride even though i will admit i really did like that one too lion king 1 1 2 is a great disney sequel the whole family can enjoy it's got a good story and is very funney 10 out of 10
<START> as has been well documented by previous posters the real stars of rockstar inxs and indeed it's sequel rockstar supernova are paul mirkovich rafael moreira jim mcgorman nate morton and sasha krivtsov don't know who they are they are the awesome tight rockin' house band whose music savvy and talent made this show something more than a sad american idol clone br br remember the strings night that was musical precision and perfection if ever i've seen it suzie mcneil's epic rendition of queen's 'bohemian rhapsody' ty taylor's memorable cover of the stones' 'you can't always get ' jd fortune singing suspicious minds the common denominator here is the awesome house band br br as good as inxs were in their prime they are sadly a shadow of their former selves though jd's live performance has somewhat breathed new life into their music this show is all about the hb br br memo to producers season three if we're blessed enough to have it happen should be rockstar house band get those boys a good lead singer and they are going places
<START> i didn't expect much from this film but oh brother what a stinker br br i found this gem in a giant crate of awful 5 dvd's at walmart where else as cheap as this disc was i feel ripped off the special effects had a high school look to them the camera work marred by wobbly tripods and sketchy lighting and the acting was a perfect example of the 'christian school' one can imagine the long and exhausting 'prayer meetings' by the production company after seeing the rushes come back the people who bankrolled this thing must have had seriously anti biblical feelings towards the inept production company that cranked this thing out think of their anguish as they saw their 914 86 investment go up in smoke br br someone asked why christian movies are so bad perhaps the xian film makers need to look at good movies and attempt to copy some of the things that make them so good believable stories and characters less hysterical arm waving and fanaticism oh and a story that appeals to everyone not just true believers i e stop the sermon save it for church take the omen or prophesy series for example excellent films with compelling story lines great cinematography and intense music no hysterical arm waving no preaching br br if this film had a laugh track it would have been much better
<START> truly a disgusting vile film with only a small amount of real humour br br the character of the father in particular is vulgar in the extreme intentionally so obviously and portrayed in the most pathetic seedy manner br br my wife and i found this film horribly upsetting with absolutely no redeeming features at all frankly i wish i had never seen it br br i consider this british effort to be a sick and gross embarrassment br br those who enjoyed this film have an ability i totally lack that of rejoicing in a display of deep depravity and squalor br br the producers should be ashamed of themselves
<START> it is wonderful to watch roshan seth the strict father in 1992 mississippi masala who once again takes on the role of a father and head of the family and more in such a long journey set in 1971 bombay india besides the closely knit family settings subject matters include the lost and found of a friendship the unexpected death of a friend somehow the calm smiling face of a friend in death in the presence of prayers felt peaceful so gustad noble roshan's character similarly noted a sidewalk artist's chain of events the wall as a latrine turned into a shrineÂshrine into rumbles and ashes was at once prophetic and philosophical it's packed full of life lessons in different aspects of varying relationships between father and son mother and son father and little daughter little daughter and father and mother longtime colleagues long lost dear friends even that of a man to man one whose an innocent slow witted fool br br in spite of the tone of the film's era it's a colorful film rich in substance and the strength of the story in textural layers with humor and suspense for a director who is not indian sturla gunnarsson being icelandic he's made a political indian pakistani film he gets into the bone marrow of the life of this parsi portrayed by roshan seth whose performance has such nuances subtlety and joy there is singing too the rest of the cast is equally strong from om puri the mysterious friend of a friend soni razdan the enduring wife vrajesh hirjee the argumentative eldest son sam dastor the longtime office mate ranjit chowdhry the pavement artist to a superstitious witch woman of a neighbor an unbeguiling fool of a man and a long lost bosom friend it's a world of many faces and perspectives director gunnarsson has demonstrated sensitivity in the treatment of that time period and subject was well researched with attention to details he has the good fortune to have sooni taraporevala 1992 mississippi masala 1988 salaam bombay wrote the script this is truly a worthwhile journey of a film to partake br br along the lines of cultural exploration road movie style fridrik thor fridriksson 1994 cold fever is an icelandic sojourn about a japanese young man who went across the globe in search of the specific spot to pay his last respects to his parents dutifully following memorial rituals for the dead such demonstrated reverence and cross cultural attention to family ties are heart warming in this day and cyber age
<START> i agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film i found it incredibly silly at best and downright misleading misinforming and harmful at worst like others i found this film to be an awful mix of real science and pseudoscientific new age propaganda br br as a psychologist i was especially offended by candace pert's contributions true i was not a fan of hers before this film but her discourse on the consciousness of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term consciousness that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than clarify it is an old orwellian mind f k that the master himself described so well in his superb essay politics and the english language to refer to consciousness in this manner indeed to refer to this film as based in science in general which is its clear intent is to use language in the same manner employed by stalin when he labeled his slave states democratic republics and hitler when he called his party a socialist workers movement br br i don't claim to really understand quantum physics i know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study ah but we americans do love instant enlightenment and that's what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish if it asked questions that would be one thing but it clearly attempts to ask and answer them which no film could possibly do simply because we are far far away from the answers if they indeed exist br br by the way ethically this film needed a disclaimer about the association of several expert commentators with the maharishi mahesh yogi and tm not to mention j z knight who often speaks in her ramtha voice i'm always amazed at this channeled 10 000 year old atlantean superman's grasp of 21st century concepts and terminology but then again this film argues that the past present and future are all one and the same so if ramtha existed in atlantis 10 000 years ago i suppose he could exist now and tomorrow only then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers oh i forgot i'm the creator of good and bad advice so it's all my fault not ramtha's br br what a mess
<START> this is a bit of a puzzle for a lot of the artsy lynch crowd they tend to try to write this off as some kind of meaningless crude side project of lynch's like this is lynch passing gas between his real pieces of film art well it may be a fart but its one of those intriguing farts that you catch of a whiff of and are embarrassed to admit you enjoy br br dumbland distilled down beyond this is art what can you do with aspects of modern life but laugh at it if you took it seriously you would go nuts you hook into it smell it taste it feel its agonies its unreasoning stupidities and then express it in any medium you choose thats called art and art isn't dumb but it is dumbland
<START> panned by critics at the time but loved by the fans this film has now become a classic mixing supposedly 'surreal' footage shot at john lennon's home among other places with live footage of marc bolan t rex at their very best this film is not just a must for everyone who's liked marc bolan but gives a fascinating insight into the era br br these were the times when marc was hobnobbing with the likes of ringo starr of the beatles who directed it and you can even find a brief spot from one reg dwight elton john to you bashing the ivories in an amazing and never officially released version of tutti frutti and rocking and ballad versions of children of the revolution br br there's also wonderful scenes featuring chelita secunda said to have 'created glam rock' with her use of glitter etc mickey finn and even the actor from catweazle br br the best scene for me is in the garden when marc leaves the dining table sits down cross legged in front of a string section and knocks out acoustic versions of classics such as get it on and the slider br br highly highly recommended five stars out of five br br rory
<START> i'm surprised at the comments from posters stating that jane powell made the same type of films deanna durbin did although they were both young sopranos whose film images were crafted by joe pasternak if this film is any indication they were almost polar opposites br br while in three smart girls durbin plays an impulsive little miss fixit who after some setbacks manages to reunite her divorced parents in its' semi remake three daring daughters jane powell almost destroys the marriage between her screen mom jeanette macdonald and new stepfather jose iturbi when she refuses to accept him and strong arms her younger siblings into rejecting him too from the durbin and powell films i've seen i'd say these disparate qualities permeate the early films of both of these talented young performers br br as for durbin's performance in three smart girls i find it completely winning and most impressive although it's clear from her occasionally shrill and over emphatic line readings in some of the more energetic scenes that this is an early film for deanna watching the self confident knowing and naturally effervescent manner in which she delivers her lines and performs overall and the subdued and tender manner she projects the more serious scenes you'd never guess that this was the first film role of a 14 year old girl whose prior professional experience consisted almost exclusively of two years of vocal instruction br br given that this film and durbin herself were much publicized at the time as universal's last chance the production must have been an impossibly stressful situation for a film novice of any age but you'd never know it from the ease and assurance durbin displays on screen although she's clearly still developing her acting style and demeanor before the camera this was equally true of the early performances of much more experienced contemporaries like garland rooney o'connor and jane powell durbin projects an extraordinary presence and warmth on camera that is absolutely unique to her and even here in her first film she manages to remain immensely likable despite the often quick tempered impulsiveness of her character and though she's occasionally shrill she never for a second projects the coy and arch qualities that afflicted many child stars including jane powell and some of the other young sopranos who followed in the wake of her success br br in short like all great singing stars durbin was much more than just a beautiful voice on the other hand while durbin's pure lyric soprano is a truly remarkable and glorious instrument the most remarkable thing about it to me was the way she is able to project her songs without the slightest bit of affectation or grandnes that afflict the singing of adult opera singers like lily pons grace moore and jeanette macdonald in films of the period br br the film is also delightful heavily influenced by screwball comedy it backs durbin up with a creme de la creme of first class screwball pros such as charles winninger binnie barnes alice brady ray milland and mischa auer the story is light and entertaining true it's hardly realistic but why would anyone expect it to be if you want realistic rent the grapes of wrath or triumph of the will on the other hand if you're looking for a genuine sweet funny and entertaining family comedy with a wonderfully charismatic and gifted adolescent lead and terrific supporting players this film won't let you down
<START> i'm glad that this is available on dvd now this film is an excellent example of the triumph of content style over empty headed flashing lights constant loud noises br br essentially if you have a short attention span or lack the wit imagination to engage with literary narrative you won't like this film the reasons for this are quite simple but unfortunately rarely achieved matthew jacobs has done a fantastic job of transposing the story of catherine storr's novel 'marianne dreams' successfully to a screenplay an unenviable task as anyone who has seen a film of a book will undoubtedly know br br the casting is excellent allowing director bernard rose to use the actors in a way that is rarely seen now they indulge in the craft of acting i know i know actors doing their job acting instead of resorting to mugging inanely at the camera lens whist a kaleidoscope of car chases explosions fire fights break out around them is a genuinely rare treat but it does actually happen in this film br br this brings me to the final reason that this is a film for the imaginative thinker not the spoon fed tabloid reader apart from a solid script direction acting it relies on atmosphere suspense implied horror if it is to be categorized as horror then the presentation of 'paper house' is more in the vein of sophocles than tobe hooper br br in conclusion then if you like lots of loud noises explosions constant cuts bright flashing colours you'd be better off watching 'transformers' but if you like a suspenseful story which unfolds through a skillful evocative use of narrative without insulting your intelligence by force feeding you cacophonous nonsense then this might just be your thing
<START> pickup on south street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made an example of the directing when candy jean peters starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing an alarm goes off in the background in the building she's in as if it's an alarm going off in her head it's not cartoon like it's subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until you've seen the film a few times and it just clicks that there's an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag br br richard widmark is way on top of his game as a smart alec he's really great but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for moe the street peddler informer played by thelma ritter later in her apartment you are not seeing a movie you're seeing a real person i've never seen anyone act so real i felt like i was looking into a real room until ritter's performance right down to the way her hair stuck out a bit when she removed her hat br br about a million other things just worked from the way lightning louie picks up money with his chopsticks to the way candy's jewelry clicks when she flicks moe's hand away from her brooch to the way moe gets the dollars and change from the police captain across the fbi guy's chest and even the way the captain opens his filing cabinet like he's been doing it in that way in that room for many years pickup on south street is detailed moves directing with consummate performances acting and superb now nostalgic visuals of the day such as the panel truck the boards leading to the shack out on the water the dumbwaiter and the unforgettable place skip stashes his pocket pickings wonderful stuff br br pickup on south street is also one of the few movies where even though the characters aren't perfect you do care about them perhaps because they have been somewhat branded by their pasts in ways that are hard to escape skip as a three time loser and candy as a youngish woman who has knocked around a lot when these people behave a little more badly than you'd expect it's in sort of novel ways that make it seem you're looking in at people you'd never otherwise imagine and yet you know that they are possible because the actors make them so recognizably human
<START> i am really surprised that this movie get a ranking like this i haven't seen such a bad movie for years omg this was a really bad movie splatter is not enough to describe the unnecessary nearly funny blood scenes if you didn't like hostel2 or wolf creek or halloween 2007 well this is 10 time worse the story remind me rl stine goosebumps br br i can't tell about the acting since the script was so terrible clichÃ© all the time why i must write 10lines i never understood this br br here comes spoilers br br the story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro we are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice actually those people are just missing and there is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy and as usual no one believes him what a surprise in the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher
<START> tigerland 2000 1 2 out of four br br by blake french br br throughout the years audiences have seen and understood war films with every point of view possible and somehow producers and writers always come up with new and innovative methods of portraying various soldiers on the battlefield joel schumacher 8mm a time to kill easily one of the riskiest directors currently working has found resemblance with the thin red line in the way his new drama tigerland steps in an individual soldier's shoes this movie written by ross klavan and michael mcguther has more guts and irony than the thin red line or even saving private ryan although the movie's dramatic impact is somewhat lessened due to the perversity of the material present it certainly enlightens us on a new perspective of young men training for war br br i would want to know joel schumacher's experiences with the army are the men really this unabashed and brutal i am sure some of them are but the movie views its uncompromising world through the eyes of a young man named roland bozz colin farrell who is rebellious against the ideas of war his personality instantly counteracts with several other characters one who becomes his best friend paxton matthew davis and another wilson russell richardson whose flamed temper often exasperates bozz's tension with the idea of going to war the war depicted in this production is not found on a battlefield but on training grounds of a louisiana based instruction camp between conceptions and fears of the soldiers in training this film is specifically about the preparation for war nothing more nothing less it ends when the soldiers finally go to war kind of disappointing since witnessing the characters in action would have served as a supurb payoff br br shot on location in about 28 days using 16mm stock and a minuscule budget joel schumacher accurately displays a gritty perverse cruel and unmerciful atmosphere using hand held cinematography unique lighting techniques and direct sound schumacher's grainy and blown out images make the movie feel like a documentary feature this unusual style of filmmaking only contributes to the hard core realism of the movie quite graphic in its use of coarse language perhaps a little too disturbing waves of four letter words pound the audience some in shock of what they are hearing even the extreme amount of vulgarism does not keep the dialogue from prevailing as heartbreaking true and emotional br br if anything tigerland provides us with a minor appreciation of how much our soldiers go through for our country in the beginning stages of combat such bravery must it take to enlist in the army during times of war knowing the hardships and risks that are being taken such thought provoking ideas are made possible through the heartbreaking performances by the young aspiring actors who portray the various trainees this movie is not for all audiences but one that young men should take a look at before enlisting themselves in the army and adult audiences should watch to appreciate the courage needed to do such br br
<START> gone in 60 sec where do i began it keeps you in the movie with some good action and some cool cars people say its not a good movie i disagree sure it has some cheesy parts but what action movie doesn't i gave it an 8 out of 10 cause of the action and the comic relief if you like the rock or face off than this movie is right up your alley cage dose a good job along with one of the most under rated actors in my mind del roy lindo i think sometimes people look to far into movies some times you need to sit back enjoy the movie and after words ask yourself did they achieve what they where showing meaning if they where going for action was it action pact if they where trying to make a movie to change how movies are made and trying to win every award out their well did they i think they made the action movie they set out to make give it a chance and you wont be sorry
<START> ok i really don't have too much to say about this film other than this i have seen over 4 000 films in my life and more than 2 300 of those were horror films while i have some difficulty deciding which is the best as opposed to my favourite which i can tell you is george a romero's dawn of the dead i can tell you without the slightest hesitation that todd sheets' zombie bloodbath is the absolute worst horror film i have ever seen br br there is simply nothing positive i can say about this film the acting the dialogue the directing the make up the music every aspect of this film is simply so far below what is acceptable that it boggles my mind that this was ever even released br br even if you are a horror or zombie movie completist please heed my warning and do not waste your time on this garbage there is no pleasure to be gotten from viewing this you won't even get any laughs out of the utter ineptitude on display trust me please
<START> i didn't know much about this movie before i watched it but i heard it had something to do with quantum physics so i was interested what i didn't know is that this is not actually a story but a bunch of new age blowhards who love the sound of their own voice talking about how little they know about basic quantum mechanics i say it belongs more in the documentary category than comedy or drama br br marlee matlin is in the movie in order to give this new age symposium some sort of a storyline her portions of the film feel horribly tacked on and are meant to display the speaker's thoughts so we won't die of boredom matlin has a real job as a photographer unlike the new age hippie that crashes on her couch we get to listen to nameless people ramble on about what quantum physics all means to them the one bright spot in this movie was the speaker from india i assume but i think he showed up for the wrong film br br it looks like barbara eden really let herself go and she goes on and on about how quantum science has something to do with her crazy new age beliefs it looks like quark from ds9 was running low on cash and he also makes a brief appearance in the film there is a lot of whizbang cgi we're supposed to be impressed with cells in the body are shown as dancing jello molds because the filmmakers have apparently seen flubber one too many times br br people in the movie say that the arawak people on san salvador thought columbus's ship the pinta was invisible because natives had never seen clipper ships before as if people today had any way possible way of knowing of course they leave out all of that information and just say columbus's ships were invisible to the indians in america the film takes many such arrogant leaps thomas young did a double slit experiment around 1805 and found that light can look like a particle some of the time and a wave some of the time of course you'd never know this from watching this stupid film because the only reference to it is that atoms can be particles and waves and that must mean that people can pass through walls walk on water and never grow old if they just wish upon a star then i'm sure marlee matlin could stop being deaf if she just believed hard enough i'm being sarcastic but this film is chock full of false hope and beliefs that the people espousing them don't really hold br br these are new age kooks who have grabbed onto quantum theory as if it reaffirms everything they believe about meditation zero point energy crystal healing etc if these snake oil salesmen truly believed the crap they were selling couldn't they just wish their paychecks into existence instead of appearing in this joke of a film we get to listen to another nameless man with no credentials that we know of talk on his couch in front of a fireplace or tv screen about how he creates his own life every time he was on the screen i wanted someone to rush in and throw a pie in his face these people take themselves way too seriously some other balding guy in a suit says that nobody ever really touches anything because there's a magnetic force preventing it at the quantum level if only someone had walked onto the screen and kept punching him in the stomach screaming i'm not touching you i'm not touching you a moral relativist in the movie claims that there's really no such thing as good or bad so apparently it's ok that hitler gassed millions of jews to death another person says that there is no such thing as love it's just a chemical and that we really don't love people we're just addicted to the chemical rush we have when we're around them i suspect this guy is doing this film as community service for being addicted to heroin for so many years br br we are witness to a truly pathetic sequence where two young adults walk around a wedding reception seeing everything like robocop they evaluate if women are cows dogs or foxes and a sexual position pops onto the scree marlee matlin gets drunk at the wedding she's supposed to photograph and the next day decides to love herself and take a bath because she's a beautiful and unique snowflake br br i liked when the film said people often find evidence for their pre conceived notions perhaps in this review i'm only seeing what i want to see but i truly wanted to see these people get pies to the face and it never happened br br if you've never heard of any of the ideas presented in the film before you may find them interesting but there are better sources for all of the ideas here if you want to watch a good movie that talks about the heisenberg uncertainty principle go see the man who wasn't there if you want to read a good book about quantum field theory read hyperspace by michio kaku if you want to see a film that talks about different philosophies with imaginative visuals see waking life although it can feel boring self important and pretentious at times all in all you should go and read quantum psychology or prometheus rising by robert anton wilson instead of wasting your time on this movie br br i normally have a very hard time giving movies a score from 1 to 10 but this one was a very easy for me 1 10 stars br br the movie's title is true the people in this film don't know hands down the worst movie i've ever seen
<START> overall performance at last the long waiting aag hits the screens unfortunately it couldn't set progressive fire in the audience the first best thing to talk about the movie is the idea of remaking the mighty sholay and varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie if he repeated the same ramghad backdrop people will again say there is nothing new in this different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy right from the start of his career with siva in telugu he had been using the same lighting and kind of background i seriously dunno this guy varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis godfather it's all dutch dutch dutch dutch why would some body use so many dutch angles and extreme closeup shots the shot division is lame characters couldn't carry an emotion performances are not to their mark storytelling is worse background is really really terrible br br babban amitabhz been over prioritized to his job varma produced great villains like bikumatre bhavtakur das mallik bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of hindi cinema there's no comparison of gabbar with babban babban is a more psycho rather than a villain still he has a soft corner for his brother it's a gift in this movie amitabhz performance is not to his mark his appearance itself is pathetic the scar on his nose symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema what ever they worked on babban is not successful babban is no comparison with gabbar br br narsimha the first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands if varma did that it would be like teaching abcd to a bachelor degree holder itz good he opened the secret early but the flashback is pathetic varma couldn't use a great actor like mohanlal to his mark br br durga the only character with betterment this character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story br br heroo raj ghunguroo no body bothers or at least considers these character the utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz these characters carry nothing to this movie br br ramgopalvarma his quality is degrading diminishing aag totally can be treated as a c grade movie sholay is a fire of revenge problem of a town meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by dharmendra aag never carried an emotion with its characters storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters don't compare aag with sholay still u will not like it br br if you dare watch this movie you will be burnt alive in ramgopal varma ki aag
<START> i'm sorry to say this but the acting in this film is horrible the dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever perhaps i got the dress rehearsal version by mistake the director over uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves the story is pretty well written and the fight sequences are actually better than i have seen in many action films the fights seem pretty real but all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point blank automatic weapon fire grenades morter rounds and bazookas the enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots i have ever seen especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about 30 yards and every bazooka shot is wide by at least 50 feet those bazookas need serious site calibration
