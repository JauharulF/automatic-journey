<START> i stopped by bb and picked up 4 zombie flicks to watch over the weekend now i understand that the effects will be cheesy the acting will be sub par and the sets will be suspect so i'm not expecting much but it should at least have a story stories don't cost a thing except time apparently they didn't have any time either br br zombie nation had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that all looked like new wave hookers the picture of the zombie on the front cover never appears in the movie it was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genre br br the running time is only 81 minutes but it felt like 2 hours according to my wife who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room it sounded like zombie porn which if you think about sounds kinda gross but it wasn't even that good br br the only suggestion i can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent mess br br it ended up being a free rental and i still feel ripped off i rated it a 1 out of 10 because imdb won't allow me to use decimals
<START> time for a rant eh i thought spirit was a great movie to watch however there were a few things that stop me from rating it higher than a 6 or 7 i'm being a little bit generous with the 7 br br point 1 matt damon aggravates me i was thinking 'what a dicky voice they got for the main character ' when i first heard him narrate and then i realized it is matt damon the man bugs me so very bad his performance in the departed was terrible and ruined the movie for me before the movie got a chance to ruin itself but that's another story for some other time as it almost did spirit i was able to get past this fact because of how little narration there actually was thankfully br br point 2 brian adams sucks the whole score was terrible the songs were unoriginal generic and poorly executed not once did i find the music to fit and the lyrics were terrible every time one of the lame songs came on i was turned off i almost thought i'd start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the super american freedom style lyrics i couldn't help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after 9 11 in light of the native american aspects of the film they should have gone with fitting music using right instruments not petty radio hit teen bop 14 year old girl crap i thought i was back in junior high school i can't believe no better could have been done i refuse to had it not have been for this i'd rank the film up more with disney which knows a thing or two about originality ok don't bother saying what i know some of you are probably thinking too bad it's a shame they couldn't have hired better musicians br br i liked the art and animation except for some things here and there like sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body thick dark lines mainly near the end there were often times when i thought they tried too hard on the emotion and facial expressions and failed at drawing any real emotion but there were also times when the emotion ran thick anyhow many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparent br br ok i'm falling asleep here so i'll sum it up before i start making less sense br br nice try on an epic film it turned out mediocre though matt damon you suck
<START> the young victoria is a elegantly costumed and reproduced bit of history that benefits from some fine settings solid direction by jean marc vallÃ©e of stalwart julian fellowes' version of the youthful lass who was to become england's longest reigning monarch victoria much of the early portion of the film that part when victoria is a child whose ascent to the throne is contested by her mother miranda richardson and sir john conroy mark strong seems to drag and get lost in the multiple costumes and scenery variations but once victoria emily blunt comes of age and is courted by prince albert rupert friend the film blooms blunt is a strong actress and finds that delicate line between girlish infatuation and royal dignity that makes her a fine foil for those at court who would seek to control the 'child queen' including her secretary lord melbourne paul bettany but as she matures into her role as queen her eye dwells on the dashing german prince albert and a love affair that has lasted in the memories of everyone is matched by the concept of joining royalty with concern for the care of her subjects much due to the sensitivity of albert the film takes us to the birth of their first of nine children and then ends with some statements about the influence of queen victoria and prince albert's effect on the various royalties throughout europe it makes for an evening of beautiful costume drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in emily blunt and rupert friend a solid if not transporting epic br br grady harp
<START> smokey and the bandit wasn't exactly shakespeare but then nobody wanted it to be it was lowdown slapstick but it did have brains it had a very smart script with definable characters and a fun wrap up people came out of the theater smiling hooper provides none of this there is no reason to smile if it's supposed to be a tribute to the hollywood stuntman it makes them look awfully lazy by providing nothing but badly choreographed fight scenes and one of the most unconvincing car jumps i've ever seen it all looks phony badly filmed almost on purpose poor sally field as the girlfriend who wrings her hands on the sidelines is given her weakest role with not a single funny or smart line if you do that jump i won't be here when you get back burt reynolds keeps looking at the camera and winking but the joke is on any audience who sits through hooper from
<START> i was also on hand for the premiere in toronto this film was sort of a consolation when i thought i wouldn't be able to get in to see my first choice well i was totally blown away by the time i got to the theater i could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie yes i actually forgot who was even in it terrific performances from the entire cast carrie anne moss was great in a true departure from her days as trinity as for billy connolly i think not since chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly with no lines what so ever the kids were also great definitely check this one out if you get the chance br br and by the way i got to see my first choice anyway and this was way better
<START> have to be honest and say that i haven't seen many independent films but i thought this one was very well done the direction and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction the angles settings and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped many haunting and memorable images from the film stick in your mind long after it's over always a sign of a good director
<START> this movie is god awful not one quality to this movie you would think that the gore would be good but it sucks bad the effects are worse and the acting if you can call it acting is the worst i've ever seen this movie was obviously shot on a camcorder and runs on a budget around 500 dollars probably if you want to watch a good zombie movie than watch dawn of the dead or day of the dead if you want to watch a good cheap shot on video zombie movie like this but way better than watch redneck zombies please avoid this movie at all costs it is unwatchable and pointless you've been warned i've got nothing else to say about this stupid movie
<START> br br back in his youth the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin but his family forbid it many decades later the old man has raised three children two boys and one girl and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children soon the sister is bored with brother 1 and jumps in the bed of brother 2 br br one might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island but no they are upper class europeans going to college and busy in the social world br br never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non related female and the two brothers never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non related male and the one sister all flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister br br the weakest part of gladiator was the incest thing the young emperor commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage minded girls all over him but no he only wanted his sister if movie incest is your cup of tea then sunshine will slowly thrill you to no end
<START> this movie seemed like it was going to be better than it ended up being the cinematography is good the acting seemed solid the dialogue wasn't too stiff but then about twenty minutes in there's this long scene with a doctor who you know is actually a patient at the asylum pretending to be a doctor and it just goes south from there br br on top of that the demon is about the silliest looking hellspawn since the godzilla looking thing in curse of the demon there's also some odd demon worshippers who wear masks that look like the exploding teens from the beginning of logan's run br br in the end the cinematography couldn't save this movie despite some pretty solid performances by the actors the story just doesn't go anywhere i think hellbored would have been a better title for this
<START> i've seen a lot of crap in my day but goodness hot rod takes the cake i saw a free screening in ny the other night i can only hope they show the funny version to the paying customers the big laughs were sparse the plot was uninteresting and the characters were one dimensional at best one highlight is a hilarious dancing scene with adam samberg it was priceless and was the only scene i truly had a hearty laugh at other than that i can only recollect randomness and dead air snl samberg fans may be disappointed i know i was expecting more from it but it short i definitely would not recommend attending a free screening or paying to watch this film
<START> you know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is being able to see a brief moment of jeopardy br br the saddest thing about white men can't jump is that it had tremendous potential for several years i lived in area quite like that portrayed in this film racial tensions were high and basketball meant everything to everyone a film about the members of this basketball culture could have been very interesting but the mediocre acting and poor script in white men can't job left something to be desired br br the movie's sequence of events is cyclical first billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball he then returns to his home and lounges around with his girlfriend and the process is repeated most stories build up to a climax of some kind but the climax i saw was just another sequence in this repetition this case being billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball br br in order for a plot to develop some dilemma must be resolved and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is going to be interesting as well apparently the writers of white men can't jump forgot this rule as the plot can be summarized as billy needs to pay the bills i appreciated the change of pace from other formulaic sports movies but i'm sorry this was just plain awful i could have cared less if billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment br br despite all this white men can't jump is a successful film apparently some adamant sports fans will dismiss terrible writing for a few scenes with a basketball in them others i'm sure were lured by the big names playing the leading roles this leaves me to wonder if the cast was replaced entirely with previously unknown actors and the basketball theme was replaced with lacrosse would anyone have bothered watching this movie i really don't think so br br i'll give this movie two stars out of ten the extra star is for the jeopardy scene which kept me awake for a few minutes thanks trebek
<START> during the civil war there were many cases of divided loyalties obviously many occurred in the border states where north met south by happenstance of geography from the border young father owen moore goes off to join the union army shortly confederate soldier henry b walthall separated from his regimen wanders onto the enemy's property desperate for water he finds a supply where the unionist's young daughter gladys egan sits when the yankee soldiers track him down little gladys innocently helps the confederate hide later when he returns to kill her father the little girl's kindness is remembered a sweet small story from director d w griffith location footage and humanity are lovingly displayed br br in the border states 6 13 10 d w griffith henry b walthall owen moore gladys egan
<START> china o'brien 1990 was an attempt to make cynthia rothrock a star in the united states this golden harvet production was helmed by veteran director robert clouse sadly he was either lucky with enter the dragon or he's lost his touch because he's not that great of a director the only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of ms rothrock and richard norton if this movie was directed by corey yuen or hoi meng it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straight to video action flick br br china o'brien returns home to help out her dad he's having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help so she returns home and restores order with the help of two unlikely people but will they be enough to topple mister big and his evil cronies br br if you're a big cynthia rothrock fan then this movie's catered for you i only enjoyed the fighting scenes everything else is rubbish why didn't raymond chow shell out a few shekels and hired a top notch action director br br recommended
<START> the way the story is developed keeps the audience wondering what is the tenant's dark past we get some clues during the series but enough to keep us interested in the mini series the characters are all believable and i personally felt immersed and surrounded by the story
<START> i lived during those times and i think the program caught the heart of the era i do think it should have dealt with more of the afro american issue but i think it cover a lot in the program it was scary to sit and watch the riots on t v hoping that they would not go as far as your families home and that it would not get burnt down i thought jerry o'connell did a great job portraying a vet coming back from the war i went to school with guys who came back some had changed more than others and some not so much it bothers me when someone comments that an issue was not covered enough or it was not entertaining enough live through it and then make comments i thought the movie was great and that everyone in it did a remarkable job thank you for a trip sad and good down memory lane
<START> i've now written reviews for several of the moh episodes and this is among the worst an interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll if watching people things they never would in real life amuses you let's check out the basement then this is your show except it's not amusing or entertaining it's just annoying br br the extent of the virus is never ever showed i can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only as the resulting situation is very very frightening but then things deteriorate as daughter lets obviously deranged dad into the home and ultimately dies at his hands the woman flees north and runs into a few tens situations then some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her things that make you go huh or something then she is huddling for warmth the end br br awful these directors are mailing this tripe in
<START> this is a extremely well made film the acting script and camera work are all first rate the music is good too though it is mostly early in the film when things are still relatively cheery there are no really superstars in the cast though several faces will be familiar the entire cast does an excellent job with the script br br but it is hard to watch because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented it is now fashionable to blame the british for setting hindus and muslims against each other and then cruelly separating them into two countries there is some merit in this view but it's also true that no one forced hindus and muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition it seems more likely that the british simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends br br the result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen but it is never painted as a black and white case there is baseness and nobility on both sides and also the hope for change in the younger generation br br there is redemption of a sort in the end when puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life but also truly loved her and her family which has disowned her then later come looking for her but by that point she has no option that is without great pain for her br br this film carries the message that both muslims and hindus have their grave faults and also that both can be dignified and caring people the reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching since there can never be real reconciliation across the india pakistan border in that sense it is similar to mr mrs iyer br br in the end we were glad to have seen the film even though the resolution was heartbreaking if the uk and us could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness they would certainly be better off
<START> jesus christ i can't believe i've wasted my time watching this movie i only watched because i have such a crush on jordan ladd but watching this film almost put me off her this is absolutely awful i could have been watching survivor series 93 over this br br the lead guy in this was so bland and generic i would love it if the great mistuharu misawa tiger drove '91'd his ass through a glass window i was enraging every time he was saying lake and cabin i'd kick his ass br br jordan ladd on the other hand was absolutely wonderful a true angel but she couldn't even save this utter joke of a film sadly she couldn't even act like she was off her nut when she took that truth drug it looked hilarious br br i also loved the bit where jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her it reminded me of a time where nevermind br br anayways do watch this film because of it's awfulness
<START> another demonstration of kurosawa's genius his first colour film is a darkly surreal look into the tragic lives of tokyo slum dwellers essentially a series of interweaving vignettes depicting several groups of people eking out a perilous existence in a harsh and uncaring post war shanty town swinging from comedy to tragedy and back this film shows how people deal with the worst kind of life each in their own way mostly retreating into themselves and living in the fantasy worlds of their own heads withdrawing emotionally from those around them or drowning themselves in alcohol mixing kitchen sink realism with kabuki esque theatrics kurosawa toys expertly with the emotions of his audience drawing tears and laughter with equal deftness a wonderful draining experience
<START> it's hard to watch this movie without thinking forward to the television show it would become especially if like me you happen to like the tv show more but there's a lot to be said for the source br br oscar madison walter matthau is a top new york city sportswriter who lives in an eight room apartment by himself a casualty of divorce and his own stubbornly sloppy mindset enter his friend felix ungar jack lemmon needing a place to live after his wife threw him out for his stubbornly neatnik mindset the result is a train wreck and one of the most beloved movie adaptations of a neil simon stage play br br first thing's first i love that apartment poker table novelty dart board askew photos of baseball players empty booze and beer containers even a pair of roman columns it's a place where men can be boys simon and director gene saks do a great job opening up the stage play's single set oscar's living room by moving the action into the bedrooms and kitchen and giving the mounting tension between oscar and felix more corners to bounce off of br br neal hefti's familiar score was heard on the tv show but never so sweepingly orchestrated as it is here in several different arrangements that make the on screen action soar whenever its played real location work and night shots of manhattan give the film an energy common to films shot in that place and time buddwing the world of henry orient midnight cowboy manchurian candidate rosemary's baby etc br br are lemmon and matthau too heavy in comparison to tony randall and jack klugman to be fair the movie is meant to be a more serious affair dealing with the then uncommon condition of mid life divorce and the frustration inherent in not being able to make a relationship work simon has more in mind than entering felix and oscar in a game of password or a battle of wits with howard cosell but i don't know br br both lemmon and matthau were terrific comedians i enjoy watching especially in the middle of this film as i often do in their separate movies but i never understood why they were regarded as a great comedy team here in their best regarded partnership they seem to be acting in two different films lemmon in a comedy drama and matthau in a farce matthau is great in the beginning charming us with his teddy bear demeanor around the poker table but near the end of the film he takes a turn much like jack torrance's in the shining reacting to felix cleaning up his apartment and serving tasty food to his friends in a way that totally upsets the delicate balance of blame br br while the ending bothers me the part many see as the most jarring the beginning works fine as i see it watching felix stumbling around trying to kill himself isn't great comedy no but it's a good way to get into a great comedy setting us up with some real life pain before bringing in the warmth and laughter plus it has some great shots of the seedier parts of the city in the middle of the movie this scene would have been a miscalculation but it works as a way of establishing felix's torment and a sense of sharp relief to come when we see oscar and his poker friends bicker and feud br br that's where simon's lines are so great they are the underlying strength of the film he gets the banter exactly right and real and still makes it funny i don't mind you talking felix you got things to say what's scaring me is i'm beginning to listen the tv show showed how wrong it is to assume the movie is always better in fact the tv show once made a good point about assuming anything at all but the movie makes for a solid foundation and is a joy in its own right
