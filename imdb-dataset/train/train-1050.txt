<START> the dvd for danaza macabra castle of blood is very odd that's because parts of the film are in french with subtitles and the rest is dubbed into english from the french sometimes characters switched between the two in the middle of a scene when i tried to get the film to be just subtitled or just dubbed it made no difference odd but still watchable br br the story purports to be based on a poe story though i can't recall which one in fact the character of poe appears in the beginning and end of the film though it didn't look especially like him br br a rich man makes a bet with a guy down on his luck that he cannot stay the entire night in a manner home it seems like an easy bet to win even if the house is very creepy however it can't be that easy as the rich guy says that all those who previously took the bet died yet this fool still wants to make the wager while in the home he meets lovely barbara steele within and falls madly for her later however he learns that she died more than a decade earlier how can this be i could tell you more about the plot but don't want to spoil any of the suspense see it for yourself to find out the rest of the story br br this film gets very high marks for creating a creepy atmosphere the house black white cinematography and music work together to make for a scary looking film as for the plot it's interesting especially because there are many twists and turns so many that you are wondering just who is and who isn't among the undead by the end of the film br br the only negative is that i felt sorry for the poor snake that was needlessly killed crazy as it might sound i felt sorry for it and it hardly seemed necessary br br also parents may want to know that towards the end there is a bit of nudity a strikingly beautiful woman appears topless but it's hardly necessary for the plot
<START> one of the most excellent movies ever produced in russia and certainly the best one made during the decline of the ussr incredibly clever hilarious and dramatic at the same time superb acting overall a masterpiece score it 10 10 br br
<START> before films like 'the texas chainsaw massacre ' 'suspiria ' and 'halloween' changed the view of horror forever there was a more gothic and far less violent era in the genre films like the hammer horror series and 'rosemary's baby' were what scared and thrilled audiences throughout the 60s and early 70s i can't tell you how many times i rented this film during my childhood but i did because there was something about it i didn't want to limit myself to the slasher and zombies movies of the 70s and 80s and films like this production from the famous but sadly long gone amicus film company were a good start br br pros a grand eerie music score strong performances from a stellar cast brilliant cinematography plenty good old fashioned thrills and chills especially in the first and last vignettes some haunting moments and images moves at a slow but stead pace the house is one spooky oppressive dwelling great production design and set decoration which give the film a real old gothic horror feel depends more on mood and bloodless chills than on gore and gratuitous nudity for it's thrills br br cons some pacing issues in the first half aside from the 'the cloak ' the rest of the stories feel like they've been done before clichÃ©s galore the second story 'waxworks ' has fine acting and it's moments but is the weakest of the four in terms of scares and suspense the low budget really shows at times br br final thoughts after seeing this film for the first time in many years i can see why i rented it so frequently it's not a masterpiece by any means but it's a good example of a time when horror films were made with style and class watch this one with the lights off br br my rating 3 5 5
<START> this cool marvel superhero game pays proper tribute by staying true to the comics of all the marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay spiderman improves in both departments it also features the voice of stan lee the creator of spiderman comics br br as you'd expect spiderman does whatever a spider can he does more than spin webs in fact he uses them as weapons and shields when he's not using web in combat he punches and kicks as well spidey has his hands full as he battles venom rhino mysterio scorpion and dr octopus to name a few look for captain america in a cameo br br most of the levels are challenging but some of them require patience to beat the only complaint about this game is that it's so short and can be completed in less than three hours if you're a real marvel superhero fan this game is for you but don't expect long gameplay better luck in spiderman 2 my evaluation 9 out of 10
<START> i enjoyed this film i thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that's never happened before a secret service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot unfortunately for michael douglas' character pete garrison they think he's the mole but he isn't br br he's just a morally flawed agent having an affair with the first lady since he's doing that he's unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam and that makes him suspect number one when it's revealed there is a plot to kill the president br br garrison is forced to go on the lam but at the same time he's still trying to do the right thing by protecting the president douglas does a fine job in this role i don't always care the people he plays but he's an excellent actor keifer sutherland david breckinridge is equally as good at least in here as the fellow ss boss who hunts down douglas until convinced he has been telling the truth when he does the two of them work together in the finale to discover and then stop if they can the plot the crooks are interesting too by the way also i have never and never will unfortunately see a first lady who looks as good as kim basinger br br this is simply a slick action flick that entertains start to finish are there holes in it of course probably a number of them and a reason you see so many critical comments however it is unfairly bashed here it just isn't intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this website my advice chill just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue yes it gets a little rambo ish at the end but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainment which is what movies are all about
<START> maybe i'm being too generous with the rating but i just love this movie i've seen it so many times but every time i see it i fall in love with it all over again it's just a simple romantic comedy with nothing huge or monumentous that happens but i'm a big romantic and this movie is romantic i love meg ryan and tim robbins and walter mathau is so funny the scientists make me laugh so much i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it it's such a clean good movie and those are so rare now my 20 year old brother likes this movie too so it's not just a chick flick i recommend it if you need to laugh or if you're just lonely and need to watch a romance if you yourself can't participate in one it's a good 'un
<START> i really enjoyed this debut by ring director hideo nakata if you've seen ring beforehand then you'll be familiar with the style and idea of this flick it's got a subtle spookiness about it that works better than the constant and predictable stingers that infest most mainstream movies of this genre if you like films that give you the chills then you will probably like this one a good creepy debut by hideo nakata 8 10
<START> another friday the 13th ripoff even featuring some of its music a group of young adults get together for a small high school reunion and start getting slaughtered a la jason voorhees could it be that nerd they used to torment in school br br routine slash fest is fun for fans of the genre and contains the usual t a quota for films if its ilk the ending is a bit more imaginative than your standard slasher br br mpaa rated for violence gore language sexuality nudity and some drug content
<START> this is a really interesting film it's the first time i have seen the relationship between an older woman and a younger guy on screen without it being sensationalist for the director of notting hill this is a bold move to something serious
<START> the obvious parallels between walt disney's charming fantasy bedknobs and broomsticks and c s lewis chronicles of narnia are pretty apparent there are more coincidences here than comparing bedknobs and broomsticks than with mary poppins even though a lot of the same creative talent went into the two disney films br br like the chronicles of narnia it involves some english children leaving london during the blitz and coming to live in the country and those kids have to deal with a world of magic but unlike c s lewis the rawlins kids have the magic invade their world and help defeat the people making a mess of it in the here and now no retreating to a fantasy kingdom like the pevensie kids br br no heavy duty philosophy here from walt disney except maybe it's not a good thing to mess with witches even apprentice ones like angela lansbury who learn their magic from a charlatan like david tomlinson ms lansbury didn't get to be one of the most bankable of performers for nothing she carries her own brand of magic that even the special effects boys at disney couldn't top and they won an oscar for the magic kingdom in that department for this film br br two performers made their farewell to films in bedknobs and broomsticks tessie o'shea played her last role in this film she graced many a film in the united kingdom as one of their best loved music hall performers and that grand character actor reginald owen as the retired general who leads the old home guard in war and in song bids adieu to film audiences around the world br br the team of robert b sherman and richard m sherman who wrote the score for mary poppins wrote a good and serviceable one here the age of not believing was nominated for an oscar but lost to the theme from shaft personally though i do like david tomlinson's tribute to that most colorful of london streets portabello road br br bedknobs and broomsticks is a fine fantasy film that still holds up well after almost 40 years imagine what it would be like with computer generated graphics
<START> i rented this dvd for two reasons a cast of great actors and the director even though robert altman can be hit or miss in this case it was a big miss altman's attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester after seeing kenneth branagh in a good film like dead again i didn't think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey and i hope it didn't ruin his reputation robert duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one time oscar winners on a downward spiral that includes acting in eating money films such as this one duvall was once a great actor in excellent films even though his best performance was not tender mercies but the great santini this movie was truly a big waste of time i give it a 2 out of 10
<START> manipulative drama about a glamorous model margaux hemingway who is raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician chris sarandon â to whom she had been introduced by her younger sister played by real life sibling mariel whose music teacher he is while the central courtroom action holds the attention â thanks largely to a commanding performance by anne bancroft as hemingwayâs lawyer â the film is too often merely glossy but also dramatically unconvincing the jury ostensibly takes the musicianâs side because a the girl invited assault due to the sensuous nature of her profession and b she was offering no resistance to her presumed aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple in bed together what the f she was clearly tied up â what resistance could she realistically offer br br the second half of the film â involving sarandonâs rape of the sister which curiously anticipates irreversible 2002 by occurring in a tunnel â is rather contrived marielâs character should have known better than to trust sarandon after what he did to her sister but margaux herself foolishly reprises the line of work which had indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately the climax â in which sarandon gets his just desserts with margaux turning suddenly into a fearless and resourceful vigilante â is however a crowd pleaser in the style of death wish 1974 incidentally ubiquitous italian movie mogul dino de laurentiis was behind both films br br itâs worth noting how the two hemingway sistersâ lives took wildly different turns this was the film debut of both margauxâs career never took off despite her undeniable good looks and commendable participation here â while mariel would soon receive an oscar nomination for woody allenâs manhattan 1979 and interestingly would herself play a glamorous victim of raging violence when essaying the role of real life âplayboyâ centerfold dorothy stratten in bob fosseâs star 80 1983 with the added pressure of a couple of failed marriages margaux took refuge in alcohol and would eventually die of a drug overdose in 1996 chillingly the hemingway family had a history of suicides â notably the sistersâ grandfather celebrated author ernest who died of a self inflicted gunshot wound in 1961
<START> roll is a wonderful little film toby malone plays an 18 year old kid very well acted by the way who is into soccer malone's cousin takes him out the night before his big game on an adventure with many twists and turns involving two gym bags a drug lord some tough bikers some cops and some prostitutes and the movie keeps us guessing as to which characters are on which side of the law what the contents of either gym bag is and even what gender a key biker is parts of it reminded me of lock stock and two smoking barrels br br for me roll reinforced three opinions that i already held before seeing roll those opinions are 1 i really want to visit australia one day the country and cities are beautiful and it looks like such a cool place for a vacation br br 2 some of the best filmmakers in the are australian the cinematography in roll was especially impressive i loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes br br 3 australian women are hot
<START> this was a movie that i hoped i could suggest to my american friends but after 4 attempts to watch the movie to finish i knew i couldn't even watch the damn thing to close you are almost convinced the actual war didn't even last that long other's will try to question my patriotism for criticizing a movie like this but flat out you can't go from watching saving private ryan to loc forget about the movie budget difference or the audience those don't preclude a director from making an intelligent movie the length of the movie is not so bad and the fact that it is repetitive they keep attacking the same hill but give it different names i thought the loc was a terrible terrain this hill looked like my backyard the character development sequences the soilders' flashbacks looking back to their last moments before being deployed should have been throughout the movie and not just clumped into one long memory to this day i have yet to watch the ending but there was a much better movie not saying much called border
<START> spoilers will be in this the movie could have been better if they had just had a different script director and cgi provider not much right the movie has a man starting his own theme park err zoo on a deserted island where people can see dinosaurs err sabretooths and it is called jurra oops primal park i do not mind rip offs because there are no original ideas for these kind of movies but this one just slaps you in the face with it r e p e a t e d l y there is even the creature's shadowed head on the design thing the sabretooths that are not sabretooths according to mr primal park just ancient killing cats are rather junky but the crowning accomplishment is the one i call sloggy because after disposing of one big cat a hero is relaxing a little because there is only one left enter the weird feeding guy who says nah we made three the third being a monster who pulls itself around with its front feet great groovy a group of college students are also on the island for a scavenger hunt there test to get into their cliques frat or sort always thought that needed a short nickname out of the ones who do live only one has completed their task so i got a kick out of that oh yeah the mandatory evil capitalist must die clique is in force with not one but two of them mr primal park's death is the most laughable thing you will see in one of these movies as a sabretooth statue's tooth jars loose courtesy of sloggy shrinks a few sizes and impales the man through the throat if i had only gotten away so easy i like sabretooth better than this spin off
<START> after leaving tv's popular the andy griffith show don knotts gave movie stardom a valiant try with a series of inane but matinÃ©e pleasing comedy vehicles unfortunately the reluctant astronaut filmed on the cheap as were most of knotts' movies is much worse than his others don plays a small town schnook who gets accepted to astronaut training camp but not as a candidate for space travel they want him as their new janitor some may say the weak satire capitalizes on americans' then fresh fever for the new age of technology but the flick is really just a dim excuse to keep restless children occupied it gets off to a good start with an ok set up and nostalgic locations but it becomes increasingly more spiritless and idiotic from
<START> in 2004 i liked it then it became very stupid it suggests that kids are brainless it insults children cartoon network used to be great one of the shows i liked was hamtaro it did manage to be interesting and imaginative in its approach to children programming the show foster's home for imaginary friends is like putting 20 spoons of sugar in your sprite it seems as if today's television producers are only interested in making money rather than engaging the imaginations of children and making money lately my children are tuning in to the old shows 60's to find something interesting to watch perhaps in the absence of originality for television to look to its past and recycle children's programing from days gone by
<START> this film comes as the ultimate disappointment in tsai ming liang for me it oozes laziness from its every frame so i'm not going to analyse it thoroughly either but some observations br br 1 if the premise is drought why we get to see city landscapes with blooming green trees i wonder if that was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the film in which thirst notifies the craving for intimacy and watermelon the trivial substitute sex or it is only a matter of lousy film making not giving a damn about being coherent br br 2 we don't get to know what had happened to the porn actress why she is unconscious or presumably dead it seems a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully bombastically delivered but in retrospect her inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick a pretext Â just as gratuitous and exploitative as the activity it is employed in br br 3 nothing is expressed in this movie that antonioni hadn't expressed better 40 years ago Â and without needlessly humiliating his actors br br 4 the musical numbers recycled from 'the hole' felt like a secondary schooler's idea of artistic counterpointing executed on that very secondary school level of skill if that was the point the point sucked
<START> i saw this movie by luck just because i was going through a phase where i had a new found admiration for bill pullman and wanted to see all of his recent movies and thank god i did this movie has stuck with me ever since and remain one of my favorites the story revolves around two girls who embark on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they'll learn the true meaning of freedom br br alice and darlene were just trying to spend a vacation together before going to college but their trip ended up a much more complicated story the struggle they go through as they are arrested in thailand and became prisoners is very moving and intense the acting is amazing the images extraordinary the soundtrack is fantastic and so right for the movie and the message transmitted definitely powerful i actually can't even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time i watch it i know some people haven't appreciated as much as me by the rating the movie has but i swear this one you have to see i promise it will stick with you
<START> when i first saw this film in the 1980's i was in my middle teenage years and somewhat reluctant to see this since i considered myself grown up and out of the sesame street muppets age i honestly don't remember if i liked it at the time or not however somewhere in college i watched this film again and it wound up going and staying into my personal best films ever collection br br this film is loaded with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the muppets i mean obviously the muppets always have appealed to adults and children because there's humor geared towards both generations but come on janice is accidentally overheard telling someone i don't take my clothes off for anyone even if it is artistic there's a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with kermit the frog then the father doesn't want to hear it gonzo saves a chicken with mouth to mouth resuscitation sp and afterwards says i think we're engaged now these and plenty of other moments in the film had me rolling add to that very smart dialogue very smart new york broadway wink wink humor the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that don't border on kid level cheesy whatsoever this film is a masterpiece i don't throw 10 's out on a regular basis but this one deserves it over 20 years later this film totally holds up perhaps even more so the muppets never were and never will be again as funny and smart and just plain brilliant as this film was and is q
