<START> another vast conspiracy movie that tries to blame the us government and the armed forces especially the army for every disaster since the great flood anyone who has ever served time in the us military can see how bogus this film is uniforms equipment sets and mannerisms are all wrong and of course all senior officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots blatant propaganda with no attempt at objectivity most of the theories presented have been disproven over the past few years uses every cliche' rumor and urban legend from the gulf all are presented as gospel the truth is no one knows for sure why some gw vets are sick and others are healthy as horses ps this is not new war is not fun and i know wwii korean and viet nam vets with some pretty serious ailments too and the government has the responsibility to take care of all of them sensationalistic movies like this will not solve the problem
<START> we expected something great when we went to see this bomb it is basically a broadway play put on film the music is plain terrible there isn't one memorable song in the movie heard any hits from this movie you won't because there aren't any some of the musical numbers go on so long that i got up to go to the restroom and get some pop corn and it was still going when i got back if they were good songs well but they suck the pace is slow terrible character development the lead was praised for her singing but sounded like she screamed every song it was almost impossible to stand this movie has nothing to offer anyone but die hard broadway enthusiasts this is without a doubt the most over rated movie i've seen in my entire life a complete waist of time and money there is nothing memorable about this movie except danny glover who wasn't on screen enough and whose character wasn't developed enough rent the video and you'll agree this movie was an expensive over produced polished dog do
<START> so american pie beta house is the 6th american pie movie in the series although it really has nothing to do with the original three american pie movies except some of the characters are supposed to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and eugene levy is in it can't that guy get better gigs br br there is very little to compliment this movie on there aren't any funny jokes the acting is painful to watch especially the girl with the southern accent which sounds more like a canadian's impersonation of a british woman pretending to be a hillbilly by using the word ya'll this movie makes me feel like such an idiot why didn't i apply to a college where nobody goes to class but everybody gets good grades girls consistently take their clothes off in public everybody has promiscuous unprotected sex without the burden of babies and stis and you can ejaculate all over a girl's family photos without her minding really this series has lowered itself to the standards of softcore porn maybe for the next one they'll finally break down and hire ron jeremy as the lead i'm sure they can just tie it in to the series by making his character stifler's 3rd uncle once removed or something like that
<START> the worst movie i have seen since tera jadoo chal gaya there is no story no humor no nothing the action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard akshay kumar thumbs up advertisements stitched together heavily influenced from the matrix and kung fu hustle but very poorly executed br br i did not go a lot of expectations but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder what were these guys thinking br br the only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic kareena in a bikini br br the reason why i did not give a rating of '1' is that every time i think i have seen the worst bollywood proves me wrong
<START> if i wanted to dribble i'd call a nurse br br haven't you had enough more than enough br br you got me a choo choo br br if i begin to die please remove the cowboy hat from my head that is not the way i wish to be remembered br br some of the wonderfully humorous and often insightful quotations from this charming and often insightful film dudley moore is charming lovable and rich sir john gielgud is aristocratic charming and loving and poor the two have a non father father and son relationship which defines the man whom arthur is to become will he follow his heart and soul or just his wealth over twenty five years i've returned to this movie with glee and amusement and joy it is a movie to return to time and time again and remember what is important in life as short as it is br br judge miller
<START> from the very opening scene you will notice just how hard they tried to mimic the very smart and powerful 'cruel intentions' and how flat it landed you'll also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting robin dunne as valmont then in the second scene you meet the two best things in this movie amy adams and mimi rogers as kathryn and her mother that is if you can get past the fact that kathryn wasn't blonde in the first film then the movie goes on you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago and you notice sebastian has already met an anette in the past here called danielle and a cecile here called cherie how original is that for a prequel then it turns into a low budget 'wild things' type of film with lots and lots of oh my twists as i mentioned robin dunne was a very bad choice not that he is a bad actor he's good he just doesn't have the charisma ryan did amy adams who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time once again delivers but with all the talent in the world there is no way one could save this trash as a whole this movie feels like a 'beverly hills 90210' episode the score has been stolen from 'cruel intentions' and 'jawbreaker' yes they used the score from jawbreaker couldn't they at least leave that one alone you'll want to pass this one if you want more cruel intentions watch stephen frears' dangerous liaisons
<START> forest whitaker's performance is all the more impressive for making it almost worthwhile to sit through this dreck historical fiction does not justify changing history the absurdity begins from the ground up with the imaginary lead character played by james mcavoy to create a fictional observer for the purpose of giving the reader a point of connection in the book is regrettable regrettable that white people can't just read a book without a white protagonist to connect to but at least he was placed in a somewhat passive role making up a fake historical actor and crediting this fiction with exposing amin to the world is irresponsible lazy and stupid not making the actions of this creation believable or even sane is just criminal and has opened the door for movies like the one they're planning to make with leonardo dicaprio as a heroic enron whistleblower who never existed the logic of the world does not apply in this film where some scottish kid thinks its okay to sleep with the wife of a murderous dictator it doesn't apply where the wife of the dictator desires to sleep with some stupid scrawny irresponsible white boy for that matter everybody is lined up to sleep with this scrawny irresponsible arrogant white boy he even has gillian anderson licking her comely chops br br let me declare i do not like james mcavoy i'm not sure what it is about him but i thought his mr tumnus in narnia was creepy and pervy i think that kerry washington would never look twice at him so i can't believe that the wife of a powerful dangerous man like amin would risk and lose her life for him i don't believe him as a doctor and i just don't see the appeal his character seems to have far more arrogance than would make sense and trying to make him look like a badass in shooting the cow was just there's that word again absurd think about it you are watching all of these characters bend themselves into knots in order to accommodate this unbelievable main character and there never was such a guy br br gillian anderson looks incredible and sounds more british than most brits whitaker gives a great expansive magnetic performance and highlighted with his incomprehensible pre oscar speeches just how much he was acting it's a shame the film around him had no reason to exist
<START> the first time i saw this i didn't laugh too much at the time i was only about fifteen years old and thought that maybe some of the deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at the time i had the same reaction when i viewed it a second time a few months ago and this time it was because felix's aborted suicide attempt at the beginning of the movie kind of darkened the movie a bit this scene made some of the things oscar said and did to felix later in the movie seem needlessly cruel and their personality clashes weren't as amusing as they could have been had i not already known the story i would have been worried that some of oscar's antics to felix might push him over the edge as it was it didn't make me laugh or smile like the television show with jack klugman and tony randall did still all in all a pretty good movie and it spawned one of the greatest sitcoms on television 7 out of 10
<START> the beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother's love the exceptional performances the steady execution and the quite innovative script the film tells the story of an indian woman nandini who lives in canada with her husband shekhar and little kid raja all of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in india of whom she had not even known is in troubles and the couple rush to india when they get into the village nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture shekhar's family ruled by his cruel highly cynical and merciless father narasimha lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless nandini starts nagging shekhar to return home but he is soon killed by his father's enemies when she wants to leave narasimha refuses to let her take raja back to india here starts the intense struggle which can be called nandini vs narasimha br br india is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas so it may be even correct the portrayal is in my view fair and not one sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world the locations are amazing the music is wonderful and krishna vamshi's direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing one thing that must be noted is the very ear pleasing background score by ismail darbar it is beautiful the characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film portrayed realistically throughout the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch its dialogues are superb and intelligently written and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension br br the film's biggest strength is the performances karisma kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as nandini her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible she displays so much intensity impulsiveness anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son her outbreaks while facing off nana patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child after fiza this is her most powerful performance one of the greatest actors indian cinema has seen nana patekar is indescribable as narasimha he manages to be hateful as narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him patekar displays cruelty wittiness and even humanity with total conviction he is outstanding another great performance comes unsurprisingly from india's most underrated actress deepti naval who sensitises her character to perfection sanjay kapoor is just adequate and shahrukh khan provides great comic relief anyway do watch shakti it could have been better but it is definitely a must watch
<START> goebbels motivation in backing down was not explored in the aftermath of stalingrad the reich had decided to go for 'total war' this is referred to in the film part of this was to use women in the war effort which germany had not previously done to any great extent an ss massacre of women would have faced goebbels with a public relations disaster of massive proportion his preference was to make the problem go away as quietly as possible on the basis that the jewish men could always be rounded up later i understand the majority survived the war br br his other problem was that the 'red' berlin had never been very enthusiastically behind the nazi cause and had to be handled cautiously again a massacre of women could have cost the nazis what mediocre level of support they had in their capital city br br it was interesting that the majority of ss uniforms showed patches which indicated that the men wearing them were not of german nationality but were from german origins in other countries such as lithuania or latvia
<START> john huston's wise blood was a more horrifying misrepresentation of flannery o'connor's book than i could have imagined from the utterly terrible acting performances and don't you oh that was done on purpose you just don't get it me to the musical score that was more suited to an episode of rockford files this film was revolting i viewed it with no ill will at the outset and in fact expected a pleasant experience but the misrepresentation of the southern characters from the ridiculously fraudulent southern drawl to the lilting comedic way their faith was portrayed was inexcusable right down to it's end which was completely devoid of any character sentiment it failed in every place that o'connor's book shined and resonated the actors portraying the southern policemen may as well have been eating smothered hot dogs from nyc street stands and quoting godfather the one redeeming acting performance was ned beatty's lively and dead on representation of hoover shoates a religious con artist who hears moates preaching the church of christ without christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities o'connor's powerful book is most well known for it's creepy religious undercurrent that jibes the seemingly lifeless cadaver of faith mr huston's film is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions as they are understood by me and most of her fans if i may be so bold as to say so while i acknowledge that i can't know exactly what the author wished to convey i have enough affection for her and her works to desire to remain a fan if i viewed wise blood the way mr huston apparently did i would have thrown it in the trash for flannery's sake and mine i forgive you john huston the forgetting that will take some time
<START> laughed a lot because it is so incredibly bad sorry folks but definitely one of the worst movies i have ever seen i know it is low budget but anyway the actors behave like playing in a soap the dialogues are absolutely crappy and the last time i have seen such odd pictures was at a trash nite at some youth video festival ten years ago i really appreciate that people gather together and shoot cheap movies but at least a certain amount of quality should be accomplished but at least one good thing the first three minutes of the movie were quiet interesting and looked okay and the score was really worth listening to the dvd cover promised a lot but that is by far the best this film has to offer
<START> i missed the entire season of the show and started watching it on abc website during the summer of 2007 i am absolutely crazy about the show i think the entire cast is excellent it's one of my favorite show ever i just checked the abc program lineup for this fall and did not see it on the schedule that is really sad i hope they will bring it back maybe they are waiting until bridget moynahan has her baby or is it only my wishful thinking br br i read some of the comments posted about the show and see so many glowing remarks similar to mine i certainly hope that abc will reconsider its decision or hopefully another station will pick it up
<START> this film is the worst film i have ever seen the story line is weak i couldn't even follow it the acting is high schoolish the sound track is irritating the attempts at humor are not the editing is horrible the credits are even slow i would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of film don't waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting
<START> many critics have felt offended that r w fassbinder has portrayed both protagonist wilkie and the nazis in this movie in a human like manner connoisseurs of other fassbinder films however will realize that lili marleen 1981 belongs to fassbinder's women movies like the marriage of maria braun 1979 and lola 1981 fassbinder was convinced that stories can be told much better with women than with men because according to fassbinder while men usually fulfill their determined roles in society women are capable of thinking in a dialectic manner dialectics however means that there is not only a thesis and its antithesis like usually in our black and white world but a synthesis where the oppositions coincide moreover dialectic means that because of the third instance of synthesis the absolute opposition of the difference between thesis and antithesis is abolished concretely speaking starting from a dialect point of view and portraying the fascist state the underground fighters must necessarily use the basic means like the rulers do and between offenders and victims there is thus a chiastic relation so that every offender is also victim and every victim is also offender fassbinder has illustrated this abstract scheme that transcends classical logic in his play the city the garbage and the death 1975 which was filmed by daniel schmid under the title shadow of angels 1976 br br therefore approaching an a priori controversial topic like nazi germany in a dialectic manner the depiction of this time in the form of a movie gets even more controversial especially for people who cannot or do not want to see that our recognition of the world is by far not exhausted with a primitive light switch schema but needs the third instance of synthesis as controlling instance of its opposite members thesis and antithesis the mutual relationship between offenders and victims has to scrutinized since it is simply not true that the offenders are the bad ones and the victims the good ones in a synthetic viewpoint the bad ones participate on the goodness as the good ones participate on the badness they are mutually related in a world view based on classical logic a relation between good and bad cannot even been established and in an ethics based on this insufficient system of logic the bad conscience of the survivors of nazi germany feeling illogically enough responsible for the deeds of their ancestors exclude the possibility of a relationship between the two extremes and thus a synthesis in the form a new evaluation based on this relationship as well from fassbinder's dialectic viewpoint it follows that neither lili marleen nor lola nor maria braun can be condemned for their misuse of the ruling system for their private purposes because they don't misuse them they just use them in the opposite since victims must repeat the actions of the offenders as the offenders must repeat the actions of the victims because good and bad are no longer simple mirror images of one another like in two valued logic their strategies are legitimated by the chiastic structure of a logic that describes our world that is not black and white at all much better than a black and white logic
<START> i gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned from the domestic violence to sexuality and many of the taboos therein outside of the gore i really would not call this horror so much as i would science fiction br br it's bleak depressing and hopeless while i don't mind a less than cheery ending i'm really very tired of the humans suck clichÃ© that's central to every movie i know you can't get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self hatred as a member of the human race but how's 'bout as a writer director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the aliens killing the human race are evil right now if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die just go out find a lake and swim 'til your arms are tired this way you won't be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me i deserve to die for being alive it's silly not thoughtful and boring
<START> ok so chuck norris somehow found a way to get this sequel produced i have one question why who read this script and said sound's great original this movie is regurgitated crap that i wouldn't tarnish my toilet bowel with of course it is another story following in the tradition of mia invasion usa walker texas ranger delta force and so on in which chuck norris of course is the one man who can same america from some bad guys he doesn't even need a gun most times it's stupid patriotic jargon that stales the mind big surprise that the only one who will direct these norris film's is chuck's son eric eric norris has primarily worked on all his father's films and tv shows doesn't this strike anyone as a sign that he has no directing talent afterall he's directing the same people as before in the same stories as before only difference is the characters' names if this is supposed to make me patriotic and cheer for the usa than our country is in much worse shape than i ever imagined hopefully this will be the nail in chuck norris's acting coffin
<START> to sat how awful the shield is you'd have to write pages and pages so suffice it to say that it is a monument to bad directing br br when directors go awry should have been the title of this production indeed directors are supposed to infuse their work with a sense of visual style and story telling that propels the story forward br br how is constantly shaking the camera and playing with the zoom lens a style how is it propelling the story forward of course there's also the editing by random numbers nonsense apparently it's become hip to just cut randomly br br i guess it's too much work to do good editing br br well that made it too much work for most people to watch the shield which languished as one of the most over hyped and unwatched shows of all time
<START> white chicks hold on why couldn't they have dressed as black chicks oh yeah they wouldn't look different at all can anyone give me one wayans movie where they haven't dressed up as ladies don't be a menace doesn't count jack white and michael costanza ghost wrote that the other norton trio members acted as directors br br in white chicks there's never really any jokes it's just the wayans acting like girls for 2 hours there's no setups no punchlines and no laughs there is a lot of i think i'm gonna play some time crisis 3 at least for me there was 5 times to be exact br br somebody has to tell kenan ivory damon marlon shawn damien the only talented one kim rakeesha george w and osama bin wayans to stop making movies its only hurting the o zone layer br br verdict 1 2 out of
<START> this film might have weak production values but that is also what makes it so good the special effects are gross out and well done my favorite part of the movie had to be chrissy played by janelle brady she is super hot and also has a good nude scene robert prichard as the leader of the gang is hilarious as are the other members this film is actually trying to make a point by saying that nuclear waste plants are bad 4 10 fair comedy gross out film
