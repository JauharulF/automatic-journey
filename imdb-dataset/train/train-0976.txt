<START> a team of archaeologists uncover a real treasure Â the crown of the queen of sheeba from egypt the crown is to be transferred via steamship to san francisco but it won't be an easy journey there are plenty of would be thieves who would love to get their hands on the priceless jewels contained in the crown fortunately for all involved mr moto is on hand to guard the crown on its journey however that doesn't mean someone won't try to get their hands on the treasure br br after the disappointment of mr moto's gamble i went into mr moto takes a vacation hoping for the best but admittedly fearing the worst but within the first 10 seconds of the film i knew i would find it more enjoyable i'm a sucker for a 1930s style mystery that features anything to do with archaeological digs in egypt and seeing moto disguised as a german archaeologist imagine that peter lorre playing a german the beginning scenes really drew me in while the movie may have quickly shifted to the less exotic san francisco it remained just as enjoyable dark sinister characters lurking in the rainy night gunshots fired from open windows that narrowly miss the hero's head sophisticated and supposed foolproof alarm systems just begging for someone to test them and master criminals believed to be dead Â these are the kind of elements found in a lot of the really good 1930s mysteries that i love and mr moto takes a vacation's got 'em all a couple other bonuses for me included the always enjoyable lionel atwill in a nice little role comic relief from g p huntley that's actually funny and a return to form for mr moto i've already mentioned his disguise in the movie's opening scenes well the athletic moto comes out near the film's finale moto is a like a whirling dervish of activity as he goes after his prey all this and i haven't even mentioned the wonderful performance turned in by lorre any way you look at it mr moto takes a vacation is a winner br br as much as i hate that the mr moto series had to end after this installment it's understandable when you think about it wwii was just around the corner and after pearl harbor a movie with a japanese hero wouldn't have gone over very well at least the mr moto series ended on a very positive note
<START> zodiac killer 2005 was an interesting film from german born director ulli lommel he directs produced and co stars in this latest production not only does he manage to make an interesting film on the cheap but he reaches a new low when herr lommel works in footage from nearly his entire film catalog i have seen film clips from boogeyman i and ii war birds tenderness of the wolf brain waves and cocaine cowboys even andy warhol makes a cameo from beyond the grave courtesy of this film even though he uses plenty of old footage he works them in well and very creatively might i add br br the film follows a young man who copies the original zodiac killer he also corresponds with a writer ulli lommel who originally wrote about the serial killer during the late sixties and early seventies the writer's friend david hess helps him to try and find this wannabe zodiac can this killer be stopped will the writer put two and two together and reclaim some of his old glory is david hess still the man you'll have to find out for yourself and watch the zodiac killer br br this film is not about the original zodiac killer i have also heard people whine about this film being shot on video so what the director's old school artistic style outshines the fact that it's shot on video my only complaint was the over use of stock footage from herr lommel's earlier films but i understand why wink wink don't believe the hype this is a gritty and street level horror film like the disclaimer in the beginning states this film does nor glorify murder you got to like that statement br br highly recommend for ulli lommel fans
<START> the shooter was a different type of film for michael dudikoff although normally associated with action flicks that incorporate martial arts this film because it was a western enabled him to display that he is a far more capable actor than certain formula story lines have allowed br br the major problem of course is that the film does not allow any solid character development the fleshing in is really left to the viewer we can only guess at the sadness that has made the shooter whose real name is michael atherton the killer that he is a killer mind you that a little town terrorized by a local bully welcomes as a hero who can release it from its misery
<START> i'm amazed we see even one nay sayer criticizing this old film we don't ordinarily get good opera films and here is a true grand opera rendition understandably the visuals are not great it's dated but as opera it can't be faulted and i'm an opera buff i can't even detect one lip sync if we didn't know that was tebaldi in the audio nothing would convince me it isn't sophia loren she does everything with flair her dark makeup is fine and she brought the role to gorgeous life the rest of the cast is wonderful as is that stunning ballet troupe most of the actors are excellent loren truly marvelous her rival amneris is also terrific whoever didn't care for this 1953 job is shamefully remiss verdi would have enjoyed it naturally renata tebaldi as aida is the engine behind the scenes i love this old movie
<START> and thats about all that is this thing is slow the actors have ability they just don't seem motivated to put forth the effort the plot isn't that great and is hampered further by the aforementioned slowness of it all the accents when there are any are british uh lots of these folks are supposed to be danes ok ok accents aren't that important but language is i don't think they used words like yeah and ok in beowulf's day and that supposedly way cool weapon his king gave him did he ever reload that thing did he ever sight it in or was beowulf just that bad an aim well his aim did at least match the computer graphics used in generating the monsters those were rather off too bad special effects bright spot just one that i can think of marina sirtis has held up well over the years
<START> there's a theory of time that posits that all the moments that ever existed and will exist actually exist right now it's a bit too much to wrap your head around but perhaps a bit of a comfort to those who wish they could go back to a simpler time and place for barbara jean trenton ida lupino that time was twenty five years earlier the mid 1930's when her youth and glamor held the greatest promise for my part if i could travel through time it would be back to the 1950's when i grew up maybe to a place like willoughby but that's another episode br br one thing that wouldn't be so special about 1959 would involve dealing with all that clunky machinery just to watch an episode of the twilight zone how many reels do you think it would take to catalog the entire series and then find a particular story you wanted to watch i guess you have to consider the trade offs convenience versus simplicity having it right now or taking the time to spool it up to the exact spot where the story begins popping in a cd has it's advantages br br i'm a little surprised that rod serling would pen a story that so closely resembled sunset boulevard ida lupino's character mirror imaged norma desmond just a bit too closely to be considered an original concept martin balsam portrays very much a similar character to erich von stroheim the husband turned butler who's loyalty is unquestioned where the story diverges has to do with the way danny balsam and sall ted de corsia challenge barbara jean to get with reality and clear the cobwebs that paralyze her existence br br fortunately for us viewers ida lupino had no such reservations about taking parts that were 'not big but a nice showcase' it's a real treat to watch any episode of the twilight zone and get to see who pops up from days gone by sometimes you get a two fer like you have here with lupino and balsam celebrities who sometimes made their mark before the series began and sometimes after combined with the stories that the program produced it's not surprising that they still manage to entertain so well today
<START> der todesking is not one of my favorite jorg buttgereit film but still is an interesting film dealing with suicide and it's reasons and ramifications those looking for a gore fest or exploitation in the style of the nekromantik films or schramm will probably be disappointed der todesking is definitely an art house style film so those that need linear explainable narratives need not apply br br the basic concept of der todesking is that there is an episode for each day of the week that revolves around a strange chain letter that apparently causes people to commit suicide interspersed with scenes of a slowly decomposing corpse br br there are some very well done and thought provoking scenes including the man talking about the problems with his wife and the concert massacre which unfortunately lost some of it's power on me because i was too busy laughing at the scorpions look alike band on stage but seriously this is a sometimes beautiful the scene that shows different angles of that huge bridge is particularly effective especially if you understand the significance of the scene and that the names shown are of people that actually committed suicide from jumping from the bridge sometimes confusing sometimes silly the she wolf of the ss rip off is pretty amusing sometimes harrowing i found the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park about his wife particularly effective film that is more of an experience then just entertainment as many of these art films are meant to be still i didn't find der todesking to be as strong as nekromantik or schramm and would probably put it on relatively even footing with nekromantik 2 in terms of my personally enjoyment level definitely worth a look to any buttgereit or art film fan if you dig this type of film check out subconscious cruelty in my opinion the best art house horror film that i've seen 7 10 for der todesking
<START> the film is a collection of cliche's on just about anything out there it has no focus whatsoever no goals no real message symbolism is pushed over the top and stereotyping is abundant and outrageous this movie can't resist the temptation of making drama where non exists every small exchange of words turns immediately into a lengthy unjustified dialog that is so typical of an acting class rehearsal where there is no substance to this exchange the actors regardless of how good they are normally can't help but compensate with exaggerated emotion aka raising the stakes over acting to put it simply the directing is of no help here nothing can save this non story it is forced faked and boring to tears inaccuracies in portaraying punk rock with the who piercings and flashy 90's outfits characters wander without a role detail and motive locations are arbitrary this is boogie nights cum the good fellas cum saturday night fever with meaning and art ripped out br br good dp i'll give it that br br some films have flaws this film is lee's flaw he sold out like the rest of them became irrelevant he has nothing of interest to say anymore br br i have no desire to see anything again from this guy whom i'll refrain from naming from now on
<START> very nice action with an interwoven story which actually doesn't suck interesting enough to merit watching instead of skipping past to get to the good parts having jenna jameson and asia carrere helps liven it up too jenna in that sweater and those glasses is just astounding worth picking up just to see her
<START> that's right a movie written directed and produced by fred tepper and family fred should have known better having worked the sets of 'titantic' and 'dogma' br br so the plot there are some scientists and some forest rangers and a hot chick with huge fake breasts they are all really bad at their jobs including the hot chick who i think is supposed to be a photographer but who cares because she wears a bikini one of the forest rangers comments that the scientists are professional people which is good because it would be horrible if they were professional grubs or jellybeans or ewoks br br they are hiking through the woods in search of some strange ape like bones and no one even once mentions that the bones just might be those of the infamous bigfoot they just wander around and one of the rangers unabashedly hits on the hottie we all hope he dies real soon along with his sister who's meant to be the cute naive one but is really just annoying then they gasp find a sasqu i mean ape like animal burial ground of course no mentions that it might just be bigfoot bones they're messing with i guess scientists and forest rangers just don't think about those types of things br br then sasquatch and his tribe get really angry and kill all the people we dislike chases the other losers away and buries his great aunt muriel and cousin josh who died in an unfortunate trout accident all over again br br insipid boring dialogue i zoned out several times inane plot unlikable characters bad cgi a man in a monkey suit would look better and acting that just wasn't very good all add up to make a movie i won't be watching again br br you check it out though it's good for some unintentional laughs
<START> probably the only thing that got the movie up to a four for me is the fact that i love peter falk one of the world's great portrayers of bumbling incompetence and yet he is one of the only anchors that prevents this from being a chaotic disaster as pops romano he provides a respectable mix of gangster charm and straight man to chris kattan's manic foolishness respectable performances are also offered by richard roundtree as the harried boss vinessa shaw as a talented female fbi agent bouncing her head off a glass ceiling and fred ward as falk's advisor and benedict arnold br br the plot concept actually has some wonderful possibilities and in the hands of a young steve martin or chevy chase could have proved a great comedic vehicle kattan who seems to idolize ernest or pee wee herman just provides a muddled mess sadly peter berg and chris penn who portray his misfit brothers both fall far short of their proven capability br br there are some very funny scenes but they are far too few and separated by way too many boring ones what i truly miss here is what always attracted me to the leslie neilsen movies there is no 'second level' of wit riding over the slapstick no cultural references that only the adults get no double entendre it is just silly br br and by the way this doesn't all mean that i am recommending it for your 9 year old because hopefully they have better taste and less fascination with some of their body parts and their functions
<START> one scene demonstrates the mentality of terminator woman pretty well karen sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain's camp karen runs across an armed guard who points his gun at her but after a few seconds throws it away and challenges her to a fight karen kicks him in the balls picks up the gun and runs away then again when a film is directed by a martial artist and written produced by another member of his family you know you shouldn't expect too much karen sheperd and jerry trimble do get some amusing banter going early on and the film might have turned out better if it had focused more on their love hate relationship but after about 20 minutes they get separated and the film slows to a crawl and even with the occasional fight scene to liven things up it lacks excitement the finale has trimble fighting qissi inside a cave and sheperd going womano a womano against the beautiful ashley hayden on a speedboat but the fights are intercut in a way that breaks their flow and diminishes their value on the positive side kudos to the costuming department for giving karen the chance to show spectacular cleavage throughout the film 1 2
<START> pretty disappointing prequel to the first two films it's got none of the suspense of the first nor the interest of the second by concentrating on the guys who 'run' the cube it basically takes away any of the sense of tension inside the cube as we simply don't care about the characters inside much of the film is simply boring and it only becomes truly terrible with the introduction of the glass eyed superior and the green eyed crazy marine after that though it just descends into over the top unintentional hilarity the ending is fitting though tying it back into the first one in an indirect way the script is terrible the acting mediocre at best and the direction unimpressive a much lesser follow up
<START> for all the hoopla respect and recognition this film gets from kung fu historians it still lacks glaringly in a couple critical areas action and fight scenes but i must say that the plot is probably the best and most original i've ever seen in a martial arts film five deadly venoms without a doubt is a must see not only that a movie you can watch again and again but i also must say that after watching it you feel it could have been even better it somehow leaves you wanting something you want more the producer chang cheh sets up the storyline beautifully for a potential masterpeice but doesn't follow through with giving us more of the action we want the fighting styles in the movie really captures the viewer centipede snake scorpion lizard toad and they are shown but battles are noticeably short the toad and snake styles are particularly intriguing and should have been showcased much much more in fact the toad is killed off by the middle of the movie interestingly enough with this movie the absence of constant action or fighting leads to development of a great plot this is one of the few kung fu films where you are really interested in the storyline and care about the outcome this movie has a dark and vicious tone to it and you are drawn into the vibe sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the movie and adds to the movies feel to start off the movie and to introduce the poison clan producer chang cheh takes us to a grimy dungeon the ending fight scenes are certainly good but seem muffled and somehow you expected more still though this movie is one of shaw brothers best and is quite enjoyable my overall impression of the movie would conclude with this the styles the fighters used are merely shown to us and not showcased in detail sad thing is the director had the goods for something extraordinary right at his fingertips and didn't expand on it i am left wondering what could have been with this movie still one of the best though 8 out of 10 on the scale
<START> i remember watching attack when it first came out and caught it again recently the sci fi channel has run worse but not by much a shameless ripoff of jurassic park attack substitutes sabertooth cats for dinosaurs and they are on the loose devouring as many extras as possible the cgi is pretty bad and closeups of prosthetic cat heads are laughable we get some gore which helps a little wait until you see how the mad scientist who started this whole mess gets it other than robert carradine who has very little to do the cast is unknown apparently this was shot in fiji nice work if you can get it reminds me of all those low budget monster stvs that were popular in the 80s and 90s
<START> the choke starts as a rock band known as the choke prepare for a gig at a nightclub called 'club 905' owned run by guy johnson andrew parker lead singer dylan sean cook guitar player mike jason mckee plan to tell the other band members bass player london brooke bailey drummer nancy tom olson that they are both going solo their services won't be needed any longer once at the club dylan prepares but mike doesn't show up the gig turns into a disaster then just as the band think things couldn't get any worse they find a dead body in the cellar that all the doors have been locked so they can't get out that they can't trust anyone as a mysterious killer begins picking them off one by one br br produced directed by juan a mas the choke is a standard by the numbers teen slasher that really doesn't have anything going for it the script by jessica dolan susannah lowber not too many horror films out there penned by ladies has some surprisingly good character's in it some nifty dialogue but while it's much better than a lot of modern shot on a camcorder type horror in that respect it's so slow boring that even a few interesting character's can't come anywhere close to saving it as one would expect all the usual teen slasher clichÃ©s are used from the isolated location the victims can't escape from the cast of good looking teenagers who keep splitting up a few murders a really poor twist ending that tries to mimic something like scream 1996 be surprising but doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you think about it logically they couldn't have done some of the things they were supposed to to make matters even worse i guessed who the killer was fairly early on even though i don't want to boast i was spot on then there's the fact that the makers of the choke felt that it's audience would be entertained by showing endless well it feels endless while watching it scenes of teenagers walking around dark corridors doing nothing in particular i am sorry but there is only so many scenes like this that i can take before it starts to become tedious the kill count is low at first they all decide to stick together good idea but then they all just randomly decide to split up go their separate ways bad idea when there's a killer on the loose the pace is lethargic the kill scenes are unimaginative to top it all off the twist ending is poor br br director mas does alright the film looks ok for the most part although there are the odd occasions where he uses some annoying post production editing technique like slow motion or frame skipping the gore levels aren't really up to scratch there's some blood splatter a guy with a hole in his chest a few dead bodies someone impaled on some metal poles most of the kills happen off screen with the axe kill at the end a good example of the film not actually showing anything since the film is about a rock band there's quite a rock orientated soundtrack with some truly horrible horrible rock songs used on it i am sorry rock fans but to my ears this crap is just noise pollution it's not scary there's no real atmosphere the lack of blood gore is just inexcusable when the rest of the film is so bad br br with a supposed budget of about 1 000 000 the choke is well made with reasonable production values it looks cheap to be sure but not as cheap as many low budget horror films look shot in a place called spokane in washington apparently the acting is one of the films strongest points as it's generally pretty good all round i mean no one is going to win an oscar but it ain't half bad br br the choke is a throughly routine scream style teen slasher that has one of the weakest twist endings ever a criminal lack of blood gore violence nudity dead bodies i mean if a slasher hasn't got any sex or gore then what's the point those are the only things that the average slasher is worth watching for right
<START> let me start by stating that i usually do like renny harlin's directing style for the most part and that the cinematographer should be commended for some the shots unlike harlin's elm street 4 and die hard 2 which i really liked there is something that is missing from this movie that my friends is a script the dialogue in movies like this is always pretty awful but this one takes the gold medal for stupidity there are so many awful lines in this movie i don't even want to have to remember any of them not just that but the execution of the lines is pathetic and seems more suited toward a bad porn movie than an action adventure it's almost like harlin thought that if they slowed down the words being said they could improve the script wrong again br br the sad part is that there is some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue stallone has never been a favorite of mine but when he is acting circles around lithgow turner and the worst of the bunch rooker there is something wrong with this picture lithgow played one of the best villains in ricochet yet comes across as someone who can't act to save his life here how is that possible i've always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by stallone who himself still phoned in his performance turner's part is so small and pointless but she still manages to appear lost on screen michael rooker can act i know this because i have witnessed it in days of thunder but he seems like he is reading his lines from cue cards has it come to this when rooker and lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking i just wanted the movie to end right there or have them both amazingly find their acting ability unfortunately neither of those things occurred br br which brings me back to harlin who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters it's his fault that i was never drawn into this movie at all because he should have made the people actually act the script is not very good but still the actors' performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director i don't care how much was paid for the special effects which for the most part are good you still can't just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting br br plus the pacing of this movie seems to be off the opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all i mean i understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the bells and whistles of the plane scene but i really didn't care if they got the money or not in that scene if the bad guy's would have won early maybe i wouldn't have had to witness one of the worst movies ever
<START> i cannot believe how popular this show is i consider myself an avid sci fi fan i have read countless sci fi novels and have enjoyed many sci fi movies and tv shows i really wouldn't even consider this true sci fi every episode i have sat through was like a lame watered down version of a star trek episode minus anything that might make it interesting or exciting br br it's basically a bunch of people standing around in army fatigues talking about something boring who occasionally go through the stargate and end up on a planet that looks just like earth with people who look and sound just like humans it seemed extremely low budget the characters are all forgettable one dimensional cutouts and the many attempts at humor fall flat it reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it trying to be funny but he is not it is just sad br br the movie was terrible as well there is so much you can do with a portal through space yet every place the army people go is boring this shows no imagination i actually thought the tv series alien nation from a few years back based on the movie alien nation was much better that show actually had good story lines and decent characters i wasn't crazy about alien nation but compared to this overrated crap it was great br br also unlike the great new battlestar galactica series stargate copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely they should have at least updated the cheesy toilet flushing special effect of whenever somebody goes through the stargate
<START> ok i've seen plenty of movies dealing with witches and the occult but this one was just plain weird this movie starts out as this cult of witches led by a really bad orson wells playing the staring role couldn't they have gotten somebody that looked and acted more like a satanist he just did not belong in this movie at all but anyhow the coven takes a new member and stabs a doll that resembles somebody and makes her have a miscarrage the lady that had the miscarrage and her husband go off to a place called lillith on busness and the lady meanwhile is seeing an image of her sister or whoever it is calling to her and warning her to stay away from there and to never use her powers there or she will die the couple after they get settled down in the strange town discover that all the inhabitants are all witches and she becomes nosey and afraid of all of her neighbors and friends then strange things start to happen as the lady discovers a funeral taking place on a hill that suddenly disapears that was creepy as well as seeing the little boy belonging to orson wells at the playgroud that he later asks the lady to help him bring back to life the lady soon tries to escape the town but only to find herself traped by it's inhabitants and powers and finds herself ignoring all of what the spirit tries to warn her about this movie is ok it's has it's moments of suspense but it really could have done much better than to have orson in there
<START> don't waste your time on this film it could have been good but the ending was one of the lamest i've ever seen i seriously have to wonder how the people involved with the making of this film could've looked at that final scene and thought yeah now there's an ending and patted themselves on the back about it to me it seemed more like they just ran out of ideas they built up the final scenes to have a cool twist but instead just let the whole build up fall flat on it's face when the last shot faded to black and i heard the credit music starting i was in shock i could not believe what i was seeing and that someone could even call that an ending the best thing anyone could do with this film is rewrite the end and give it some substance seriously i'd really love to get whoever came up with that one in a room look them in the face and say wtf
