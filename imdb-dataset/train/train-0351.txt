<START> i love this movie jouvet arletty blier carnÃ© almost everything has already been said about the movie but there is one detail i'd like to shed some light onto no footage of the real still standing hÃ´tel du nord is it still i heard it was to be demolished has been used for the movie the whole scene has been rebuilt on set the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the st martin canal for several weeks
<START> possible spoilers although done before and better in 'midnight express' and 'return to paradise' brokedown palace still strikes a chord with me br br here we have the tale of two young girls who travel through thailand and get arrested on charges of trafficking drugs was it clare danes' alice was it kate beckinsale's darlene was it the handsome stranger whom they met on their journey none of that really matters for this is a tale of friendship and trust and the limits they can be stretched to throw in bill pullman as an unenthusiastic lawyer and jacqueline kim as his thai bride and better lawyer than he is and we have a nice little story that holds the audience's attention br br brokedown palace is nothing extraordinary or notorious for any reason it is not an original concept it doesn't show sensationalised violence that leads to the wannabe avant garde crowd talking about it's gritty realism or hard hitting truths it is merely a good story with some fine performances bill pullman is weakest with his lazy drawl and gravelly way of talking i was quite bored with the character br br kate beckinsale while decent is nothing spectacular she acts well but it's not exactly a memorable performance br br jacqueline kim however is in fine form crafting a likable and defined character where really there is not much to work with br br but make no mistake this is clare danes' movie i've long been a fan of her work and this is no change she captivates in every scene she appears and were it not for her the film would probably stoop into boring fare i particularly applaud her performance in the scene between her and darlene's father br br the film also has a brilliant soundtrack br br 7 out of 10
<START> the entire thing is very beautiful to look at the european location shooting was a good idea the lead actors are attractive the score is servicable br br but then they spoke and the non plot developed and it was all downhill from there pacino is sleepwalking and keller keeps talking about how bored she is hello dear you're not alone when he does a mae west imitation you might have to hide your face its that painful to watch br br i can't imagine how either actor or director sydney pollack got involved with this or a better question why it ended up stinking so bad br br since death is represented in almost every scene one way or another maybe you're supposed to have low enjoyment here maybe its supposed to feel as empty and cold as death but i still can't recommend it
<START> there's tons of good looking women in this flick but alas this movie is nudity free grrrrrrrrrr strike one br br ahem one story in this film takes place in 1971 then why the hell are the main characters driving a kia sportage hello continuity anyone br br as you might know this movie was released in stereoscopic 3d and it is the most hideous effect i have ever seen i'm not sure if someone botched the job on this but there was no 3d just double vision blurs i didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3d movies hunting season and camp blood sure the 3d in those ones sucked too but with them i could see a semblance of 3d effect br br this thing is a big ball of nothing br br and whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear eating dame yum i'd like to see more of her in movies as well looks like janet margolin at a young age purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr br br
<START> this is without a doubt the worst most idiotic horrible piece o' crap i have ever watched br br this movies plot is that some guy goes crazy and dresses up as santa claus and kills people because he saw his mother give his father oral sex while he was dressed as santa clause that is why he went insane is it just me or is that the worst damn reason for someone to go insane like ever and that's not the only thing i'm being serious when i say nothing happens in this damn movie nothing until like 1 hour and 15 minutes of it have gone by br br there's an entire friggin scene where he glues a friggin santa beard on to him it's a friggin minute long who the hell wants to see that however i must say the ending of this movie made me crap myself laughing at it so if you see this movie on tv or something come back in like 1 hour and 20 minutes just to watch without a doubt the worst ending in all of cinematic history and i'm serious about that br br it's not even so good its bad it's tedious it's idiotic it made me want to break the vcr it's just not worth your time also i'm sure every other review mentioned this but the actress who played the mother on home improvement was in this movie for a split second you want to know how bad this movie is i'd rather watch home improvement for sixty six hours then even look at this movies cover ever again
<START> have you ever or do you have a pet who's been with you through thick and thin who you'd be lost without and who you love no matter what betcha never thought they feel the same way about you br br wonderful wonderful family film if you have a soft spot for animals this is guaranteed to make you cry no matter your age i used to watch this movie all the time when i was a little kid and i find that now at age sixteen i love it as much as i did then i could never decide on a favorite character then and i still don't think i can i love all three of the animals the dialogue seems very real and comfortable like a loving but feuding family i do love chance and how at the end he says that he has a family at last cheesy yes but one must remember that this is meant to be a family film and it fulfills that role perfectly sassy has just the perfect dose of sassiness and shadow is the perfect leader role model to the young adventurous chance br br the animals way outshine the humans but of course most of the teary moments are to be had during an interaction with them ie rescuing molly and the end not to mention the incredible soundtrack that gives each moment even more emotion and an accompanying heart swelling feeling i give this 9 10 to be compared to and even rated better than cats and dogs and babe
<START> a possible spoiler or two br br soul survivors is quite possibly the worst theatrical released movie ever nothing makes sense at all there's some plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead the entire movie is just a bunch of random shots of things that don't really tie together by the end of the film br br tha acting is non existent the camera work is jerky and the script is so confusing it just makes the movie even harder to watch br br i kept waiting for something to tie the movie together but nothing came definitely the worst film of the year 1 2 stars
<START> yes this is one of those movies so terrible so insipid so trite that you will not be able to stop laughing i have watched comedies good comedies and laughed less than my wife and i laughed at this movie the other comments give the idea well enough the characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class was in charge the acting oh the acting talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses br br but the rat yes the big rat why we didn't get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me often the 'big one' isn't shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew up so much money i surmise however that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy running around dressed up like a woodchuck with third world dentistry br br the most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene after figuring out that the rats couldn't stand loud noise migraines from the bad acting the main dude rigs up a fire alarm to send the rats into a frenzy if you've ever wanting to see a pair of rats waltz while blood squirts out of their heads like a geyser this film is for you really you need to rent it and see for yourself br br but not for more than 99Â¢ ok
<START> holes is an awesome movie i love it a lot and it's one of my favorite films it's one of the few flicks produced by disney that isn't cheesy holes is generally a very cool motion picture i wish disney would make more pictures like it holes is indeed a rare breed of disney flicker shows that is cool don't get the wrong idea i don't mean to bad mouth disney but most of it's stuff is aimed towards kids and that's okay children deserve to have their entertainment too but disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail but not with holes it's the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think it's corny really it's the kind of movie that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate to br br holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge i hope disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this
<START> spoilers redicules slasher film that makes no sense at all with a killer running around dressed in a black robe and wearing what looks like a pull over peter lorre rubber mask were told early in the movie almost the very first scene that young beth morgan was in rehab due to heavy drug use after her boyfriend was murdered in tennyson collage about a year ago br br it's also brought out that fbi agent sacker's jeff conaway who's obsessed in catching the killer daughter was also murdered in tennyson around the same time by the time the movie do you wanna know a secret is over it's never explained just what those two killings back in connecticute has to do with the slaughter in florida of some half dozen collage students a year later other that the killer at least in the murder of beth's boyfriend wore the same silly halloween outfit br br at spring break in the sunshine state the six students spend their vacation at a beach house and before you know it they start getting knocked off one at a time starting with computer geek brad clyton chad allen the killing even spill over into town with a number of people who have nothing to do with the targeted student including the police chief gavin jack mcgee getting sliced open br br the masked killer saves beth for last in this weird ceremony at a deserted church in what looks like the florida everglades he then finally reveals who his is and what he intentions are which make as much sense as the movie does none trying to scare it's audience all the movie does is confuse and bewilder it with a number of not too convincing slasher scenes the most effective ones having the victim oz washington tom jay jones survive at least three attempts on his life and ending up together with agent sacker the hero in the film br br oz also had a vicious cut on is foot from a large splinter of glass that almost cut it in half and crippled him but later he miraculously recovered after getting arrested for a murder he didn't commit in fact he had it out two more time with the killer with him not as much as having a slight limp in his walk it also made no sense at all why oz and beth went on their own to tack down and catch the killer instead of calling the police with a cellphone that oz had instead br br beth's boyfriend who loses his head over her in the movie hank ford joseph lawrence is also very unconvincing as well as the two girls at the beach house they together with with beth oz end up being the killers victims and then somehow disappearing from sight for a moment you didn't know if they were really killed at all or if it was some kind of hallucination on oz's or the local police part until the off the wall final scene where they popped up in the church br br we also get an insight on a previous relationship between tina and hank with her drunk and acting obnoxious trying to get it on with hank as beth walks in without hank and tina even noticing her that seemed to have upset beth even more then her boyfriend being murdered at the beginning of the movie
<START> here is the explanation screenwriter pamela katz gave me for why mvt introduced jg as a specific character in the film br br the historical record is very clear joseph goebbels was directly responsible for the release of the rosenstrasse prisoners so we needed a way to get goebbels himself into our film for a woman like lena a woman from an aristocratic family with connections it wasn't unthinkable that she would make an attempt to go to the top the idea of getting to goebbels wasn't impossible for her so that became our hook br br those of you who insist on seeing an actual sex act here can read my new thread below then fire away br br jan lisa huttner films for two
<START> i love occult horror and the great british hammer studios who delivered one of their greatest films with the devil rides out 1968 have proved to be more than capable in this field of horror this occult tenth episode of hammer's short running tv series hammer house of horror 1980 guardian of the abyss is indeed a creepy entry to the series director don sharp who had previously enriched the hammer oeuvre with the kiss of the vampire 1963 and rasputin the mad monk 1966 and furthermore directed two fu machu movies starring christopher lee is doubtlessly one of the better known names among the hhh directors and he also delivers here antiques dealer michael ray lonnen stumbles over a mysterious old scrying glass the scrying glass happens to be the object of desire of a devil worshiping cult who want to use it for their satanic rites when he shelters a beautiful young girl named allison rosalyn landor who is to be sacrificed by the cult michael gets into deeper trouble with the cult and their sinister leader john carson while this is not one of my absolute favorite episodes of hammer house of horror the best one clearly is the brilliant seventh episode the silent scream it is a very creepy and atmospheric one the plot has several interesting twists and stays suspenseful and uncanny throughout the film ray lonnen makes a good lead young rosalyin landor is convincing as the innocent beauty and john carson is truly creepy as the leader of the satanists overall guardian of the abyss is another interesting and creepy hhh tale and my fellow hammer fans should not miss it
<START> the woman in black is easily one of the creepiest british ghost stories ever made a young solicitor after arriving in a small town to handle a dead client's estate is haunted by a mysterious woman dressed all in black the film is loaded with extremely eerie atmosphere and the frights are calculated for and deliver the maximum effect possible the action keeps the viewer deeply involved and the finale is quite disturbing the acting is excellent and the tension is almost unbearable at times so if you want to see a truly creepy horror film give this one a look i dare anyone to watch the woman in black alone at night with the lights off highly recommended 10 out of 10
<START> this movie just pulls you so deeply into the two main characters i popped it into my laptop without even reading the cover let alone reviews and was intrigued for two solid hours two lost ships from two different worlds collide the sexual tension that brews between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable even without hardly any physical contact toward the end i couldn't decide which i wanted more our hero and heroine to pull off their caper or simply consummate their passion rml could've done without a curious subplot and a traditional 100 minutes would have been plenty i'm nitpicking though after a series of netflix blockbuster and local library duds this movie restored my faith in great film making
<START> first this film is not a thriller neither is it gripping taut it might have been so based on the script but the direction's slow pace makes it difficult to get into br br the plot itself is very interesting and ingenious unfortunately we only get a sense of how ingenious after the picture is over that leaves us with over two hours of long sequences with music playing over them punctuated by some action scenes that don't grab the viewer and cunning vixen scenes that inject a little more overt intelligence br br i wish this had been the fast paced thriller the box promised it would've been an outstanding film instead spike lee made it plod along through the end
<START> what a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be this is the type of film that i've been looking for ages particularly important for me was the fantastic looking chicago which i still keep thinking about the back cover doesn't do this film justice it's superb and in my top 5 for sure
<START> this movie surely has one of the strangest themes in history right up there with ed wood's impassioned defense of cross dressing in glen or glenda br br the subject playing bridge the park avenue set plays it the bohemians play it the russians who speak very questionable russian and have most unconvincing accents when they speak english play it at the restaurant where they work br br if one isn't interested in bridge one even despite the great cast isn't likely to be much interested in this bizarre movie br br loretta young and paul lukas are fine well frank mchugh is an unlikely ghost writer as lukas is an unlikely russian but they are all sunk by the fetishistic script
<START> i am extremely picky about the films i see i'd heard about moon child completely by accident i've been a fan of l'arc en ciel for some time and a fan of gackt and mizer only recently br br i finally found out the film was being re released and picked it up without a second thought br br being as critical as i am about films i will admit the action scenes can be somewhat hokey at times but they're meant too be as another user suggested it's the quintessential calm before the storm quoting gary oldman from leon without getting into the spoilers the film hit me extremely hard because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are limitless and as they often say true friendship is loyalty and like marriage it's until death do you part br br hyde and gackt give performances that showcase why they are able to commit such depth to their song lyrics their passion for music happens onto the big screen and in the process it creates an exemplary film that will reach into one's soul and evoke response emotionally br br upon seeing the film for the first time i realized it will probably remain in heavy rotation as far as my collection goes i want to encourage anyone reading this post to pick up the film if you want to get away from the current hollywood trend in film this takes an entirely new direction using classic yakuza film elements and how can you go wrong with a cameo from ryo ishibashi of takashi miike's audition and suicide club fame br br man i just can't say enough about this film but i'll stop here br br 10 10
<START> resident evil code veronica is a great well made video game it has great graphics very comfortable controls a great storyline and high fun factor the storyline to this is claire redfield gets taken to an island for trespassing on umbrella grounds and reaking havoc at they're main lab while looking for her brother code veronica's graphics are very good the fire and rain effects are great looking the controls are comfy but the button pattern doesnt fit the dreamcast control makeing it hard to get used to its still fun going around some wierd disturbing place shooting the guts out of zombies code veronica also has a little bit of romance between the two main characters you also get to play as chris redfield from resident evil 1 the sound in this game is better than ever for example even though i hate the new feature when the giant spiders crawl they're feet make a disturbing scampering sound and the guns sound alot more realistic great graphics outstanding story comfy controls and realistic sound makes resident evil code veronica a definite loved i give it a 10 out of 10
<START> i never fail to be amazed and horrified by the evil that has been predicated in the history of the world in the name of religion and it seems that the machinations of the catholic church in twentieth century ireland rank right up there near the top considering that the wisdom of history and modern times should have had some sobering effect br br a love divided is the story of a real family scarred by ignorant intolerance and prejudice all in the name of an inane church doctrine at the beginning of the film we are offered a view of the bucolic life in a small irish village in which sheila and sean cloney are happily married with two young children sean is catholic and sheila is protestant but she has no qualms with their children being raised as catholic there is no sign of any animosity between the catholics and protestants in the village the peaceful and loving relationships are soon shattered when sheila expresses the desire to have their older child attend the protestant school the local priest takes it upon himself to forbid this sin and soon has sheila's husband and the entire catholic population of the village turned against her as well as her father the local dairy farmer in an act of defiance and desperation sheila kidnaps her two daughters and flees from the area br br special note should be given to orla brady who plays sheila she gives an extremely powerful performance in which the viewer is drawn in to the emotional trauma in which she decides to reject the wishes of a husband she deeply loves in order to express her fervent desire to establish herself as independent from the pressures of the establishment on an equal footing is liam cunningham who plays sean for he gives a realistic portrait of a man not nearly as complex as his wife who is torn between his love for her and the influence of church and community br br if fiction this film would have been a compelling and interesting drama considering it is true it changes to a horrific tragedy in real life the people and the village never fully recovered from the events that took place there it took almost half a century for the church to acknowledge its negative role in the events and even though sheila and sean lived out their lives in the area they never fully recovered from what was done to them by the religious leaders and their fellow villagers br br whether it be denying basic rights to education of choice crashing planes into buildings subjugating women condemning whole races or just plain on torture and murder we humans certainly have the ability to use religion as a powerful negative force in our society
