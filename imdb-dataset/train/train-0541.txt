<START> good old black and white graham greene based people in dangerous times doing heroic and mysterious things hardly a shot fired or a punch thrown and a hundred time more interesting than the glop that's being minted by hollywood today bacall lights up the screen of course and boyer is entirely engaging they don't make movies like this any more
<START> on the contrary to the person listed above me i felt that this movie was really funny particularly in the scenes were there is a lot of mix up i don't want to give the plot and the storyline away to the people that haven't watched it yet but i will say that paresh rawal does not have an extensive role such as past priyadarshan movies for example hera pheri and hungama paresh rawal does an amazing part in the little role given to him john abraham does equally well akshay kumar has proved that he is no less in this movie like he had from waqt and almost all his movies after andaaz even though all three heroins in this movie were at a debut they did a pretty good job of acting particularly nargis who is very good looking and hot i would say that if you liked hungama or hera pheri this movie is a must watch
<START> i'm usually not too into a specific show save for the o c desperate housewives hey i am 20 but no kidding after one episode of reunion i was hooked br br i can't even say how bummed i was that it's time slot conflicted with bush's speech last night because i was really looking forward to the 1987 episode which will now air next thursday again that conflict was disadvantageous because being a new show it needs to build up a following and having the second episode pushed back a week kills some momentum br br that said tv doesn't always have to be emmy worthy to be enjoyable i don't expect reunion to take home any prizes but i do expect it will be able to capture my attention all season ever watch the first few episodes of a beloved show years later sometimes you wonder how you ever got hooked character building takes some time br br the one episode for each year idea is wonderful in my opinion the only other show i can recall doing something similar is 24 with each episode being an hour and having an eventful year is more realistic than a day that eventful please give this show a shot relax about art form it's just tv
<START> an unusual film from ringo lam and one that's strangely under appreciated the mix of fantasy kung fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven thru bodies is startling especially during the first ten minutes a horseback rider get chopped in two and his waist and legs keep riding the horse several horses get chopped up it's very unexpected br br the story is very simple fong and his shaolin brothers are captured by a crazed maniac general and imprisoned in the red lotus temple which seems to be more of a torture chamber then a temple the general has a similarity to kurtz in apocalypse now as he spouts warped philosophy and makes frightening paintings with human blood br br the production is very impressive and the setting is bleak blood is everywhere the action is very well done and mostly coherent unlike many hk action scenes from the time sometimes the movie veers into absurdity or the effects are cheesy but it's never bad enough to ruin the film br br find this one it's one of the best hk kung fu films from the early nineties just remember it's not child friendly
<START> even for a tired movie model as the nature vs man cycle that prevailed so predominantly in the 1970s ants falls miserably short of being even somewhat effective though entertaining for reasons it was not intending it is sooooo preposterous apparently these ants that are bulldozed near an inn have been eating poisonous waste for decades and have now adapted by emitting poisonous bites hundreds of these bites being fatal watching actors of some notoriety clumsily fall amidst tiny black specks is painfully funny in a not so good but very bad way so many scenes just look ludicrous a boy trying to fall in a dumpster whilst being attacked suzanne sommers crying out in horror while lounging in bed robert foxworth and lynda george breathing through pieces of wallpaper bernie casey faking a gam leg and the list goes on and on the peril shown ranges from ants crawling from a drain to black lines of ants all over the walls the cast for the film is not bad on paper but none of these actors seem to believe in the material poor myrna loy has to sit in a wheelchair through this horror i hope she found a good use for the money for it is obvious that was the only reason a woman of her pedigree would be in this nonsense although it is quite a bad film it is watchable once for me and does have many of those seventies bad film qualities start studded actors embarrassing themselves that made for tv feel and the dreaded creatures of nature reeking vengeance on man this time man must push his hand into a pile of ants to be affected really quite dreadful
<START> holy crap what a terrible terrible spanish thriller i've had it for about four years and finally started it the other night i watched an hour or so before heading to bed i was pretty intrigued by the whole thing i finished it last night and couldn't believe where i stopped it the night before literally i stopped it the second before the movie went completely downhill br br like i said i was pretty intrigued and curious as to where this mystery was going but stopped it right when simon receives the package in the bar i picked up when he opens up the package to reveal a laser gun and then plays a menacing game of laser tag whew then the big reveal is that the whole thing is a terrorist plot by role playing game nerds whew you can tell the spanish industry was definitely behind director mateo gil co writer of amenabar's two big previous hits there is an excellent score and great photography but this scenario reeks of silliness how anyone sat through the last 40 minutes with a straight face is beyond me
<START> thsi is one great movie probably the best movie i have ever seen i watch it over and over again i must give it 10 10 stars because like i said this is probably the best movie i have ever seen this movie popcorn coke best mix you can imagine if you want to watch some movie then i clearly recommend this one first i sawed it i liked it so i buy ed it and now i own it and watch it probably every day my sons like it and think that this is the best movie ever seen this movie is about guy in fantasy world i don't want to spoil all the movie so you can enjoy it after you read my text lovely movie lovely characters lovely story and just great stuff a must watch movie hope you enjoyed my comment cya br br jim make
<START> shamefully before i saw this film i was unfamiliar with helena bonham carter br br i had to do some research in order to assure myself she wasn't actually afflicted as was her character with well what she was afflicted with i was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady she pulled it of flawlessly br br who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants and needs of a unique young lady could be interpreted as tender and romantic well they can be when the right performers present them in the proper manner as they did in this wonderful movie i forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful miss carter looked in this movie i have often said she was the most beautiful creature to have ever graced the face of our earth but she seemed to have out done herself in this particular movie br br i hope any of you who watch this movie enjoy it as much as i did thank you for letting me express my opinion
<START> i must say this movie is a mork and mindy knock off when watching it i got the chills i even wet myself a little when that korean guy with the spiders in his neck started kicking people i was like oh my lord asian people smell and suck cause they eat dogs all the time any way back on track chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non robotic human being some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of christmas past this movie is so bad i put my new born child in a box and left it in mr norris mailbox he can raise my kid i'm not letting him into a world where he thinks chuck norris is a karate expert ill let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life
<START> i really enjoyed this i'm a big fan of movies that mess with your mind and leave you with a lot of questions and ideas to debate and this was a stellar example but then terry gilliam is always good at that well almost always let's just forget about jabberwocky and the brothers grimm shall we br br i particularly liked the way it handled the time travel theme and the avoidance of paradoxes the way events in the past and future intertwined and fed into each other br br it was also really well done aesthetically the art direction was really great and i wish i'd been able to see it on the big screen the future scenes had a similar feel to brazil in a lot of ways and even the present scenes were often really visually compelling br br but perhaps the most striking thing about it was that it featured two actors i normally don't much like bruce willis and brad pitt and they both delivered amazing performances here pitt especially i'd seen one or two films before that made me realize he could in fact actually act contrary to what i'd originally thought but this one really outdid them i actually found myself asking my friends at one point are you sure that's brad pitt this is probably the most memorable performance of his career though admittedly that may not be saying too much
<START> this is one of my all time favorites great music and some funny bits i laugh every time at millie the maid pretending to be a dÃ©butante holding her dainty hankie while chatting and mindlessly polishing furniture with it as she chats i just never can get past her french accent never being a problem as they try to pass her off as the boss's daughter br br seeing a teenage mel torme and the very young frank sinatra singing is such a treat my mom saw frank sinatra at a theater about the same time this movie came out she said they couldn't clear the bobby soxers out between movies in those days you didn't have to leave between showings this movie shows you how attractive and appealing the young frank was and allows you to appreciate his early talent as well and victor borge gets in a bit of his routine in which is a bonus br br this is a fun movie with a sweet simple storyline very enjoyable
<START> don't get me wrong goldeneye was revolutionary and is definitely the best fps game to be based on the 007 franchise but the series had fallen into a fps rut enter everything or nothing which puts bond in third person when i wrote my earlier review for from russia with love i had finished frwl and just started eon and judged eon a bit harshly even though frwl definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise eon definitely is superior in terms of in depth controls and gameplay variety missions range from standard running and gunning to driving an suv driving an aston martin driving a limousine that is wired to explode commandeering two different types of tanks a la goldeneye riding a motorcycle flying a helicopter repelling down a shaft guarded by laser tripwires and free falling after a plummeting damsel sure vehicle controls are a little clumsy but the issue here is the variety br br as movie adaptations goldeneye and frwl were all that i could have hoped for but eon's original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a james bond adventure this is helped by the impressive cast list of willem defoe shannon elizabeth heidi klum and misaki ito judi dench and john cleese reprise their movie roles of m and q respectively and pierce brosnan while no sean connery adds credibility to the game's proceedings all characters resemble the stars with the disappointing exception of heidi klum who's in game model doesn't do the real life model justice mya's theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen bond title tunes br br the game also plays tribute to some of the older bond movies willem defoe's character is a former colleague of christopher walken's baddie from a view to a kill richard kiel appears as jaws the hulking henchman from the spy who loved me and moonraker in three fight scenes the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have br br single player gameplay mainly consists of standard on foot missions as bond like bond you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing the game provides plenty of opportunities to utilize stealth with plenty of wall and object cover unfortunately unlike frwl only one button in eon controls both crouching and wall clinging so bond may end up crouching low when he's supposed to be peeking around a corner and vice versa the game also allows players to go into bond reflex mode while you browse your inventory everything around you will go into super slo mo allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be interacted with while this takes some getting used to eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular bond moments such as shooting down a chandelier to take out four goons underneath and greatly add to the bond movie feeling br br there are 3 available difficulty levels operative agent and double oh on operative you can breeze through in a few hours on agent a few weeks on double oh a few months the difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission garnering high scores on missions will unlock gold and platinum awards and effect features such as vehicle upgrades and the skimpy outfits the bond girls wear some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a scarcity of checkpoints but when all is said and done no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a bond movie br br multi player unfortunately is not as thrilling goldeneye still has the best multi player mode of any bond game eon's main multi player is a co op campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser mi6 agents on a less important mission than bond's a more standard third person death match can be unlocked from this mode but the single player mode is the most complete bond experience to date the ending as with most bond games is anticlimactic while the final mission is one of the most aggravating of the game the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing also levels that require bond to be speedy become largely a matter of trial and error still for any serious bond fan not playing this game is tantamount to missing one of the bond films
<START> the more i think about it there was nothing redeeming about this br br movie i saw it 9 months ago so my memory might have made it br br worse than it was but i do know it was at least as bad as a 4 out of br br 10 br br after seeing the movie i met the director he seemed so clueless br br as to what he was doing or what he had done and as far as i br br could tell he didn't care for the film either even he agreed that he br br didn't really know what he was doing and he was forced to do br br certain things because it was filmed digitally br br i felt that the movie was trying to hard to fit in to the formula that it br br built for itself 9 people all have to be connected in some way how br br can we get from point 'a' to point 'b' so in order get from the br br prostitute we see in the start and back to her at the end they 10 br br minutes on each character's relationship to another person it br br makes one feel choked by the 2 demensional badly drawn br br characters br br i just remembered the one redeeming part of the movie steve br br bouchemi there is one scene where he is amazing that's it as i br br say 4 out of 10
<START> i was lucky enough to see this at a pre screening last night oct 20 and i was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and genuinely heart felt acting br br while the plot is not particularly complicated or exceptionally new the story unfolds in a way that feels fresh unique and distinctly indy in style it isn't something that can easily be compared to films of the past it's a unique take on a sort of classic middle aged depressed love story br br i was particularly struck by the casting of the film down to every last extra in the family it was a beautiful and talented cast the three daughters did a wonderful job the talent was evenly dispersed between them and none of them out shone the other two br br it was truly a delightful film appropriate for all ages and laugh out loud funny while also being truly touching and heart warming it was a wonderful break from the sex jokes and nudity of recent films
<START> the premise of this movie was decent enough but with sub par acting it was just bland and dull br br spoilers the film does not work because of the nature of the death it was accidental so although it was a murder it wasn't like the guy set out to do it also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree there is no emotion in this film the first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister and hearing her message it was dull and boring br br with some polishing and better acting it could have been pretty good
<START> david mamet is a very interesting and a very un equal director his first movie 'house of games' was the one i liked best and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations and so does the perspective of the viewer br br so is 'homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama the principal characters are two cops one jewish and one irish who deal with a racially charged area the murder of an old jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the israeli independence war triggers the jewish identity in the mind and heart of the jewish detective br br this is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious the process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe the group of jewish militants is operatic and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic the end of the film itself is mamet like smart but disappoints from a human emotional perspective br br joe mantegna and william macy give strong performances but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated
<START> joan crawford had just begun her working girl makes good phase with the dynamic paid 1930 she had never attempted a role like that before and critics were impressed so while other actresses were wondering why their careers were foundering because they were clinging to characters that had been the in thing a few years before but were now becoming passe joan was listening to the public and securing her longevity as an actress the depression was here and jazz age babies who survived on an endless round of parties were frowned upon of course if you became rich through immoral means but suffered for it that was alright br br this film starts out with a spectacular house boat party bonnie jordan joan crawford is the most popular girl there especially when she suggests that everyone go swimming in their underwear however when bonnie's father has a heart attack because of loses on the stock market both bonnie and her brother rodney william bakewell realise who their real friends are after bob townsend lester vail a poor man's johnny mack brown offers to do the right thing and marry her they had just spent a night together when bonnie declared with abandon that she wants love on approval she starts to show some character by deciding to get a job br br she finds a job at a newspaper and quickly impresses by her will to do well her working buddy is bert scranton cliff edwards and together they are given an assignment to write about the inside activities of the mob rodney also surprises her with the news that he also has a job she is thrilled for him but soon realises it is bootlegging and he is mixed up with cold blooded killer jake luva clark gable rodney witnesses a mass shooting and goes to pieces spilling the beans to the first person he sees drinking at the bar which happens to be bert he is then forced to kill bert and after wards he goes into hiding the paper pulls out all stops in an effort to find bert's killer and sends bonnie undercover as a dancer in one of jake's clubs joan does a very lively dance to accordian joe much to sylvie's disgust the film ends with a gun battle and as rodney lies dying bonnie tearfully phones in her story br br this is a super film with crawford and gable giving it their all natalie moorehead who as sylvie shared a famous cigarette scene with gable early in the film was a stylish other woman who had her vogue in the early thirties william bakewell had a huge career he had started as a teenager in a douglas fairbanks film in the mid 20s a lot of his roles though were weak spineless characters in this film he played the weak brother and was completely over shadowed by joan crawford and the dynamic newcomer clark gable maybe that was why he never became a star br br highly recommended
<START> the day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of azumi's fate as an assassin fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga br br that's as poetical as i'll get when talking about azumi 2 death or love because when i cringed over the heavy sentimentality of house of flying daggers and complained about the credibility of aya ueto portraying a blood driven assassin after watching azumi 2 i started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before br br not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience in azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics which is their number one priority as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape but i won't hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in azumi's way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma by the way chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of go go minus the cool weapon and sense of menace br br this brings me to the final blow which is the action simply disguised in the title as the 'death' side of the epic in the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons to no one's surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily in azumi 1 the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between azumi and bijomaru in comparison to the fights in azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter i am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched br br the romance side of azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution br br as a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation i won't lie and i'll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first azumi film but i'll step right up and say that after watching azumi 2 the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece for what it's worth azumi 2 death or love could have gone straight to video with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins doing their best to restore the peace with an unwavering courage to die trying
<START> the two things are are good about this film are it's two unknown celebrities br br first daphne zuniga in her first appearance in a film young and supple with looks that still encompass her body today steals the very beginning which is all she is in and that is that she is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projects br br second the score by then known composer christopher chris young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one star yeah i know one star more is not much but in this movie's case it is a lot br br the rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer blah blah blah we all know where this is going br br watch the first eighteen minutes with daphne zuniga then turn it off
<START> i saw this on a flight over to the u s and was a little sceptical at first as a few people had said there were so many characters in it that you didnt get to know any of them however i didnt find this at all the film is fast but this is due to the nature of the director and the star the chase scenes are excellent and yes it may be predictable but isnt that true of most films the main villain is a bit of a let down christopher eccelston is not as convincing as he could have been but that said its still a good film
