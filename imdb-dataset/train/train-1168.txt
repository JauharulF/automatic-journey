<START> pinjar is truly a masterpiece it's a thought provoking film that makes you think and makes you question our culture it is without a doubt the best hindi movie i have seen to date this film should have been shown at movie festivals around the world and i believe would have been a serious contender at cannes all the characters were perfectly cast and urmila matkondar and manoj bhajpai were haunting in their roles br br the story the movie tells about partition is a very very important story and one that should never be forgotten br br it has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story here no one country is depicted as good or bad there are evil indians evil pakistanis and good indians and pakistanis the cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious meaningful and haunting everything about the movie was amazing and the acting just took my breath away all were perfectly cast
<START> what can i say about it it's another hollywood's horror flick with very high budget 80 million dollars not scary at all it offers us only a few thrills and one really creepy sequence with skeleton in the fireplace a lot of computer generated special effects and nothing more catherine zeta jones is beautiful as always lili taylor is also a good actress the architecture of the hill house is amazing all these monuments statues furniture delicious however i don't like the ending because it was so luscious check this one out and form your own opinion on it i give this picture 7 out of 10
<START> this review applies for the cut of the film that's generally available as fury of the wolfman i understand there is an uncut version out there with additional footage and i would hope that it contained at least eight or nine crucial scenes that seem to be missing from the cut known as fury of the wolfman in short the movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever it is utter nonsense and incomprehensible nonsense at that br br waldemar daninsky that venerable lycanthropic antihero portrayed by paul naschy in a seemingly endless series of films is apparently a normal guy who has just come back from a trip to tibet where he was attacked by a yeti somehow this has turned him into a werewolf daninsky is a doctor a scientist and an instructor at what appears to be a college one of his female colleagues ilona elmann is involved in a vague form of hypnosis chematodes a nonsense word used to refer to a bunch of wires attached to a victim's head ellman feels this will enable her to change the direction of the human brain naturally enabling her to rule the world provided she can get us all attached to those wires with no trouble br br elmann is also into werewolves because she kidnaps daninsky and takes him to her hidden laboratory she has a bunch of other people trapped there as well some of them look like gypsies and are chained up being in varying states of lucidity others are clearly hippies elmann feels that one day she may be able to help them be human again but in the meantime she controls them with her chematodes waldemar becomes her hairy hit man wandering around like a werewolf zombie that is until the filmmakers decide to use footage spliced in from another naschy werewolf film frankenstein's bloody terror don't ask at which point naschy's werewolf makeup changes considerably and he lurches around like an animal br br is this making any sense no good that's the film's saving grace it doesn't try and engage you on any kind of intellectual level it just goes full speed ahead with whatever nonsense dialogue or cheap horror movie sets it can muster up fury of the wolfman may be the best halloween party movie ever you absolutely do not need to pay attention to it and in fact if you do you will be completely confused
<START> i really love the sexy action and sci fi films of the sixties and its because of the actress's that appeared in them they found the sexiest women to be in these films and it didn't matter if they could act remember candy the reason i was disappointed by this film was because it wasn't nostalgic enough the story here has a european sci fi film called dragonfly being made and the director is fired so the producers decide to let a young aspiring filmmaker jeremy davies to complete the picture they're is one real beautiful woman in the film who plays dragonfly but she's barely in it film is written and directed by roman coppola who uses some of his fathers exploits from his early days and puts it into the script i wish the film could have been an homage to those early films they could have lots of cameos by actors who appeared in them there is one actor in this film who was popular from the sixties and its john phillip law barbarella gerard depardieu giancarlo giannini and dean stockwell appear as well i guess i'm going to have to continue waiting for a director to make a good homage to the films of the sixties if any are reading this make it as sexy as you can i'll be waiting
<START> prom night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a lifetime original film you know the one this october lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving insert disease name here to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker ex boyfriend it's dramatic Â it's sappy Â it's immensely dull it does nothing to further a genre tell an original story or strive for any sort of newness prom night shares this plight watching the killer poke holes in his victims we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled it occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie history br br our director is working with a fairly good looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier think about matthew mcconaughey coming at you with a knife you'd probably go Â oh good lookin guy is going to kill me naaaa not scary even for a second so the director throws schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror this mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator you'll get 15 jump scares in this film 2 of which made my date jump i might mention she is afraid of everything i'd also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave me br br as if this film were not disjointed enough it appears to be cut to shreds i'm not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film i'm saying as the film moves from scene to scene you often get a jarring jump this is the kind of thing you'd expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together cross his fingers and hope for the best the editor should be shot br br with a plot you can pack into two sentences one stray spray of blood an emo killer and the tension of a very special episode of silver spoons we're left with no reason to support horror this weekend Â at least on the big screen in fact this is the sort of film that should be punished is it really that hard to make a scary movie was this crew even aware they were making a horror film a complete waste of my time and yours i bit the bullet to get you this review don't let my sacrifice be in vain don't go into the movie
<START> this is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists all over the world the documentaries are varied and deal with all sorts of concepts the only thing being shared is 9 11 as a theme very minor in some cases some of the segements are weak while others are very strong some are political some are not some are solely about 9 11 some simply use 9 11 as a theme to touch on human feelings emotions and tragedies that are universal some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic this film has not been censored in any fashion by anyone so the thoughts that you see are very raw and powerful br br this is a very controversial film especially for conservative americans i think two segments might really tick off the right wingers one from egypt where a dead american soldier and a dead palestinian bomber come back as spirits another from uk which recounts the us backed overthrow of chile on sept 11 1973 which resulted in 50 000 deaths and horrible atrocities the segment from mexico was the most powerful recounting the fall of the towers and the resulting death in vivid fashion you have to see it to believe it br br even though the final product is uneven with some segments being almost pointless i still recommend this it's very difficult to rank this film because the segments vary all over the place some weak some very powerful i'm giving this a rating of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered issues that usually get censored mexico segment uk segment japan segment egypt segment
<START> many people have commented that this movie was nowhere near as good as the first well maybe it isn't to you however how does your child react to it well mine loved it more than the first br br disney movies of the past can sometimes be a little harsh for little kids for example bambi's mother getting shot this movie was really great for my sensitive little girl who likes humor and happy endings br br if you want to be snobby about what should be disney's standards based on the past skip this movie br br if you have a sweet little girl or soft hearted little boy you really want to please buy this movie and treat your small children this film is great as a bedtime movie for happy dreams instead of nightmares i'm happy with a movie that pleases my kid doesn't need to impress the parents all the time
<START> sometimes a movie is so comprehensively awful it has a destructive effect on your morale you begin to really ask yourself what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low can they honestly expect that we'll endure this many clichÃ©s and still be entertained br br of course it is still a hollywood mainstay to make the gun the major character plot device and the source of all conflict and resolution in films character needs a gun gets a gun can't do that because he has a gun puts his gun down first oh my god what are we going to do he has a gun he waves it around acting more malicious than real human beings ever do he pushes it in someone's face for 90 minutes shouting questions the hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens br br it's a real challenge to make such a tired hackneyed formula work again a film has to be very clever and well executed this one is neither it has no life and no personality and it will suck these components from you it will make you feel worse about living in the time and space that you do really who needs that so yes i'll say it i think this may well be the worst film i have ever seen anyone who was involved in the making of this sub mediocre soul killing trash should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice they've done to us all
<START> the 1st season was amazing the whole idea of them adjusting to the island while mysteries were being explored and seen was just phenomenal filled with suspense tons of cliffhangers and an amazing plot i mean i love the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island and then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention from then on i was hooked the second season was right on par with the 1st season only a little better i absolutely loved the idea of the hatches and the dharma initiative the whole plot and sequences of season 2 were mysterious creepy and exciting i loved all the suspense surround others on the island but the dharma story really made season 2 amazing br br season 3 wasn't quite as good as 1 and 2 but nonetheless great i loved seeing the back stories of the others seeing their camp and seeing the mysteries further explored tricia tanak is dead is one of my favorite episodes this season while not as good was still breathtaking and fun but most of all exciting now the 4th season i had hopes for this season and the 1st couple of episodes we're good but then it really started to get boring and monotonous i mean i really despise the new rescuers such as miles and daniel the plot got old after the first couple episodes and most of all season 4 was stripped away of something which made lost a perfect series the mystery suspense comedy mixed in charlie gone and overall excitement also some of my favorite characters have left
<START> the acting in this movie was superb but mixed with the truth about the condition of many africans in south africa made it heart wrenching it was good that the writer isolated boesman and lena from others run from their homes so we could share fully in their triumphs and defeats the conflicts they shared as they grew together and apart worth seeing when you put the movie in it's proper context
<START> we have an average family dad's a famous rapper we have the rebelious teenage daughter the adopted white kid and the cute little kid and we have careless housemaid what show has had a housemaid like that do we have a messed up brady bunch yay when it first came out i thought it was really cool mostly because i was young the music was bad the raps were so bad and they were too g rated all of his raps were about his family and friends and problems the dad was kind of the danny from full house type of dad always gave the advice out but he wasn't a clean freak they had a house keeper for that remember the plots were basically lil' romeo was in trouble of some sort or not that's it oh and maybe some preteen drama yeah that stuff is good not really but its still a good show for kids but nikelodean could do better
<START> the undoubted highlight of this movie is peter o'toole's performance in turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic does anybody do it better than o'toole i don't think so what a great face that man has br br the story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts especially toward the end but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels however i felt the film basically revolved around peter o'toole's luminous performance and i'm sure i wouldn't have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn't been in it
<START> i just saw dreamgirls yesterday and i was really underimpressed despite all the oscar buzz this is nothing special anyone who was really impressed by this film has never bothered to see any of the true movie musical classics except for eddie murphy's great musical and dramatic performance dreamgirls is just a glorified tv movie with no style or flair just a bunch of amateurs singing at each other br br now the first half hour was good but i was irritated at how eddie murphy's terrific raveup performances were truncated and interrupted by montages those were easily the best songs and best performances in the film and the rise to the top portion of the film was the only part of the film that had a consistent point of view or any momentum the remaining hour and 45 minutes was a formless rambling mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting it was also visually dull and included too many sound alike tunes br br condon didn't try to turn any of the tunes into big show pieces as i'd expected they would each number in the 2nd half was just one closeup after another of people singing at each other and the way they shot hudson's big love me number was criminal condon just shot her stomping around the stage no drama at all god it sucked br br and note to all involved that sing talking dialog stuff might work on stage but it does not work in movies see embarrassing failures of evita and phantom all that i'll teeeell youuuu something efff ieeee crap should have been left on the editing room floor those aren't songs br br again the film except for eddie murphy's amazing performance was nothing more than a glorified tv movie there must have been megabucks behind the pr work for this film i wonder how much money was spent to give it that pre release one to beat oscar buzz as a whole this film was except for eddie nowhere near an oscar caliber movie except for eddie i'd rank it right up there with grease 2 big disappointment especially after all the very expen i've hype
<START> i must admit that this is the type of film that i would normally eschew but i rented it basically because of the stars i certainly was not sorry in fact as you see i rated it five stars this film is the perfect combination of sharp directing and superior acting br br andy and hank hanson are brothers who decide to commit the uncouth crime of robbing their parents' jewelry store the crime goes terribly wrong thus beginning an examination of the three men in the hanson family through a series of flashbacks we get to know charles hanson and come to an understanding of the strained relationship between father and sons br br younger brother hank is basically a screw up he has always had trouble holding a job and pretty much goes in the direction of the wind hank is insecure cowardly and very much under the influence of his big brother ethan hawke has the character of hank nailed to a t and gives what is probably his best performance thus far he shows us a man who is basically good hearted but so influenced by outside forces that he is unable to follow through with any important task br br andy on the surface appears to be a successful businessman but we soon discover that he is addicted to drugs and has been embezzling from his company to pay for his habit it is andy who concocts the scheme to rob his parents' store and he gets weak willed hank to commit the act philip seymour hoffman surely one of the finest actors of our time plays andy hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who on the surface is a charming businessman liked by his acquaintances but a real slime ball underneath he is absolutely perfect for the part of andy or it might be said that he through his superior acting skills made andy the perfect part br br albert finney plays a father common to his generation charles hanson is not a bad or unfeeling man but he has a lousy relationship with his sons because he never really understood what was necessary in nurturing a positive bond between his sons and himself he has always been too quick to criticize and admonish he always made it clear that he favored his younger son over his older thus causing a wide emotional rift between himself and andy as we get to know charles and andy the thought of andy forming a plan to rob from his father becomes less unbelievable br br on a personal note i cannot believe how much charles hanson reminded me of my own father and how much andy and hank reminded me of my own brother and myself perhaps this may be one of the reasons that i enjoyed the film so much as this story of a distant critical father a more successful older brother and a less successful younger brother hit so close to home fortunately my brother and i never came to the state of committing a crime against my parents guess we were made of sterner and more moral stuff br br this complex of personalities and actions has been expertly put together by director sidney lumet at eighty three he still has the chops to give the audience engrossing characters and edge of seat action that hypnotizes 12 angry men was his first film made fifty years prior to before the devil knows you're dead but he hasn't lost any bit of his magic touch in showing us characters that will be long remembered br br the events and characters in before the devil knows you're dead are harsh and unattractive and this is definitely not a feel good movie however it is two hours of ultimate entertainment which i thoroughly recommend

<START> hitler the rise of evil was shrouded in controversy before it ever aired and that controversy may obscure the accomplishment of the film br br those who criticzed the film which they hadn't seen did so with good intentions based on the misguided thought that it would be overly sympathetic to hitler however they misunderstood the point to humanize the evil hitler is not sympathize with him it is far more disturbing to realize that the unspeakable acts committed by one of history's greatest villains were committed by a human being a sick diseased maniac to be sure but a human being nonetheless it is necessary to know the story of how hitler was able to come to power to prevent it from happening again br br rise of evil is highlighted by a brilliant career best performance from robert carlyle who makes hitler a human being without ever redeeming him in any way carlyle flawlessly captures the look and mannerisms of the nazi leader while never letting the impersonation become cartoonish or distance us something anthony hopkins was not quite able to accomplish when he portrayed hitler in the bunker another very good made for television film while were are repulsed by hitler's depravity and virulent ant semitism carlyle gives him a certain magnetism and power the real adolf hitler must have possesed after all while else would a nation have followed him br br of the various subplots by far the most compelling features matthew modine as reporter fritz gehrlich who makes it his life's work to draw attention to the reality of of hitler and nazism while modine's performance is a little stilted in part 1 by part 2 he seems to have settled in the character gives us a real life hero in a film full of villains peter stormare and liev schrieber also give strong support br br part 1 of this two part mini series suffered a little bit from being overly choppy including a look at hitler's childhood which lasts only the duration of the opening credits and in part 2 sections detailing hitler's relationship's with his niece and his mistress eva braun are less successful than the central plot but do serve to give us further insight into his mental and emotional state br br ultimately no film about hitler can make us understand him the average person is thankfully incapable of ever understanding a man who would try to exterminate an entire race of people hitler the rise of evil tries less to make us understand hitler and more to make us understand how he came to be power it is an important story that must be told and it is impossible to believe anyone who has seen the film would accuse it of having anything but the best of intentions and the capability of doing anything but good br br 9 out of 10 1 2
<START> i am writing this after just seeing the perfect son at the 2002 gay and lesbian mardi gras film festival in sydney australia br br when their father dies two estranged brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering that one of the brothers is dying from aids they enter on a heart warming journey of reconciliation the two leads do a magnificent job of creating the gradual warmth and respect that builds up between them as the movie progresses i do have one qualm about the movie though whilst the brother who is dying acts sick he doesn't look it a person of 0 t4 cells would look quite ill not even a make up job to make the actor look ill was employed a small gripe but one that makes it a bit less realistic despite that one small gripe the perfect son is a wonderful movie and should you have the chance to see it do i'm hoping for a dvd release in the near future
<START> what surprised me most about this film was the sheer audience it attracted similar films such as anita and me have never caused as much hype as this film has though i think that's probably because of the mention of 'beckham' in the title more than anything else br br it's a brilliant film putting across a brilliant message you can do anything if you're determined enough and put your mind to it which is such a positive message to anyone watching this film br br i think this is one of keira knightley's better films and i think she's a brilliant actress and was excellent for the role parminder nagra was brilliant too sadly i can't say this for jonathan rhys meyers because i don't think that he was that much of a good actor and to be honest his eyes were a little scary br br all in all a brilliant film and a brilliant story
<START> all i can say is first movie this season that got my attention i picked it because of the actors gere and claire and the story looked promising i have just watched it and i can say i'm overwhelmed there are shocking scenes true but that's what makes it more realistic we shouldn't run away from our reality these things are happening right this moment and there are experts who are trying to change things and make things better and who get laughed out about their commitment to the cause actually i can't seem to feel the hollywood touch in the movie and that's what makes it better both claire and richard did a great roles and deserve a 10 from me
<START> i myself am a big fan of low budget 80's horror films this isn't the worst but still not to spectacular the plot line is decent but drags out way too long you're through half the movie before you even get to see any zombie action the kills aren't very creative and the zombies aren't too crafty i truly think this movie would have been better if they left out the zombies and just made it into some mafia flick it's watchable but i feel that this film did steal at least an hour of my life i'll give the film credit for being somewhat original if you are really into b horror movies it's worth a viewing but if you're not don't bother but you don't have to take my word for it
