<START> gi samurai sees sonny chiba and some other guys get transported back to civil war stricken feudal japan for no particular reason and much carnage ensues it's a rather over the top essay of sword vs machine gun that ultimately yields some interesting results br br the plot essentially runs along the rails that you might expect from the title initial fish out the water antics what is this flying metal box etc etc aren't we better off here discussions and ultimately a huge battle the latter is proof that the film doesn't take itself seriously at all the carnage taking up most of the second half as samurai army battles chiba's platoon a face off one would fully expect from the title but it still manages to overwhelm with its inventiveness and extravagance it's certainly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and doesn't drag despite its extended length br br chiba gives a gruff performance as iba initially a good leader but someone who finally finds himself questioning his own morals as the situation slowly has an effect on him this is certainly one of his better vehicles from his terrific cv by the final act the two worlds have had such an effect on each other you have to wonder if it was a bit of nihilism on the part of the writers as they seem to be asking weren't we better off back then ' but this is maybe reading a bit much into was can generally be described as a hugely entertaining two hours of almost non stop action
<START> after all these years i still consider this series the finest example of world war ii documentary film making the interviews with the many participants from all countries set this apart from any other project it would be great to see a contemporary documentarian ken burns take on this topic and try to gather information from veterans before they are all gone with modern technology to improve old archival footage and lots of information that has been unearthed since 1974 when the world at war was produced an updated version of this series would be welcome the history channel has made some fine shows dealing with many aspects of wwii but an expansive series such as the world at war has not been successfully attempted since the original if you are interested in this era don't miss this series it is required viewing
<START> i saw this obvious schlock fest on a video store shelf and before i got my first vcr i figured i'd christen it with this little gem and it's bad film making at it's finest br br the dialog is inadvertently hilarious and it contains a cameo with donald trump anthony quinn is in it inexplicably and much like christopher walken seemed to want to star in every bad movie in his later years this movie is mr quinn's country bears br br it features lines like shut up and let me fight br br and you're saying a lot of sh it br br and the priceless comeback unfortunately it is sh it tough angry sh it br br you'll be awed by a fight scene as bo does a sommersault across a billiard table and does a nice kung fu kick when she comes up from the roll chop socky action and t and a thrills br br what schlock movie fan could ask for more oh and when mr quinn's character commits suicide and and comes back to haunt bo as a ghost she asks him why he killed himself rather then deal with his debilitating illness he says real men don't eat quiche br br uh aaa yeah if bo was a smart cookie she woulda called for an exorcist right then and there
<START> i saw this movie on t v this afternoon and i can't see how anyone can sit through this piece of trash it's not funny at all and it takes your i q down a few notches i know this movie is for kids but that doesn't mean the writers should take their intelligence for granted i bet that writers were sitting around a large wooden table and figured that a the word poop equals big laugh b a four foot tall kid can dunk on a ten foot tall basketball net c kids should always fight kidnappers armed with guns because the kidnappers will fall for anything and d 3 months of karate training is all you need to beat up so called ninjas with swords one good thing i can say about this movie is it contains the weakest suburban gang in the world that couldn't scare anybody maybe the guys at mst3k could use this movie for a good laugh don't bother with this lame ass excuse for a movie
<START> excellent story about teenagers leaders high school football stars how far will you go to protect your friends lie kill how much can you lose if you stud by an innocent girl can love beat the odds can you defeat narrow minded small town people when your friend scores and you lose will you do everything in your power to make her pay for it or will you be a man about it and respect her right to chose will you rape her and show it as your victory over a problem girl can you stand by the one who's only sin is to have an opinion of her own to be able to make her own decisions to chose for herself it made me think twice before giving my judgment about who was right and who was wrong but one is for sure very disturbing movie and theme in general thumb up
<START> a milestone in eastern european film making and an outstanding example of serbian mentality a group of completely different people are doomed to die because of their discord with maratonci trce pocasni krug makes two mythological movies everyone here knows word by word
<START> oh my this was the worst reunion movie i have ever seen that is saying a lot i am ashamed of watching br br what happened in the script meetings ooooooh i know let's have two stud muffins fall madly in love with the most annoying character since cousin oliver yeah that'll be cool br br even for sitcoms this was the most implausible plot since ron popeil starting spray painting bald men
<START> i find it rather useless to comment on this movie for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment upon it's similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it but since a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance br br filth is definitely the proper word to describe this movie created in the same manner as any other romanian movie directed by lucian pintilie who insists to depict the so called romanian reality following the communist era 1990 to present days br br under no circumstances recommended for people outside romania as for the others who lately find amateurish camera lack of plot lack of directorial actors's quality etc noise etc as being trendy and even art like watch enjoy this movie as i know you will but do the other well intentioned imdb members a favor don't write an online review for it will misguide irritate and in the end waste their time br br on the other hand this movie among others has some value whatsoever an educational one for it sets the example for how not to make a movie
<START> this film is pure elvira and shows her at her breast i mean best the story co written by cassandra peterson elvira's alter ego is inspiring and captivating and is brought to life by elvira's wit and charm the viewer gets an opportunity to see elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with the prejudices of the people of fallwell massachusetts where she has travelled from los angeles in order to attend the reading of her great aunt morganna's will and at the same time tries to help the long suffering teenagers who have been deprived of fun by the matriarchal chastity pariah and the rest of the town council she also has to deal with her attraction to bob redding the owner of the local cinema and another woman patty who has her eye on bob as well but is not nearly as deserving of his love as elvira and later in the movie she also faces the complications of being descended from ''a major metaphysical celebrity'' and the charges of witchcraft brought against her which mean that she will be burnt at the stake elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable streetwise and naive in this film while cracking risque jokes and delivering off beat lines with double meanings br br this movie is inspiring because it gives out the message of never giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams in the end elvira's dreams finally come true which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman br br i've seen this movie countless times and i never ever get tired of it there are no unnecessary scenes and i found myself captivated throughout the whole movie a review will not do justice to the actual movie so i can just tell you to please watch it because it is one of the best movies ever made meanwhile i wish you ''unpleasant dreams ''
<START> so this movie has been hailed glorified and carried to incredible heights but in the end what is it really many of the ways in which it has been made to work for a hearing audience on the screen do not work the fairly academic camera work keeps the signing obfuscated and scenes that are in asl are hard to follow as a result even for someone who is relatively fluent the voice interpretation of matlin's dialogue under the excuse that hurt's character likes the sound of his voice turns her more and more into a weird distant object as the film goes on matlin does shine in the few scenes where her signing is not partially hidden from view but nonetheless most of the movie when this is a love story is only showed from a single point of view that of the man as ebert said if a story is about the battle of two people over the common ground on which they will communicate it's not fair to make the whole movie on the terms of only one of them br br the idea that an oralist teacher who uses methods that have been imposed in many deaf schools for decades would be presented as revolutionary is fairly insulting in itself his character becomes weakened as a credible teacher as the movie goes on drawing comedy from a deaf accent is quite honestly rather low and his attitude towards the male students of his class is pretty symptomatic of how he seems to act with women as an entitled man a party scene involving a number of deaf people including a few academics meeting together leaves him seemingly isolated in a way that's fairly inconsistent with his credentials i have seen interpreters spontaneously switch to asl between each other even when they weren't aware of a deaf person being in the area and yet somehow he feels like a fish out of the water in an environment his education should have made him perfectly used to as a lover he seems like a typical dogged nice guy including his tendency to act possessively afterwards and yet the movie is indeed only really seen through him as everything his lover says is filtered through his voice br br the scenes involving the other deaf kids are in general wallbangers the broken symbolism fails the dance scene the pool scene even the initial sleep scene which is supposed to carry some of it all these scenes that try to hint at the isolation of the deaf main character are broken metaphors at best many hearing people i know do dance on the bass beats that deaf people feel instead of squirming like copulating chihuahuas and going to take an evening dive for a hearing person is rarely an excuse to make a deep statement on the isolation of deafness no seriously when i go swim i go swim br br it also fails at carrying the end of the play instead making it a story of a deaf woman who submits to a strong man even though the original play ended with a more equal ground where both have to accept each other as they are and where he has to finally recognize her real voice is the movement of her hands not the vibrations in her throat br br and for all the breakthrough that it may have seemed to be marlee matlin remains hollywood's token deaf woman to this day
<START> this movie is without a doubt a perfect 10 10 for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no good plot or anything like that thats ridiculous saying that a jackie chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot you watch jackie chan for the fight scenes for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other american films from that era and even later you will realize that jackie chan's movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while american movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what jackie chan was doing at the time porn is watched for the porn jackie chan is watched for the action i think you people are rating it bad because there's no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained sure the middle of the movie was boring very boring but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that this did change the way how american action movies were created they have even stollen scenes from this movie if you want a true man a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of jackie chan's hes pure in everyway he literally makes american movies look like a walk in the park and even in todays movies american movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more police story and many other jackie chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do a masterpiece
<START> boring children's fantasy that gives joan plowright star billing but little to do sappy kids pursue their dreams frankie wants to be a ballerina and a baseball player yuk while best friend hazel runs for mayor she's 13 totally pedestrian in every way plus the added disadvantage of syrupy performances by the girls as well as the baseball boys certainly a lesser effort for showtime no limits
<START> as far as i can recall balanchine's alterations to tchaikovsky's score are as follows br br 1 the final section of the grossvatertanz a traditional tune played at the end of a party is repeated several times to give the children a last dance before their scene is over br br 2 a violin solo written for but eliminated from tchaikovsky's score for the sleeping beauty is interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene balanchine chose this music because of its melodic relationship to the music for the growing christmas tree that occurs shortly thereafter br br 3 the solo for the sugar plum fairy's cavalier is eliminated br br it seems to me the accusation that balanchine has somehow desecrated tchaikovsky's great score is misplaced
<START> holes is a wonderful film to see it has good messages in in such as be a good friend never give up etc i highly recommend it to anyone i still say the book is better than the movie but the movie gives the book a run for its money also khleo thomas plays zero that really adds to it lol
<START> when i saw the exterminators of year 3000 at first time i had no expectations for that movie although it wasn't so bad as i was thought it's kind of italian version of roadwarrior with cast that is almost famous in italy including venantino venantini behind the story is elisa briganti and dardano sacchetti who are also responsible for story of zombie flesh eaters you can also see other links to italian horror movies luca venantini plays the role of tommy and you can see that kid in paura nella citta dei morti viventi city of the living dead aka gates of hell as john robbins and in cannibal apocalypse as the role of mary's brother quite entertaining movie with some dull parts
<START> this is the most saccharine romance i ever sat through the perfect film for an idle housewife in kerchief housedress and ostrich trimmed high heeled mules to watch in the afternoon lying on the couch eating bonbons in fact bonbons play a prominent role in the movie br br the only reason i was able to watch to the end is that i finally was able to gaze at keanu reeves' dreamy face in almost every scene in most of his films he moves too fast to get a good look the only rapid action in this show is giancarlo giannini waving his hands with latin emotionality more italian than mexican really br br the dialog is as stiff as wood unfortunately no bodices are ripped the hero is disgracefully perfect mannered and mild the aristocratic warm blooded old world family cliche is as old as the hills what does it matter if they are irish or italian or mexican this is a fairy story br br i knew before the titles finished running that this would not be the movie i hoped for the glowing grapes looked like the paragon of all food ads in women's day magazine i didn't see his name listed but the art director surely was thomas kinkade who paints the million dollar canvases of irish cottages snuggled in fuchsias this film was literally seen through rose colored glasses if you like dreamy pink and blue sky this film is for you the bonbons looked really good too
<START> the sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine this movie is no cabarnet and certainly no casablanca i agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us nightly in sit coms and the dialogue is stilted and preachy but let's look at the obsolete theme of the movie br br with the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom since watch on the rhine author lillian hellman has been exposed as a bidenesque plagiarist with her so called real life story julia from her book pentimento as one of the most odious of a plethora of western based ussr apologists it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir america to action to save the bloody soviet dictator stalin and international communism from the fascists who had just proved their military superiority in spain br br as one reviewer correctly noted this is not a pro american play and movie as lillian went to her grave an american loathing communist this film chronicles that familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual elites that made up the american left then just as now the full mooner left of the daily kos and michael moore has bought into the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy america
<START> i've just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions a bunch of kids 14 to 22 put on the dvd of titanic on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal only two of them had actually seen it before but they all had seen the moment of kate leo and celine dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie shortly after the epic started they started to get restless some of them left asking the others call us when the iceberg appears over an hour and a half into the movie only the two girls who had seen the movie before were still there they started shouting iceberg iceberg a stampede followed they all came back to see the sinking of the titanic they sat open mouthed emitting ohs and far outs so just like i thought when the movie first burst into the scene what is this one and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of the of it dr zivagho for instance had a similar running time but think how much takes place in that film within the same period of time in titanic leo teaches kate how to spit look at the faces and hands of the supposedly creme de la creme in the first class dining room of the ship look at the historical details if you can find them the storyline is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to sink the real sinking here is of film standards all the efforts are focus on special effects and opening week ends the film went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time so what do i know
<START> i loved this movie first because it is a family movie second because it offers a refreshing take on dealing with the news of hiv in a family with far less hysteria than what i have normally seen in the movies the brothers are very close yet are not judgmental their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble but not needed in the end i understand that leo's choice on how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most popular one with people but i believed it was the right choice for him i can't believe that this was a french television programme it had great production values i gave this movie a ten and i think you will too once you have seen it
<START> this only gets bashed because it stars david hasselhoff well then let me bash it to compared to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays this film isn't too bad it has the beautiful leslie cumming she is super hot but can't talk very well there is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped she shows off her nice body linda blair does nothing here as well as hasselhoff 3 10
