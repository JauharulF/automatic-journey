<START> first let me say that notorious is an absolutely charming film very lovingly rendered of its time and subject s gretchen mol is utterly painfully convincing the very soul of the contradictions smoothly reified by ms page herself irving and paula klaw are richly drawn as the working class stiffs they were having met paula at movie star news in 1990 i can say that lili taylor's performance is unimpeachable and jared harris as john willie coutts is an adoringly debauched genius anyone with an interest in the recorded history of american attitudes toward sexuality must see this movie in a theater preferably where votes made with dollars count more br br second i will allow that i am a producer of material similar to that for which the klaws would become famous which is no way affects my estimation of ms harron's work as the splendid piece that it is but does condition my view of notorious as an act of political resistance of the first order ms harron has crafted a work of subtle subversion along with v for vendetta it is a movie about another time for our times br br few readers of this site will be aware that the government they will see enacted in notorious through transcription of the very words uttered in closed senate committee hearings is a very close approximation of the one they live under right now while ms harron expressly disallows that she has a political agenda appended to this film her faithfulness to the facts and the respectful and unsensational way in which she renders them synchronizes notorious with the present day the very acts that notorious portrays in loving and accurate detail are defined as obscene by the communications decency act recently brought to the supreme court as a first amendment case and turned back there at the behest of the bush administration in other words the delicate and ineffectual bondage depicted in notorious is indictable today by federal prosecutors in whatever hostile jurisdiction they choose of course there were no hearings in the senate or elsewhere on this matter when the cda was passed of course you know nothing about it because you don't want people in peoria telling you what you can and cannot look at likewise people in peoria probably don't want me telling them what they're allowed to view of course notorious will never be indicted it's hollywood it's lawyered up countless klaws will however continue to be steamrolled by a puritanical bureaucracy that has not advanced its aesthetic moral or biological composition much in 50 years br br in addition notorious posts no 18 usc 2257 compliance statement which is mandated by the unnoticed earmark recently voted into law if any media contains images of sadomasochistic restraint it is required to make available ex warrant records of age and circumstance of all performers notorious fails in this regard also br br in addition to being a splendid piece of entertainment and an nearly accurate historical document notorious will be the litmus against which the bush justice department is itself judged with respect to the 14th equal protection amendment and on perhaps several other constitutional grounds in this regard alone a debt of gratitude is owed mary harron you'll be grateful in any case constitutional or otherwise if you see this film
<START> the arch title doesn't fit this gentle romantic comedy donna reed and tom drake don't have much chemistry but their characters aren't supposed to both are extremely likable and attractive br br the supporting cast is a dream with the exception of sig ruman's annoying faux russian
<START> i too was fooled by the packaging i too fell for the gory packaging and the dvd casing that claims grieved fans as every copy was pulled from shelves though it was inexpensive 6 99 it wasn't really all that worth it no scares and very limited gore the ending was very cheesy and didn't deliver the punch it should have i really don't even know how it became a video nasty with how very tame it is the story drags the characters are obvious amateur actors it doesn't live up to the promise the dvd bonus feature the interview is very strange as the director appears very incoherent and not all there the lead actress talks like she's appearing in a shakespearean production it's a great laugh
<START> i went to see fever pitch with my mom and i can say that we both loved it it wasn't the typical romantic comedy where someone is pining for the other and blah blah blah you weren't waiting for the climatic first kiss or for them to finally get together it was more real because you saw them through the relationship rather than the whole movie be about them getting together people could actually relate to the film because it didn't seem like extraordinary circumstances or impossible situations it was really funny and i think it was jimmy fallon's best performance all in all i would definitely recommend it
<START> this horrible the acting costumes production values editing the script everything about this film is as bad as it can get it looks as if it was filmed with a video camera can you give a movie a negative rating watch the ring instead
<START> pakeezah has a very interesting history which is well documented in the 'trivia' section about how it came to be it seems as if destiny conspired to test kamal amrohi the director while at the same time secretly desiring to see him complete his masterpiece br br pakeezah rides on metaphors poetry and visual elocution as a result the intensity with which emotions come out achieve a dimension which may not be very real but are very effective and leave an impact on the viewer br br meena kumari lives the tragedy of nargis and sahib jaan like her own the other stars of the film besides her are ghulam mohammed the music director lata mangeshkar naushad background score and joseph wirsching the d o p their music and cinematography leaves you spell bound br br pakeezah is a classic in world cinema it reveals new layers to you every time you watch it again kamal amrohi is one of the rare poets of cinema and he left us all a gift
<START> spoilers included this film surely is the best amicus production i've seen so far even though i still have quite a few to check out the house that dripped blood is a horror omnibusÂan anthology that contains four uncanny stories involving the tenants of a vicious hellish house in the british countryside a common mistake in productions like this is wasting too much energy on the wraparound story that connects the separate talesÂpeter duffel's film wisely doesn't pay too much attention to that it simply handles about a scotland yard inspector who comes to the house to investigate the disappearance of the last tenant and like that he learns about the bizarre events that took place there before all four stories in this film are of high quality level and together they make a perfect wholesome high expectations are allowed for this film since it was entirely written by robert bloch yes the same bloch who wrote the novel that resulted in the brilliant horror milestone psycho'Â we're also marking peter duffel's solid and very professional debut as a director br br the four stories Â chapters if you will Â in the house that dripped blood contain a good diversity in topics but they're almost equally chilling and eerie number one handles about a horror author who comes to the house along with his wife in order to find inspiration for his new book this starts out real well but after a short while his haunted and stalked by the villain of his own imagination the idea in this tale isn't exactly originalÂbut it's very suspenseful and the climax is rather surprising the second story stars hammer horror legend peter cushing as a retired stockbroker still haunted by the image of an unreachable and long lost love he bumps into a wax statue that looks exactly like her cushing is a joy to observe as always and Â even though the topic of wax museums isn't new Â this story looks overall fresh and innovating this chapter also contains a couple of delightful shock moments and there's a constant tense atmosphere it's a terrific warm up for what is arguably the best story number 3 another legendary actor in this one as christopher lee gives away a flawless portrayal of a terrified father he's very severe and strict regarding his young daughter and he keeps her in isolation for the outside world not without reason since the little girl shows a bizarre fascination for witchcraft and voodoo besides great acting by lee and the remarkable performance of chloe franks as the spooky kid this story also has a terrific gothic atmosphere the devilish undertones in this story along with the creepy sound effects of thunder make this story a must for fans of authentic horror the fourth and final story in which a vain horror actor gets controlled by the vampire cloak he wears is slightly weaker then the others when it comes to tension and credibility but that the overload of subtle humor more or less compensates that there's even a little room for parody in this story as the protagonist refers to co star christopher lee in the dracula series most memorable element in this last chapter is the presence of the gorgeous ingrid pitt the cult queen from the vampire lovers' certainly is one of the many highlights in the filmÂher cleavage in particular br br no doubt about itÂthe house that dripped blood will be greatly appreciated by classic horror fans i truly believe that with a bit of mood settling preparations this could actually be one of the few movies that'll terrify you and leave a big impression intelligent and compelling horror like it should be highly recommended one extra little remark though this film may notÂrepeat may not under any circumstances be confused with the dorm that dripped blood' this latter one is a very irritating and lousy underground 80's slasher that has got nothing in common with this film except for the title it stole
<START> this could well be the worst film i've ever seen despite what mikshelt claims this movie isn't even close to being historically accurate it starts badly and then it's all downhill from there we have hitler's father cursing his own bad luck on the fact that he'd married his niece they were in fact second cousins hitler's mother klara called his father alois uncle because alois had been adopted and raised by klara's grandfather and brought up as his son when he was really his nephew alois was much older than klara and so as a child she'd got into the habit of calling alois uncle br br the scene in the trenches where hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to take it out on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all viewers we see hitler chase the dog through the trench when he catches up with the poor thing he proceeds to thrash it for disobeying him in the distance we see and hear his fellow soldiers continue to mock and chastise the cowardly little man but then a shell lands directly on his persecutors and every last one we are told is killed outright how then if hitler was the only person to survive the scene did this tale of brutality and cowardice come to be told did hitler himself go around boasting about it i don't think so br br next up hitler bullies and intimidates a poor stressed out and war weary jewish officer into giving him an iron cross i can only assume that this jewish officer had been a pawnbroker before fighting for the fatherland and had thoughtfully brought along some pledged medals from his shop because i'm certain that iron crosses were not being handed out as shown in this comic farce br br all the grotesque clichÃ©s are here not least the calming and hypnotic effect of wagner's music upon the little man if only the producers had kept ian kershaw on side then they might have discovered that franz lehar's merry widow was more likely to float the fuhrer's boat than any flying dutchman from the cannon of richard wagner br br hitler may have been responsible for the deaths of 60 million people but how can he ever be forgiven for his appalling taste in music br br i could go on but i'd be at it for hours br br give it a miss
<START> a single mother diane keaton finds herself working several minimum wage jobs when she gets fired she finds that she is unable to support her sons michael seater and colin roberts the latter of whom has asthma then she goes to her friend and starts selling drugs soon enough she gets addicted to the drugs that she is selling her life comes crashing down especially when her kids namely her oldest son find out the truth and threaten to leave her then she struggles to redeem herself with the help of her kids but can she protect her family from the drug lords who she worked for br br wow this lifetime movie has some of the best acting i have ever seen diane keaton overacts a lot and her character comes off as crazy but she was extremely convincing she is much better suited to drama than to comedy however the best performance in the movie comes from michael seater who plays her oldest son he is perfect as the responsible son who is still young but trying to be the adult in the family his acting was especially great in the scenes where he confronts his mom about the drugs colin roberts who plays the younger son also does a great job br br a movie well worth watching especially because of the acting from michael seater and diane keaton
<START> i really like miikes movies about yakuza this one i saw about 2 years ago and it really fu ed my head never before seen such a sick and twisted thing the story is good and the actors do their thing very well i haven't seen the uk or japan version but i have to say that i believe that the german dvd is a bit censored if you haven't seen the movie already and live in germany maybe you better look out for a dvd from the nederlands or austria the i on dvd contains a lot of very hard and nasty scenes but at the showdown i felt that something was missing about one or two very short scenes br br all in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence that's what i like miike for
<START> kim novak's a witch on the prowl for a mortal lover and james stewart's her choice scintillating comedy of manners from the broadway stage shot by james wong howe in witch color and performed by a sterling cast ernie kovacs is wonderful as the perpetually dishevelled writer redlitch i love this movie though few others seem to kim alone makes it a winner in my book ha my 5 film of 1958
<START> this is a cute little horror spoof comedy featuring cassandra peterson aka elvira mistress of the dark the most infamous horror hostess of all time this was meant to be the pilot vehicle for elvira and was so successful that it was picked up by the nbc network they filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the busty babe in black but unfortunately the sit com never made it past the pilot stage due to it's sexual references this film however is very amusing elvira is the modern day chesty morgan and the queen of the one liners this film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal elvira's haunted hills which was meant to be a take off of the old roger corman movies but falls flat on it's face watch this movie instead for a much more entertaining experience
<START> do not judge this production by the 2 hour version that was released on vhs in the us which is a choppy and incomprehensible mess i had the pleasure of watching the full length 6 hour version available on dvd from the uk and was spellbound the deliberate pace and growing sense of menace are mesmerizing as is the amazing visual and aural landscape this is an ancient rome we have never seen before and far more authentic than most br br director franco rossi was justly celebrated for his 1968 mini series of the odyssey and this mini series is equally powerful just as bekim fehmiu became the screen's best ulysses so klaus maria brandauer may be the screen's best nero now i am hoping someday to see rossi's version of the aeneid eneide that was broadcast on italian tv in 1971 br br i am undecided which version of quo vadis is more powerful this one or the polish mini series from 2001 each has different virtues and in many ways they complement one another certainly either one towers over that hollywood camp riot starring peter ustinov
<START> first things first this isn't an action movie although there is a lot of action in it i think you can compare it to american sports movies where a team of very bad players succeed in the unthinkable winning a game or tournament beyond expectation in this case it isn't about football or baseball but taekwondo in the beginning these street thugs seem to be good for nothing but soon we will find out that they don't want to be thugs and actually achieve something in life it is nice to see them struggle and training i was surprised how funny this movie was from start till the end you will laugh your pants off the young korean actors are very convincing go see this wonderful feel good movie
<START> as the maker of this darkness i admit we neglected 3 very important acknowledgments in our end credits the omissions were over sights that could not be corrected once committed nor did the parties involved who saw the movie mention it at the time on behalf of the excellent cast and crew of the film i extend them an apology obviously some criticisms posted here are harsh in light of their credit being accidentally our production values were negligible and our special effects were quite special indeed but the plot is very strong and the cinematography by john mcleod is superb we hope you the reader enjoy this darkness and the efforts of those who worked their butts off for free thank you dylan o'leary director
<START> wow wow wow i have never seen a non preachy documentary on globalization until i saw mardi gras made in china this film has zero narration and combines verite footage with sensitive interviews with four teenage workers in china who live inside a factory compound they play with toys jump rope and dance yet the majority of their days and nights consist of work work and work but the footage of their work is illuminating and mesmerizing to watch the owner of the factory in china is amazingly open so much so that he hits home the effects of globalization while he punishes the workers astutely following mardi gras beads from china to the carnival the film reveals how the local is connected to the global through humor and interesting compelling footage from both cultures one of the most interesting parts in this film is the cross cultural introduction of factory workers and mardi gras revelers to each other through pictures here the film comes full circle and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation the film is never preachy is not guilt driven and allows everyone's point of view to be present at the end we the viewers make up our own conclusions about the complexity of the film and globalization
<START> why this is called mistresses is a puzzle because it's about four women three of whom aren't mistressesÂ except wait ah i see it's a salacious title and we all have to merchandise i suppose the series itself delicious most of the characters are hell bent on cutting metaphorical chunks off themselves great fun reminds me of lwt's 1976 miniseries bouquet of barbed wire where every character and their dads wielded the machete br br siobhan orla brady is the only actual mistress and she's getting herself in proper trouble husband is infertile so no chance of a baby there then but at work there's dominic played by uber sexy adam rayner who looks so good that there's no surprise when heavy lust breaks out dominic it turns out has no fertility problems i expect his sperms do swashbuckling probably each carries a little sword and now siobhan is inevitably pregnant that way instead what siobhan should do is to shut up good and tight and go with it's a miracle what she actually does of course is say to her friends i have to tell my husband no you don't really you don't stop stop br br katie sarah parish was a mistress once for we learn that she'd had an affair with a married man before the series started unwisely she's now taken up with his son the father died of cancer and katie who is a doctor helped him on his journey so she's an euthanasiarist has had affairs with two of her patients and is sleeping with the son of the father in carelessly ignoring the incestuous undertones it's not going to end well for katie br br jessica is an experimental lesbian she arranges events and she's busy doing a lesbian marriage as the series gets underway she quickly gets into steamy eye exchanges with one of the brides alex played by anna torv and the script hurries along to a lesbonk with great haste however it can't think of a good way of putting the two women in bed together so it invents a very lame you're not having a hen night well i can't let you get away with that i'll organise one and the guests shall be me which achieves the result but isn't exactly winterson i thought script writers were supposed to earn their living lazy torv's interpretation of her character is good alex treats jessica as possibly unsavoury and alex's body language always points backwards when she's moving forward mind once she's over the wall in she happily goes and unsurprisingly for shelley conn is so mouth watering that so would a good percentage of the human race given the chance br br which brings us to trudi who's a widow of course there should be plain people in a community but if you're going to have a plain character then you have to invent something to admire in them it's quite possible to be a lump and engaging however small's trudi looks like one of those characters that casting put prominently in a medieval crowd scene after the director said that's ridiculous not every single character would be pretty more tellingly you can't find anything to admire in her nothing she's a turnip in a bowl of apples appallingly she does sexy from time to time i won't forget her appearance in bright red corset with stockings tucked into her crotch for a long time and for all the wrong reasons br br so good delinquent fun all round there's easily enough material here for a second series and i hope that they do one i trust they learn one lesson though the characters never take off their underclothes in bed having spent abandoned hours of unbridled lust afterwards they surface still wearing their bras or keep the sheets tight wound round their naughty bits after several episodes no nipples yet and you can go beg for a cock what's this early 21st century puritanism so production team are you listening your characters will solve some of their mental problems if they do abandon as well as talk it at least they'll have more fun in the fun scenes poor things in a series dominated by either being in the bedroom or wanted to be in the bedroom or having just been in the bedroom it's a bit silly and jars a lot that the characters bonk in their underwear br br overall i was going to score 6 top end medium but the series does one trick that's rare enough when each episode ends you always want more and you look forward to the next one with anticipation so i score 7
<START> my kid makes better videos than this i feel ripped off of the 4 00 spent renting this thing there is no date on the video case apparently designed by wellspring and what's even worse there's no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie the only date given is 2002 leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he's getting a recent film br br this movie was so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it was made that i'm amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to market it as a video it might be of interest to students studying the counter culture of the 1960's the anti war anti establishment tune in turn on and drop out culture but when you read the back of the video case there's no hint that that is what you're getting if you do make the mistake of renting it though it is probably best viewed while on drugs so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors fassbinder and fengler regardless of your state of mind while watching it i can tell you that it doesn't get any better after the first scene so knowing that i'm sure you'll be fast asleep long before the end
<START> this was a really cool movie it just goes to prove that you don't need silly litle things like continuity and scripts to make a movie it traverses continents in seconds people get shot and nothing happens to them swords set on fire samuari fight on sinking galleons david essex is the epitome of slimey villainy and john rhys davies is just the dude i enjoyed this movie but i like s t movies this is the perfect example of a very s t movie that just kicks ass if you like battlefield earth you'll love this film its swashbuckling its fast its silly its samuaraitastic br br it also looks as if it was made in 1972
<START> i don't what that other review was talking about this definitely isn't a bimbo movie in fact i don't think there was one decent looking girl in it no it's just cheesy poorly done ed wood style science fiction schlock and it's bad i can't even begin to tell you how bad it is i saw it late at night on cable and i was in shock the fact that this movie was ever released is an insult to us all the actors were either friends of the producer or mentally retarded the special effects are a joke and the pace is insanely slow to me though the music tops it all a monkey could write a better theme with a toy xylophone do not rent this thing but if you ever see it on cable watch it you'll be amazed at how bad a movie can be
