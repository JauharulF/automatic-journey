<START> i have a feeling that dr dolittle was intended for an audience composed entirely of children i think i would have had a better time if i sat at home and watched a sit com my favorite characters in the movie were the pet hamster and the two alley mice
<START> there were good performances by robin williams and others but the movie was dull overall and very disappointing compared to the positive reviews br br i thought sy might become a serial killer who bores people to death a forlorn guy in ugly clothes trails his victims around food courts quoting oprah and reciting his medical history until they beg him to shoot them br br i think the movie mostly appeals to egomaniacs who think strangers are interested in their photos i expect most retail workers want a break from the customers
<START> this is one of the worst films i have ever seen it is bad even at tv movie level standards the plot is diabolically flawed and the known names in this film are wasted on confused uncertain characters i don't know how the director managed to keep this excuse of a film together it is that bad billed as a 'psychological horror thriller' it is certainly horrific there is nothing thrilling about it and it could do you psychological damage the initial opening scenes held such promise a possible embarkation on whether the soul is just an aspect of the brain but the utter shambles that followed the car crash scene is beyond belief no matter how hard you try you couldn't care less about the characters there are so many sprinkled ideas that the film is at best a collage of disconnected phrases from chinese philosophers and at worst the film would actually make you go brain dead br br i have purchased over 300 films on dvd and this is the first one i'm going to get my money back on steer clear
<START> simply terrible why wouldn't you use actual actors look this has to stop stop using non actors if you want any credibility or any message sent via these low budget films please for the love of god use real actors most will work for free take advantage of that now back to my comment anyway the humour was lower than that of the bathroom variety and wasn't funny on any level as for the quality in one scene filmed on a public transportation bus you could see the reflection of the crew guess what it was one guy with what looked like a sony camcorder and probably not even his well i assume the only audience for this film are people with a gore fetish and it wasn't even good gore
<START> this film has good characters with excellent performances from the cast david strathairn is diabolically sincere as the child molesting salesman and danny vinson plays a perfect pussy whipped southern husband the slick soundtrack betrays the murder ballad tone of the film
<START> i think this piece of garbage is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed why all the american animators thinks that the kids this days wants stupid gi joe versions of good stories the looney tunes are some of the most beloved characters in history but they weren't created to be xtreme i mean come on tiny toons was a great example of how an old idea can be updated without loosing it's original charm but this piece of garbage is just an example of stupid corporate decisions that only wants to create a cheap idiotic show that kids will love because hey kids loves superheroes right the whole show is only a waste of time in which we see the new versions of the looney tunes but this time in superhero form this doesn't sound too bad but the problem is that this show tries too hard to copy series like batman the animated series or the new justice league the result bad copies of flash the road runner or superman who else bugs bunny the problem is that looney tunes weren't meant to be dramatic the were supposed to be funny as i said before this series sucks and many people wonders why anime is taking all over the world this show tries to be dramatic and action packed but that's something that few series and anime are able to do if you want to see a good upgrade of an old show watch tiny toons that's an example that it's possible to bring back to life old characters but with a good story and respecting the original roots too bad that show is already dead another corporate wise decision i suppose
<START> melissa sagemiller wes bentley eliza dushku and casey affleck play young students at middleton college in the town of middleton the four teenagers form two love triangles one night during an ominous full moon they drive and argue along a slippery and twisting mountain road not looking properly they careen into another car and one or more of them are killed the ghostly nightmare begins pretty lousy and politically correct horror flick without gore and nudity it's obviously influenced by carnival of souls the cinematography is decent unfortunately there is zero suspense 4 out of 10 just another instantly forgettable teeny bopper trash
<START> recently i had opportunity to view a working print in kansas city olathe ks of this title it is difficult for me being a lover of the art as i am to report the following but the truth sometimes hurts and quite frankly after sitting through this tripe i'm using the slang definition here worthless statements or writing for an hour and a half i feel obligated to share warn any interested parties let's begin at the beginning a good place to start as always the first 15 minutes are not really that bad a couple of laughs and decent development but then it is downhill from there this is the story of a woman in her mid thirties that as the writer would like for you to believe is dissatisfied with her life and unfulfilled the first major difficulty occurs when if you don't know that fact going into the movie you won't know it when she suddenly risks it all for in my opinion a very unkempt and unlikely fling with a local salesman there is little development drastically insufficient development to justify her actions for the affair she has and when it occurs one feels as i did that she is just of low moral character the word slut comes to mind hopefully they'll let that pass the review and post the comment this in my opinion is the first fatal flaw of the film if you're married or have ever been in love irregardless of whether you are male or female its going to turn you off quite frankly i feel that it would have made a much better blue movie that's the level in my opinion of which the screenplay is deserving the second fatal flaw is the casting diane lane just didn't work for me here and viggo mortensen is not the right man for the job believe me the only saving grace to the entire film is anna paquin the depth of her ability as a fine actress shines in places conveying a subtle yet very blunt i apologize for the dichotomy but it is accurate portrayal of an emerging teen bravo well done i'm not going to give the ending away but i was disappointed being billed as a slice of life romance is one thing but an ending like that well if that teased you enough to see this picture don't say i didn't warn you but you better look fast if this celluloid is released i doubt it goes four weeks before bursting into flames i'd say wait for the video but the free sex education tapes at most video rental outlets have more entertainment value hmmm dustin hoffman produced this you think he'd learn after ishtar this film once carried the working title blouse man and should have been left on the rack if you've never in your life wanted to walk out on a film give this one 35 40 minutes the only thing worth staying for is anna paquin if you can stomach the fact that you'll find your mind drifting to whether or not you took out the garbage before you left home which is probably where you should have stayed in the first place if you're off to the movies to see this one that's my two cents for what it is worth
<START> this is a film exploring the female sexuality in a way not so often used almost every other film with this kind of sexual scenes always becomes rated x and so seen as a pornographic movie here is a kind of romantic horror story combined with the females own satisfaction need br br a very good film
<START> if you love cult 70's sci fi the way i do or if you like movies such as repo man or buckaroo bonzai than you're going to love this one it's a stream of consciousness 70's sci fi spectacular including a 22nd century junkyard and the earth a million years from now this movie is pure 70's put on steve miller's fly like an eagle or pink floyd's dark side of the moon and you're ready to go
<START> to fight against the death penalty is a just cause everyone who is sane in europe would think so in the usa everything is different the film seems to demonstrate in a first stage that justice can be won against the racist bigot death penalty craving american justice a young man is freed from death row thanks to a law professor who went back to defense counseling for this particular case but the film has a sequel justice in the usa is entirely governed by the aim of vengeance miscarriage of justice is just the same governed by vengeance one person in the local public attorney offfice has a young man prosecuted on false charges this public attorney's officer drops the charges after a while and the young man walks out free but he loses his college scholarship and he is castrated by some vengeful people for whom there is never any smoke without a fire he hides his shame and swears to get his vengeance but he also needs to satisfy his sexual needs which are more mental than hormonal for sure but even stronger because mental and no longer hormonal and he can only do that with little girls he apparently teams with another serial killer who is after the same kind of preys one day the local cops follow their intuition guided by some vague circumstantial elements in the assassination of a young girl and they arrest the young chap we are speaking of they beat him up and interrogate him for 22 hours with nothing but blows and blows and telephone books and guns and russian roulette he confesses sent to death row he asks his grandmother to go get the law professor in massachusetts who is the husband of the local public attorney's representative that had him falsely prosecuted some years ago and the vengeance is on the rails it will fail but it shows that as soon as one in the line of justice police work and other security forces steps off the line of absolute legality some unjust act is done that can ruin even the best accusation case and that can nourish the worst deepest imaginable thirst for vengeance to charge someone on circumstantial elements is just as bad as to let circumstantial elements ruin the work of the police or of justice the best intentions on the police side are ruined by some personal involvement and vengeful intention just as much as the life of a person can be jeopardized by circumstantial elements inflated to the size of evidence which in its turn will jeopardize the whole case by being just circumstantial hence easily discardable with a good lawyer the film then is a deep reflection on the necessity to respect standards and regulations all along the police and justice line if we don't want to make a mistake which in its turn of course does not justify the death penalty since anyway it goes against the deepest belief americans are supposed to have we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness declaration of independence life is an unalienable right that was given to man by his creator which means no one but the one who gave it can take it away only god can take the life of a person away the death penalty is the arrogant appropriation of a power that we do not have even if we do not evoke god we cannot justify the death penalty except as an act of vengeance and here the film shows vengeance is the worst possible motivation in the rendition of justice and in the establishment of public peace if vengeance is pushed aside there is no other justification for this death penalty and there can always be a mistake in that pursuit not of happiness but of vengeance br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university paris 8 saint denis university paris 12 crÃ©teil cegid
<START> this is the story of australian commandos who are captured out of uniform after a raid since they are out of uniform they are justly treated as spies as such they are tried convicted and sentenced to death the japanese court martial out of admiration for their heroism authorizes that they be given a warrior's death of course under the code of bushido this means that they are to be beheaded a fate for which as westerners they are unprepared
<START> revenge is the theme of this denzel washington thriller that offers its share of action mayhem murder and grisly bloodletting the essentials are a bodyguard's search and destroy mission as his charge young dakota fanning is kidnapped from school which is exactly what washington was hired to prevent the mexico city locations are as chaotic as the storyline moves towards its predictable violent conclusion with plot twists along the way washington a former cia operative with a drinking problem gets a good reference from a former fellow agent which sets in motion the plot's outline washington and fanning have a great chemistry between them and after a troublesome beginning the bodyguard and his charge become the best of friends christopher walken rachel ticotin radha mitchell giancarlo giannini and mickey rourke comprise the good cast in support of the two stars
<START> the germans all stand out in the open and get mowed down with a machine gun the good guys never die unless its for dramatic purposes the plot has so many holes its laughable where did the german soldiers go once they rolled the fuel tank towards the train erik estrada please and the whole idea hijacking a train how moronic is that the germans know where you are going to go its not like you can leave the track and drive away what a waste i would rather bonk myself on the head with a ball peen hammer 10 times then have to sit through that again i mean seriously it felt like it was made in the 60s but it was produced in 88 1988 the a team is more believable than this horrid excuse for a movie only watch it if you need a good laugh this movie is to tele sevalas what green beret was to john wayne
<START> the only possible way to enjoy this flick is to bang your head against the wall allow some internal hemorrhaging of the brain let a bunch of your brain cells die and once you are officially mentally retarded perhaps then you might enjoy this film br br the only saving grace was the story between raju and stephanie govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the brit girl perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their escapades in india and how they eventually fall in love would have made it a much more enjoyable film br br the only reason i gave it a 3 rating is because of govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy br br juhi chawla and anil kapoor were wasted needlessly plus the scene at heathrow of the re union was just too much to digest being an international traveler in the post 9 11 world anil kapoor would have got himself shot much before he even reached the sky bridge to profess his true love but then again the point of the movie was to defy logic gravity physics and throw an egg on the face of the general audience br br watch it at your own peril at least i know i have been scarred for life
<START> ray liotta and tom hulce shine in this sterling example of brotherly love and commitment hulce plays dominick nicky a mildly mentally handicapped young man who is putting his 12 minutes younger twin brother liotta who plays eugene through medical school it is set in baltimore and deals with the issues of sibling rivalry the unbreakable bond of twins child abuse and good always winning out over evil it is captivating and filled with laughter and tears if you have not yet seen this film please rent it i promise you'll be amazed at how such a wonderful film could go un noticed
<START> this is the kind of picture john lassiter would be making today if it weren't for advances in cgi and that's just to say that he'd be forgotten too if technology hadn't made things sexy and kewl since 1983 twice has got the same wit imagination and sense of real excitement that you'd find in a pixar flick only executed under the restrictions of the medium c 1983 innovative animation techniques combine with a great script and excellent voicing to produce a movie that appeals on lots of levels it should be spoken of in the same breath with spiritited away and toy story
<START> what an inspiring movie i laughed cried and felt love for a true story it does give you hope and that miracles do happen it has a great cast ellen burstyn samantha mathis jodelle ferland she's 4 or 5yrs old what a actress its on showtime a must see movie
<START> i figured the whole joke of the movie would be to see some rich white guy acting like chris rock and then see chris rock react to people's reactions instead you just see chris rock being himself and people not understanding him there are maybe 2 scenes in the entire movie where they use their gimmick this should have been a lot better
<START> i have grown up reading modesty blaise both the comics and the books and she truly is a heroine to me although not being a great fan of quentin tarantino i anyway was interested to hear a few years back that he was considering making a film of her could he finally give modesty a nice big screen treatment she's worthy of i heard of 'my name is modesty' a few months ago and checked the stars it had been given here and wasn't too surprised to find out the score was not too high since beloved characters often have hard time melting the fans' heart if not done exactly right so i decided not to read any reviews and see the film instead and well i just finished watching it and i'm stunned and sad and yeah pretty furious too sad and furious of giving over an hour of my time seeing something so fabulous as modesty blaise character being turned into a film that has nothing to give to a viewer or a fan br br it seems that almost everything about this film is sub par and unprofessional although i must admit seeing some actors in other films earlier where they were fine so i can't blame them but the screenplay and the directing my god why even make this kind of crap with production values slightly bigger than your average tv film but done much worse i don't know the background of this film and actually i really don't want to know but i just can't help wondering that how on earth could tarantino with a straight face tell that he loves modesty and then put his name on this he just lost a huge amount of respect in my eyes the director was not the right man for this job and i can honestly thank him for ruining my night br br i give this film 3 stars and those stars go to the actors and the technical quality which could've been worse the other seven stars missing are what this film was not good at oh well hopefully at some point there will be a serious production of the modesty blaise movie that has some other goals than to steal money from the modesty fans although if people like tarantino are the ones making the decisions i'm not holding my breath
