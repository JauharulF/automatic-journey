<START> this is by all categories the best movie i have ever seen forget hollywood their movies always sucked this is art moon child's story starts with kei a japanese vampire who loathes what he has become and lives in denial his wish for final death leads him to mallepa where refugees from several asian countries live here he meets sho an orphan living on the street br br from here the movie is an intense experience which bases on the visual and emotional part of the movie it has everything you laugh you cry you get angry excited sad happy never has a movie touched me the way this movie do and the actors are amazing never have i heard anyone speak so many languages without it sounding strange a big praise to the editor for creating this masterpiece br br a last comment on this brilliant movie is that it stars gackt ex vocalist of malice mizer and hyde vocalist of l'arc en ciel in excellent roles as sho and kei i am amazed at how gackt can change his way of speaking and acting depending on what age he is acting out br br this is a must see if you never see any films see moon child the crow brandon lee and the newly released masterpiece final fantasy vii advent children all in their original languages of course
<START> it even beats the nasty raw almost twenty years old is this show and still i laughed very much when i was watching it last night it shows eddie murphy dressed in tight red clothes old school and he jokes with everything from celebertis to his family he was only 22 years old then and this is a must see br br 8 10
<START> this is one of the greatest sports movies ever made by hollywood what a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of american history what makes the story of james j corbett especially interesting is that mr corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day in that respect james j corbett was truly innovated but getting back to the movie all the performances were excellent alexis smith was beautiful indeed she looked like nicole kidman and although it's a period piece the story withstands the test of time it has not gone stale ward bond's portrayal of john l sullivan has to be one of the great portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are realistic well staged and highly effective that coupled with a great script makes this movie a must
<START> although i am inclined to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen this movie i am ashamed to say i rather like it not often can such a huge pile of 80s pap be found outside of a wham video so it is most definitely worth a viewing Â£0 79 a night in my local store watch out for the insanely obvious seams and zip on the monster's costume the fact that the 'hero' looks a lot like keith chegwin and such classic lines as the following evil wizard type bloke at last we meet kor kor thrilling isn't it br br amazing i also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous falcon like bird carrying a handsome hero to safety among other such 'interesting and engaging' suggestions of what goes on in the actual film none of them actually happen no i'm not joking there really isn't a raging sea or a ferocious bird it's just trying to make you interested classic in my opinion this film gets 10 for pure entertainment value
<START> i cannot say enough bad things about this train wreck it is one of the few movies i've ever been tempted to walk out of it was a bad premise to begin with first pregnant male but then they tried to make it a spoof what were they spoofing all those real pregnant males this was the worst movie i have ever seen if it had enough votes it would be on the imdb bottom 100 if it was possible to give it a zero i would and i would still feel i had given it too much credit
<START> william shatner in small doses is tolerable unfortunately instead of leaving his character as a minor irritation and in that moderately amusing it has been seen fit to enlarge his role and overdo it just as occurred in the original star trek series i guess i will never understand american humour which frequently goes 'over the top' to get the message through i vote with my feet i no longer watch the show which is a shame because the rest of the cast were good it is pity that shatner's overdone role also affects james spader's performance but the majority demonstrate the way society is going i guess i don't travel the same routes frank
<START> the first question that springs to mind after watching this rubbish is who on earth gave these idiots the right to use the omen name on this movie it is a shambolic embarrassing pathetic atempt to carry on the omen franchise when the film starts the backing music sounds like it has been lifted straight from a bugs bunny cartoon and from then on the film gets worse i dont know who wrote the script but i bet they got a e for it when they took it back to show their teacher it is difficult after a while to tell if this is a comedy because what happens is so funny and so un true to the original omen it beggers belief the acting is laughable especially from the leading lady faye grant she keeps pulling silly faces or is she finding it difficult not to laugh it's hard to tell the worst sequal i have ever had the misfortune to witness 1 out of 10
<START> after having seen marrying mafia i'd nearly lost my faith in korean movie business but this one brought my faith back br br leading female character who is university student forced to teach the spoiled rich but charistmatic high school student guy he is actually female character's age through some hilarious quarrells these two end up being great friends br br i was pleasantly surprised that newcomer kwan sang woo did his job with excellency he was such a revelation actress kim ha nul was also charming as usual br br this movie tried hard to avoid any cliches that can be seen in typical romantic comedies and it didn't show us any unnecessary nude sex scenes it was brilliant lovely fresh made me want to see it again br br
<START> whether this movie is propaganda or not i firmly believe it is not it really shows the power of media the importance of this documentary is not to show how good of a man chavez is it is really to demonstrate the way the bolivarians saw how it happened the chavez way of seeing it although it may seem wrong and bias to support a film i think the point of view shown in the movie is utterly legitimate the venezuelian people via the private media corporation of venezuela only saw a one side perspective of the coup the neo liberal side this movie shows us the way the bolivarians saw it call it propaganda i say it's a judgment call on your part

<START> takashi miike is one of my favorite directors and i was worried about him doing a kids film because i would hate to see him depart from his films i came to love visitor q gozu izo ichi the killer and black socioty trilogy lately he seems to be exploring new territory and i think he's succeeding still this was the first of his films i'd seen him take that direction so i was nervous of coarse i bought it without seeing it and was glad i did br br great yokai war is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too the whole film reminded me so much of the movies i loved as a child neverending story labyrinth return to oz etc i enjoyed those films because they didn't treat kids like they're stupid and this one doesn't either the dark underlying morals are there but it's also as silly as any kids film should be i personally wasn't bothered by the cgi and prosthetics i feel like they fit well and don't think kids will notice br br if you are a die hard takashi miike fan you may not like this one but i suggest giving it a shot it proves that miike is as diverse and talented as i suspected he is he also continues to make his signature miike films outside of these ones which is very reassuring br br to those people that are new to takashi miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one i suggest these other miike films 'zebraman' 'the happiness of the katakuris' 'sabu' and 'the bird people in china ' br br good job takashi miike 8 10 stars
<START> when i watched this film the first time it was a taped copy and the title was is caged terror i still own the tape and i confess i've watched it more than once from beginning to end the film is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often unintentionally amusing i have gotten a few of my friends to watch this and we've had some great laughs from the terrible script the film concerns a couple remember this is like early 70's so they are just too hip man who go on a week end camping trip in what i believe was supposed to be upstate ny they have some hilarious dialogue after catching and eating a fish and the girl bemoans the death of the fish and that they ate it the guy comes back with something goofy about how they ate the fish and now it was a part of them and he goes and that's beautiful man heavy man really heavy lol anyway along come a couple of vietnam vets one of who plays the flute i believe at any rate they are musical fellows the guys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple prove unfriendly they end up terrorizing them during the night the guy ends up caged in a chicken coop and has to watch his girl friend being ravished by the two guys actually by the end of the night she seems to be pretty into it and when morning comes the guys leave and the girl and guy are free to leave supposedly the guy has learned a lesson about how to treat people and the girl has a smile on her face anyway i would recommend this film highly to anyone looking for a damn good laugh it never fails to amuse me anyway if i could find this on dvd and replace my old tape copy i'd actually buy it again it's classic camp you gotta love this stuff
<START> this is a strange sex comedy because there s very little comedy but a whole lot of sex most of which takes place in the back of a car and is so graphic it makes basic instinct look like an edition of teletubbies i kid you not the sex in this film is so in your face it might just choke you especially if you re watching with your grandparents br br as for the rest of rita sue and bob too there s not much else worth mentioning except the language where every single sentence seems to contain the f word this a rather bleak hyper realist british film made at a time when channel 4 was the main investor in british movies which explains its made for television low budget feel
<START> where is it written that sequels must suck scream 2 didn't others didn't but this one sure did problems include horrible actors only christopher walken could act in the entire film bad writing you will never understand what's going on and i even have done research on the idea of nephilim before and just horrible choices for casting eric roberts makes the stupidest archangel michael that i have ever seen in my life br br avoid it like the plague unless you are desperate to see christopher walken in that case just fast forward to the parts where he is in the film and avoid the others br br yech
<START> the interplay between the characters is a moral disaster you end up disliking most of the characters and you don't particularly like any of them br br even the two main characters played by david and gwen are so badly written that you really don't care one bit about them the movie has no plot no direction and no purpose the single redeeming quality of the movie was to treat it as a glimpse into the messed up lives of a few losers and that's hardly stimulating even as an afternoon waste
<START> i love this movie i mean the story may not be the best but the dancing most certainly makes up for it you get to know a little bit about each character the way they want you to learn about them i just think that you won't like this movie unless you're into broadway
<START> an underrated addition to the graham greene cinematic canon its perceived faults can now be seen as virtues director shumlin theatrical director frames his action with an oppressive rigidity appropriate to the material and the seemingly inept compositions compellingly suggest unease both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration for the female character in a 40s thriller the film has an upright hero who turns mad and murderous and possibly paedophiliac brilliantly brings the faraway ideologies of the spanish civil war into jolting dangerous reality has one horrific murder an astonishing insights into class and capitalism clever theatrical metaphors a rare approximation of greene's god and an ending that is only happy if you know nothing about history
<START> it is rare that one comes across a movie as flawless as this it's truly one of the best acted most tightly structured films i've ever seen every line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways relating to each of the three main characters differently the film weaves an intrinsic web of motivations and double crosses that snare you and refuse to let go add to this that the slow burning romance between kevin and faye is as moving as anything that's ever been committed to celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect film it exposes the romance of movies such as titanic as the trite cliches they are if you're looking for a movie to watch while you fold laundry this isn't it you have to commit yourself to this film you can't have a conversation while running in and out of the room this movie demands your attention treat it with the respect you deserve and you'll get a lot out of it unless you think titanic is the greatest film ever
<START> i found it a real task to sit through this film the sound track was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was being said there was little to move the plot along and often the action simply stopped and there was a prolonged period of conversations which seemed extraneous to the movie these conversations switched between family groups and the observer was left to try and piece together what the common thread was that tied them together it is rare that i rate a film this low and do so in this case as the entire viewing experience left me thinking so what and why did i waste my time watching this
