<START> i saw this movie after i saw blue crush and other of michelle's movies i thought she had a bleak future in this business i was extremely wrong after watching her performance in girlfight i was amazed in the way she captures the emotion of one a fighter but also a warrior in this movie the way she confronts her father about the treatment of her and her brother the way she conveys anger when getting hit her characters learning curve in the movie of she cant always put up a wall and hide from love or that just because she has power she wont win i believe this role was fit perfectly for michelle even though she had no prior experience the director saw talent i criticize myself for not seeing the talent in her
<START> i enjoyed albert pyun's nemesis for its cheesy action and semi complicated script a lot of people complain about the confusing plot to the first film which is probably why nemesis 2 nebula has a dumb as rocks plot with the same super action to carry it through br br this one gives the name of the first movie's hero alex to a bulked up super female sent to the past to save the future she is raised by a tribe in africa a good portion of the film only has dialogue in an african tongue without subtitles which i liked because it made it seem somewhat authentic how often do movies in this genre really try to do that it doesn't take long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her br br don't get me wrong this is a piece of crap not that the first one was anything great there are subplots involving africa's political unrest treasure hunting and tribal combat the picture is very short on brains so none of these things gets a very good treatment the picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to muscle babe vs cyborg it has its entertainment value just don't expect quality or anything of the first movie
<START> kitten natividad of russ meyer film fame plays chastity knott a woman who has found she has breast cancer so she goes to south america to get some special fruit crockazilla that is supposed to have healing powers after going down on some of this fruit which appears to be plastic bananas on stalks chastity is endowed with some mystical magical powers that makes her a super hero specifically the double d avenger note that she's also wearing a pair of panties as a mask in writing that all sounds pretty good in execution well it leaves more than a little to be desired it seems that chastity owns a pub and a local strip joint is upset because she's taking away their business so some of the strippers including haji also of russ meyer film fame go after her to ruin her of course chastity fights back in the guise of the double d avenger watch her do a wonder woman type spin to change into her outfit and also lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force bad jokes and lame double entendres fly like there was no tomorrow with the inane theme song playing over and over this comes off like a twisted 70's live action kid's show with adult content although while this is unrated it could probably get away with pg 13 at the worst and it's probably a blessing that the faded stars kept well covered this makes doris wishman's chesty morgan films look positively wonderful in comparison special appearance by forest j ackerman but so what very stupid and i'm never buying another film with joe bob briggs on the cover 2 out of 10
<START> i don't know what margaret atwood was thinking to allow this movie to have the same name as her book i've always been a big fan of the robber bride and was so excited to learn there was a movie in the works i am aware that the translation of book to movie isn't perfect but this movie was the worst ever the names of the women are correct and some of the back story is correct but that is about it i feel like i lost a good portion of my time trying to make it through this movie this really should have been a mini series to tell the story the way it was written br br the actors for roz tony charis and zenia were well chosen even though i was skeptical at first about mary louise parker i only wish they'd had a better script to work with because this really had nothing to do with the book at all
<START> as an engineer i must say this show's first season started out very promising most of the applied mathematics were somewhat plausible and the relationships portrayed between the eppes brothers and father gave the show an interesting edge br br but after the first season the show started degrading heavily most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving is now utter gibberish and very laughable to all people involved in science technology for real br br the involvement from the actors still feels okay and i can imagine a fair amount of money is still going into producing each episode but in the end this has degraded to a very unpleasantly tasting dish which is a mix of a grade c action thriller and csi style cop show br br if you are gonna watch it go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second thereafter i would not waste my time myself i gave the show up midway through season 3 br br season 1 8 stars season 2 5 stars season 3 3 stars br br let's sum that up to 4 stars since charlie doesn't know his math anymore i won't bother with the correctness of mine either
<START> hey hulu com is playing the elvira late night horror show on their site and this movie is their under the name monsteroid good fun to watch elvira comment on this crappy movie have fun with bad movies anyways this movie really has very little value other than to see how bad the 70's were for horror flicks bad effects bad dialog just bad movie making avoid this unless you want to laugh at it while you are at hulu check out the other movies that are their right now there is 10 episodes and some are pretty decent movies with good plots and production and you can watch a lot of them in 480p as long as you have a decent speed connection

<START> holy crap this is so hysterical why aren't american comedies written like this for anybody who thinks comedy has to be dumb there is more wit and intelligence in the six episodes of this series than in a shelf of novels hugh laurie is a complete hoot i couldn't believe it was the same guy as house there are so many great lines and gags in this series you could watch each show dozens of times and still pick up on new things each time rowan atkinson is hilarious as the verbose and put upon butler edmund this is my favorite of all the blackadder series and tony robinson is wonderful as ever as the somewhat obtuse heart of the series the oppressed mass baldrick some of my favorite lines when someone messes with a wellington he really puts his foot in it and baldrick explaining how he got his name and cousin macadder the top kipper salesman and homicidal swordsman from scotland
<START> ok so guy gets bitten by a bat and then turns into a bat well sorta i can only assume this made sense to someone at the time aren't bats supposed to fly use radar and eat bugs instead of attacking humans tho
<START> i'd love to give this movie a 10 10 but in its existing state i can only go to 8 10 tops the post code editing read destroying of this film warrants a 2 point demerit br br from my very limited knowledge of film history baby face was apparently one of two movies that finally broke the camel's back and brought the full wrath and enforcement of the production code into play in 1934 i don't know what the other movie was as a result the movie in its original incarnation was never allowed to be re released after 1934 it was chopped and edited to bits and no original version is known to exist today the best that we can see today is the version that tcm turner classic movies shows but that is blatantly edited in several scenes and has a really disappointing happy ending slapped onto the end br br all the above being said the movie is still pretty darned great and lots of fun to watch barbara stanwyck is as always absolutely amazing and wonderful she is so beautiful and powerful she just owns the whole movie she plays a woman who's been used by men her entire life starting with her father who pimps her out to the local erie pa steel workers as well as to local politicians in a quid pro quo of 'if you don't shut down my speakeasy i'll let you sleep with my daughter' when the father dies in a fiery explosion near the beginning of the flick the smile on stanwyck's face is priceless br br after the fire stanwyck leaves erie with her maid and heads to new york city she sets her sights on a skyscraper and starts literally working her way to the top starting out with the personnel clerk in the hr department she sleeps with him to get an entry level position at the bank from there she sleeps with man after man after man including a very young john wayne using each new man to help her land a higher paying job on a higher floor of the skyscraper with increasingly powerful male bosses cum sugar daddies stanwyck stops at nothing in her rise to the top it is great fun to see her and her maid in increasingly fancier clothes and apartments as stanwyck works her way up the corporate ladder stanwyck is the ultimate femme fatale manipulating she vixen in this flick if you watch this movie i recommend stopping when you see the george brent character courtland trenholm die in stanwyck's arms skip the remaining 3 minutes or so the happy ending slapped on to the end of the movie for post code audiences is insulting to the audience's intelligence and lame beyond belief the bank board members are sitting around a table expositing about mr and mrs trenholm's million dollar donation to the bank and how they are living happily but poor in erie with former vp trenholm now working in the steel mills cut to the exact same footage of a steel plant that we saw in the beginning of the movie the end puh leeze how lame the movie originally ended with george brent succeeding in his suicide attempt i think that ending fits the overall mood of the movie much better than the slapped on post code ending br br i certainly hope that a print of the original pre code version of this flick is discovered during my lifetime update the original has been found and should be out on dvd and or tcm in 2006 until then i'll enjoy the tcm version and switch it off before the lame o post code ending
<START> woody allen has lost his ability to write dialogue or characters that are clearly distinguishable from each other this is the case with melinda and melinda where all the characters speak with allen's generic pseudo sophistication and have problems and points of view that are not relatable to anyone outside of a four block radius of where allen lives they also share the same curious condition of being able to afford multi million dollar manhattan apartments that appear to have been designed by professional decorators regardless of their financial situation or what they do for a living br br the only character who exists outside of this dull mindset is will ferrel as the obligatory woody allen surrogate although he does not simply come off as merely doing a woody allen impression like kenneth branagh in the god awful celebrity ferrel lacks the charm or charisma that the real woody had when he was playing the part himself in his best movies br br the end result is another in a string of self indulgent bores from a once great filmmaker who has been trading in on his former reputation for years
<START> this documentary or i should say mockumentary is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be when they have full enthusiasm on something like that honestly i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it just destroy it however something positive in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists so that is the reason why it deserves a 1 of 10 and not a 0 an example of false information would be the hydrogen idea it is true that according to chemystry the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions so in that case you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing so it is impossible anyway there is actually something worse the idea of the platinum this element is more difficult to find than gold and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that it is ridiculous they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth but off course at least that explain why they got extincted probably cryptologist's call themselves scientists but they are not people like them say lies like in this mockumentary and what is worst some people buy them but i do not think that a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this those fake scientists waste their time
<START> there are some things i can never understand such as this movie what if i were to create a really really cheap and crappy looking dino and crocodile polygon model in maya and then proceed to cut and paste that into an amateur video clip having people scream and getting eaten by the same thing how can anyone even believe that an utterly fake cgi dinocroc that looks completely out of place would influence the events in this movie i know that its b grade low budget and all but the producers could do better than making a piece of crap that no one will ever seen see or sit through it just does'nt make sense are people really so stupid that they would sit through this apparently so for laughs no this thing isn't even worth laughing at
<START> this movie was awesome not quite as good as the leif garrett masterpiece longshot but still awesome i thought ashley looked freakin' huge compared to mary kate in this film i wonder why who woulda thought they could swith places like that and almost get away with it dad was kinda a jerk though and mom was a little too chummy with helmit head i give it 4 any one who likes this movie shoudl check out longshot
<START> what a long drawn out pointless movie i'm sure that historically this film is delightful but as entertainment goes it just doesn't make the grade ralph fiennes has been in some fantastic movies the english patient schindler's list but this one was such a let down it didn't seem to be going anywhere his character at the beginning was so shallow and uptight it amazes me that his sister would ever have been interested at all don't bother paying to rent this movie buy yourself a copy of the english patient instead
<START> a surprisingly good movie it has quite a few good jokes thru out the whole movie the only negative thing is that some scenes go to the extremes to show just how stupid the two main characters are we get it stupid blondes get on with it br br the plot just barely dodges being called corny and boobies are always a plus altho the movie for some strange reason doesn't play with that card very much even tho the plot line introduces two black haired women who act as the evil counter part of our two blondes br br so all in all a good movie to watch i almost gave it an 8 10 but let's not get crazy
<START> while thinking of the great escape i allowed my mind to wander back to this little gem of a movie from my childhood i had read and re read the autobiographical novel from 1949 which inspired it and when it came to the only cinema we never used that word then actually in town that showed foreign films i was first in line to buy my ticket br br as someone brought up on wartime newsreels and propaganda films during wwii i had an avid interest in exploring the realities of that conflict as reflected in the memoirs and stories of men who were there in person that extended later to a keen willingness over the years to buy any book on the subject and eventually to read the equally compelling novels of hans helmut kirst and erich maria remarque which provided an even deeper sensibility the movie versions however were unlike this one in that they rarely delivered the goods br br the medium of black and white film has never been served so well as it was in those years i have never seen any technicolor version of war that seems as authentic as do the deep chiaroscuros of films like the wooden horse if it is true that we are destined always to be captive to the images of our childhood then i confess it freely br br and there will never be another the likes of leo genn as the emblematic british war hero on film not even sir alec
<START> plenty has been written about mamet's the house of games most of it good i decided to revisit the flick to see how it held up after 17 years and was surprised at how much i enjoyed viewing it again the film's success and durability probably has much to do with two principal ingredients which are always fun on film a good story and a good scam mamet manages to bring his signature moodiness and obvious histrionics to the film while scamming us the audience and the mark simultaneously then he explains the art of conning only to do it again etc all the while building the story the house of games now a freebie on cable is worth a look for first timers and an okay rerun for mamet fans b
<START> something surprised me about this movie it was actually original it was not the same old recycled crap that comes out of hollywood every month br br i saw this movie on video because i did not even know about it before i saw it at my local video store if you see this movie available rent it you will not regret it the suspense builds throughout and the twist ending is excellent br br
<START> pretty standard b movie stuff seriously anyone who watches dragon fighter with dean cain and a bunch of people making their first movie should know better than to expect real quality or even moderate intelligence b movies exist to re work formulas that are popular if you give them even token analysis you'll wind up ruining the movie for yourself and perhaps writing some self important slanderous review on imdb br br i liked the female lead kristine byers she had charisma and i thought she was notably attractive it was a memorable b movie appearance unfortunately i don't see where she has made any movies since i'll watch for her again
