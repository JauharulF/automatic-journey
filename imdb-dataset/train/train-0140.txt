<START> oh man does this movie ever bite if you were ever afraid of seeing a rehash of the slasher genre done as cheap as possible and as cautious at the same time pc friendly means no nudity a classic element of slasher films cut is it every cliche is retread without a hint of self awareness and the acting oh the acting redefines the word horror i should have known better as the direct dutch translation of the title would have tipped me off
<START> this piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow the sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its production br br poor film making aside the story is vile just sick evil sh t if you like rape murder and self harm this is right up your alley and if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed i watched almost all of it but had to turn off after i seen someones brains blown out never before have i seen a film that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty
<START> i stole this movie when i was a freshmen in college i've tried to watch it three times the second two because friends wanted to see it sweet adam sandler i've never heard of this movie but since he's so funny its gotta be funny wrong i can't make myself watch this pile of crap after the dream boxing match insult war where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain you would think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous but after watching this you'll know its true this movie isn't worth the price i paid for it i've watched a ton of steven segal movies and i've even watched crossroads twice but i still couldn't watch this
<START> i had seen 'kalifornia' before must be about 10 years ago and i still remember to be very impressed by it that's why i wanted to see it again and all i can say is that it still hasn't lost its power even though i'm used to a lot more when it comes to movies than that i was ten years ago br br 'kalifornia' tells the tale of the writer brian kessler and his girlfriend carrie laughlin a photographer who want to move to california but instead of stepping on a plain and flying right to the state where they say it never rains they choose to make a trip by car he wants to write a book about america's most famous serial killers and she will make the matching pictures but because their car uses an enormous amount of petrol they decide to take another couple with them so they can spread the costs of the trip only one couple has answered the add so they will automatically be the lucky ones but they haven't met each other yet and when seeing the other couple for the first time when their trip has already started carrie is shocked without wanting to be prejudiced she can only conclude that early grayce and adele corners are poor white trailer park trash she definitely doesn't want them in her car but brian doesn't really mind to take them with them and decides to stop and pick them up anyway at first the couple doesn't seem to be that bad after all but gradually early grayce changes from a trashy hillbilly into a remorseless murderer br br not only is the story very impressive so is the acting from our four leads brad pitt is incredible as early grayce his performance in this movie may well be his best ever the same for juliette lewis she plays the childish and naive girlfriend that doesn't want to hear a bad word about her early and does that really very well but david duchovny and michelle forbes are a surprise as well they both did a very good job and i really wonder why we never heard anything from forbes again since this movie because she really proves to have a lot of talent br br overall this is a very good and impressive psychological thriller with a very powerful story but because of the graphic violence i can imagine that it may not be to everybody's taste although i don't really see another way how to portray a serial killer in a believable way personally i really liked this movie a lot and the violence never bothered me it's a part of the story that's too important to be left out i reward this movie with an 8 10
<START> other reviewers here seem to think this is an awful film that's simply not true and a little unfair br br the acting is of a good quality and the direction moves on with a decent fluidity i don't think there's anything wrong with the tarantino esquire way of interlocking stories together perhaps its just a new tool for directors to try i thought it made the film much more interesting perhaps a few elements of the script need tightening but that's about the only fault i can find nestor cantillana gives a great performance as sylvio also antonella rios is stunning and worth the price of admission alone
<START> this is the funniest stand up i have ever seen and i think it is the funniest i will ever see if you don't choke with laughter at the absolute hilarity then this is just not your cup of tea but i honestly don't know anyone who has seen this that hasn't liked it it is now 17 years later and my friends and i still quote everything from goonie goo goo to the fart game aunt bunnie to the ice cream man ralph and ed to get out there are just so many individual and collective skits of hilarity in here that if you honestly haven't seen this film then you are missing out on one of the best stand ups ever take any of robin williams damon wayans the dice george carlin or even the greats like richard pryor or red foxx and this will surpass it i don't know how or where murphy got some of his material but it works that is what it comes down to it is funny as hell br br could you imagine how this show must have shocked people that were used to eddie doing buckwheat and mr rogers and such on snl if you listen to the audience when he cracks his first joke or when he says the f word for the first time they are in complete shock br br his first time he says the f word is when he does the skit about mr t being a homosexual br br hey boy hey boy you look mighty cute in them jeans now come on over here and f me up the ass br br the crowd erupts in gales of laughter no one was expecting the filthy mouth that he unleashed on them but the results were just awesome i have never been barraged with relentless comedy the way i was in this stand up in fact the next time my stomach hurt so much from laughing wasn't until 1999 when i saw south park bigger longer and uncut that comedy was raw and unapologetic and it went for the jugular as did delirious i don't think it is possible to watch this piece of comic history and not laugh it is almost twenty years later and it is still the funniest damn thing on video br br i took your kids fishing last week and i put the worm on the hook and the kids put the fishing pole back in the boat and slammed their heads in the water for two minutes gus normal kids don't do shit like that gus then they started movin their heads around like this and the m f come up with fish then they looked at each other and said goonie goo goo i said can you believe this f n shit br br see it again and be prepared to laugh your freakin ass off br br 10 out of 10
<START> el mar is a tough stark utterly brilliant brave work of cinematic art director agustÃ­ villaronga with an adaptation by antoni aloy and biel mesquida of blai bonet's novel has created a film that traces the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure wrecks havoc on adult lives and though the focus is on war's heinous tattoo on children the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear this film becomes one of the finest anti war documents without resorting to pamphleteering the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following children's march toward adulthood br br a small group of children are shown in the spanish civil war of spain threatened with blackouts and invasive nighttime slaughtering of citizens ramala nilo mur tur david lozano julia sergi moreno and francisca victoria verger witness the terror of the assassination of men and the revenge that drives one of them to murder and suicide these wide eyed children become adults carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their minds br br we then encounter the three who survive into adulthood where they are all confined to a tuberculosis sanitarium ramala roger casamajor has survived as a male prostitute protected by his 'john' morell juli mira and has kept his life style private tur bruno bergonzini has become a frail sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to catholicism and the blur of delusional self mutilation crucifixion francisca antÃ²nia torrens has become a nun and serves the patients in the sanitarium the three are re joined by their environment in the sanitarium and slowly each reveals the scars of their childhood experiences with war tur longs for ramala's love ramala longs to be free from his morell and francisca must face her own internal needs covered by her white nun's habit br br the setting of the sanitarium provides a graphic plane where the thin thread between life and death between lust and love and between devotion and destruction is played out to detail more would destroy the impact of the film on the individual viewer but suffice it to say that graphic sex and full nudity are involved in some of the most stunningly raw footage yet captured on film and the viewer should be prepared to witness every form of brutality imaginable for this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and director villaronga is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense the actors both as children and as adults are splendid roger cassamoor bruno bergonzini and antÃ²nia torrens are especially fine in inordinately difficult roles the cinematography by jaime peracaula and the haunting musical score by javier navarrete serve the director's vision a tough film this but one highly recommended to those who are unafraid to face the horrors of war and its aftermath in spanish with english subtitles br br grady harp
<START> this movie is just great if you have a chance to see it then you should run to see it even though the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from 1932 pacino does a great job playing as tony montana to get around br br pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in anyway and make it sound just great if you thought that pulp fiction was good with the swear words if you saw it then you should also see scarface to see another angle at how an actor can say them its quite sweet br br even though the movie is has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast through time not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct it is still easy to follow along but you must keep your eyes peeled at all times to not lose anything personally i have found that watching this movie makes three hours seem like a breeze it is really just that great br br this movie is one of thoe movies that is acted and directed so well that not only do you forget that this movie was made in the crappy 80s but that it makes you actually root for the bad guy so say good night to the bad guy
<START> funny sad charming these are all words that floated through my head while i was watching this beautiful simple film br br it is rare that a movie truly moves me but shall we dance accomplished that with grace to spare gentle humor mixed in with occasional subtle agony made this easily one of the best experiences of my movie viewing history it left me with a quiet sense of exultation but with a small touch of sadness mixed in br br and the dancing oh yes the dancing even if you are not a lover of the art or can't put one foot in front of another the steps displayed here will take your breath away and make you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can it was absolutely enchanting even the parts that show sugiyama's touchingly portrayed by koji yakusho stilted steps when he was first learning to dance were lovely in a humorous child like way and yet this film was not entirely about dancing but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings we witness a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance a beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love for the art and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting cast br br beauty pain emotion all the love and little agonies of life are here expressed with the delicate feeling of a fine japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of the culture br br
<START> i havent seen that movie in 20 or more years but i remember the attack scene with the horses wearing gas masks vividly this scene ranks way up there with the best of them including the beach scene on saving private ryan i recommend it strongly
<START> in 1967 i visited the lake elsinore glider port and flew a yellow pratt read sailplane returning to germany the above serious ran on tv and one segment was about the high altitude sailplane flights in california in the early 50ies the real life pilot was bill ivans i don't know who played him in the series it turned out that the sailplane in the film was the same same n number as the one i had flown at lake elsinore ever since i saw that segment i have been searching for it and have been wondering if it is somewhere available other segments in that serious were about the baker ejection seat an instrument to find avalanche victims etc
<START> taking a break from his escapist run in the early '80s steven spielberg directed whoopi goldberg in an adaptation of alice walker's the color purple about about the desperate existence of an african american woman in the 1930s watching goldberg play celie it's incredible that this is the same woman who starred in movies like sister act this is the sort of movie that could easily be no make that should be part of the curriculum in black studies and women's studies there's one scene that may be the most magnificent editing job that's ever been on screen you'll know it when you see it i can't believe that this didn't win a single oscar it may be spielberg's second best movie behind schindler's list maybe even tied with it also starring danny glover adolph caesar margaret avery oprah winfrey willard e pugh akosua busia and laurence fishburne
<START> i managed to catch a late night double feature last night of before sunrise 1995 and before sunset 2004 and saw both films in a row without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately after sleeping it over i have to say that i largely prefer the former over the latter and i shall explain why br br before sunrise introduces us with then young actors ethan hawke reality bites dead poets society only 25 at the time of the film's release and julie delpy the three colors trilogy then 26 although looking much younger he is a promiscuous american writer touring europe after breaking up with his girlfriend she is a young french student on her way home to paris they meet on the budapest vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together the two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of vienna exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love br br the film has 1990's written all over it back then technology was leaping rapidly the new millennium with all it's hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future the characters of jesse hawke and celine delpy with all their flaws and inconsistencies celine's accent if by mistake or on purpose was half american half french and it swinged from one spectrum to the other breaking the character's credibility were a mirror of the time watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement acting all clichÃ©d and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well is what really made this movie work for me the fact that the director doesn't let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while br br all in all sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of vienna a well told classical romantic rendezvous and a film i will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future
<START> masks is a moving film that works on many levels at its simplest it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art masks to the next generation although at times the story makes the old man into a job it is so well crafted written acted directed wonderful production values it is easy to move beyond his plight and if you hang with it the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting kudos all around this is a wonderful film for children as well as adults the trick is how to get americans who may not like foreign language films to see it
<START> what a wonderful fanciful movie stardust is br br i could easily end it with that one statement and suffice to say one could take it as a very strong recommendation to go see it br br at a time when hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels down our throats stardust makes us remember why we go to the movies in the first place to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives other times or other planets ironically stardust takes us to all three places effortlessly and with a childlike glee we all long for br br stardust is full of all the characters we remember as children princes witches pirates ghosts and scoundrels it has the damsel in distress the hero the rogues the obstacles spells antidotes charms and even a touch of light speed to make it quasi modern br br stardust is about a man from the town of wall which is conveniently situated next to a wall that separates their town from a magical kingdom the only way past the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger played wonderfully by david kelly one day a young man from wall named ben barnes out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech he happens upon an enchanted kingdom called stormhold where he meets a chained and very sexy young lady named una she is held captive by a witch and leashed by an unbreakable chain while the witch is away una seduces ben and sends him on his way ben returns to wall without incident and continues his life but nine months later he is summoned to the wall breech where the old guard hands him what you might expect a baby boy br br the boy named tristan grows up to be a rather hapless young man charlie cox who is smitten with a girl way out of his league and also betrothed to another nevertheless the young lady named victoria and played sienna miller goes out once with tristain and he confesses his love to her after they espy a falling star she tells him he can have her if he retrieves the star and brings it back to her he agrees and sets out on his quest which will take him to the other side of the wall br br meanwhile in the kingdom of stormhold the old king perfectly played by peter o'toole is dying he calls his remaining living sons to tell them who shall succeed him to the throne his sons' names are primus secondus sextmus and septimus the other sons where killed by the other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throne br br anyway he tosses his ruby charm to the sky and voila that what brings the star to earth br br the star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named yvaine clare danes and she of course is wearing the charm but little does she know she is now being persuaded by tristain the princes and also an aging witch named lamia michelle pfeiffer who wants to cut out the stars heart to regain her own youth br br complicated yes but it all comes together as the adventure unfolds br br tristain is the first to find yvaine but is so blinded by his devotion to victoria he doesn't recognize the growing bond between he and yvaine his initial interest lie only in returning yvaine to victoria as proof of his love but he must get past the princes and lamia first the princes aren't that big an issue as they are constantly trying to kill each other and just as in pirates of the caribbean never has death been so funny br br but tristain also encounters the witch who enslaved his mother though he doesn't know it's his mother and a band of flying pirates led by robert deniro br br his is the most important character in the movie and deniro plays it to a tee he steals the movie with his toughness and soon we learn an undercover secret that will leave audiences on the floor with laughter though his role is small in length deniro is extraordinary br br michelle pfeiffer is wonderful as lamia a sexy evil witch claire danes is most appropriate as the confused and distressed yvaine she makes a perfect damsel jason flemyng adam buston rupert everett and mark strong add the perfect dose of levity as the fighting princes whom as they die return as ghosts ala blithe spirit and high spirits br br moreover director matthew vaughn whose only other directing experience was layer cake weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoy br br stardust may be too complex for young children but anyone over the age of 13 will want to see this movie multiple times it's that good stardust is what movies are supposed to be perfectly written perfectly cast perfectly directed and perfectly acted in other words perfect
<START> i think the comments regarding the show being cheesy are a bit too exaggerated when a person comes to watch a tv show what does he look out for it is to enjoy that he watches a show unless he she is a critic or a person who analyzes story but most of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy full house is an ideal show to watch after having a heavy day in the office school it makes you laugh and it is not just humor br br yes the tanner family is a perfect family a perfectly hypothetical family if any such family existed in real world it would be a role model for us to follow but this is a tv show and not a real family and there is nothing wrong in depicting a hypothetical family on television the very fact that the show could run so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it whatever be the comments later on br br another good point about the show is that any person of any age would not only enjoy watching it but would take back a message however childish that message be those jesse's talks with michelle are extremely touching if one doesn't think of it as childish br br overall i would say after watching every show of full house there is a contentment in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows
<START> cinderella is a beautiful film with beautiful songs of course in fact it's one of the best films of the 1950's br br i think all the characters are portrayed amazingly you can see the cruelness of cinderella's stepsisters and her stepmother the sweetness of cinderella the mice are funny and sweet too br br i think they changed the tale a bit but i think it's for the best it's such a nice film and i don't think anyone could resist it deep down br br i give it a 8 10 i don't think it's the best disney film but it sure is a true classic
<START> once a year comes a movie like that and makes things easy for you you don't have make an effort to think it is good it's just is you enjoy it while you watch it and you take it home with you i can't say it is totally flawless but it's near acting great story interesting and with elements of suspense it's a small family story pretty much predictable but it's not the secret itself that matters it is the way the it takes the blind girl to reach it i was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship the blind girl and her cousin the only thing i didn't like that much is the actress that played the mother she was too tough and without necessity keren
<START> reasons to watch the movie br br 1 bo derek at 16 looks good and occasionally gets naked she does a pretty good job playing an immature insecure 16 year old beauty in fact br br 2 many shots of a pretty greek island br br but br br 1 peter hooten turns in the worst performance by an actor since brutus played caeser's friend in roman senate proceedings of march 15 he delivers each and every line in a delightful baritone bellow turn down the volume whenever he speaks preferably all the way down br br 2 bo's fantasies are sadly tame especially by today's standards a few turns in the bath and as a fully clothed model br br 3 the plot is skimpier than bo's costumes
<START> contains spoilers br br hollow man is probably the weakest movie that paul verhoeven director of great movies like total recall starship troopers and robocop has ever made br br that's probably not his fault for some reason verhoeven got stuck with an utterly mediocre script and he made the best of it br br the first part of this movie is rather good with lots of cynical jokes great special effects and even skunk anansie on the soundtrack unfortunately the movie falls flat in the second part were it degenerates into a standard slasher movie or maybe a very bad alien clone the ending is especially ridiculous spoiler as kevin bacon keeps coming back to life after a number of incidents that should in the logical sense of the word have killed him spoiler and the entire thing is quite shallow indeed the subject of becoming invisible is never fully investigated br br but all in all verhoeven manages to stay well above average with this movie br br 1 2 out of stars
