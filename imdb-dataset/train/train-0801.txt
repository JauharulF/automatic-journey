<START> i bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart i am glad i did it was very entertaining listening to sean connery and playing the game i thought the graphics were the best i have ever seen in a movie game remake the bonus levels were very hard the sniper one i think was too hard it made me so frustrated i didn't play the game for a week and a half there were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it br br the only thing i might change was the upgrade system i didn't notice any difference from un upgraded equipment to the upgraded such as buying an armor upgrade didn't seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter i really liked the q copter i think the developers did a good job
<START> i haven't seen this film in years so my knowledge is a little rusty i do remember thinking that this film is twice the film of braveheart it is simply more realistic and has more believable characters ridb roy looks like one would imagine rob roy to look like messy hair and beard with simple clothing also the liam nesson has a celtic look about him he looks like a scot and more importantly looks like rob roy it's a comparison which angers some people but compare him to mel gibson as william wallace gibson is supposedly playing a man who's legend has caused him to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant while gibson is almost a foot shorter the story contains a little romance conspiracy and an underdog story sound anything like braveheart but instead of a film that cries out freedom liberty and nationalism we get a film which says honour love and justice this makes it a more interesting film much like gladiator the cast is fantastic and liam nesson is a very strong leader in this endeavour the story is great with how it deals with heroism and humanity the scene where mary is raped and she walks out of the burning house with a look of true scottish strength is followed by her washing the semen from her crotch in an extreme panic this is something a heroine in braveheart would never do overall this is a stunning and almost flawless watch go and see it
<START> omg this is one of the worst films iv ever seen and iv seen a lot i'm a film student i don't understand why angelina jolie would be in this movie did she need the money that badly i love aj and have seen almost everything shes ever been in so i watched this 2 tick another one off it was soo bad not even good bad just bad bad it had 1 or 2 funny little moments but all in all it was bad n a waste of 101 minutes i cant even say aj looked good in it because well she didn't the plot is predictable unless you r expecting a re telling of romeo and juliet then its not all round disappointing maybe if your 12 this could be a good film otherwise i really don't recommend it
<START> sorry to go against the flow but i thought this film was unrealistic boring and way too long i got tired of watching gena rowlands long arduous battle with herself and the crisis she was experiencing maybe the film has some cinematic value or represented an important step for the director but for pure entertainment value i wish i would have skipped it
<START> if you're not in the mood for more than an hour long movie than this film could give you some variation what i love is the ongoing surprises it's not only once that you want one or more of the short film in 'new york i love you' to be continue yeah some of the short films makes you curious some of them very short some of them longer some of them has it definite ends some of them don't br br most of the story presents the sad side of the capital city it shows many different nationality background many of it make it feels the same way where i have been once went to a capital city in other countries for a year where it has many people came from different countries this movie explore many type of things you might have known but for all the characters it's a new things maybe some of you have traveled abroad alone to stay for a year or two just to feel something new meet new people feel dreamy sad but the kind of sad you looking for because it is just that bored you were in your own home you might want to reliving it again by watching this
<START> this movie is another one on my list of movies not to bother with saw it 40 years ago as an adolescent stayed up late to do so was very annoyed to find that it was about 95 romance 4 everything else 1 history if that it's what i call a bait and switch movie one with an interesting title the actual movie is a scam this is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment this movie is almost an insult to those who served the actual members of the lafayette escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help france and i suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than tab hunter's character flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldn't have lasted two days it would have either been the stockade or the infantry discipline in the french army was often rather fierce in short another hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment
<START> this movie certainly proves that also the good americans can do terribly good propaganda no questions being asked no comments being made on power abuse or police terror when james stewart solid and convincing as always solves all the stories from dillinger to 5th column more or less singlehandedly june allyson as his regular love interest holds up the family values and e j hoover is executive producer and children or non guilty bystanders are never harmed when the professionals execute not to speak of civil rights which are never broken or homes which are never intruded and if the fbi service would not be enough steward also gives his son's life for the country in ww ii perfectly made if you wouldn't know better
<START> why a stupid boring crappy overrated film series like star wars gets all the hype and a truly amazing film like this one goes completely un noticed is beyond me this movie will really open your eyes to the dark disturbing sad and scary world we live in br br unlike the boring elephant this movie isn't one of those just a typical day until someome pulls the trigger movies this movie focuses more on what happens after the event br br deana played by the very hot and very talented erika christensen is a happy and healthy straight a student with great friends and a great life until she is injured on the day of the shooting by being shot in the head luckily she is not killed but is severely injured and has to be in the hospital for a while causing her to be in a lot of emotional pain in addition to the physical br br meanwhile alicia played by the also very gorgeous and talented busy phillips is a nasty cold hearted rebellious anti social goth girl who doesn't have a single positive trait on her and she is unharmed when the shooting happens because it turns out she was friends with the shooter and knew he was going to do what he did which causes her to be brought into the police station and be asked some questions when she refuses to tell the cops if she knew the shooting was going to happen they constantly come by her house to try to convince her to say something and she still doesn't so the principal of the school makes her attend a funeral of one of the dead students and after she walks out on that the principal decides enough is enough and forces her to go visit deana in the hospital of course she refuses this too but the principal says that if alicia doesn't do this the cops are going to continue to try to get her to say something and so she actually goes to see her br br the lonely traumatized and both physically and emotionally wounded deana is more than happy to have someone visit her but of course alicia is anything but happy to be seeing her deana attempts to give her a friendly welcome but of course alicia responds with nothing but harsh and hurtful comments and a harsh statement on how she is only here because she is being forced and has no intention of being friendly with her at all but sooner or later that intention will change and that's all i'll say this is truly one of the most moving movies ever as well as one of the most dark and disturbing actually i think i would tie this with american history x as equally disturbing and moving at the same time br br warning watch this movie at your own risk it contains very graphic scenes and images excellent and criminally under appreciated movie i feel so ashamed that i'm pretty much the only one that knows about it
<START> excellent film i cried when she cried i loved when they loved i was frustrated when they were this film touched my heart it was a reality check for me since this is reality for me a 19 year old soldier
<START> the next time you are at a party and someone asks the other day i heard the expression 'author's will' does anyone know what it means tell them to sit through 'head above water' the only way diaz could possibly have survived this movie was by means of this literary device commonly used by bad writers there are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs however the film does not stand up to the most minor logical analysis why does keitel tie diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind why so she can do the chainsaw gag of course for me the best part of this movie was that i saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop
<START> anyone new to the incredibly prolific takashi miike's work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director in keeping with miike's working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with what takes the movie out of the realms of the same old same old however is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in today's cinema and this isn't that nice cool clean violence so beloved of us cinema this stuff is nasty painful and hurts that said the pace is breakneck the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities miike's sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be making it hard to look away from the screen whatever he might be showing you it doesn't have the ohmigod ending of dead or alive but if you're not squeamish now's the time to get on board the miike bandwagon before he ends up on some hollywood studio's new john woo shopping list
<START> arthur bach needs to grow up but that is unfortunately not the only thing he needs to do according to his extremely rich father arthur has to marry a certain wealthy susan johnson or he's cut off from the family money 750 million dollars worth the problem is arthur doesn't love susan though i hear she makes some good chicken and has just fallen head over heels for the waitress and part time shop lifter linda marolla arthur is an interesting fellow he's really just a big kid born into riches with at least one person looking after him every second of every day working just rubs arthur the wrong way he likes to have fun womanize and of course drink drinking gives arthur a sort of jekyll and hyde complex and while that gets him into all sorts of trouble it's absolutely hilarious to watch on screen br br dudley moore is great here in this film as arthur earning an oscar nomination and golden globe win for his performance moore is fantastic with the comedic aspects of the film turning the already funny lines into unforgettable comedic gold but he is also great in bringing arthur down to a relatable level and making the character likable moore has some help in the co star department liza minnelli is great as lina the spirited nobody who arthur can't get enough of and john gielgud is terrific as arthur's butler hobson gielgud won the best supporting actor oscar for his performance in this film and there's no doubting why hobson has a stone solid dry wit and stuck up attitude but he's always looking out for arthur and gielgud is perfect in the role steve gordon's 1981 film arthur is short and simple but delivers laughs a plenty
<START> as a horror movie fan i try to watch all significant novelties of this genre especially those which are the products of my native cinema and i can say that that the power of fear or vedma as the russian title of it is one of the weakest film among them firstly it can't scary even a little kid it paces so slowly and so predictable that there is no place for the real horror frankly speaking it's bad in all points from the goofy plot i don't know why the russian producers director decided to transform the classic story about ukrainian witchcraft into some lame and ridiculous modern day america thriller i absolutely agree with the previous reviewer Â it doesn't thrill a bit and to the terrible and cheesy actors' work all actors including the leading valeri nikolayev and yevgeniya kryukova who are quite famous in russia look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me they didn't even bother to play at all only spoke their english lines without any expression and at the end i don't really understand why they filmed this flick in english with russian actors i think it was their wrong turn at least they could cast some american or english actors for the leading parts to make them look more convincing the same i can say about so called small american town backgrounds which were shot in estonia and look like it the only positive moment i found in the power of fear is the visual effects they are not excellent but rather good for the russian film and the music is ok at least it doesn't irritate me that's why i give it two stars overall if you want to see good horror film Â don't waste your time and money on this boring flick and if you are looking for something that claims to be a russian horror i'd advise you to find a copy of viy or the spirit of evil it's really the terrific movie based on the same novel as power of fear but much much better
<START> gotta start with ed furlong on this one you gotta god bless this kid 5 bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he's really like in real life he has a one liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script you know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn't even seem like furlong is even acting maybe that's why his performance was good same with madsen you keep thinking i bet this guy is really like this in real life does madsen even have to act just natural vosloo has obviously moved on from the type casted mummy guy i think the biggest surprise to this film was jordana spiro's performance her reactions are spot on in this film i battled if she was hot or not but realized i would just like to see more of her br br not a big fan of shoot 'em out hostage type films but what i am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing it's not just your standard robbers take over a bank they kill hostages and the good guys win in the end type of film the twists keep on coming and coming br br the cafÃ© scenes work best with the hand held cams to show what it's really like in there not glossed over a bit think like bourne ultimatum lite style on some scenes in the cafÃ© br br and for those bo bice fanatics out there actor curtis wayne who plays karl will make you do a double take these guys are twins br br as i watched i wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countries states so they might have these accents but more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of and some of them are smoking hot moncia dean need i say more
<START> there is so much to love in this darling little comedy anyone who has ever built or bought a house or even just been short of space will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the addled mr blanding melvyn douglas with great comedic flare both narrates and acts as the blandings' attorney and voice of reason as well myrna loy is at her best as a rather scatterbrained but extremely patient wife but the best performance is grant's he is the american everyman especially relevant at the time of this film's release when the nation was in the grips of a housing shortage after the end of the war the themes are universal lack of money work strain fear of infidelity yes it does wrap up awfully neatly but you must keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war and wanted a happy ending it is still relevant today and i must chalk up the poor reviews i see to a present preference for dumbed down gross out comedies the look of the film is slick and there are some great bits of comedy is well particularly toward the beginning while it may have lost some of it's social relevance nearly sixty years after it's release it is still a gem
<START> this is a delightful movie that is so over the top that my wife daughter and i found it irresistible the plot is just crazy but rings true to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous improbabilities and impossibilities br br i particularly enjoyed kevin kline's and sally field's performances i don't anyone better than kline at playing thickheaded field's character's truly desperate need for attention and affirmation and her almost bipolar swings in mood played nicely against the background of field's famous infamous you like me oscar exclamation people who can take themselves with such a large grain of salt are all too rare in this world br br i think this is the only movie where i didn't find myself impatient with whoopi goldberg characterization i thought she was spot on in every note she struck robert downey jr teri hatcher cathy moriarty and elizabeth shue were also first rate as well just a great movie if you're in the mood to go along for the ride and laugh
<START> only the chosen ones will appreciate the quality of the story and character design of this movie superior ancients that dwell in the lands of lore far beyond any average human creature's understanding this movie pulls the adventure genre into a unique centrifugal magical force of fantasy unto thee mystical crystals of chalice stories come and go but the idea for a good story is to think positive not negative thoughts to create a good versus evil battle like never before embracing an impounding shimmering process that keeps imagination glowing in one dimension and out the other striking a quick flash of energy that transports a human to another world
<START> not only was this movie better than all the final season of h lots but it was better than any movie made for tv i have ever seen br br looking at the top 250 i see that only one small screen movie has made it how the grinch stole christmas i think it is time to increase that group to 2 br br i will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this but i didn't mind i just loved being able to enter the world of the baltimore homicide squad again
<START> although some may call it a cuban cinema paradiso the movie is closer to a how green was my valley a memory film mourning for a lost innocence the film smartly avoids falling into a political trap of taking sides pro castro anti castro focusing instead in the human frailty of the characters and the importance of family filled with good acting in particular from mexican actress diana bracho who plays keitel's wife a masterpiece filled with references to classic movies from casablanca to chaplin's city lights gael garcia bernal plays a small role which is critical for the dramatic payoff of the story tv director georg stanford brown in a rare return to acting remember the rookies plays a homeless bum who acts as greek chorus superbly it is a pity that this movie originally titled dreaming of julia has been released in the states by thinkfilm with the atrocious title of cuban blood which has nothing to do with the movie
<START> i spent almost two hours watching a movie that i thought with all the good actors in it would be worth watching i couldn't believe it when the movie ended and i had absolutely no idea what had happened i was mad because i could have used that time doing something else i tried to figure it all out but really had no clue thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it right or wrong it's better than not knowing anything who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away how did first lady know that her husband was cheating on her at the end of the movie kate said she would eventually find out the truth does this mean that we're going to be subjected to end game 2
