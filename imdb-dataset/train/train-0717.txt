<START> despite being quite far removed from my expectations i was thoroughly impressed by dog bite dog i rented it not knowing much about it but i essentially expected it to be a martial arts action film in the standard hong kong action tradition of which i am a devoted fan i ended up getting something entirely different which is not at all a bad thing while the film could be classified as such and there is definitely some good action and hand to hand combat scenes in the film it is definitely not the primary focus its characters are infinitely more important to the film than its fights a rather uncommon thing in many hong kong action movies br br i was really quite surprised by the intricacy of the characters and character relationships in the film the lead character played by edison chen who is really very good becomes infinitely more complex by the end of the film than i ever thought he would be after watching the first thirty minutes the police characters also defied my expectations thoroughly in fact the stark and honest portrayal of the seldom seen dark side of the police force was quite possible my favorite aspect of the film i don't know that i would say dog bite dog entirely subverts typical notions of bad criminal good cop but it certainly distorts them in ways not often seen in film unfortunately so many films especially hong kong action films i find portray police in what is frankly a very ignorantly idealized light this is one of my least favorite things about the genre i was pleasantly surprised to see that dog bite dog actually had some very unique and really quite courageous ideas to present about the police force there are negotiation scenes in this film that i have never seen the likes of before and doubt i will ever see again and am sure i will remember for quite a while also the criminal characters are shown from an interesting perspective as well there is some documentary footage in the film of cambodian boys no older than ten being made to fight each other to the death with their bare hands which i thought was one of the film's most powerful and moving moments it says a lot about the reason these guys are the way they are rather than simply condemning them also the relationship between chen's character and the girl he meets in the junk yard reveals a lot about his character it wasn't until this element entered the film that i really started to see the film as an emotional experience rather than only a visceral one there is something about most on screen relationships that doesn't quite get through to me but for some reason this one really did the actress does an incredible job with this role which i imagine was not easy to play br br dog bite dog also features some really breathtaking cinematography all though it is unfortunately rather uneven there were some moments that i found really striking particularly in the last segment of the film but there was also a good deal of camera work that was just ok another slight problem i had was with the pacing which i also felt was uneven i found a lot of the looking for a boat scenes to be a little alienating all though it quickly picks up after that the action scenes are short and not too plentiful but are truly powerful and effecting particularly towards the end the fight choreography is honestly not all that impressive for the most part all though to its credit it is solid and fairly realistic but the true strength is the emotional content behind the fights the final scene while not a marvel of martial artistry or fight choreography is one of the most powerful final fights i have ever seen and i've seen quite a few martial arts films br br i suppose the biggest determining factor of whether or not one will get much out of dog bite dog is whether or not you can connect with the characters all of them are certainly some of the more flawed characters one is likely to see in a film of any kind but there was something very human about all of them that i couldn't help but be drawn to and really feel for them particularly chen's girlfriend i should say that i doubt most people will like the film as much as i did simply because i imagine that most people will not like or care about the characters in the same way but i still recommend it highly all the same it is truly a deeply moving and effecting film if you give it a chance
<START> the movie starts out fine widower out with new girlfriend and the children br br the movie is filled with stupid director's choices like lets separate i am coming down to do what stupid stupid stupid br br please do not waste your time hoping that it will get better not hardly
<START> i read all these reviews on here about how this is a such a good movie jeez this movie was predictable and pretty boring the acting was below average most of the time especially by mckenna i haven't seen a more pathetic attempt at making someone badass in a movie oh man this movie was a letdown i also read somewhere this might be a cult classic i know there are followers of the director but this movie was just a average piece of film br br the script was lame for the most part the acting was lame this movie was lame br br oh and pray for the guy that used to be in cheers he looks really bad br br the best actor in this movie was probably the guy in office space and he was only in this movie for about 8 minutes br br 4 10
<START> i do find it a bit overrated maybe it's just because i've never seen a subtitled version dubbing stinks but i just don't get into it like a lot of other people do the finale is really great though as jackie trashes a mall a scene that plays in my head every time i go shopping
<START> this is a better adaptation of the book than the one with paltrow although i liked that one too it isn't so much that beckinsale is better they are both very good but that the screenplay is better davies is a master at adapting austen for filming and the production values here are very good it's not quite as glossy as the hollywood treatment but it's close and i thought that the locations and the costumes actually worked better
<START> it's my opinion that when you decide to re make a very good film you should strive to do better than the original or at least give it a fresh point of view now the 1963 robert wise telling of shirley jackson's remarkable novel the haunting of hill house is worth the price of admission even today now fast forward to 1999 and the re make i was left shaking my head and asking why the acting is wooden the story unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with as many special effects computers can generate i had heard that this update was bad but couldn't believe it was that bad considering the source material i was wrong after watching this and saying to my wife how awful it was she said well they got your money she's right don't let them get yours if there's no profit in making lousy re makes maybe they'll stop making them or come up to a higher standard that doesn't insult their audience
<START> melvyn douglas once more gives a polished performance in which this time he inhabits the role of a detective who can't place love before duty and adventure and the warmly beautiful joan blondell who far from being illiterate as one reviewer suggested wrote a novel about her early life is as enjoyable as ever as his ever suffering sweetheart it's almost a screwball comedy almost a thin man type movie almost a series i guess that didn't quite make it to a sequel it doesn't quite reach classic status but it has all the ingredients for a fun 85 minutes with an episodic but pacey script fine character actors and direction that keeps it all moving fast enough so that you nearly don't notice that williams douglas isn't exactly columbo when it comes to detecting i wish there were more films like this
<START> brothers with psychokinetic powers yes really duel not just for debra winger's affections but really over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powers br br there are surreal touches the fire brigade that act like a singing greek chorus but there is also humour and romance the soundtrack is great similar to the way american werewolf in london used every great wolf song they could get but with fire and i don't think i'll ever forget dennis quaid mmmmm dennis quaid setting his own trailer a rockin' to 'she's a lady' priceless br br best line missing from the quotes section btw 'once you've had a clown you never go back ' br br i love this movie i ordered the dvd from the us and if the comments written by the kind of people who'd be happier with legally blond 3 don't put you off give it a try
<START> harvey keital's best performance so far the new century very nicely photographed a beautiful snap shot of pre castro cuba the story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an american with hollywood connections it's really about the moment when a boy awakens to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger much more complex world that he doesn't yet understand the script is strong and filled with humor the direction is crisp over all a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of latin american cinema the one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync sound english rather than spanish probably to improve sales in the us unfortunately this just makes the film a little less convincing but if you can see beyond this you will find a heartfelt trip to another world recommended
<START> this was a strong poirot suchet television mystery selection the characters were vivid and well acted the plot and the main setting a student hostel were excellent japp was nothing special but for me did not distract from story one significant point many poirot watchers don't recognize good acting or good characterization i also think they are rather harsh in their judgments of some of the poirot mysteries finally i have read few christie novels none in recent years and find it annoying that so many viewers are upset about changes from the novel please viewers consider what is presented to you on film not what you think should be there that said the poirot mysteries vary in quality but not as much as reviewers and raters would have you believe with the singular exception of the five little pigs which was fabulous in plot character and theme the longer poirot films are neither that good or that bad for the record i have seen all the longer poirot suchet films finally films without lemon hastings and or japp are neither good nor bad because of their absence there presence however is either obtrusive almost always with japp or irrelevant with hastings lemon is in the middle
<START> in micro phonies the stooges are at there best in this short the trio are handymen working in a recording studio they end up getting a look at alice van doren christine mcintyre singing the voice of spring the voice is amazing curly in drags is heard by mrs bixby symona boniface moe calls curly senior cucaracha the three stooges end up going to party where curly is going to dress up in drags they play a record of the voices of spring and all is going well until moe destroy the record on curly's head they end up using the lucia sexlet until the baritone recognizes them and unplugs it alice van doren catches on to the boy scream and hides behind a curtain to help them out all is well until the baritone wonders how curly is singing without the aid of a phonograph discovers alice behind the curtain the three stooges are revealed to be frauds but alice's father discovers his daughter's talent and agrees that she should become a singer the stooge are pelted out of the room excellent
<START> if you only read a synopsis of the plot this movie would sound like quite a typical one of the 1930's the story would seem quite contrived the subject matter maudlin the strength and beauty of this film is in the direct earthy performances of the cast i have seldom seen jean harlow display such a range of feeling rich and subtle nuances float over her face if you watch their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel there is such an obvious depth of feeling between the principal characters the raw emotions are so sincerely portrayed so true the final sequence is almost unbearably poignant when clark gable looks down with such joy and surprise at his son lifts him up and proudly says my kid i couldn't help remember that mr gable's own son was born to him posthumously this is one of the finest examples of depression era cinema
<START> yet another example of what british cinema can achieve a simple story told and acted well brenda blethyn gives a layered and warming performance as the recently widowed and financially straitened grace ably assisted by a solid supporting cast the quirky small town card gets played to the hilt similar to many tv series and films that have come from the british isles in recent years ballykissangel hamish macbeth and others come to mind like the forementioned this film makes use of some ravishingly beautiful rural scenery in this case the wet and wild cornish coast br br some viewers might find wholesale acceptance of cannabis use a bit challenging others might find the ending just a little too cute and safe but it's an enjoyable spliff to be sure
<START> the 1990's begun to have day time talk shows sprout up left and right every network had one and they all lacked one thing originality ricky lake was just another show to entertain the obese trailer park mother with a marlboro cigarette hanging out of her mouth while breast feeding one of her dozens of toothless illiterate children the english language and other cornerstones of mankind where ruined by this shows existence titltes ranging from girl you a pigeon head and so on how could anyone want to watch this pure and utter garbage has our society really became nothing more than a bunch of hill billy's and dead beat fathers the people who appear on this show were trash the people who watched this show were trash anyone that wishes to see this show re aired or put onto dvd is trash people wonder why americans are becoming huge piles of lard and too fat to even get jobs its having shows like this tell them its ok to be 500lbs overweight and have 12 year old girls act like prostitutes having such trash on tv has ruined morals
<START> that magical moment in life that point between the beautiful innocence of childhood and the confusing whirlwind that marks adulthood this is what this movie is all about br br danni wonderfully played by reese witherspoon is right at that moment in life when the movie starts she swoons over elvis playing his records and wishfully thinking about love maureen her sister will soon be off to college has no trouble with attracting boys is beautiful and seems to have it all figured out although she doesn't she dates a local loser whos father is also after her and just wishes she could find a decent boy and be swept off her feet danni like most young teenagers wishes she could be anyone else but herself because most teenagers think that who they are just isn't good enough she wants to be maureen but doesn't see that she is beautiful herself br br the moment adulthood begins to intrude itself upon her life is when she meets court foster for the first time court whos father has recently died has moved to their old farm to work it with his mother and two younger brothers he has been thrust responsibility when he should be having fun on one particular hot day he goes to the pond and jumps in only to find danni skinny dipping they yell and argue and danni leaves but they see each other a day later when courts mother is invited to danni's to visit old friends danni's parents danni becomes attracted to court and court to danni she is a tomboy and is spunky has attitude and says whats on her mind br br court is 17 and danni 14 and he knows it but they continue to grow closer with their days at the pond between court working the farm by the time court kisses her one day danni is smitten danni's father tells her to invite court to the house and he does but things are uncomfortable for court on his sort of date the silence though is broken by his meeting with maureen who has yet to see court one look between the two and its all over the looks of pain and defeat on danni's face are both beautiful in their trueness to life and painful at the same time the rest of the movie i will not tell but the movie has more to it than a relationship between a boy and two sisters br br the greatness of the movie is in its depiction of lifes moments both beautiful and painful and the relationship between two sisters whose love is tested by both a boy that they love and the pain they must endure both together and individually danni eventually marks her entrance into the world when she sees that the world is unfair painful and maybe even a little less hopeful than when the movie started few movies can truly capture the wonder of childhood and the pain of adulthood so perfectly this movie has since the first time i watched it stuck in my mind its in the my top 100 movie list and deservedly so i only wish more movies like this were made because if so my faith in hollywood would be a lot better
<START> there's really not much need to begin this little review with a plot synopsis i mean it's shakespeare's hamlet for goodness sake Â probably one of the best known plays ever written i'm not embarrassed to admit that i came to this version of hamlet the way most people on imdb have Â through mystery science theater 3000 while the show may not be the best venue to use to judge a movie in this case i cannot imagine attempting to watch it without the comedic quips in a word this german made for tv version of hamlet is dreary 152 minutes no way it's too dark and depressing to be anything i want to spend almost three hours on i've said it any number of times but entertainment is the thing for me and this wrist slitter is far from entertaining i will however give it a couple of points for what i felt was some reasonably good acting a 3 10 sounds about right to me br br as much as i enjoy mst3k their comments don't help to make hamlet any more palatable there are a few good riffs here and there but overall hamlet is just the wrong movie for mst3k shakespeare is far too talky to allow the comedy to have any sort of rhythm or flow as much as it pains me i've got to give hamlet a 1 5 on my mst3k rating scale
<START> this one's a romp many trek fans don't rate this as high as the well known all time classic episodes because it lacks the deep meaning or undertone of those really great ones but this one is so well executed for what it is so successful as pure entertainment it always makes my personal list of the top half dozen episodes no matter what mood i'm in several well known future movies westworld and tv shows the more bland fantasy island took their cue from the premise of this episode then of course the tng show revamped the concept with the holodeck technology beautifully filmed especially evident in the restored version and on dvd and directed it takes place in the nice park like setting of a planet which the enterprise has just arrived to it's odd that no animal life even insects seems to exist here how are flowers pollinated for example but things turn really odd when members of the landing party start seeing people from their past kirk has a people heavy past it turns out as well as figures from other well known fantasy stories sulu even finds an old style police revolver adding to his collection of swords no doubt br br by this point in the trek series halfway thru the first season the main characters had pretty much solidified into the old friends we'd come to know over the many proceeding years here we get to really see them relax converse and work together to figure out this episode's puzzle the strong narrative is a mystery again of sorts and the audience is along for the ride as kirk friends seek to unravel a very bizarre series of events which have a decidedly amusing flavor to them it's almost whimsical following up on the carefree style established up on the starship as kirk was finally maneuvered into beaming down after showing definite signs of stress and fatigue the enterprise had it's suggested just completed a harrowing mission then dr mccoy is killed by a knight on horseback yes this is dr mccoy's final episode just kidding but it's no joke to the rest of the landing party at this point in the story mccoy really is dead for all intents and purposes and like the best trek episodes the 2nd half of this adventure escalates to a more frantic more desperate tempo of action and suspense this is all signaled by kirk's resolute response to sulu who voices his lack of understanding about any of these events just after mccoy's death kirk will get to the bottom of all this come what may br br but it doesn't get much easier for kirk what follows is probably the longest staged mano a mano fight for the series as kirk tussles with his nemesis from his academy days a struggle that seems to take place over half the planet yet this is counterbalanced by scenes of extraordinary tenderness with another of kirk's past acquaintances this episode runs the gamut of all human experience rather fitting in light of what we learn about the actual purpose of this weird planet it's gratifying that the script really does explain all of what's happened as opposed to some nonsensical approach which permeates many other fantasy sci fi series with similar plot lines unexplained appearances by persons who could not possibly be there and there actually is a subtext to the story that we humans need to 'work' off our tensions and fatigue in a particular fashion or we just don't function in a 'normal' natural way also note the appearance of the very cute yeoman barrows and the sudden absence of yeoman rand who did not return until the first trek movie in '79 i believe that after this episode even more trek fans couldn't wait for the next appearance of all their favorite characters but i leave this episode with a final perhaps tantalizing thought if mccoy was killed verified by spock how do we know it was our real mccoy who beamed back up to the ship perhaps this explains why this mccoy was still inspecting starships about a century later and getting along very well with data
<START> this wrestlemania just didn't do it for me while some things such as the battle royal and involvement of celebrities were a throwback to the good old days so to speak it seemed to be more of a highbrow in your house than anything else above average worth it for several matches such as the tag team title match although worthy of note is that the title change meant nothing as it was reversed the next night
<START> i had fun watching red eye it's not a masterpiece but it's well directed and structured cillian murphy and rachel mcadams are perfect in the role yes it's the same old story with a different setting but wes craven gave it a good pace at least not another scream with the usual college killer it's nice when you can see a clean coherent thriller even when originality doesn't stand out as its main character particularly from a film maker like craven that has brought so many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genre in the past and that now just lends himself to bringing home what could have been a good tv movie had it not been released theatrically good job
<START> interesting how much more realistic brosnan's performance is to that of the original james bond novels when compared to the bond films he's neurotic paranoid an alcoholic and a womanizer to boot this is perfect break for him even so much as to make fun of the bond icon i'm a mess a parody of myself he says it doesn't get any better than that i just finished reading dr no and this is very much how ian fleming had portrayed james bond personally i never liked brosnan as bond because he fit the icon too closely there was nothing for him to personalize the character with as compared to roger moore or sean connery its great to see brosnan play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall a shallow character trying to come to an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has no background dealing with it's an impressive portrayal and having greg kinear to ground him is just poetic this movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in my blue heaven but more genuine in their coping mechanisms
