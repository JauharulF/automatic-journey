<START> titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill fated voyage on the unsinkable ship writer director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april 15 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet they make for a good on screen couple dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane kathy bates frances fisher jonathan hyde and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film the love story the action suspense and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch
<START> this is a very funny movie easy to watch that entertains you almost all the time the work of the director is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark the movie is a typical police partners history like lethal weapon but the jokes and comedy are of argentinian sort the twist is that one of them is a psychologist played by peretti and has to go with detective diaz played by luque on his assignments while he also assist him diaz is troubled because his wife cheated on him some of the dialogs are hilarious worldwide understandable and laughable anywhere is very good overall it would deserved an 8 but i rated 7 because it gets a little down at the end on a personal remark i must add that is a bravo for argentinian filmmakers considering the little good is coming lately
<START> this is a great film classic from the 40's and well produced there are very dramatic scenes in this film with john garfield al schmid force of evil '48 and dane clark lee diamond last rites '88 fighting the japs during wwii being completely surrounded and with only one machine gun when al schmid was able to go home after being wounded with a horrible injury his problems just started to begin with his family and engaged girl friend dane clark gave an outstanding supporting role as lee diamond who did everything to help his buddy al get his life together again there is never a complete victory to war and lets not forget all the brave wounded military personnel in veterans hospitals from all the wars and our present iraq vets
<START> as you may have gathered from the title i wholeheartedly believe this movie to be the worst zombie movie of all time the acting camera work writing special effects and anything else remotely related to this movie sucked people have argued that while this movie is terribly acted and terribly produced but it comes through with a witty intelligent script wow the plot has more holes than i or anyone else could possibly count for starters why would the government tell everyone to go back to work when it's not safe i know the government's supposed to be evil but they don't gain anything by killing the entire population of the country there wouldn't be anyone to govern another thing that i was wondering about even if the government told everyone to go to work why would people go if the streets were swarming with zombies were the zombies going to hide in the bushes and ambush the unsuspecting people in order to aid the government in their plot to kill everyone on the planet and how about the ending that stupid torch guy sacrifices his life in order to get a few close up shots of the zombies he probably forgot that every camera made in the last 35 years has a zoom feature and another thing why does he say hindenburg before he dies the hindenburg was a rare event seen by a very few people the zombie menace will been seen by everyone in the country possibly the world he doesn't think anyone else will get a few snapshots they also managed to ruin the only semi interesting scene in the film when the soldier is watching the exotic dancer why did the zombie hide behind a curtain for five minutes before attacking the girl especially when the zombie could have come through the door it's probably just something an unintelligent zombie movie fan such as myself wouldn't understand every day i pray that god with increase my brain capacity long enough for me to figure out all the subtle nuances in feeding the masses br br anywho i think it's interesting that this is the first movie that gave me the desire to physically hurt the people involved in the production hey trent haaga i'm calling you out
<START> this will be best known for the ferrari that was crashed when eddie griffin was doing promotion br br tale of racing and betting is a poorly made by the numbers that appears to have a director who couldn't see the numbers largely a point and shoot affair with a group of actors in it for a paycheck this is not a good movie but its not bad enough to be watchable and end up as a some what nothing film isn't worth bothering with no matter how you look at it br br misogynistic despite the fact one of the leads is a woman this is a film that was clearly made just to get the producer and director close to pretty girls want evidence there are long lingering shots of women in next to nothing that serve no purpose other than perhaps to get a rise out of people too afraid to rent a porno or the sports illustrated swimsuit dvd br br avoid this movie at all costs
<START> after the success of part 4 another sequel was a natural move however they should have stopped it before it began alice having survived part 4 finds herself pregnant and it seems freddy is using her unborn child to get at his victims which of course are alice's friends strange nightmare movie very heavy on religious imagery and bad acting the special effects are good but the movie itself is not
<START> my daughter her friends and i have watched this movie literally dozens of times i bought it twice and some little girlfriends absconded with it subsequently i rented it so very many times it just never gets old blockbuster doesn't even have it in their listings anymore and i have tried to buy find rent it for over 5 years without a doubt this was and is my most favourite movie of my daughter's childhood it has it all we laughed we cried we discussed real life and how hard some children have it in the world there was nothing pretend about this movie we related to every second and every line bill thanks a million for restoring our faith in human nature sincerely shelleen and kailin vandermey craven saskatchewan canada eh br br august '07 update br br who are we to judge if a rich woman falls in love with a poor man or a man who has love chooses to raise a child who is not his own it may not be my or your life it is not only believable it happens every day thank god keeps my faith in human nature alive celebrate
<START> although i was born in the year that this movie came out and had never heard of it until my junior year of high school 1996 when i saw it i became totally engrossed laughing and crying and feeling along with the characters because me and my friends were them br br their hair clothes and speech were outdated but the emotions and the desperation of each situation were so familiar i remember thinking how real it was and how i wished that they would make movies like that still br br in fact i saw this movie the night after i had been at a crazy party not so unlike the one in jay's house which had been crashed by what we considered the loser derelicts who hung out on the fringes of our crowd a world class bs'er and responsible mother figure type i identified immediately with jeanie i was also the one with a car although i had a little bit of madge's insecurities floating around in there too my best friend was a deidre and her good friend from childhood was our annie br br watching the scene when jeanie is in school or the one where her and her boyfriend break up and then she is telling madge how much she loved him felt like conversations and situations i had personally had br br now at the age of 27 i recently saw the movie again and felt a surge of emotions because it was like watching back a piece of my own youth though none of my friends died i think this is a must see for all girls 13 and up
<START> red eye is not the kind of movie that's going to win the palme d'or but wes craven has never been that kind of director anyway and his branding is a good indication of what a film goer can expect br br the fact that red eye is a tight little undemanding package at 94 minutes is part of its charm and an indication of craven's craft in producing lightweight but generally enjoyable box office fare in fact it's the perfect kind of movie to show as inflight entertainment attention holding without putting any intellectual or emotional challenges on the viewer br br overall there is a cheesy feeling to the plot vague terrorist subplot motivation and the supporting characters and the main section has a tv movie feel however there are definite elements of hitchcockian suspense and echoes of schumacher's phone booth which ultimately is a more sophisticated and pretentious play on the same idea of emotional crisis being played out suppressed in public br br for a film that focuses mainly on two people sitting in airline seats it lives or dies on the characters and script cillian's icy but eloquent jackson rippner and rachel macadams resourceful lisa are the main reasons the film gets carried off not only making the dialogue zing but also giving some sort of adam's rib type dimension to their battle of 'male logic' against feminine 'sensitivity' br br in the final portion of the film craven indulges himself a little scream style as man chases girl with knife the most surprising revelation here is what brian cox looks like after the 'just for men' treatment his ubiqutous appearance in films as diverse as super troopers the ring and this making him the sexegenarian version of jude law br br short haul fun
<START> what can i say an action and allegorical tale which has just about everything basically a coming of age tale about a young boy who is thrust into a position of having to save the world and more he meets a dazzling array of heroes and villains and has quite a time telling them apart a definite must see
<START> i am a christian and i say this movie had terrible acting unreal situations and a completely facade front for christianity you might as well watch remember the titans and at least not mix christ in a football film like a formulaic steroid for losers let me make some really pressing comments of what bothered me in this film br br 1 the school was in georgia and was a white academy school i did not notice a single black student or player in the school i deal with the white christian academies in the south and they were built for no other reason than to reestablish segregation this is troubling when the movie is about christianity and christ changing lives how about changing the hearts of segregation note i loved the token black coach like it made up for the entirely white team and all the black 'giants' players br br 2 the uncritical acclaim by everyone christian about this movie can i get a couple people to say that it was bad acting bad filming bad writing and in short poor compared to other movies if we were to compare this to another football movie would it have the same charisma and energy br br 3 the half baked christianity which was shown made even less sense to me than the unrealistic ending if christianity is about simply reading a little scripture and praying to begin a complete life change then don't wonder when no one will listen to what christians have to say we want to sell christ as a cure all he doesn't need sold and he doesn't need to be attached to such whimsical lifestyles no wonder everyone considers christianity to be anti intellectual with this unreal presentation br br i recognize this film may be inspirational to a few people to most it will not be it will not give a real picture of struggle and heartfelt tension most importantly to me it is not christian by any means or stretch it has values but it falls short as a 'pull yourself up by the bootstraps' message as shallow as positive thinking if you live alongside people who struggle and or those in third world living conditions this movie will be hollow as most churches are today in their religion
<START> nowhere near the original it's quite accurate copy bringing nothing new to the story but the directing is very poor basinger is weak without good directing baldwin is simply just a second league compared to mcqueen i watched it just out of curiosity being a huge fan of peckinpah's masterpiece and i got what i thought almost a b movie with second rate acting and directing i wasn't even disappointed i just don't know what they were trying to do this remake doesn't try to play with the original material it's not a tribute and indeed it lacks some really good actor of its era br br it reminds me of a bad xerox copy of wonderful photograph br br this is a complete waste of your time save yourself 2 hours or watch the original again
<START> i saw this for free thankfully and wish it was better than it was but it's really the same old stuff that movie studios seem to foist on us in the last ten years br br ben stiller and jennifer anniston play a couple who are opposites and yet they are attracted to each other br br if that plot line doesn't take you by surprise and thrill you the movie won't either br br lots of sight gags and fart jokes halfway through the movie i began to realize that ben stiller really isn't that funny but he tries very hard and jennifer anniston really isn't that pretty but her hair looks great and hank azaria and phillip seymore hoffman must have got paid a great deal of money to be in this kind of average ho hum movie i've come to expect more from them br br what was interesting was that i saw this after i saw american splendor which is a truly funny and original movie and i compared the two in my head and found myself wishing that the movie executives would be forced to sit through those two movies back to back perhaps that would knock some sense into them and br br they'd start making better movies with unknowns rather than this formulaic stuff that plays best on airplanes
<START> ten out of ten stars is no exaggeration this documentary provides the viewers with unique footage about the 2003 coup in venezuela this great film is now the minimum knowledge requirement if you want to express a competent opinion about venezuela or hugo chavez br br the dramatic electrified atmosphere the unique footage will allow you to experience a true historic moment you'll feel like you're in the middle of the situation br br the film will help you gain unique insight in the happenings of 2003 and will help you hear a side you will rarely hear on tv it's something you shouldn't miss
<START> i remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie it was my first horror movie maybe that's the reason why i can still remember some parts of it i don't remember much about acting nude scenes or other things but i do remember a male has head blown up with a grenade a male dismembered over a tree and a male run down by truck and shot in head todd schaefer kenny johnson and kevin mcparland i also remember the last scene when jennifer mcallister riped of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck it's a movie that gives you the creep and it's worth a look but where do i find it how can i download it
<START> lifetime did it again can we say stupid i couldn't wait for it to end the plot was senseless the acting was terrible especially by the teenagers the story has been played a thousand times are we just desperate to give actors a job the previews were attractive and i was really looking for a good thriller once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie this isn't one of them unless one has nothing else to do i would avoid this one at all cost this was a waste of two hours of my life can i get them back i would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide that would have been more entertaining
<START> few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later yet remain as engrossing as this one technological advances have not dated this classic love story special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie the acting is superb david niven kim hunter and especially roger livesey do an outstanding job the use of black and white color adds to the creative nature of the movie it hasn't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence it is my favorite movie of all time waiting and hoping for the dvd release of this movie for so many years is in itself a matter of life and death
<START> this movie is so bad it hurts the car doing 30 mph when it's supposed to go 100 the shift lever that's stuck in park the nurse that drives for almost 2 hours with the cell phone on the shoulder can't any of the 2 morons take this damn phone there's nothing credible in this crap i would be ashamed to be seen in a movie like this
<START> it is quite simple friends is a comedy of very basic humour aimed at teenagers and young adults with unsophisticated sense of humour br br it is also painfully obvious that towards the end they were desperately trying to make it last 10 seasons most likely so they could say they beat seinfeld's 9 season run the trouble with this is seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing friends had and i'm being very generous here at most 5 or 6 ok seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons br br it became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that weren't that good so start with then got worse at the 100th time you saw them i find it so hard to understand why people rate this so highly it is truly awful
<START> the show had great episodes this is not one of them it's not a terrible episode it's just hard to follow up the man that was death all through the house and dig that cat he's real gone br br this episode is about a couple that has just been married peggy ammanda plummer and charles stephen shellen in the first five minutes you find out that charles only married peggy for her money the two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandon mansion charles soon finds out a secret of peggy's family br br in my opinion you should watch this episode but just don't expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season
