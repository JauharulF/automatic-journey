<START> ok the movie is good but i give it a 1 because the idea of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale this kind of crap just adds to those uncomputer savvy moron's paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus first of all strings of code and dozens of 1s and 0s add up to computer virus an organic virus is much more complex even though it's way tinier though it's considered one of the simplest forms in the universe organic virus's attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the rna then change your own rna code explain to me how something like that could be processed from a monitor maybe the radiation has some effect on the user's cornea that turns your eyeballs into these viruses i could see that but obviously the writer didn't think of that
<START> i initially gained interest in this film after reading a review saying this movie reminded the reviewer of silent hill br br being a huge silent hill fan and disappointed with it's movie debut i thought i would give this one a chance mind fearnet only lists this movie as dark floors not by it's full name so when i saw the name mr lordi in the credits i immediately thought of the band i had a few friends in college that like them but didn't think it was important and quickly pushed the thought aside br br the film starts out strong despite the fact creepy little girl has been done to death the good use of audio and sense of isolation really started to piece the the story together the tense atmosphere built rapidly and every indication pointed to the film being excellent as monsters are the true stars of horror i couldn't wait to see what was lurking in the halls of the hospital the main characters had found themselves trapped in br br and then the first monster showed up and i found myself greatly underwhelmed by the time the second appeared i boggled at the fact it looked like it had just come from a megadeth concert and the silliness turned me off completely br br over the course of the movie the atmosphere did remain intact and the story left you wondering just what was going on but the scares were pretty much non existent however i held out hope that the end would make it all worthwhile unfortunately that was not to be the case by the time the movie had reached it's climax i was in utter disbelief and i immediately recognized the big bad in his final reveal the lead singer of lordi seriously br br was that what the movie all boiled down to a bunch of poor souls being chased around a hospital by lordi band members the silly monster design suddenly made sense if you're going to be that corny may as well through the members of marilyn manson or even kiss in there too not to mention the fact that i'm pretty sure i saw the ending in one of lordi's music videos a few years ago they had to go and make an entire movie off of it br br worst of all when i found out what really had been going on all i could manage was a yawn i'm not going to ruin it for you but i can safely say it's probably a plot device you've seen before most likely more then once br br so unless you're a huge lordi fan stay away from this it's not scary it doesn't bring anything new to the table although it does a decent job of borrowing from other horror movies mainly silent hill and i can't stress this enough lordi is the antagonist lordi talk about a buzzkill br br really you'd be better off trying to scare yourself watching slipknot music videos in other words it's just not possible
<START> i bought this on dvd for my brother who is a big michelle pfeiffer fan i decided to watch it myself earlier this week br br it is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines the section with michelle pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two she plays a rising hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships she literally bumps into brian kerwin a regular married guy with kids after driving her car into the back of his after being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out what happens at the end i was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine tv direction takes any drama out of the plot br br the other section involves an old studio boss played by darren mcgavin this section actually has the better cast with kenneth mcmillan lois chiles steven bauer stella stevens they all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere br br it passes the time but is not all that interesting and i am glad this was not bought for me i am not a michelle pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress overall though unless you are a fan of hers avoid this as it is very routine
<START> the novel is easily superior and the best parts of the film are direct translations from what greene wrote for instance the quiet but grim humour that breaks into the scenes with boyer and lorre or the murdered child obsession that takes over some of the plot where the film deviates from the novel it tends to the ludicrous br br however i don't want to suggest that the film is bad in any way it always looks the part and the story stays in the mind like a good 'un some of the minor characters were stock actors who could turn their hand to anything br br it's a dreadful shame that the film's not available on dvd
<START> pretty bad movie offers nothing new the usual creaks and moans attempt to make up for a muddled but thin story acting is barely above pathetic why liam neeson signed on for this is anyone's guess owen wilson truly turns in one of the worst performances in recent horror movie history catherine zeta jones is fun to look at and not much else although lili tayor did an above average job the special effects were fairly memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and hauntingly gorgeous however they can't makeup for the poor acting and the storyline which appears to have been thrown together at the last minute don't bother
<START> four teenage girlfriends drive to fort laurdale for spring break unfortunately they get a flat tire in medley georgia and one of the girls witnesses a brutal murder deep in the woods the local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins shallow grave is a pleasant low budget surprise the cast is likable enough the direction is steady and the violence is particularly nasty and misogynistic especially the second murder is pretty grim the murderous sheriff isn't one dimensional character in a couple of scenes it seems that he feels remorse for what he's done the subplot involving the two boys they meet in the diner goes nowhere but the stalking scenes in the woods are tense and exciting 7 out of 10
<START> wonderland is the fascinating film chronicling the x rated film star john c holmes involvement in the brutal wonderland murders br br the movie's promotion misleads one into thinking this a romanticized portrayal of the porn industry in the vein of boogie nights and that is not the case here in fact except for a few references made by newscasters that john holmes is a porn star and a brief montage of real life footage of john holmes this film is strictly drama about a fallen celebrity's involvement with murder and how it happened br br despite being mislead the film is actually engaging the acting from all the cast is excellent and i'd like to say that val kilmer is amazing in his ability to get down all the mannerisms of john holmes i was completely convinced that i was watching what john c holmes probably looked and acted like in real life br br if you are a john c holmes fan or like stories about hollywood then i think you will enjoy watching wonderland
<START> this was stupid funny movie cheech and chong are the dopiest wasted guys ever i rate this film a 7 but if you like this one then go see jay and silentbob there funnier and crazier now cheech is a sellout working on kids movies wheres chong
<START> from the critical acclaim i expected more from this movie and from tamara jenkins the story just meandered along and didn't seem to have a point or a plot and i find it hard to believe that a 14 year old girl mature for her age or no would be so blase about getting the loss of her virginity over with maybe i am too young to relate i was four years old in 1976 but i didn't have any problems connecting with the stories of shakespeare in love or life is beautiful and i wasn't alive for either of those settings the cast is very good but unfortunately for them the script did not alow them to engage the audience overall slums had its moments but unless you are yearning to reminisce over halter tops and tube socks i would say skip this one
<START> flat ordinary thriller about a conniving woman who deceives all those she supposedly loves in order to boost her bank account nicole kidman plays the deceptive tracey married to the doting andy bill pullman when an old school friend of andy's named jed hill alec baldwin turns up as the resident surgeon trouble is not far behind him br br script fails in that it does not carefully develop the promising premise into an effective tantalising thriller and the severe lack of character motivation background and development leaves the whole show reaching none of the cast are able to generate interest in their shallow characters especially bill pullman whose own inexplicably curious andy is impossible to believe br br poor director harold becker is left trying to resurrect an impossibly dead project and is unable to make entertainment from any of it by the time the 'secret' of the plot is revealed you just won't care br br at least the cinematography has massachusetts looking good also stars george c scott peter gallagher and josef sommer br br sunday february 25 1996 t v
<START> this movie is awesome for three main reasons it is esthetically beautiful i absolutely loved that there is a bold color theme throughout the movie with extraordinary costumes and picturesque sets a photography which looks very costly and probably was not completes the look i always enjoy those stories about groups of misfits loners coming together and becoming a family sometimes they fall into clichÃ©s but this one does not this group of actors really portrays well flawed yet extremely likable characters alan larkin is the best between him the van and the road movie theme i could not help but remember my favorite movie of last year little miss sunshineÂ i discovered fabrizio bentivoglio very interesting actor and just got annoyed a tiny little bit by til schweiger performance at times the opening scene all the scenes where they mess up their tricks are very funny there is a mix of humor and emotion throughout the film i like the end a lot and of course it is all about the magician theme a good magician is making the audience look where he wants them to to create an illusion which happens to be exactly what a movie director does and that's why they call it movie magic
<START> the fact that i watched this entire movie says something about it or me it is not a good movie terrible in fact but terrible in the way that kept my attention in that perverse manner that is akin to watching a tragedy and not being able to look away it would have made a great mst3k subject br br most of the things that make a terrible movie enjoyable are here bad dialogue inappropriate music contrived plot sequences ridiculous pseudoscience you'll thrill to slo mo death sequences the poor victims with mouths agape and waaaaaaaay too much time to contemplate their impending doom facing the outrageously contrived deliverer of their deaths your heart will be warmed by old action scene cliches like when two women struggle for a gun and it goes off but who's shot both look at themselves then the other then themselves then seemingly 15 minutes later one finally goes down you'll sing along in latin of course with the street carolers that turn into a ghastly death's choir that for a moment threatened to turn the movie into a twisted musical br br so if you believe like i do that as movies get worse they get better then this might be a decent choice for you it's not as funny as my current sci fi schlock favorite they live featuring rowdy roddy piper but it's more fun to watch than luke warm movies like omen ii or iii br br i give it 4 out of 10
<START> written by the excellent mcgovern and directed by frears this film was a slight disappointment it seemed too short it spent far too long creating the hovis atmosphere and laughing at the catholic demands then very quickly you have the fascist and socialists vying for the family's attention and the terrible conclusion br br still my wife thought liam was cute
<START> hitler the rise of evil is clearly produced by people emotionally unburdened by the horrors of world war 2 which makes watching a refreshing experience br br i think its greatest value lies in its crystal clear revealing of the nazi mechanism of the utterly corrupt ways hitler used to make it to the top having arrived there this film ends br br when on top the 'fuhrer' german for 'leader' led his germany to the biggest most devastating war in history of mankind ending six years later in germany's utter defeat as a result germany lost its eastern provinces about 35 of its prewar soil and was forced to accept a 44 year split of its remaining territory both west and east germany had to be rebuilt from scrap their reputations severely damaged by the many nazi atrocities inspired by racism br br as i said hitler the rise of evil makes an good watch set in an acceptable thirties environment with more than competent acting in particular peter o'toole's role as the aged president von hindenburg stands out even adds an extra dimension br br my copy of hitler the rise of evil also provides a second dvd with two good documentary films one is about hitler's personality the second deals with the forgery of the hitler diaries in 1983 this forgery caused a hilarious scandal in england and germany damaging the reputations of several historians and journalists
<START> the fiendish plot of dr fu manchu 1980 this is hands down the worst film i've ever seen what a sad way for a great comedian to go out
<START> the significance of french title of this film la naissance des pieuvres which literally means the birth of the octopuses is rather obscure so it is perhaps not surprising that it has been marketed in english speaking countries as water lilies the lilies of the english title are three teenage girls marie anne and floriane who are members of a synchronised swimming team based in the paris suburbs and the film is a coming of age drama about the development of their first sexual feelings br br one feature of the film perhaps unusual for a film of this type is that it concentrates exclusively on relationships between the young people themselves we see nothing of their parents or their teachers and very little of the adult world at all the three girls are very different in appearance and are portrayed as being very different in character the shy retiring marie is slim and petite and appears to be the youngest of the three anne is something of a plain jane floriane a glamorous blonde who is very popular with the boys the three together with a handsome male swimmer named francois are involved in what might be described as a love quadrilateral br br anne has fallen in love with francois but he is smitten with floriane who seems to return his affections although he is by no means her only male admirer indeed not all of floriane's admirers are male because marie has a crush on her attractive friend the film charts the way in which their friendship develops at first it seems that floriane is simply using marie as a convenient excuse when she is in fact going out to meet boys her parents presumably object to her dating boys but have no objection to her going out with female friends later however we realise that despite floriane's image as the sexy popular girl who is always the centre of male attention she actually reciprocates marie's feelings the film reverses some conventional stereotypes about sexuality anne with her short hair and rather chunky figure looks typically butch yet she is the only one of the three main characters who is unambiguously heterosexual whereas the more conventionally feminine marie and the glamorous floriane are lesbian or at least bisexual br br coming of age films are common enough although most of them tend to avoid the controversial topic of teenage lesbianism water lilies however deals with its subject matter in a sensitive way with three very good performances from its three leading actresses pauline acquart adele haenel and louise blachere the relationships between the characters especially that between marie and floriane are complex and capable of a number of interpretations is floriane for example simply using marie for sex or does she genuinely have romantic feelings for her could floriane's sluttish behaviour with francois and the other boys be just a device to hide her lesbian feelings from the outside world or even to hide them from herself this was the first film made by its young director celine sciamma only 27 at the time on this basis she must be regarded as a highly promising newcomer 7 10
<START> i saw this movie a few months ago in the town which appeared as greendale in the movie which is the only reason i went to see it another local who was there just forwarded to me an email announcement of a repeat showing because the first had sold out and people were turned away his editorial comment in his forward is a good summary br br yuk br br unless you're a neil young fan or live in near greendale if the latter you know the real name skip this movie it's mostly an ego trip for the filmmaker it has no discernible plot the music is merely ok and too much of the lyrics are unintelligible making it impossible to follow what little shreds of plot there may be br br i don't need to put in a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give away br br i'd give this a 1 5 10 but that's just for the amusement value of seeing the locales made into a movie it wasn't worth the 6 i could rent a video camera and drive around greendale and make a better movie myself br br if you want to see a good environmental message movie with no plot go rent koyaanisqatsi
<START> it's very funny it has a great cast who each give great performances especially sally field and kevin kline it's a well written screenplay by andrew bergman honeymoon in vegas i don't like soap operas even though i never watch them but i do love this film because it's so crazy and off the wall that it beats the hell out of any stupid soap that they have on daytime television in my opinion it's the best film of 1991
<START> such a pretentious and lame attempt to hipness diabolical script and dialogue and truly embarrassing acting really the worse movie i have ever seen at the cinema nothing in my opinion saves this movie from being a total disaster i saw it when it came out in a cinema in brighton people were walking out and there were more people chatting outside the toilets than in the auditorium at the end there were boos and scorn from the meagre crowd left which was quite sad as relatives of one of the main actors were present and looked really sheepish however the movie was that bad that i really could not feel like that sympathetic with them everybody has to start from somewhere and their son started off his acting career with this truly awful attempt at 'tarantinism made in the uk' 5 years have gone bye but sometimes i still cringe at the memory of that sad night at the movies this is a movie with no redeeming features whatsoever i gave it a 1 as 0 was not available they should invent a 'shameometer' for everybody involved in this sorry mess of a movie i know some of them have moved on to better things the positive thing is that none of them could have sank any lower than this
<START> this film wasn't programmed in italian cinemas i have seen it at a manifestation called fantafestival i find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and there's no suspence in the film music is completely out of the story and i don't have words to describe the visual effects if you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting but a few minutes later it becomes busy the story is interesting but the development needs a complete review
