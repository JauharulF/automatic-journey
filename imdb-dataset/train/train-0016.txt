<START> i think that this film is brilliant there are many reasons why but these are some of them 1 the good acting by tom and tyler 2 brilliant machine gun scene that was a piece of brilliance 3 i thought that the ending was a good twist because i never expected that at the end all credit to sam mendes as well as a these 3 points the film form of the film is good as well i am a film student at college and we studied this film in great detail and it was one of the best films i have seen in many years i'd just like to say a big thank you to all of the people involved in making this film lastly i would like to say the best scene in the film is the machine gun scene where john rooney gets kill it is just pure brilliance in shooting the scene in silence until john rooney says i'm glad it's you it is a lot better like that i think because the viewer creates there own sound and that sound is totally different for every viewer just brilliant br br thank you for reading this comment written by ross kirk aged 16
<START> cry freedom is not just a movie it is a historical account heroic story and insight into the cultural background of a major event in history not only does denzel washington do a terrific job of impersonating a motivating determined hero steve biko but he delivers a message to the public about the horrors of south arfrican apartheid the story of biko an influential leader and his main influencee donald woods is a heartbreaking one but the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in south africa cry freedom manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot it is because of great films like this one that the public can become educated on terrible events in history great leaders who sought to end them and how we can never allow them to happen in the future because of this importance cry freedom is an amazing film that should be seen by all
<START> i find it hard to believe that anyone would put this movie in the same context as the exorcist where the exorcist was subtle and creepy stigmata was blunt clumsy and way too formulaic br br this is one of the most visually beautiful films i've seen in a while but the imagery does not make up for the downward spiral of patronizing exposition that makes it unbearable br br my interest in this movie was peaked when it was compared to the exorcist and my visit to the official web site increased that interest the web site had many tales of actual stigmata throughout history however scene by scene the movie is so obsessed by its quest for genuineness that it becomes comical at first then outright hard to watch toward the end i began getting suspicious when the priest charged with investigating potential miracles walks into the beauty parlor where our would be heroine cuts hair and evidently flirts with priests br br the plot a woman without faith in god begins receiving the wounds of christ the stigmata and is baffled and upset about the ordeal a priest is sent straight from the vatican to investigate the case is frankie possessed by satan or a vessel for jesus christ br br the only miracle in this film is that it finally ends

<START> time for hollywood to sit up and take notice if the actors are acting snooty all you need to do is get the animators who worked on this little marvel renaissance is probably the first animation flick which makes you forget that you are not seeing human beings although the voice overs by the cast craig mccormack pryce etc are some of the best i have ever heard but even then the emotions portrayed by the 'cartoons' are unnerving br br this style of animation is not very new but the use of light and shadows makes the movie a living painting ironically such technical wizardry makes you forget that this is actually a very very nice movie the pacing and plot development are marvelous and the dialogs crisp br br plot disappearance of a mega corporation's top employee unravels a tale of deceit and corruption with a cold hearted hero at the helm can't say much without giving it all away except that while the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat the climax leaves you speechless br br a must watch even for the 'grown ups' who smirk at 'cartoons'
<START> what's in here let me tell you it's the presence of alec baldwin he's not a great actor but maybe a nice star with some good movies which this is not one of them he did nothing here more than anything he did before or after so not to mention literally the matter of steve mcqueen being at the same role in the original because i don't want to make that comparison in the first place i'm not a big fan or even a fan of kim basinger she got a lot of bad movies on her and even at her best she looks average and it gets on my nerve indeed whenever they talk about her seductive rare beauty well if being a blond would make anyone captivating then i'll dye my hair in yellow as soon as possible and what is it with all the craziness over miss basinger's legs it's surely insanity or bad tasting as i don't see them both as not sexy only but ugly too and if you hate that so shoot me down but you know what i've just watched this movie so i'm dead already yet what would make you really suffer in unbearable way is that nothing of the credits goes to the one she deserves the mostÂand of course i mean jennifer tilly now we're talking about a true genuine seductive chick with such unforgettable body and one unique sense of allurement like a nasty brunette marilyn monroe however much more healthier i can't help it she was the only new and watchable thing in here michael madsen as the bad guy was much appealing as well as effective more than the good guys james woods is here to summarize the early events beside the pool so the trailer would be by his voice later and he knew before all that this is a whole hollywood's stuff so do your thing take your cash and good luck as an actor in other movies the editing gave the movie a serious personality along with violent atmosphere done by suitable shining cinematography so the main goods of it the action the thrill are here and fairly well made though any echo for deep meanings about the kinds of betrayal as the main dramatic motif of the whole thing is not that strong so don't wait for it ok it's all in all another remake without anything special except jennifer tilly's spicy moments so i think i tried to be objective as much as i could therefore i shouldn't end my review saying that basinger or anyone here did better than this movie it would be an insult because frankly anything is better than this movie
<START> this movie is a lot better than the asylums version mainly its war of the worlds the tripods look pretty cool but their walking and deaths could have been better the action scenes were really cool walking walking walking walking oh my god stop walking please or i'm going to kill myself the thunder child scene was my favorite sequence mainly because a ship rammed bunch of tripods good movie i recommend it for people ho have read the book the music is awesome and the directors cut looks pretty cool br br pros good soundtrack 99 to the book cool violence tripods and handling machines are cool to look at br br cons some bad acting cheesy looking london
<START> jeez only in the 70's antonio margheriti brings us this quirky hybrid of spaghetti western and kung fu flick evolving around a treasure hunt the spices of this trashy co production between shaw brothers and an italian one off company include humorous storytelling off the wall happenings and some very tame t a extra campy moments are being served by lee van cleef's obnoxious wig leather clad bible thumping psycho gunman yancey hobbitt loveably hammed up by julian ugarte the man who should've done way more obscure european genre productions than he did wanna be witty dialogue hilarious background music and completely laughable sound effects accompanying various little events especially every jump made by lo lieh br br while this little piece of action falls fare and square into the turkey territory it's great to see van cleef and lo lieh on the same screen and you can't deny the charisma of this duo don't expect too much and you'll get plenty out of it br br this is my truth what is yours
<START> i have been using imdb for years and i never wanted to get involved in the commentary of moviesÂuntil now this documentary has so many problems that i hardly know what to say i am not a muslim nor am i an islamic studies expert but i know enough to shed some light on the obvious one sided viewpoint that this documentary espouses br br the problems with this movie begin with the fact that it is a documentary most of the documentaries that i have seen anchor themselves around a few valid points and then surround those points with debatable interpretations and misinformation this is certainly the case with islam what the west needs to know yes there are fundamentalists around the world and some of them are muslim but to build a documentary about all of islam around a small percentage of radicalized people is incredibly misleading this is really a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of islam and nothing more br br for those who would like to more objectively explore some of the issues raised in this documentary here are several points that may help br br there was nothing positive about islam presented in the documentary br br the documentary focuses on the middle east but more muslims live outside of that region more muslims live in china believe it or not than in saudi arabia about 40 of all muslims live in pakistan bangladesh india and indonesia br br the translation of the qur'an used in the documentary is a questionable one i watched the documentary while viewing another translation and the differences were striking i had been warned about the translation that was used in the documentary and now i know why surrah 98 6 is a good example the documentary suggests that the surrah says that disbelievers will go to hell but the translation i have reads instead those who reject truth among the people of the book and among the polytheists will be in hellfire the difference is that those who reject truth are those people who know about god and the truth of god and decide to reject it anyways br br the movie mentioned that there is no morality inherent in islam but this is not true although it is true that much comes from the qur'an and hadith islam also recognizes a concept called 'urf or normative behavior obviously what is normative can be interpreted many ways but 'urf is meant to be good behavior what an average person would consider right or wrong br br the documentary presents shar'ia islamic law as being one unified body of knowledge that all muslims follow this is simply not true there are many islamic schools of law and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way they interpret law br br the hadith tradition is similar there are thousands of hadith and each school of law accepts some and rejects others using the hadith without serious scholarship to determine which ones are accurate real and applicable is indiscriminately picking and choosing quotations from history that fit what you want to sayÂ which is what the documentary did br br what i hope people realize is that fundamentalism is the problem not islam or any other religion christianity has fundamentalists that shoot abortion clinic doctors and so on i know this is not the same as suicide bombing just understand that the righteousness of fundamentalism is arguably the problem if you feel you have the answer then everyone else must be wrong but if you feel you have an answer you can work together with other people's views about politics religion god or whatever
<START> the reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point it's obvious he hasn't been young or innocent in a very long time or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the well meaning young characters actually thought they could make a difference by putting up posters and holding a rave for peace if only it was that easy but the cynics sit and sneer at people who earnestly try their best to make things better as the situation gets worse and worse every single day well if you're not part of the solution you're part of the problem br br the central theme is that revenge begets more revenge which begets even more in an ever expanding bloodbath both sides will tell you tales of atrocities committed by the other side which they think justify their committing even more in retaliation where does it end and apparently he missed the significance of the bubble referred to in the name which was that people living in tel aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on all around them which is partly why they seemed so naive he also seemed to think that ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without a problem which tells me he wasn't paying attention when ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered br br i found it very brave of the director the screenplay writer and both star crossed lovers to update the romeo juliet story to a modern troubled land and to make both lovers male let's be honest here very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female young love wins all hearts but when people's uneasiness with their sexuality is added to the fact that incredibly these same people would rather have them hate each other then the conclusion is inevitable
<START> ah ritchie's made another gangster film with statham thought the average fan expecting another snatch lock stock expecting perhaps a couple of temporal shifts but none too hard for me and the lads to swallow after a few beers br br ah pay attention you do need to watch this film no cups of tea no extra diet cokes from the counter no keep it running shouts as you nip to the fridge watch the film no laughs other than those you may make yourself from the considerable violence and if that floats your boat so be it but sharp solid direction excellent dialogue and great performances br br my favourite big pussy from the sopranos always a reliable hood
<START> i anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly clichÃ© but i was completely wrong charlie cox i had never heard of him until now played an incredibly good leading man he was so earnest and romantic me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with him br br claire danes who i did like before loved her in romeo and juliet made me enjoy her even more her acting was fantastic i couldn't even tell that she was american the chemistry between her and charlie cox was extremely good the casting was quite perfect br br robert deniro and michelle pfeiffer were equally well casted deniro as that gay pirate priceless priceless i laughed so hard at that one scene where septimus comes on the ship oh my god wow pfeiffer played a decent villain i liked her as the snippy mother in hairspray but she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie br br overall it was funny but not slap stick at all romantic the special effects weren't totally frequent but when they were they were great the cameos from ricky gervais and peter o'toole were also well placed br br i totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the princess bride or even lord of the rings it kept my interest the entire time and i will be buying the dvd when it comes out
<START> nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video sci fi movie that's been vilified at the us box office and roundly criticized as the poorest movie of kurt russell's career br br i have my reasons br br firstly when you read negative reviews of this film they usually start with the wooden nature of russell's interpretation of todd the eponymous soldier i'm going to start here too with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting i've seen russell pull off todd is an emotional cripple and suffering from intense ptsd this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now br br the portrayal is spot on todd is withdrawn uncommunicative and a loner he suffers from irrational anxiety keyed to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger his hyper focus brings with it an inability to comprehend the bigger continuum that the tasks he is given to do sit within there is a scene where he cuts himself slicing carrots and continues to work unfazed not cleaning up the cut or the blood many interpret this as a sign of his physical toughness and focus on the job at hand but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the requested task by rote not comprehending the relationship between the vegetables he's preparing and the food that will be eaten later br br todd's dialog is spartan to say the least the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the bleak nature of his existence fear and discipline we are told always fear to keep him pumped up to a hyper alert state where the smallest detail will not pass him by keeping him ready to react on a knife edge discipline to hold him in check through his fear to overcome it and perform tactically the inference is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from nielsen's sandra but i believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who's only experience of an embrace is in combat the trembling represents him suppressing his fight flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled his movement and vision restricted fear and discipline indeed br br then there is the subtext of his abandonment twice in fact so representative of the way our society tends to toss infantrymen onto the rubbish heap of society when they've served their terms 40 of the unemployed are ex military in our world in his it can only be worse russell quickly picks up the mantle of mace's responsibility to his wife and child desperately in need of a mission even one with such a high likelihood of his death br br then there is the military subtext too the conflict between busey's church and the hotshot from hq mekum mekum's new men are faster stronger more accurate and aggressive any one of them could pound todd into the ground but it's not about the tools you have it's how you use them an incentivized todd given the freedom to exercise his initiative and acting without the numbing effect of perceived superiority utilizes ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a swathe through the newer unit sent in without support cover or reconnaissance it is a reminder that military power cannot make up for a failure in leadership br br there are many other subtle themes when a film is shot and scripted so minimally it leaves plenty of white space for your own interpretations to take root watch soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches you
<START> with title like this you know you get pretty much lot of junk acting bad script bad director bad grammar bad br br movie make lot of noise that really not music and lot of people yell movie make bad racial stereotype why come every movie with black hero have drug addict why come hero always have to dance to be success why come famous rapper always have to be in dance movie why come letter s can't be in title br br hollywood need to stop dumb down audience and make movie that have people with brain who know how speak proper english br br do self favor and not go see
<START> like talk radio the booth is actually kinda predictable talk radio because we know the truth of what happened going in the booth because of let's face it the genre and the basic set up that's not necessarily a bad thing in this case it means in essence that the filmmakers don't punk out in the end the way they might've in say an american version of this story the booth moves inexorably toward its foregone conclusion but is so beautifully crafted on every level that one can enjoy the ride the way one might a familiar cruise along a well travelled stretch of very scenic road it reminds me of harlan ellison's spooky short story flop sweat the claustrophobia is at times almost palpable worth a nice long look
<START> an insomniac's nightmare was an incredibly interesting well made film i loved the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without coddling the viewer the acting was top notch honestly i would watch dominic monaghan read the phone book but everyone else especially the young girl was great as well i was very impressed by the look of the film too usually independent films have a grainy i shot this on my camcorder look to them but this director knows what she's doing the lighting the cinematography quality work i'm looking forward to a feature length work from tess nanavati
<START> this work is striking in its accurate depiction of teenage life at the time of its execution though this is a broad generalization parents of that time were too self absorbed to be real parents and those who were home tended to be far too distracted from the real issues where their children were concerned br br this film teaches us how to let go even when it is painful and does so with a sweet melancholy but informed style whereby foster talks philosophically about feeling the pain of life i loved that scene it was my favorite scene in the movie actually br br the transition from funeral to wedding was meant to show that life does go on and so must we baio's skateboarding through a pack of goons and outrunning them was meant to show us that the troubled times will pass and we are meant to get through them to better times br br the whole metaphor of moving on and the procession of life is present throughout the film and serves to give us hope in the end br br i like this movie though i do not watch it often as it tends to make me melancholy br br it shouldn't be viewed by young children and probably only those raised in the 1970's 80's would want to br br it rates a 7 4 10 from br br the fiend
<START> i can't believe i wasted my time with this movie i couldn't even call it a movie it was so bad with nothing to recommend it br br i like low budget movies and weird flicks but this one had me bored to death badly made and bad acting ruined it from being curious you have to wonder what these people were thinking when they spent money to produce this movie i wonder what i was thinking watching it to the end i recommend this movie to no one how did they release this was there an audience who likes this kind of movie there must be because you can find this at almost any video store but why br br deserves to be forgotten br br if you like bad movies then this is for you
<START> i keep watching this movie over and over and over i have to watch it at least once a week i am from africa and looking at that movie taught me some things that i didn't even know about africa denzel's movies are all full of lessons for people of walks of life i wish he was my own brother i have also seen and love your masala mississipi what a thrilling situation when denzel was trying to hook his brother up on the job reminds me of my teen ages when my brother was always mad with me about getting myself busy all the time my brother was always caring for my old father and he wants to see me the same way too by the way where did denzel get that african accent from in the cry freedom movie i have first seen that movie in africa and i didn't know then that denzel was american till i moved down here
<START> ernest borgnine was so wasted in this movie there was no point in putting this great actor in this movie one of the greatest actors in the world wasted and for what reason none what so ever so america if you want to put classic actors in movies don't waste them
