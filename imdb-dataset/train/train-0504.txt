<START> saw this film ran in the wee hours on tcm several problems with the film were apparent from what i saw first the adults did not age when the children did for 10 years several parts of the film had continuity problems for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the 10 years passed br br the copy i saw was missing about 20 minutes or so at least a huge gap with black screen appeared it is too bad because even though the script left something to be desired bergman russell both did fine in the film in their roles it is a shame the large chunk is missing but what is here is watchable br br i just wish it was all intact the script makes little sense in that bergman's character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults some of the time lines don't make sense either there is a stock market crash that resembles 1929 but the kids grow up to fight in world war 1 all the acting by the support folks in this film is fine just wonder what was in the 20 gap of film i could not see as it was missing
<START> i loved this masterpiece and quite frankly i too found mary poppins although i love julie andrews and dick vandyke to be silly and sacrine sweet angela lansbury plays her character to perfection and i don't know why people think of this film as distorted it was magical and it was lots of fun to watch every scene held a certain charm as you got to know the characters better you truly see how this little thrown together family learn to bond with each other despite their age and differences i thought the characters were well developed especially charles who was at the age of not believing mary poppins may be more popular and cherished by others but this little gem will be the one that i will always love and cherish
<START> uta hagen's respect for acting is the standard textbook in many college theater courses in the book hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor the presentational approach and the representational approach in the presentational approach the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible by introducing emotional elements from the actor's own life in the representational approach the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion through a high degree of control of movement and sound br br the representational approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this hamlet was made british theater has a long history of this style of acting and olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the representational school br br time has not been kind to this school of acting or to this movie nearly every working actor today uses a presentational approach to the modern eye olivier's highly enunciated stylized delivery is stodgy stiff and stilted instead of creating an internally conflicted hamlet olivier made a declaiming self important bullhorn out of the melancholy dane an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger london theaters but is far too starchy to carry off a modern hamlet br br and so the movie creaks along ungainfully today olivier's tendency to e nun ci ate makes some of hamlet's lines unintentionally funny in stead you must ac quire and be get a tem purr ance that may give it smooth ness instead of crying at meeting his father's ghost as any proper actor could bright fill lights in olivier's pupils give us that impression br br eileen herlie is the only other actor of note in this hamlet putting in a good essay at the queen despite the painfully obvious age differences he was 41 she was 26 the other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done given olivier's tendency to want to keep the camera on him at all times br br sixty years later you feel the insecurity of the shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a breakable flawed hamlet and instead elected to portray a sort of elizabethan bullhorn final analysis i would have such a fellow whipped for o'er doing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it
<START> i simply cannot believe the number of people comparing this favourably with the first film it moved me to leave this comment this is just an obvious attempt to cash in on the success of the first film the dialogue is appalling and nothing like as authentic or compelling as the original film br br the storyline is ridiculous the portrayal of the french police laughable and the characterisation of doyle a mile away from the first film br br how many drug bosses do you think go down to the docks in person to see a shipment come in the ease at which doyle finds his guy is just pathetic like all the french police were just drinking coffee until doyle turns up from america and does some real police work what a joke try going to a foreign city and unearthing the biggest crims in the place with a travel map and some tourist pamphlets pathetic br br a truly awful sequel anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy
<START> this is a very cheaply made werewolf flick the video is dark and poorly lit the audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed the script is cliche ridden junk with the usual characters like the tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver handgun filled of course with silver bullets the acting is as wooden as the characters the fx are non existent lots of extreme close ups of werewolf jaws and biting the only thing that is shown is lots of soft core t a instead of dropping 30 for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf pic dog soldiers with sean pertwee
<START> i'm all for a bad horror movie but this was just a pile of dog sh t how anyone can call this movie cool or decent is beyond me if you like rushed editing to cover the special effects bad acting and a bad script then go for it there was no suspense whatsoever and the gore factor was laughable because it was so fake i'll take hostel or wolf creek over this pile any day my partner gave up after about 20 minutes she knows a stinker when she sees one i on the other hand stupidly sat through the whole movie just to wait and see if it got any better no such luck i haven't sen his other movie torched and i doubt if i'll bother now
<START> i have to say that there is nothing wrong with low budget films so that was not my problem with it my problem with it is that i felt like i was watching my next door neighbor's home movie imo everything about it just seemed like a guy wrote out a quick story grabbed a camera and started shooting i understand how hard this must be to do effectively but when i pay to rent a film i expect to feel like i am watching some type of professionally made movie br br john schneider has a huge resume is a great actor and was fine in this film the other people in it were not i understand how it must be fun and cheaper to use friends and relatives as the cast but it doesn't make for convincing acting it seemed like the way it was shot he was trying to give many of the scenes a more interesting look but when the writing plot and acting are there to begin with that type of style isn't necessary and it is a distraction br br also on a technical level it had digital artifacts all over the place in the first scene of all of those fine cars when they did a slow scan of them they appeared to jerk back and forth just a little bit the problem isn't in my viewing equipment benq pe 8700 84 diagonal but somewhere in the production i've never seen that kind of artifact in a professionally made film before then there was the sound it sounded like they didn't do any voice overs which may be o k unless it sounded like the track in this film it sounded like the built in microphone on the camera
<START> siskel ebert were terrific on this show whether you agreed with them or not because of the genuine conflict their separate professional opinions generated roeper took this show down a notch or two because he wasn't really a film critic and because he substituted snide for opinionated now when ben lyons comes on i feel like i'm watching teen news you know that kids' news show hosted by kids for kids manckiewitz is not much better it's obvious they've encountered only a steady diet of mainstream films their entire lives the idea that these two rank amateurs have anything of interest or consequence to say about motion pictures is ludicrous if they are reviewing a non formula film they are completely lost show them something original and intelligent they just find it confusing wait i think i get it abc is owned by disney disney makes movies for kids while siskel ebert and roper promoted independent films and were only hit or miss with the big budget studio productions what a surprise these two guys love the big studio schlock and only manage to tolerate a few indies plus everyone knows the age group tv advertisers are aiming for the blatant nepotism is the icing on the cake in what alternate universe do these guys qualify as film critics
<START> there is something kind of sad about seeing someone who is so good at doing something try to do something very different and end up being mediocre i was thinking about jordan playing baseball but the same applies to steve martin br br this movie is reasonably well acted and directed but the script is a stinker martin did a great job adapting a classic story into a comedy in roxanne but this effort to bring a victorian drama to the contemporary scene smacks straight into a wall of implausibility if you want to see an old story updated with some style best to rent great expectations
<START> the plot doesn't begin to describe the film a man is writing a film or rather this film it's totally self referential to the point that you think it's going to fold in on itself like a black hole the writer writes something and it happens or something happens and he writes about it br br it's very philosophical like waking life but more zen oriented and for that matter much better in my opinion at one point there are person on the street interviews and then you see shots of these people being filmed and then you discover that their responses are scripted when one keeps flubbing her lines there is beautiful scenery and optical illusions br br i hope it comes out on dvd so i can watch it again more carefully seen at cinequest the san jose ca film festival on 2 25 2002
<START> i am completely baffled as to why this film is even liked let alone held in such high regard especially by so many critics who are otherwise quite sensible br br there is one key word which describes this film to its core irritating br br the most easily explained example of this is the director's use or more accurately abuse of music in the first half a really dull reggae tune is played about three times when once is too often but in the second half the mommas and the papas california dreamin' is played at least seven times usually at top volume godsakes whether you liked the song or not beforehand you'd be thoroughly sick of it by the end just think some people claim to have seen this film four or five times this means they've listened to california dreamin either 28 or 35 times br br all of this needless hyper repetition it contributes nothing to the story could possibly be excused if the remainder of the film had any lingering merit or if the story was in any way involving br br but it ain't br br the only aspect i found likeable was bridgette lin's charging around and still playing asia the invincible in a raincoat and sunnies even this wore off fairly quickly br br i'm sure this film's undeserved high reputation will convince many poor suckers to go and see it br br i can only warn you if you've never seen a hk movie before don't start with this one br br if you feel compelled to watch it avoid at all costs seeing it in a cinema the fast forward and mute buttons are essential tools for survival here br br you have been warned
<START> alain delon visits swift sure vengeance on the ruthless crime family that employed him as a hit man in the duccio tessari thriller big guns after they accidentally murder his wife and child tessari and scenarists roberto gandus ugo liberatore of a minute to pray a second to die and franco verucci of ring of death take this actioneer about a career gunman for the mob right down to the wire indeed big guns is rather predictable but it still qualifies as solid entertainment with lots of savage and often sudden killings alain delon of the godson is appropriately laconic as he methodically deals out death to the heads of the mob families who refused to let him retire so that he could enjoy life with his young son and daughter richard conte of the godfather plays a sicilian crime boss who wants to bury the hatchet with the delon character but the rest of his hard nosed associates want the hit man dead like most crime thrillers in the 1960s and 1970s big guns subscribes to the cinematic morality that crime does not pay interestingly the one man who has nothing to do with the murder of the wife and son of the hero survives while another betrays the hero with extreme prejudice tessari does not waste a second in this 90 minute shoot'em up apart from the mother and son dying in a car bomb meant for the father the worst thing that takes place occurs in an automobile salvage yard when an associate of the hero is crushed in a junked car ostensibly big guns is a rather bloodless outing but it does have a high body count for a 1973 mobster melodrama only at the last minute does our protagonist let his guard down and so the contrived morality of an eye for an eye remains intact tessari stages a couple of decent car chases and the death of a don in a train traveling through a train tunnel is as bloody as this violent yarn gets the photography and the compositions are excellent
<START> soylent green i found to be an excellent movie br br if you like logan's run you'll like this br br yes the movie is old and there are no special effects and some of the acting can somewhat be best described as cheesy but the story is excellent br br the story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very poignant br br at the end the mystery wasn't a mystery but the story unfolded in an easy at the right pace br br it's nearest modern day equivalent would be dark angel in terms of how the us is shown to be third world country
<START> i am a big fan of old horror movies and since i am middle aged old to me is a movie made before 1970 with most being made in the 1920's to 1960's period i am not a big fan of more modern horror movies with one exception being creepshow 1 which i thought was great i could reminisce about the stories there but i really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with hal holbrook and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending all the stories were great though so why did i like them so much the characters had some decent development the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear and the funny bits were really funny this sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent i am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and i turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on imdb com lol when george kennedy and an old dorothy lamoure get top billing it's telling you something 4 of 10 also romero's expertise is hard to find here they must had told him to tone it down to a pg standard i don't know what this was rated at but it looks pg to me and that's not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on it's shown on the encore cable channel if your dieing yuck yuck to see it
<START> let me start out by saying i will try not to put too many spoilers in this normally i enjoy robin williams movies however this gem was not one of them it was billed as a suspenseful thriller the night listener was anything but to be blunt there were 6 people in the theater opening day 2 walked out for good reason the movie was in my opinion poorly written and directed the acting was alright but again there wasn't anything to work with the movie is about a storyteller who reads a good book by a dying kid however insert spooky here no one can verify the kids existence so williams goes to wisconsin to try and find the author however all he gets is a headache and excuses from the boys caretaker there thats it thats all you wait for about an hour and a half and movie ends it had as many thrills and chills as a dentist office visit the homosexual undertones or overtones had really nothing to do with the story and the movie had a little profanity but it seemed to be thrown in there for absolutely no reason and made little sense in conclusion i really can't write a decent review on this film because there was nothing to it it was as captivating as watching paint dry i gave it a 2 because the acting for what it was worth was alright and it wasn't directed by uwe boll
<START> absolutely stunning warmth for the head and the heart the kind of movie western movie makers are too rushed too frenetic to even attempt my kids watched it and they loved it too what real people goes to show you how cultural differences the japanese setting is less important than the human similarities go see it whether you like dancing or not
<START> the sitcom the league of gentlemen follows the lives of several bizarre inhabitants of the fictional village royston vasey the different scenes are linked together by their common setting br br in the first series a sketch show the main plot deals with a new road which is going to be built through royston vasey consequently more foreigners visit the small town but edward and tubbs the owners of a local shop which is actually far away from the town do not like foreigners whenever a visitor enters their shop they kill him in my opinion some scenes are kind of tasteless and not funny at all for example when the couple absorb two engineers who want to build the new road edward drums while tubbs is dancing half naked around the victims br br moreover pauline lives in royston vasey she works at the local job centre although pauline hates the people she has to work with the woman does not want to loose her job so when an unemployed man gets an interview as fireman she does not allow him to go because he is not ready for the job yet br br then there is barbara dixton a transsexual taxi driver who goes into great detail about her sexual conversion br br furthermore the vet mr chinnery always kills animals instead of curing them in one case he comes to a farm and is leaded into the sitting room where a dog lays in his basket the farmer goes outside on the assumption that the dog is the sick animal mr chinnery euthanizes him a second later the farmer opens the door holding the real sick animal a sheep in his hand br br some more inhabitants are a husband and his wife who are visited by their nephew his friend is killed by the shop owners by the way the couple is very tidy they have for example towels in different colours each colour stands for one part of the body besides they have thousands of keys marked with different colours and precisely classified br br in my opinion the actors play very well by playing women the scenes become comical the costumes are suited to the actors too tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy characters for example edward have unappetizing black teeth the show has a great deal of dark humour typical british the set design reflects the mood of the series the village and all the houses look grey and are decayed around the local shop there is often fog which strengthens the threatening effect even the village sign is ominous welcome to royston vasey you will never leave br br although i think that the actors do a great job this type of series is not my taste
<START> i don't see how anyone who even likes van damne could like this movie br br the movie actually starts out with some promise i would say the action scenes at the beginning of the movie is excellent the actions scenes with the family ward trying to save the twins is a great start and is good lead in to the main story however the film is all down hill from there br br it would have been nice if the director could have stayed with the original premise that is the brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills one brother is supposed to be skilled in martial arts but the other brother is supposed to be skilled in firearms how convenient when the time arises that the brother who has never picked up a gun before all of the sudden is a great marksman and the brother who has not been taught any martial arts is all of the sudden doing the splits and high kicks br br the plot action etc are just plain ridiculous my favorite scenes how about when van damne is confronting an armed soldier with an ak 47 the soldier is about 100 yards away instead of aiming and shooting at van damne he is doing a war cry like he is wielding a battle axe and running at him van damne proceeds to pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him while he is still about 75 to 80 yards away br br this movie has one of the most disappointing endings bolo yeung is a skilled martial artist however instead of choreographing a decent fight bolo is throwing barrels at van damne like donkey kong absolutely aggravating movie that had so much promise if your a van damne fan save your time and see hard target or one of his earlier films
<START> who were they kidding with this there was just too much in this film that was hard to digest right from when arjun ajay devgan unknowingly wishes death on his father to when he arrives in london with his uncle played by om puri only to abandon him minutes later the only problem with that theory is that anybody who has ever passed through london heathrow knows that such a fÃªte would be impossible to pull off and especially not by an indian but the film problems do not end there there's the issue of the two main leads salman khan and ajay devgan passing as rock stars on the verge of achieving their dreams i mean yeah we saw success come to susan boyle a woman in the uk achieving her dreams after age 50 but that was a rare case it was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief because i felt that the casting of salman and ajay was just ill conceived they would never cast madhuri dixit and sridevi to play the same roles so why should we be forced to watch ajay devgan and salman khan men well into their 40s prance around desperately trying to hang on to their 20s let's not even talk about the most self conscious actress on screen today asin this is her second film that i have seen and she is just hopeless as an actress so conscious of her looks that she only concerns herself with looking good and voguing for the camera rather than giving in a good acting performance it's just hard to believe that she turned down all those other movie roles to star in this fluff and then be so fluffy as an actress nothing to write home about at all and to top all of that the film just boringly dragged on there's nothing special about it at all trust me you will predict every clichÃ©d thing that is going to happen in it
<START> this series got me into deighton's writing and the genre when i was younger and i love this presentation of the story i would however disagree with the above comment from what i have read in the past it is not holm's performance that lead deighton to refuse to have the series released but the butchering that all three books received in the translation to the screen a great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing that ended samson's field career the scene is not in the book the character who dies in the minefield was never in any of the books and the crossing in sinker was from east germany to west germany not the polish frontier this whole storyline is cloth the changes in set similarly damage the integrity of the story my perspective on holm's performance was that he portrayed the disorientation of samson during his wife's defection excellently and i believe comported himself well in portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class divide samson both pays for his father's idealism and suffers due to its influence on his life as clevemore comments had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department i think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything holm is diminutive when compared to the samson of the book a physically impressive man capable of using his size to impose a presence
