<START> the movie that shoots scenes of a scenic caverns tour br br remember no one from this movie except for michael pataki who dished out extreme pain as jc in five the hard way he's the really annoying sheriff who i did applaud when he practices nightstick on our rabid doctor probably the most laughs you will have is with dr beck's epileptic seizures out of nowhere could mrs beck be anymore wooden seriously if you took a 4 foot branch stuck it in a hot tub you wouldn't be able to notice a difference the dread and suspense is looking over at the clock wondering when the credits will roll br br watch it as a late night movie mstified but don't go out of your way
<START> what is the point of creating sequels that have absolutely no relevance to the original film no point this is why the prom night sequels are so embarrassingly bad br br the original film entailed a group of children hiding a dark secret that eventually get them all killed bar one in a brutal act of revenge can someone please explain to me what a dead prom queen to be rising from the grave to steel the crown has to do with the first movie then prom night 2 had continuous plot holes that left the audience constantly wondering how did that happen and why should that happen but in the end i guess you could call it one of those movies that is so bad you end up laughing yourself through it
<START> somebody mastered the difficult task of merging sports with romance in reality sports and romance go together like oil and water so to successfully put the two together on screen well that is about the equivalent of splitting the atom i never thought it could be done i will be the first to say that in general i don't like romantic comedies but i do like sports and most movies about sports this movie was a pretty good mix of the two being a baseball fan i could really appreciate the comedic ordeal with ben wrightman jimmy falon being a rabid boston redsox fan anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the curse of the babe that plagued the redsox for 86 years and they know just how nuts about baseball a lot of redsox fans are the farrely brothers did a great job capturing that and it made for good comedy this was a very good movie that could appeal to many
<START> loaded with fine actors i expected much more from deceiver than was delivered the plot is extremely contrived and manipulative the many flashbacks only add to the confusion believability flies out the window and with the ending becomes unbearable and downright ridiculous i would strongly advise anyone who likes their movie plots to be based on something that is at least possible to avoid deceiver because you will be very frustrated maybe i am just not hip enough to get it but my suspicion is that many others were totally confused by the story line and especially by the ending blurring the line between reality and lies simply does not work because the entire movie made no sense merk
<START> eric stoltz delivers an extraordinary performance as joel garcia a successful young novelist who winds up paralyzed and in a special hospital for the recently disabled after breaking his neck in a hiking accident while learning to cope and adjust with the gravity of his new limited physical condition joel befriends slick fast talking charming womanizer raymond an amazing wesley snipes and boorish surly racist biker bloss a terrific william forsythe who feels threatened by the diverse multi ethnic array of fellow patients he's forced to share a room with joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving but married girlfriend anna radiantly played by helen hunt but he still must come to terms with being disabled on his own br br this remarkable movie's key triumph is its laudably stubborn refusal to neither sanitize nor sentimentalize the severity of what these men are going through directors neil jimenez who also wrote the thoughtful and insightful script and micheal steinberg relate the story with exceptional taste wit and warmth specifically addressing with disarming candor and matter of factness how being handicapped irrevocably alters one's lifestyle including and especially your sex life this point is most powerfully made in a striking sequence when joel and anna try and fail to make love in a motel room besides the expected poignancy the film further provides a surprising surplus of wickedly funny raw earthy humor that's highlighted by the uproarious sequence with joel and bloss making a secret nocturnal expedition to a strip club the uniformly superb acting qualifies as another significant plus stoltz snipes forsythe and hunt are all outstanding with stand out supporting turns by grace zabriskie as bloss' doting amiable mother and elisabeth pena and william allen young as compassionate hospital nurses despite the grim subject matter the film ultimately proves to be a very moving positive and uplifting cinematic testament to the astonishing strength and durability of the human spirit a simply wonderful little gem of a drama
<START> i picked this film up based on the plot summary and critics' quotes on the back of the box i'm not big into foreign films and didn't know what to expect i don't really care for subtitles either but i absolutely loved it it has a simple lovable quality that leaves you feeling good about life i found myself laughing out loud repeatedly i'd recommend this picture to anyone even those who abhor foreign films with subtitles this one makes it worth the effort
<START> prince stars as 'the kid' in this semi autobiographical film of a talented but narcissistic young musician who has a less then stellar home life true the acting leaves a tad to be desired barring morris day and especially clarence williams who are both pitch perfect but the movie is still great and among the best to come out of the 1980s it has the best soundtrack of any movie of the last 50 years at least highly quotable lines and the dumpster scene is hilarious plus apollonia is just simply stunning on an unrelated not when i saw prince in concert in 2004 he blew down the stadium he is an expert showman and it was one of the best concerts that i've experienced br br my grade a br br dvd extras disc 1 commentary with director albert magnoli producer robert cavallo director of photography donald thorin theatrical trailer trailers for under the cherry moon and grafitti bridge disc 2 a 12 minute featurette on the first avenue club purple rain bachstage pass a half hour featurette on the movie which i'll review later on it's page riffs raffs and revolution the impact and influence of purple rain 10 minute featurette 30 minutes of mtv's premiere footage when mtv didn't suck donkey balls 5 prince music videos let's go crazy take me with you when doves cry i would die 4 u baby i'm a star and purple rain 2 videos by the time jungle love and the bird and a music video for sex shooter by apollonia 6 br br eye candy apollonia shows her fine ass titties
<START> not many movies were made about the lighter than air lta aspect of aviation but this is one of them and it's damn good just a fun film to watch br br most of the movie takes place at the navy blimp operations at nas lakehurst with nas tustin playing the role wallace beery plays a likable but munchausen like senior chief ned trumpet an enlisted pilot whose tall tales have gotten so frequent nobody really believes him half the fun is near the end of the movie when events start proving that most of his more outlandish tales are actually true br br set during wwii the main plot centers around bachelor trumpet wooing a local widow only to end up having a father son relationship with the widow's crippled son jess told he would never walk without crutches by doctors chief trumpet pulls some strings and a navy flight surgeon helps in restoring the lad's crippled leg jess goes on to join the navy to become a flight officer flying blimps back at lakehurst and facing a whole new set of challenges br br a very well done movie albeit not without some corny hollywood dialogue slipping past the technical advisers and beery's apparent inability to march in step otherwise this movie gets good grades for technical accuracy and gives a rare look into the navy's lta operations the cash register scene an exchange between trumpet and jess's future love interest cathy is an absolute hoot
<START> lars von triers europa is an extremely good film how's that von trier has a very stylized way to tell a story at least he did have with europa to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen even with all the tricks in my opinion this film is the most complete real and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top 250 list i also think it is perhaps the scariest the most gothic and complete film around all right there are other good ones too but this one is my favorite the final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever
<START> the scene where sally field and whoopi goldberg go to the mall to revive sally's flagging spirits is enough reason alone to enjoy this movie but wait there's more this is a crackling good sendup of daytime tv movie stars on the way down and up and the horrors of love robert downey jr shows the lighter side of his genius and cathy moriarty is splendid the dialogue is witty and the physical humor done with consummate skill this is a movie that will appeal to those who really enjoy the arts of acting directing and writing
<START> a lot of themes or parts of the story is the same as in leon then other parts felt like some other movie i don't know which but there are an familiar feeling over the whole movie it was kind of nice to watch but it would have been fantastic if the story would have been more original the theme little girl bad assassin from leon is just tweaked a little the opening scenes are really good it is strange that people like to fight in the kitchen in the movies my biggest problem was to remember which parts was from leon nikita and if they where from the french or american version if you have not seen leon then this is a good movie if you liked this movie then i can recommend leon br br best regards rick
<START> nothing in this movie is funny i thought the premise giving a human the libido of a randy ram was interesting and should provide for some laughs wrong there is simply nothing funny about the movie for example the main character making a pass at a goat in heat in the middle of a farmer's yard is not funny it borders on obscenity they are toying around with bestiality in this film on one level and it just aint funny br br we all know that dogs will eat anything anywhere anytime the main character doing this with everything everywhere everytime is also not funny it becomes a cliche br br rob schneider is i guess acceptable in the role by this i mean that he's not a bad actor but with rotten material it's difficult to comment on quality however coleen haskell the other half of the human romantic leads does one count the number of animals that the main character has interest in as romantic leads too seems embarrassed by the whole thing as well she should be she seems to be acting in some kind of vacuum detached from all the other actors in the movie br br see this film only if you wish to be bored by tasteless dull repetitive material
<START> the good thing about this that's at least fresh almost no movies about dance music and the club scene if even made hit the cinemas and it radiates lots of energy too from the music to the portrayal of ibiza br br but the main problem is that it can't decide what it wants to be although it definitely likes to be a mockumentary in the line of this is spinal tap the makers also realized they wouldn't want to play copycat however it fails grossly on the jokes because it's not very well written and most characters are underdeveloped and it has no arc in its script and directing to make it to 90 minutes so why not edit it down to 75 the production department and cinematography still try to save the day e g paul's home br br in a strange way and unexpectedly so it's all gone pete tong works much better as a simple drama in the line of almost famous especially the scenes with beatriz batarda offer some acting power br br conclusion it's a mess it somewhat entertains at a basic level but you better spend a night in your favorite club
<START> i like goldie hawn and wanted another one of her films so when i saw protocol for 5 50 at walmart i purchased it although mildly amusing the film never really hits it a stride some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purpose br br then of course there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as i'm concerned i don't think this scene added to the movie at all i don't like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson written by some '60's burn out especially br br in the end although i'm glad to possess another hawn movie i'm not sure it was really worth the money i paid for it
<START> on the surface show me the money should have at least finished a full season you had the always entertaining william shatner as your host surrounded by a baker's dozen of beautiful leggy models collectively called the million dollar dancers you had knowledgeable contestants who had interesting stories to tell of their lives and who presumably knew a lot of pop culture trivia and you had big money so what went wrong br br the format of this game was the failure a good game show needs at least two of three things very simple rules exciting pacing and the ability for the viewer to play along at home the best most enduring ones have all three br br unfortunately smtm had none br br the rules for this game were among the most complex of any prime time game show in history let me try to explain how the game worked as briefly as possible br br a contestant began with a single word or short phrase followed by the choice letters a b c subtle plug for the network each letter was connected to a separate question all starting with that word or phrase once a contestant chose one of the letters they could either answer that question or pass and select a second letter if they passed they got to view the next question and had the same option however if they passed the second question they were required to answer the third option br br after they answered and before they found out if their answer was correct they then had to select one of the 13 dancers on stage each with a different amount of money in a scroll by their side they revealed their dollar amount ranging from 20 000 to 250 000 and depending on if the contestant answered right or answered wrong that amount would be added to or subtracted from their pot br br still with me so far in addition there was one dancer who held something known as the killer card if you selected the dancer with the killer card and you had gotten your question right you were safe and the game continued if however you were incorrect you had one final question to answer if you got that final question wrong you were out of the game if you got it right then the game continued br br there was no quitting no walking away with the money earned until you either answered six questions correctly or got six questions wrong or you were so far in the hole you couldn't earn enough money to get back out got it okay br br the biggest problem as i saw it was a complete lack of tension because of the design of the game a contestant could pass questions they knew they didn't know and answer many questions they did know making the pressure even less then they could still find a low dollar amount even after knowingly missing a question which meant there still wasn't any drama and the fact that they could answer five questions wrong and still have a chance to win was a big mistake and the pacing of the questions was deadly slow often the questions were so obvious it was ridiculous to try to create tension as if there was any doubt about some of the most common answers br br the pacing the lack of any real tension at any point during the show and those very complicated rules prevented this program from working despite shatner's terpsichorean talents
<START> i own this movie i bought it for 3 99 at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some indie type movie research since i had just finished my own feature and was editing it now when i feel down about my skills as a first time director i just sit down with a plate of cookies and severed within minutes i feel great br br i hate to down talk another filmmaker so i'll just use constructive criticism 1 find good actors take the time it really helps 2 when shooting video over light your scenes and darken in the computer later on in post 3 closeups are better for video 4 when an actor enters a scene wait a bit before br br having them speak so that we know what's going on and who's talking 5 never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to come open it damn well worth the 3 99 br br the true horror would be getting the reviews severed has here on imdb and you have to give these guys credit they did get distributed
<START> an adult realistic cruel dark story like a second part of les roseaux savages the wild reeds plenty of beauty and sadness ellipsis and silences shadows and little sparks of hope a man searching for a warm companion a better life a sincere attitude
<START> this is 2009 and this way underrated gem has lost nothing of the power it had 31 years ago it connects a pretty wide variety of different characters and stories without appearing to be cluttered br br clothes and music might have changed over time but in the end this is a story that will never lose its up to dateness and especially this movie does the job pretty well of course it is cheesy at times but very touching as well br br jodie foster's performance is striking and it shows that she is really a natural born actress who showed her true potential especially in her earlier movies br br don't miss this one
<START> this is part one of a short animation clip showing the history of the matrix the war between man and machine that resulted in the eventual creation of the matrix the animation is part japanese anime part contemporary american animation and is very well made considering the excellent directors behind the movie it shows the initial development of ai and the exploitation of the machines by man until the day they rebelled
