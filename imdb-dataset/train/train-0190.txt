<START> i was not expecting much from this movie i was given a ticket for an advanced screening i had just gotten off of work it was hot and i was tired i had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complex br br once seated in the theater tired and frustrated the movie started i did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning but the flow of the movie was perfect right from the beginning i became consumed with the movie getting more and more excited with each minute passing i think this movie is destined to be a fantasy fairytale classic the actors were fabulous the pace was perfect and the ending was magical
<START> i'm stunt i must admit i never saw a movie with such good story and none stop high special effect martial art fighting scene if you like the fantastic genre like me you will certainly be more than satisfied all character have very cool power and the special effect are near perfection in one word flawless i will listen to this movie a lot in the next years
<START> after a big tip of the hat to spinal tap this movie is hilarious anyone who grew up watching mtv will love it and if you didn't rent it anyway the my peanuts and a gangster's life videos are worth the three bucks alone
<START> this film was a major letdown the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean spirited the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with the lead protagonist's character was as slimy as they come the sickroom hothouse atmosphere lent itself to over the top theatrics little or nothing could be learned about the spanish civil war from this film fortunately i've been to spain and realize this is not realistic in addition the use of same sex attraction as a lurid horror was also very offensive and poorly handled while the dvd is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess i guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killed this film might especially appeal to you
<START> this had all the makings of a very good film good actors robert loggia ellen parker a good plot mysterious missile from space threatens to burn up the planet and lots of stock footage if the air force had film of jets firing rockets it was used unfortunately it is ruined by too much melodrama and an impossible time line br br the movie concerns a missile from space that is attacked by the soviets and inadvertently diverted into a low atmospheric orbit at under five miles and at a speed in excess of 4 000 miles it emits an exhaust of a million degrees burning up everything on the ground including glaciers distant early warning dew line bases and eskimos br br every attempt at destroying the missile fails br br the first flaws in this film appear early on while we don't expect much from low budget films some things can't be forgotten like a little research for instance both the soviets and the us fire anti ballistic missiles that home in on the missile with unerring accuracy however the first successful abm tests weren't done until march of 1961 by the russians br br there is too much melodrama dr loring loggia and his assistant joan woods ellen parker play their romance with about as much wood as a log cabin parker's character cries and boo hoos at loggia's sacrifice like she was at a screen test loggia is about as heroic as a bored businessman a scientist phillip pine hams it up so much he makes william shatner look like a thespian a bus driver continually spits out end of the world crap in scene after scene the only good actor is the film narrator played by veteran character actor lawrence dobkins naked city br br all of this could be overlooked if it wasn't for the time line after the missile's info is sent to dc the pentagon brings in a group of scientists a general larry kerr announces that the missile will hit new york city in 63 minutes after this there are discussions by scientists and there is a deadly lull as word is sought from ambassadors to see if the missile is an attack from the russians and if a response is necessary br br the film shows the military being fully scrambled civil defense people leave work and go to their stations eight million people scramble to fallout shelters while school buses pick up millions of kids and we get to see the whitest new york city i've ever seen though watching 50's sci fi films made it seems like this was the standard the press is kept in the dark for tens of minutes then incredibly a man at the pentagon announces that the missile will hit ottawa canada in 51 minutes all of the aforementioned action happened in 12 minutes then to add fuel to the fire loggia somehow thinks of a way to stop the alien missile he slowly produces a caseload of plutonium loads it in a jeep and takes it from dc to a distant missile base to put it atop a missile along the way he is knocked off the road by a wild driver breaks down and then is carjacked he finally gets the plutonium back and drives to the base to arm the missile again all this in the same 63 minute time frame br br the movie also irks the viewer by making it seem as if ottawa might be saved only to show men women and children get roasted the missile is then said to have five minutes to reach new york loggia is still driving to the base 4 more miles to go he gets to the base and arms the missile a two minute countdown is then announced all within five minutes the boroughs of new york should have been at least scorched br br by the way the missile is destroyed if you haven't guessed the abm warhead destroys it with a massive plutonium based nuclear blast five seconds later the blast dissipates and all is clear yeah they caused a nuclear blast equivalent to 100 hiroshimas on the outskirts of new york city and nothing happens br br the film had all the elements necessary to be a good b film but wasted them loggia played his character so lamely you didn't care that he sacrificed himself in the end you didn't care about the other characters not even the smarmy scientist played by pine the tension that should have moved the film along just wasn't physically possible in the time line allowed it still wouldn't be today not even with jack bauer br br this film is very difficult to find as far as i know it hasn't been re issued on any medium and for good reason i don't know if the film meant to be or if it was standard practice but there's a scene where the government sends all of the best scientists military men and businessmen into deep shelters saying they're too valuable to lose there isn't a single woman or minority in the bunch hari rhodes is the only black man in the film and he gets a brief bit playing a piano it was worse than 27 days where an alien gives five earthlings the chance to either save or destroy the planet and he doesn't include any blacks or hispanics br br i saw this on a special sci fi night on turner classic movies and i don't expect it to show up again if you do find a copy of this somewhere you might want to put it up on amazon com
<START> lucy alexis liu and cillian murphy are both excellent actors who can certainly rise to any acting challenge put to them br br unfortunately 'watching the detectives 2007 ' offers only one to both actors and audience alike not to fall asleep during a mind numbingly boring very predictable and unimaginative story br br 'watching the detectives 2007 ' tries very hard to be funny but the comedy is forced extremely poorly directed and embarrassing to the verge of complete ridicule br br after a third of the film still nothing that may capture even the most willing audience like the director's friends and relatives is even hinted at not to mention actually happening br br i'm pretty sure everybody who liked it faked it or had to fake it like neil's ex girlfriend did when he showed her an old b w film she couldn't care less about 'watching the detectives 2007 ' is nowhere near category b it falls somewhere between q r like questions and repress the questions the director knows what he's doing well if his goal was to bore the viewer to death he has done a very good job br br 'watching the detectives 2007 ' was a complete waste of time for lucy alexis liu and cillian murphy bur please don't let it be a waste of your time br br rating 0 out of 100
<START> another detailed work on the subject by dr dwivedi takes us back in time to pre partioned panjab dr dwivedi chose a difficult subject for his movie debut he has worked on all meticulous details to bring the story to life the treatment of the subject is very delicate br br even though we have not been to the region during that time the sets and costumes look real unlike most movies made on partition this one focuses not on the gory details of violence to attract audience but on its after effects the characters come to life priyanshu chatterjee has given an impressive performance manoj bajpai has acted his heart out showing the plight of a guilt ridden man the rest of the cast has done a good job too
<START> largely dense road movie with some comic relief provided by the excellent john cleese although he is really sending up his performance in fawlty towers seems to flip from over the top slapstick to slushy sentimentality at the drop of a hat and the worst part of the film is that martin and hawn have to find themselves who they are etc see it at your peril
<START> have you seen the graduate it was hailed as the movie of its generation but a river runs through it is the story about all generations long before dustin hoffman's character got all wrapped up in the traps of modern suburbia norman maclean and his brother paul were facing the same crushing pressures of growing up as they tried to find their place in the world but how could a place like post ww1 montana be a showcase for the american family at a time when the wild west still was not completely gone just what has maclean tapped into that strikes so deeply at who we all are and what we have to go through to find ourselves as the movie opens norman is an old man flyfishing beside a rushing river trying to understand the course his own life has taken the movie is literally a journey up through his own stream of consciousness against time's current and back to when he was a boy he and his younger brother paul were the sons of a presbyterian minister and devoted mother the parents fit snugly into their roles mom takes care of house and home dad does the work of the lord the boys ponder what they will be when they grow up norm has it narrowed down to a boxer or a minister like his dad given the choice little paul would be the boxer since he's told his first choice of pro flyfisherman doesn't even exist the boys grow up and get into trouble with their pranks fight to see who is tougher and do the things brothers do all the while attending church and taking part in all other spiritual matters like flyfishing they are at similar points in their lives before college but when norm returns from his six years at dartmouth things are very different paul is at the top of his game master flyfisherman grad of a nearby college and newspaper reporter who knows every cop on the beat and every judge on the bench norman is stunningly well educated for his day but has little idea what to do with his life even as his father grills him about what he intends to do you're left feeling that at least to pops god will call you to your life's work but you have to stay open and ready to receive it all your life father has always taken his boys to reflect by the side of the river and contemplate god's eternal words listen their father urges it's both zen and quakerly pretty radical for a stoic clergyman but with all the beauty and contemplation and even though the macleans are truly a god fearing scripture heeding household how is it that rev maclean's family is unraveling paul is true perfection as he fishes the river but he's feeling the pull of gambling and boozing while his family doesn't know how to keep him from winding up where he seems to be headed mom dad and brother all seem to have the same quiet desperation of not knowing what they should be doing and why they can't seem to help pauly just waves it all off with a grin and his irresistible charm but the junior brother is losing his grip norman starts getting his life on track finding love and career but paul continues to slide the family that loves him watches helplessly mother father brother flounder in their own ways trying to help but none very effectively how can a family that loves each other so much be so ill equipped to handle this how can someone be so artful and full of grace when out in god's nature yet be somehow unfit or unwilling to fit into the constructs of society that god's peoples have made for themselves these are all questions norman will ponder his entire life the eternal words beneath the smooth stones of the river forever haunt him yet keep their secrets the movie is beautiful to watch this is certainly god's country and filming it won an oscar director robert redford plays with the story from the book and teases the narration a bit to follow the emotional pattern he's presenting and it works well but do go back and read the book too you'll see norman made connections with his old man even deeper than the movie can suggest and you'll see the places where the storyteller's very words gurgle and sing right off the page with an exuberance of a river running through it leading into the unknown
<START> in sum overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes the director and co writer says he wanted to mix genres in this case drama and comedy well at least here these two mix like vinegar and oil to boot the comedy is not very funny and juvenile additionally the film is not really realistic liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing french citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in french hospitals i watched this film on my big screen tv at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on eventually toward the end i fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex lover's son by that time i was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover marriage of convenience and a nutty ex lover at times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them either ismael or primarily nora to the detriment of the audience viewpoints keep changing from nora and ismael her ex lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital there probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed the epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub plots and seems to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball's chance in hell the actors do their best and are appealing but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing editing and lack of focus
<START> turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget the variety of characters is amazing from axe wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls i enjoyed the relationship between the leads not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going i also enjoyed the mix of humour which can be very easy to get wrong too much not enough which meant it didn't get too dark nor too spoofy it was a great step up from eaves' other efforts hellbreeder and sanitarium in terms of storyline and production they have a great website which is worth checking out can't wait for bane if the level of improvement continues it should be fantastic
<START> it was in 1988 when i saw the ronnie and nancy show for the first time on austrian television at that time i was already a very big fan of spitting image since when it won the bronze rose of the montreux film festival in 1986 of course i recorded every show on tape and watched it again and again especially the ronnie and nancy show i remember that scene when ronnie stood in front of a painting of abraham lincoln thinking it was a mirror and said to himself i need a shave or most amusing of all when he played ball with his dog but vice versa br br it's such a shame that spitting image seems to fall into oblivion it was one of the most fantastic and most intelligent made tv shows ever compared to other satirical broadcasts it was definitely the best of all br br well almost 20 years have passed since then and i wish i could see the show again is it possible to purchase it from someone somewhere
<START> american boy jesse took the train to vienna in order to take the plane for usa on the train he met a french girl celine although they met the first time they talked like good friends when the train stopped at vienna jesse begged celine to accompany him to have a tour on vienna then the romantic story unfolded br br at first they were cautious the funniest scene was their listening to cd in music store they peeked at each other though their eyes did not contact after in depth conversation they relationship became close then i saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words br br love is a strange thing when you really want it it will not come as you wished love needs mutual understanding without it love will not last long spiritual harmony is the most important for love br br excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie br br one of the best romance movies 9 10
<START> this is not an all around terrible comedy but it is very dull it has barely any laughs and it wastes its lavish production values there is one poignant moment near the end when fu manchu offers a dose of his elixir to his nemesis and tells him that you've been my one worthy adversary and now we can start all over again that scene however along with burt kwouk's amusing cameo in the beginning are the only memorable parts of the movie 1 2
<START> the photography was beautiful but i had difficulty understanding what was happening was there a lot of symbolism the 2 goldfishes do they mean something in thai culture there's not much plot not much happens and it just meanders along no real start no real middle and no real end rather unsatisfying really br br it was difficult to get into the characters as you never felt you got to know them it was difficult to know which scenes were imaginary and which were real the move felt chaotic and disjointed i don't know what the pang brothers were hoping to achieve maybe if i were thai it would make more sense
<START> omen iv the awakening starts at the 'st frances orphanage' where husband wife karen faye grant gene york michael woods are given a baby girl by sister yvonne megan leitch who they have adopted they name her delia at first things go well but as the years pass delia asia vieria grows up karen becomes suspicious of her as death disaster follows her karen is convinced that she is evil itself karen then finds out that she is pregnant but discovers a sinister plot to use her as a surrogate mother for th next antichrist gets a shock when she finds out who delia's real father was br br originally to be directed by dominique othenin girard who either quit or was sacked was replaced by jorge montesi who completed the film although why he bothered is anyone's guess as omen iv the awakening is absolutely terrible a disgrace when compared to it illustrious predecessors the script by brian taggert is hilariously bad i'm not sure whether this nonsense actually looked good as the written word on a piece of paper but there are so many things wrong with it that i find even that hard to believe as a serious film omen iv the awakening falls flat on it's face it really does work better if you look at it as a comedy spoof i mean the scene towards the end when the detective comes face to face with a bunch of zombie carol singers who are singing an ominous gothic song has to be seen to be believed i thought it was absolutely hilarious ridiculous in equal measure then there's the pointless difference between this the other omen films in that this time it's a young girl the question i ask here is why seriously why there's no reason at all isn't used to any effect at all anyway then of course there's the stupid twist at the end which claims delia has been keeping her brother's embryo inside herself that in a sinister conspiracy involving a group of satan worshippers it has been implanted in karen so she can give birth to the antichrist is moronic comes across as just plain daft at first it has a certain entertainment value in how bad it is but the unintentional hilarity gives way to complete boredom sooner rather than later br br it's obviously impossible to know how much of omen iv the awakening was directed by girard montesi but you can sort of tell all was not well behind the camera as it's a shabby cheap looking poorly made film which was actually made for tv it shows with the bland flat unimaginative cinematography production design then there's the total lack of scares atmosphere tension gore which are the main elements that made the previous omen films so effective br br the budget must have been pretty low the film looks like it was the best most stylish thing about omen iv the awakening is the final shot in which the camera rises up in the air as delia walks away into the distance to reveal a crucifix shaped cross made by two overlapping path's but this is the very last shot before the end credits roll which says just about everything i have to mention the music which sounds awful more suited to a comedy is very inappropriate sounding the acting is alright at best but as usual the kid annoys br br omen iv the awakening is rubbish it's a totally ridiculous film that tries to be serious just ends up coming across as stupid the change of director's probably didn't help either that's still not a excuse though the last omen film to date following the original the omen 1976 damien omen ii 1978 the final conflict 1981 all of which are far superior to this
<START> one of the best movie dramas i have ever seen we do a lot of acting in the church and this is one that can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things that actors can do in their work i highly recommend this one especially for those who have an interest in acting as a must see there are several scenes of note for one the graveyard scene when hamlet encounters yorick everyone knows about that scene by just going to elementary school and his interaction with the skull was extremely well done the logic used in this scene was tremendous i suppose a testament to shakespeare more than anything else for a second i very much enjoyed the scene where hamlet horatio and the character played by robin williams discussed the upcoming duel
<START> powers boothe turns in a stellar performance as 1970's cult figure jim jones of the peoples temple jones physical likeness to jones is uncanny and the story is acted out chillingly the movie keeps you riveted and is a must see for anyone check it out
<START> i don't understand why making remakes has become the trend every remake i have ever seen is awful and this is no exception if any of you have seen the quote from ben jones that it is a sleazy piece of trash he is quite right why they would take a wonderful television show which i loved have never missed an episode and own seasons 1 4 on dvd and ruin it i'll never know the television show was a family show and although daisy has the body it was really flaunted or even addressed in the show save the outfits a family show has been turned in to a dirty piece of garbage and i wouldn't recommend anyone go see it another thing i didn't like was that john schneider and tom wopat are excellent actors along with the rest of the original cast and they are also extremely cute the new bo and luke are not even a little cute that was one of the drawers for the show the casting is terrible they could have at least gotten a brunette for daisy i don't think burt reynolds is a qualified boss hogg either every other role he has ever played is totally opposite this role the only role they cast halfway decent is willie nelson as uncle jesse but still it is no comparison denver pyle is an actor all his own and that made him perfect for the role i think that the casting is awful the story is awful and all in all ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty terrible movie i wouldn't recommend anyone go see it i only saw it out of curiosity plus there was a free ticket in season 4 dvd i would never have paid to see this movie but it was free don't pay to see this movie
<START> having loved 'paris je t'aime' i highly anticipated this film and i admit i went in with high expectations but was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons br br although i was not expecting a re make of 'paris' in new york i was expecting the same structure what i liked about 'paris' was the breakup of the neighborhoods you got a sense of each directors style and the story they wanted to tell in 'ny' there is no clear separation of the stories at different points in the film characters from different stories run into each other which made me confused as to who i was watching and what exactly was going on also the switch in directing was evident but confusing since there was no flow br br another thing i loved about the 'paris' film was the different takes on love it wasn't all romantic there was love between parents and their children unrequited love a lonely middle aged woman yearning for love etc it explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans 'ny' seemed to only go for an edgy over the top sexuality there were some redeemable shorts the older couple having spent a lifetime together julie christie's short but overall the'ny' film didn't evoke any emotion for me i didn't connect with any of the characters like i did with 'paris' i remember watching 'paris' and feeling a deep sadness loneliness yearning hopefulness wonder it just had so much soul for me there was no soul in the 'ny' film br br maybe if i had gone into it without having 'paris' looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have elicited a more favorable response but as a self titled re take of 'paris je t'aime' i was sorely disappointed
