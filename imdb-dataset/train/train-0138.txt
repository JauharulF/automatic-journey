<START> this movie had more holes than a piece of swiss cheese ben affleck was seriously not trying to act in any way shape or form he outright sucked nothing about the movie was believable the first problems were in the intro where the man gives everything of value to the salvation army santa claus but it doesn't show why and then the granny sticks her head in the oven really beautiful and has absolutely nothing to do with the movie it's not even in the same tone as the movie there was no explanation of the motivation for ben affleck to choose the house he chose there was not any believable reactions by the family he chose and people are swayed here and there without any cause to be swayed example christina applegate and ben affleck's characters go tobogganing down a steep slope this is the incident that makes her suddenly fall in love with him riiiight anyway there was a funny moment or two but they were a rarity in the movie it seriously needed another rewrite or 4 hope you enjoy
<START> i feel totally ripped off someone needs to refund the 4 95 i spent at blockbuster to rent this homemade mess this is not a musical it is a complete waste of time and my evening what i don't get is why did this get distributed in the first place somebody must have been doing some heavy drugs the night that deal was made i've seen better films come out of film schools and i have been to film school so i can say that as a fact the quality of this work is also just so very bad to view shot on dv nuff said the songs are not songs but just banter that sounds the same in every section want to see a good musical then don't rent this movie
<START> i couldn't hold back the tears when i watched this beautiful documentary it was heart breaking disturbing and inspiring all in one i recommend this documentary to anyone seeking something that will make them think about what they are doing with their own lives or simply something that will make you think you watch as john lives through the last couple months of his life you watch as he goes through his days with a positive attitude at one point you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual you begin to understand that he has something to teach all of us his life and struggles will make you cry laugh and find that life's a lot easier to live if you just take it one day at a time
<START> cynthia rothrock china o'brien manhattan chase 2000 made this film enjoyable to watch and of course e this cute petite gal burned up the screen with her artistic abilities and hot sexy body china o'brien gets upset as a police officer and decides to call it quits and go back home to her hometown and get back to her roots and her dad who is the local sheriff her dad is getting older and the town has changed gangsters have taken over the town and started to get the local women to start turning tricks and the city people were getting sick and tired of their town going to hell well you almost can guess what happens and you are right china o'brien fights back after great tragedy strikes her life bad acting through out the picture but cynthia rothrock brings this film to a wonderful conclusion
<START> not only was the plot of this film contrived with the ease in which the two psychos are able to kidnap a pregnant woman without breaking a sweat but it was a terrible rip off of 'misery' however the main reason i gave this film such a low rating was because it absolutely disgusted me br br i'm not someone easily shocked by what film makers dish out and have always had a love for horror flicks but this film went too far purely in terms of violence and torture just for the sake of getting points in the shock factor br br i think most people when watching just the first ten minutes of 'hide and seek' will find themselves reaching for the remote
<START> i knew absolutely nothing about chocolat before my viewing of it i didn't know anything about the story the cast the director or anything about the film's history all i knew was it was a highly acclaimed french film had i known more i probably wouldn't have viewed the picture with an open mind on paper the premise doesn't sound interesting to me had i known what chocolat was about ahead of time my interest while watching would have been limited however not knowing about the story helped me enjoy it throughout i had no clue has to where the story would go what the characters would do and what the end result would be it was if nothing else not a predictable film indeed it could have been as the story is told in flashbacks telling a story in flashbacks is often a risky move on the part of the filmmakers since the lead character is seen in present day the audience knows she will remain alive by using the flashback technique director claire denis is able to ensure the audience that the young girl makes it to adulthood without any serious physical damage giving the viewer the sense that chocolat is a story more about emotions than what is on the outside a lesser filmmaker would give france a haggard looking face one that screams of a confused and unusual childhood instead denis presents france as a beautiful girl someone who looks fine on the outside br br it could be argued that chocolat is more about france's mother since she is given far more screen time though i believe it is ultimately about france to me what chocolat is really about is how a mother's actions affect her daughter it is about how parents' behavior stays with their offspring france is not ruined by her mother's actions in the story yet her mother's actions clearly made an impression on france had france not been affected at all by her mother's actions the flashback aspect would be irrelevant br br for a movie that deals with two time periods the past and the present chocolat was a very well paced there were no scene of excess fat none of the scenes felt gratuitous or out of the place the film had nice rhythm the editing crisp leaving only what was necessary to tell the story with a well told story solid editing and organized directing chocolat is one of the better french films i have seen it was responsible for launching claire denis' career and with good reason it's an incredible directorial debut
<START> life is really too short for movies like this i knew it couldn't be good when i realized what i'd already suspected that david schwimmer would be playing the exact same type of person he plays in 'friends' br br let's face it either the guy can't play anything but a nerd or he is never offered any other parts i have a feeling that it's a mixture of both br br and i have to say that it is extremely difficult to like a movie that utterly wastes the considerable talents of gwyneth paltrow barbara hershey toni collette and carol kane
<START> although this is generally a cheesy jungle adventure movie it does have some highlights the settings are quite beautiful and the pacing of the adventure is good you won't be bored watching it br br keith is as breezy as possible playing the eponymous lead an unabashedly drunk jungle guide shanghai'd into escorting rich boy van hoffman and his gorgeous wife shower on a hunting expedition in cannibal country he never takes things seriously shower is there as decoration and keith makes extensive use of her she doesn't really have to act much she's not the only female to show off her body and the prurient aspects of the film make it about halfway to a t a picture br br there's nothing in this film that would draw specific attention to it or away from it produced to be shlock it succeeds without too much fuss a good 2 am cable programmer
<START> buck's role as the kahn brings to mind bob barker of the price is right running a country the same way he runs his show but there's lots more to chuckle and snort through in this turkey kurt thomas as the baby faced hero displays some considerable acrobatic skills but not a whit of acting talent whatsoever there's a few spooky moments in the village of crazies mostly and some mildly impressive martial arts sequences but any given ninja movie will give you much more entertainment and you won't feel as guilty about laughing
<START> its like if you took the general themes of the usual suspects and fightclub take away all their style and class and mixed them together with a lot of pretentious new wave i'm intellectual so my movie must be hard to make sense of film maker rubbish mashed in a few extra styles for good measure chopped off the ending there you have revolver br br yes i did think about it for a little bit after watching and yes it did kind of make sense however that doesn't stop it being garbage br br waste of money waste of time br br up there as the worst movie i have ever seen with not even a bad movie novelty value to redeem it a little
<START> i saw this in the early 70s when i was 16 and despite the long slow set up meetings riots etc once the desert section began all fell into context and i loved it still do it has aged very well back then i was in what seemed to be a tiny minority all criticisms seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and narrative happily i'm no longer in such a minority br br it deftly shows in a somewhat prophetic way the political splintering unrest confrontation brutal repression commercialisation and deception which lay ahead br br appreciation for this magistral film has grown and i'm glad about that
<START> this musical was not quite what i expected foremost being there weren't many scenes between brando and sinatra as it was based on a damon runyon story i expected irony and surprise of which there was one really good one when we find that sinatra's gang has used the salvation army office for their crap game while brando was in havana with simmons if course it comes at the right moment too when brando brings her back i really didn't expect much from brando as a singer but he surprised me he wasn't great but he was just fine in the role his big number in the sewer however with the rest of sinatra's boys was the only place i felt brando's voice was weak he just didn't have the power the grand climax demanded overall i found the scenes between brando and simmons to be filled with electricity something i didn't think would happen when we first see simmons by herself and later when we're introduced to brando in the restaurant with sinatra trying to pull a fast one on him it wasn't until brando goes to her office that the story came to life br br frank sinatra on the other hand was flat even his vocal performances and vivian blaine who i never heard of but who i guess played the role on broadway just seemed to slow the proceedings down the scenes between her and sinatra were obvious also her songs felt the weakest to me both in terms of advancing story or character on top of that all the goldwyn girls numbers seemed shoe horned in just there for glitz for example when frank meets with brando in the nightclub we just cut to the stage routine for the cat number then it cuts back to the guys who continue on as if there hadn't been any dance number at all whenever brando and simmons were on screen i was having a great time but each time we return to the sinatra blaine story my interest level waned br br as for the songs there were some good ones particularly the very first number with stubby kaye the fugue for tinhorns number can do that's a great song and it reminded me of the very first song in the music man cash for the merchandise whatever it's called and the number in the sewer i couldn't help but be reminded of cool from west side story which brings me to a point i really did not like the art direction in this film the fake times square was just so completely phony it drew attention to itself same for the havana sequence and particularly the sewer i realize back in 1955 most musicals were shot on sets but things were changing carousel for example made great use of location photography even on the town shot scenes in mahattan in 1949 by the time we get to west side story in 1961 it's a given that stuff taking place in manhattan had to be actually shot in manhattan so by comparison guys and dolls set bound manhattan felt dated and more than a little too cute and changing lindy's to mindy's did they really have to do that for legal reasons now i always thought guys and dolls was a musical about sinatra and brando and their adventures with various girls it was much more focused than that which is to its credit in that regard it is much better than les girls which was interesting in it's own right but had a certain shallowness to it br br my one major complaint about guys and dolls and i don't know if this is endemic to the original stage show but when jean simmons realizes that brando never took any money for a bet that he made with sinatra and even said that he lost the bet she just runs off to find him and we cut to the wedding it seems to me a scene between brando and simmons would have added to the impact of the story to see brando come around as she came around to him would have been a great scene there is such a scene in the music man spoilers ahead when harold and marion have that duet while he's waiting for her to change she's upstairs in her house he's down on the sidewalk he's singing 76 trombones she's singing goodnight my someone they suddenly switch and sing each other's songs a beautiful way to convey their cross over to each other it's an emotional high moment of the film still guys and dolls had a lot going for it
<START> jag Ã¤r nyfiken Â yellow is a lot of fun like at least one other reviewer i was on numerous occasions laughing out loud yellow is energetic playful self aware explorative don't expect bergman here this movie is about a youth in the early to mid 60s in sweden and about the issues read contradictions that the nation and the world were facing at times yellow appears to be an earnest social political documentary with lena the main character and others interviewing both common people and politicians e g olaf palme at home at other times yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary all the while yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring lena's life her home life her loves her political views her view of herself she is a complete person Â complex flawed contradictory happy sad curious and placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director sjÃ¶man and his crew documenting themselves documenting lena it is this that for me really gives yellow wings not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice but their presence is itself another layer of the film they are filming themselves filming themselves i am reminded of a bjork music video with this same quality Â a music video about the making of a music video ad infinitum with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish i think sjÃ¶man may have had something similar in mind while jag Ã¤r nyfiken Â yellow may not be everyone's cup of tea it is certainly intelligent witty refreshing ebullient and authentic
<START> a trooper is on the side of the road making sure every1 is obeying the speed limit doing his job he then pulls over a woman who appears she is a mother there is a child in the back seat he then is telling her what is wrong and bam they get killed okay this is the start of what i personally thought would have been a good movie when i was watching this movie in the theatre i was with some friends this was our first night out after the summer so we wanted to go and see a good movie we all decided to see a suspense thriller that looked good to everyone in the group this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life not only did i waste 7 oo on a movie ticket but i had to sit through torture for the brain this movie started off with mystery and suspense and i seriously thought this cant be bad i was so wrong the whole problem with this movie is that it makes no sense even if you can get passed the bad acting the not so scary storyline and the over all horrible mess this movie was you will still be puzzled it's not because you're not smart enough to understand it it's because no human with a brain could comprehend what this stupid movie is about right now you may be thinking oh man i have to watch this movie just to see if it's as bad as this person says it is get that thought out of your head right now i'm trying to save you the trouble of watching this movie by telling you that it is so bad that there is no point in even considering seeing it please people don't make the same mistake i did thinking that this movie has potential it doesn't i give this movie 1 out of 10 if i could give a zero i would and i do not recommend anyone to ever see this movie you'll be saving yourself many sleepless nights trying to think w t f that freaking movie is about
<START> this movie is mostly chase scenes and special effects it is very weak on plot most of the computer talk was just mumbo jumbo i watched this because i was a big fan of the original war games movie which was based mostly on computer fact and real computer terminology this movie had none of that most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and highly unrealistic of real computers and networks but just lame it is like it was written by somebody who has no comprehension of real computers br br the ripley game was lame and was essentially just an arcade game no real hacking so what was the point movie was boring lame sequel
<START> i was very fond of this film it kept me guessing till just before the very end what would happen one of the better movies about the partition that i have seen urmila matondkar is gorgeous too this is one of the most personal and down to earth films i've seen on the partition it's a little less mainstream than gadar and is really an emotional roller coaster where you start out with one opinion of what is going on and come out completely one the other side this isn't typical bollywood fare but rather an art house type film the best part of this movie is that it doesn't dehumanize one side of the partition conflict when focusing on the story of another it doesn't blame or castigate but rather lets you draw your own conclusions about things
<START> before sunrise is a wonderful love story and has to be among my top 5 favorite movies ever dialog and acting are great i love the characters and their ideas and thoughts of course the romantic vienna introduced in the movie does not exist you won't find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night and it isn't possible to get to all the places in only one night either especially if you're a stranger and it's your first night in vienna but that's not the point the relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic although nothing ever really happens the movie never gets boring the ending is genuinely sad without being titanic or something even if you don't like love stories you should watch this film i'm a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer the first part is perfect as it is in my opinion
<START> though for a film that seems to be trying to market itself as a horror there was a distinct lack of blood br br there was also a distinct lack of skilled directing acting editing and script writing br br jeremy london put in one of most appalling performances i've ever seen his descent into the maelstrÃ¶m of madness is achingly self aware and clumsy oh look at him twitch oh look at him drink strong spirits oh look at him raise his brow and cock his head at a jaunty angle oh look at his unwashed greasy dark hair oh listen to his affectedly husky voice he must be a tortured artist writer genius oh yes out comes the poet shirt it's another boy who thinks he's byron or poe oh for the love of did someone give this guy a manual on how to act good or did they just pull him out of a cardboard box somewhere the defunct little plastic toy prize in a discontinued brand of bargain bin cereal okay that was a stupid line but that's only because london's performance has melted my brain with its awfulness br br katherine heigl is cute and very briar rose but has yet to grow into her acting shoes in this film she delivered her lines like she was being held up in fact her whole performance was very wooden her poses as stiff as her lines who knows perhaps she was just reacting to and trying to neutralise jeremy london's flailing excesses but if that's the case she takes it too far br br notable is arie verveen as poe while his character's role is confused he delivers the best performance of the piece he quite simply looks right but it's more than that he has some sort of depth i believed that he had a life beyond the dismal two dimensional quality of the rest of the characters huh maybe it's just because i like poe and could thus just let my mind wander and invent while he was on screen whatever he had an interest factor otherwise missing br br the rest of the characters are a faceless blur there are all the usual caricatures the perky blonde best friend who's a bit of a floozy the smitten local cop who's a bit of a dork the protective older man who perhaps has too much un fatherly interest in our heroine the scheming old witch etc etc yawn yawn br br as with the 'distinct lack of blood for a horror movie' issue none of the themes that they mention and that london's character mentions so scathingly in his attack on poe's writing are followed through on as another reviewer said there was potential here murder incest genuinely shocking stuff but instead they skirt away from the issues and cut away from the violence a raised candlestick swinging through the air closing in on it's victim then cut to black this is fine in a noirish traditional horror indeed it's expected and is fondly received when it happens it's a dear convention especially when accompanied by fake lightning bolts and intense siouxie eye makeup but in 'descendant' it just comes across as clumsy or as though the editor got queasy at the last minute and cut it out this could have either been a very tense psychological thriller the horror of palingenesis delusion madness or a simple and fun slasher movie it tries to be both or neither something new and exciting but either way it fails dismally the only horror element of this entire movie is it's epic dullness br br i think the editor if there was one at all must have been drunk when s he chopped this thing up there are awkwardly foreshortened scenes scenes that appeared to be out of order but that could have just been the poor script likewise the director cinematographer there were some very strange shots and framing that i think were meant to be tributes to hitchcock or browning but just ended up looking silly again fine in a noir but this was trying to be something else br br the whole thing perhaps may have been funny in that way that previous reviewers have mentioned omg how did this get made if i had been in the mood for some trash bagging unfortunately for me i had settled on the couch with the lights down low with the express intention of scaring myself silly this is a very poor film and i'm afraid i can't recommend it to people not even for laughs br br please please don't waste your time or money on this either borrow a real horror thriller film or find yourself a copy of poe's fantastical tales either way you'll have a far more enjoyable and frightening night than you could ever hope to achieve with this rubbish
<START> quote theurgist anyone with an i q over 50 would have seen this film what it is an intelligent well acted prequel to a modern day classic yes it doesn't have a blockbuster cast or a huge budget but it is still very well done and had me hooked for the full duration br br an i q over 50 you say that most mean you have an i q lower than 50 its name is carlitos way rise to power meaning it should have something whit the first one to do br br all and all its a ok movie if you change the title and no characters named carlito brigante br br p s don't comment on a movie if you don't know anything about movies but i guess an i q under 50 you wont know what the hell i am yelling about br br peace out
<START> this film is a quite entertaining horror anthology film along the lines of tales from the crypt written by robert bloch author of psycho it's good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast the movie should also be required viewing for doctor who fans since jon pertwee the third doctor has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star
