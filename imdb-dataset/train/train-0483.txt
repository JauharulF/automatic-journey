<START> this is the worst brain damaged ultra cheap super stupid silly pointless piece of trash i've ever seen an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre if you think that ed wood's plan 9 is bad well let me tell you looks like citizen kane compared to that one Â¿special effects again plan 9 is star wars Â¿acting thor johnson is al pacino so it's beyond bad really but if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies it's for you i'm a fan of american international for so many glorious horror movies the price corman poe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff but with star creatures they descend right down to the z level of course my 1 out of 10 works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun the guy playing an indian chief is great so have fun and enjoy if you can
<START> from director barbet schroder reversal of fortune i think i saw a bit of this in my media studies class and i recognised the leading actress so i tried it despite the rating by the critics basically cool kid richard haywood half nelson's ryan gosling and justin pendleton bully's michael pitt team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them investigating the murder is homicide detective cassie 'the hyena' mayweather sandra bullock with new partner sam kennedy ben chaplin who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene e g non relating hairs the plan doesn't seem to be completely going well because cassie and sam do quite quickly have richard or justin as suspects it is just a question of if they can sway them away also starring agnes bruckner as lisa mills chris penn as ray feathers r d call as captain rod cody and tom verica as asst d a al swanson i can see now the same concept as sir alfred hitchcock's rope with the murdering for a challenge thing but this film does it in a very silly way and not even a reasonably good bullock can save it from being dull and predictable adequate
<START> this film on paper looked like it could possibly be good after watching though i realised that this film was completely terrible the plot has no meaning and i think i counted the best part of 5000 cut scenes each one making the film more annoying boring and ridiculous i watched this late night pitch black no noise at all just to add to the scariness of it but the truth is the only thing that scared me was the music what they would call tragic music they play opera i mean be serious this film sums up all of what is not good about this type of film to be honest ill say no more but watch at your own risk this film is just complete rubbish enjoy
<START> i really liked this movie kurt manages to act without speaking letting moments speak for themselves he doesn't have to verbalize or rationalize his actions he simply decides and takes action he is supported by a good cast of actors and settings and is able to show us a more humane side of soldiers without getting to corny
<START> much about love life can be learned from watching the folks at the shop around the corner br br ernst lubitsch had another quiet triumph added to his credit with this lovely film with sparkling dialogue courtesy of his longtime collaborator samson raphaelson and wonderful performances from a cast of abundantly talented performers he created a truly memorable movie always believing in playing up to the intelligence of his viewers and favoring sophistication over slapstick the director concocted a scintillating cinematic repast seasoned with that elusive enigmatic quality known as the Âlubitsch touch ' br br although the story is set in budapest and there is a jumble of accents among the players this is of no consequence the beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any great american city or small town could easily be the locus for the action br br jimmy stewart margaret sullavan are wonderful as the clerks in love with romance and then with each other without knowing it their dialogue so adeptly handled as to seem utterly natural perfectly conveys their confusion quiet desperation as they seek for soul mates theirs is one of the classic love stories of the cinema br br cherubic frank morgan has a more serious role than usual that of a man whose transient importance in his little world is shattered when he finds himself to be a cuckold an accomplished scene stealer he allows no emotion to escape unvented additionally morgan provides the film with its most joyous few moments near the end when he determines that his store's newest employee an impoverished youth enjoys a memorable christmas eve br br joseph schildkraut adds another vivid depiction to his roster of screen portrayals this time that of a toadying sycophantic lothario who thoroughly deserves the punishment eventually meted out to him gentle felix bressart has his finest film role as a family man who really can not afford to become involved in shop intrigues yet remains a steadfast friend to stewart br br sara haden graces the small role of a sales clerk william tracy is hilarious as the ambitious errand boy who takes advantage of unforeseen developments to leverage himself onto the sales force br br in tiny roles charles halton plays a no nonsense detective and edwin maxwell appears as a pompous doctor movie mavens will recognize mary carr mabel colcord both uncredited in their single scene as miss sullavan's grandmother aunt
<START> spoilers br br i was blown away by this movie i've been renting on movielink for a bit and decided to check this movie out alot of boxing movies seem to overblow the blood in this movie it shows it at the amature level though i do wish that perhaps more attention would have been brought to perhaps her improving her grades the movie points out the problems some families face with gender br br i was a bit concerned with the ending but the ending wasn't a disappointment either br br i think it was pretty clear by the title that she'd win what was unexpected was that the two of them got back together sort of at the end br br loved the score for some of the scenes highly recommended br br 10 10 br br quality 9 10 br br entertainment 10 10 br br replayable 10 10
<START> it's hard to say what was the worst thing about this show the bad acting poor acoustics of different portions bad cgi improper sets for the period the poor script it would have been nice if the script followed the original tale a bit closer there's enough tension and good material in beowulf to provide a great deal of good material and a better story line than the scriptwriters could come up with br br and why introduce a strange new weapon like a crossbow that fires explosive bolts br br i see that this movie was made in only 21 days it shows in the lack of quality i'm beginning to think this is general poor attitude taken by sci fi channel and others when it comes to making movies out of classic tales in the past few years br br what a waste
<START> oh my god what the hell happened here i'm not going to say this again but what sort of backward movie is this the dubbing in this is way worst than the dubbing in king kong vs godzilla linda miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesy its about some villain called dr who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as king kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap kong when he does thats when linda miller gets annoying he makes kong his slave but everything goes wrong and king kong escapes then dr who sends the robot after him br br later when i was watching the movie i got a headache when linda miller and the other clowns started moaning as i sat through the misery of watching the dvd while it was playing i was hoping that the madness in the movie was going to end until the fight the ending has to be a really bad one because they could've shown kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs again br br don't watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do beware of the disappointment you will receive
<START> the characters are cliched and predictable with everyone being either snow white pure or wholly evil the acting is too stilted for it to be bad in an amusing over the top way it's doubly disappointing if you're a bette davis fan because her character is not a typically fun bette davis type character she just gets to frown pensively a lot br br on the whole neither my wife nor i found the movie to be interesting moving or enjoyable at all
<START> i saw this movie at the 2006 palm springs international film festival and it is a movie and not a film since it apparently was shot by hbo to be shown on their cable network sometime this year this movie presents page as a bondage and discipline fetish pinup and b d stag film actress who had enough talent to become a real actress page was a little more than that and the film touches on some of her other roles in modeling but not enough to balance out the career of the 50's pinup icon this film is supposedly based on the book the real bettie page by richard foster it's shot in black and white for that 1950's nostalgia feel i have the book called bettie page the life of a pinup legend that has a lot of great photos chronicling the career of page and i must say that this movie reproduces on film with gretchen mol as page many of those famous photo's very accurately mol herself with the bettie page black wig and brown contact lenses is bettie page not only does she have the bettie page look but she has the smile and characteristics of her personality that came through the camera down perfect and her body is as close to a replica of page's as possible terrific casting the story is kind of thin and tabloidesque and certainly could have been a lot better but this is a pretty good tv movie i would rate it a 7 0 of a scale of 10 and recommend it's viewing when it comes on tv
<START> i remember watching gung ho as a child with my mother and wondered why she would always cry in the last few minutes i of course found the entire movie hilarious particularly the mannerisms of the characters it wasn't until i was much older and watched it again that i realized how much deeper this show actually is br br michael keaton and gedde watanabe shine in their roles as the reluctant mediators keaton ceases to amaze me with his real life style of line delivery and watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix i also thought that patti yasutake umeki was simply fabulous in her role as the comic relief br br i think this movie is one of the most underrated films of the 80s we can all learn a lesson from the merging of the american and japanese workers in this film sometimes you really can have the best of both worlds and now i understand why my mother felt the way she did in those closing moments i'd rather have one of those cars too
<START> i'd been following this films progress for quite some time so perhaps expected a little too much i consider both gillian anderson and danny dyer to be good at what they do and was interested to see what dan reed could come up with but unfortunately it just didn't work for me br br the problem lies in the fact that the film doesn't really seem to understand which genre it's falling into and as such it fails to impress on drama horror and thriller elements because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well it's a bit of a jack of all trades and master of none br br the premise as with most revenge films is simple couple meet and go out something bad happens and they get their revenge it's a simple formula and one that many directors have handled expertly over the years unfotunately in this case it's as if dan reed thought it'd be great to do one of those revenge films that goes a little deeper by showing a more human side to all the characters and delving into their mental state in more detail wrong there are also a few key elements missing in this type of movie there's generally some kind of warning a don't do this or this might happen element which adds to the tension but there's nothing of the sort here it just simply happens then nothing happens for an hour then something interesting happens and then it ends br br there's a lot of really stiff competition in this genre and hats of to dan reed for trying i have no issue with his directing abilities but in term of writing i'd say next time he should stick to the formula for the type of film he's making instead of trying to be too clever and he'll have a quality movie on his hands
<START> 10 out of 10 this brilliant super documentary is a must see with film clips from the war which people did not seen for years untill this was screened in 1974 the film clips in this documentary from the war doesn't miss out anything some of the clips left me dumbstuck the whole series is over 20 episodes long and sir lawrence olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning story of war simply this is still probably the best documentary of war still and now over 25 years old still is able to pack a tremendous punch you must watch this at some time even if it's a few episodes even at that you will still be blown away at the impact this documentary means to those who have been there suffered and died in the name of war in a world at war
<START> i have been known to fall asleep during films but this is usually due to a combination of things including really tired being warm and comfortable on the sette and having just eaten a lot however on this occasion i fell asleep because the film was rubbish the plot development was constant constantly slow and boring things seemed to happen but with no explanation of what was causing them or why i admit i may have missed part of the film but i watched the majority of it and everything just seemed to happen of its own accord without any real concern for anything else i cant recommend this film at all
<START> i've bought certain films on disc even though the second rate presentation wasn't an option a certain company i won't identify here has put out several pan and scan dvds clean and sober star 80 and this one to name just three of films i don't think anyone wants to see in this compromised format some discs give the viewer a choice of 16x9 or full screen and others are just in their theatrical release 1 66 1 ratio br br that off my chest i'll say deathtrap was a spooky and oddly enough amusing picture my only complaints are the tinny score what is that f g instrument that is usually dragged out for films set in 18th century france and dyan cannon screaming at regular intervals couldn't her character have been an asthmatic who grabbed for an inhaler when she was stressed minor complaints both the benefits of discs include being able to fast forward to get beyond those things which you don't like br br i never saw a staged version of deathtrap so having these folks in the roles sets a great impression of their careers at the time before broadway tickets cost an arm and a leg the theatre was more affordable to average people now anyone paying less than a king's ransom to get live entertainment probably isn't going to a hit show on the great hyped way br br michael caine and christopher reeve were both large virile specimens in the early 80s and that's integral to how we'll react to their profession and overall image here they're definitely not bookish men who can't fight or will back down from an obstacle the two are equally great as their criminal stubbornness becomes their ultimate deathtrap
<START> the movie has a distinct albeit brutish and rough humanity for all its borderline depravity the zippy lyrical score points up the comic side of their misadventures and even when they're at their most thuggish like terrorizing the woman on the train a semi pitiful vulnerability lurks never far away dewaere sucks on her breasts like a baby blier cuts away from the scene where depardieu may be about to rape dewaere so we're never sure how explicitly to read the manifestly homoerotic aspect of their relationship either way that incident is the start of their relative humanization so the movie could certainly be read as pro gay although it could likely be read as pro anything you want the movie has many objectionable scenes and points of sexual politics and is probably best taken as a general cartoon on the foibles of both sexes making a mockery of the whole notion of sensitivity and honesty and hitting numerous points of possible profundity on the basis that if you fire off enough shots some of them are bound to hit
<START> i first saw blood of the samurai at its premiere during the hawaii international film festival wow blood just blew us away with its sheer verve gore vitality gore excitement gore utter campiness and even more gore and all in such great fun especially for those of you who enjoy all those japanese chambara samurai and ninja films you definitely have to see blood
<START> i seems in the beginning a interesting film a spanish thriller in a interesting nowadays madrid but it isn t none of that is actually a film only interesting for future films directors learning about what not to do making a film it can t be worse in others words even the presence of a oscar winner mira sorvino isn t enough to justify the 3 00 dollars expended to see this film the acting is horrendous and it seems the actors were just waiting to finish the daily shots to go home it lead to nowhere and is boring weak and bad don t expend time or money on this film
<START> a serial killer dies in a snowstorm and gets mutated into frosty the snowman's evil twin then goes on a killing spree interesting plot sounds scary and it is scary if you're five years old otherwise it's kind of cheesy i saw it on cable and i'm glad i didn't pay money to see it it has all the charm and style of a low budget movie which may become a cult film i'm sure it has a loyal fan base somewhere i'm just not in it even though i didn't like the movie as a whole there were some scenes i found amusing such as the bathtub scene and the post explosion scene with the picasso reference it was also enjoyable to watch the many ways the heroes try to kill jack and he just doesn't seem to want to die in short jack frost is a good low budget b movie comedy but a bad low budget b movie horror
<START> it's been a long time since i saw this mini series and i am happy to say its remembered merits have withstood the test of time br br most of the components of 'a perfect spy' the adaptation of lecarrÃ©'s finest novel in my opinion are top drawer outstanding aspects of it are the musical score and the masterful screenplay the latter written by arthur hopcraft who was also i believe the screenwriter for 'tinker tailor soldier spy' with alec guinness a few years before br br the actors are mostly very good some superb like alan howard's jack brotherhood and ray mcanally's ricky pym peter egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes with every camera angle the passage of time and the effects upon the physical appearances of the characters is very believably done so much so that i wondered exactly how old peter egan was at the time of filming the only jolt comes after the character of magnus pym is transferred from the very able hands of a young actor named benedict taylor to those of a noticeably too old peter egan just fresh out of oxford but this is a minor and unimportant seam in the whole br br egan has trouble being convincing only when the text becomes melodramatic and he needs to be upset emotionally ie cry none of the actors have a very easy time with these moments aside from the wonderful frances tomelty who plays peggy wentworth for all she's worth and steals the episode with ease br br jane booker is annoying as mary pym she has part of the character under her skin but often displays an amateurish petulance that diminishes her as a tough cookie diplomatic housewife which mary pym is rÃ¼diger weigang is splendid as axel amusing ironic and brilliant i also enjoyed sarah badel's camp turn as the baroness br br the british view of americans is vividly rendered in some dryly hilarious scenes when the yanks have come abroad to confab with bo brammell head of mi6 the american contingent are portrayed as empty headed buffoons who appear to have memorized a lot of long words out of the dictionary and spiced them liberally with american jargon and psycho babble much to the bemused scorn of the english br br the humor and sadness are subtly blended lecarrÃ© has a knack for mixing disparate elements in his stories and hopcraft has brilliantly captured the melancholy yet wistful atmosphere of the original br br not a perfect production what is and yet the best of the lecarrÃ© adaptations to reach film or television to date br br highly recommended to all spy thriller lovers and especially lecarrÃ© fans dvd available from acorn
