<START> perhaps it's because i am so in love with the william holden kim novak version or because i'm not a gen x'er but this was absolutely the worst remake i have ever seen without the original's soundtrack it just seemed like another typical tv movie yes about as bland as kraft cheese
<START> you know what you are getting when you purchase a hallmark card a sappy trite verse and that will be 3 99 thank you very much you get the same with a hallmark movie here we get a ninety year old ernie borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact he is not dead like we thought poor ernie he is the poor soul that married ethel merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks in this flick ernie jumps in feet first and portrays the grandpa that bonds with his long lost grandkid we have seen it before you might enjoy this movie but please don't say that you were not warned
<START> not everything is said in this excellent first feature from cÃ©line sciamma the friendship the wanting to fit in the first sexual feelings all this and much more is sublimated through the underwater synchro swimming scenes br br all three girls in the movie try to find and express their personality in a very different way it is a much less violent approach to the understanding of the teenage years compared to say thirteen but a very worthwhile trip nonetheless br br a must see and please leave all american cinematographic preconceptions at he door the soundtrack is a by the way br br bon cinÃ©ma

<START> the fine cast cannot uplift this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married paramour in fact there are more questions than answers in this one sided tale of romance and murder and since we are only provided with the prosecution's side none of these questions will be answered this is the type of fare that appeals to the he woman man hater clubs of america as presented it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be caught up in a romance with a married high profile attorney is it possible that if she had not been two timing her boy friend and having an affair with a married man the whole nasty murderous sordid incident could have been avoided when you watch this don't worry about going to the 'fridge you won't miss anything
<START> i first heard about this film about 20 years ago when i was a kid in grade school it just so happened that i was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day and under the entry for movies or cinema i don't remember were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental and one of them shown on the page was a still for offon it really intrigued me since it stood out the most on the page it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed over it br br about 18 or so years later the public library here where i live had available for checkout the whole 4 dvd set of treasures of american film archives released by the national film preservation foundation so when i was reading the notes on the dvd cases for the set i was quite pleasantly surprised to see that offon was on one of the discs after all these years i could finally see the film after viewing it it slightly wasn't was i was expecting it to be it tended to be a more organic looking film not that that's a bad thing but i was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic but it was still an impressive film imho considering the techniques scott bartlett used to make the film including hand tinting the film itself and using video equipment for some of the film's scenes filmed off of a video monitor giving it a more distressed lo res look br br don't get me wrong the techniques used in this film were quite ground breaking for 1972 that's why it's still one of my favorite short experimental films and a creative inspiration for me as well
<START> now here's a film straight out of my childhood my family used to taped but it kind of got tapped over and losted over the years now i was fortunate to watch the whole film on youtube com i had love this wonderful film when i watched it as kid and after watching again online i still do today my favorite song from the movie is candy hearts and paper flowers i will always remember that sweet song forever br br i was surprised when i looked at the opening credits on who animated who that some of the animators date back to 1930s wow that's like 47 years
<START> i saw this film a few years ago and i got to say that i really love it jason patric was perfect for this weird role that he played the director i don't too many things about him and i don't care the screenplay is good that's for sure in just a few words i have to say about this movie that is weird strange even dark but it's a good one i saw it a few years ago and never saw it since then i want to see it again and again i know that i'm not gonna get sick of watching it the scenes the atmosphere the actors the story everything is good the movie should have lasted longer i think 120 minutes should have been perfect i was hoping for a part 2 for this movie too bad it din't happened jason patric you're the man very good movie the end
<START> as a kid i did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool however i was a kid and so i was a bit dumb even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people what amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it what script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale the plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic the whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon the plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree seriously you just have to wonder why this movie was made if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars
<START> beginning with the poster featuring only morgan freeman and kevin spacey the entire movie was a fraud one stereotype after another this movie was about nothing or nothing new at least after 10 15 minutes you realize that you've just paid to see justin timberlake and ll cool j recite their way through another cop flick br br basically the story is about the corrupt system in some city all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town under the watchful eye of some hot shot politician the almighty and above the law organization is called frat and guess what they've got a kick ass loony cop shooting and beating at will suspects girlfriends you name it frat cops are corrupt and greedy so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented journalist one hour later after a series of unbelievably bad made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines everything ends happily and we get served the final line you can't beat the system bah don't see this waste of film roll freeman and spacey barely have 10 min altogether
<START> the cast is different and now they took a different approach we have the street smart team networth vs the supposed professional team magna but boy if you think the street smart team would have trouble you'd be right while the magna team has struggled at times the street team has simply disintegrated week after week br br first some things to reiterate as far as the apprentice 3 first of it continues the same absurd mentality from trump and the game in this series if your a good project manager but you lose the team will turn on you and you will be fired despite the fact that your backstabbing teammates are often the ones who do half ass jobs simply absurd that a game show that claims to hire the best candidate actually weeds out the best while the dysfunctional candidates stab each other until one is left and that person is the best lol br br anyone this season weve seen a total of cursing backstabbing and even gay offensive stereotypes carried out as teams try to do campaigns br br the list of victims so far cast tara dowdell audrey evans danny kastner those three are the only that i feel were unfairly fired by trump the rest really had it coming as they only incited conflict anger and suffering it's just amazing as one candidate audrey evans said as how she who did a good job was fired and how some of her worthless teammates are still in the game br br yes its the game it's the apprentice where manipulation backstabbing and always popular everyone gang up on the project manager mentality rules br br it has been an entertaining ride though the candidates are given a wide array of assignments from photo shoots to the construction of mini golf courses to building of new apartments br br still though it's still the apprentice though so all you can do basically is laugh the whole time as the insanity and chaos insues until lucky person is the winner
<START> i rarely make these comments but i felt compelled to spare others the pain i endured in watching this movie it's so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply can't suspend disbelief the problem starts early when you see a government researcher tooling around in a new porsche and dining with his team in a restaraunt that looks like a castle overlooking the capitol building in washington d c that kind of life on a government salary hah it only gets worse toward the end when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die in order to cleanse the gene pool the special effects are pretty good any producer's money can buy that and the lead actors have been great in other films but the screenplay and direction here are moronic many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind paul verhoeven's previous facially stupid movies showgirls starship troopers but this movie should stop the wondering he's just plain bad
<START> i can't believe that they took this off the air especially when they only had a few more episodes left my daughter sister and a few of my friends loved watching this show we were so upset when they stopped showing this because of so called ratings it is not fair to the people who were watching this show since the beginning we had a right to see the end i wish they would take an overall vote from all people with a 3 times a year voting system they could send out papers in the mail and we as viewers could give an overall vote on all programs that we watch or have heard about this could also help promote a new show people would see it and wonder what it is not only could you see what the viewers are watching you could also use this as a tool for free advertisement for tv and cable channels we want to see the other episodes bring it back
<START> hello i am from denmark and one day i was having a film evening with my friends one brought this movie with him russian terminator and it was extremely awful after watching less than half a minute we decided to fast forward only stopping at some laughable highlights or should i say lowlights in the movie i was actually mostly surprised to find out that this film was produced here in my homeland denmark that must have been the biggest mistake this country ever made
<START> i did not really want to watch this one it seemed to be an old raj kanwar movie which disgusted me even before i started watching it because i don't consider him even close to being mediocre as a filmmaker the only reason i took this one is obviously the shahrukh khan appearance in the film i had not even known what the film was all about because i was sure it would be just an ordinary fairy tale so i just imagined a love story between shahrukh khan and divya bharti with a substantial supporting role by rishi kapoor who i thought would be playing her father or uncle and to my complete shock rishi kapoor is actually the hero he is the one who romances the young divya i was saddened to find out that shahrukh had a small part of no substance and that too only in the second part of this idiotic film br br just let me repeat the question why would a 17 year old lovely divya have fallen for a 40 plus long haired chubby swollen piglet like rishi kapoor rishi kapoor should be ashamed of taking this part the only thing he did is ridiculing himself he romanced a girl who could logically be younger than his own daughter and to make things worse acts like a teenager at his forties on top of that just to make himself more pathetic he plays a pop star br br to make things clear i have no problems with actors romancing ladies much younger than they themselves are as long as they make a convincing couple there should be no problem in fact leading actors have always been cast opposite young girls amitabh bachchan sridevi mithun chakraborty madhuri dixit shahrukh khan deepika salman khan sneha ullal and made the pairing pretty well also i have nothing against rishi kapoor i think he is a good actor and his act in bobby is still well engraved in my heart but it's not that he looks in this film like say shahrukh khan salman khan or aamir khan look today br br that was such a disappointment oh and as for the reason every person actually watched this film shahrukh khan made a good debut he excelled in the very little his part allowed him to do the late divya bharti made a promising debut as well if you want to watch this film go for the second half only personally i would not do even that
<START> i'm a horror gore movie freak and this flick was so bad i felt embarrassed for not only the actors but also the director and the poor sap of a producer who actually put his money up for this schlock br br from the title you'd expect some great carnage somewhat of a storyline and at least some direction or dialog instead you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual three stooges episode at least i laugh at the three stooges while watching this crap i turned another tv on and started watching howard stern until something interesting happened br br needless to say i kept watching stern br br watching this film i realize that i could produce a film with three monkeys 2 dv cameras 50 dollars in loose change and a broken pc this film is my inspiration to get into no budget film making watch this movie if you dare but be warned there is a lot of nothing in here but a whole lot of talking and very little action this makes kazaam look like a meryl streep film br br i'm sure germany didn't ban it due to sex or violence other countries need to take heed
<START> not a bad film somehow i was made to actually root for the iranians to win the game played in the movie even though i don't know anything about soccer and am not a fan the ending on the bus was exhilarating br br the film itself deals with the issue of women in iran and how they are not allowed to go into sporting arenas amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear despite this law some women try to sneak in but many of them get caught and detained it's really astonishing that any society could still have such antiquated notions of gender in an interview panahi says his films are documents of history and its injustices and that one day in the future we can watch these movies and see how iran once lived one hopes that future will come sooner rather than later
<START> i almost called hbo and demanded my money back for the month just because they've been airing this movie i can just see the movie execs sitting around going okay we need to come up with something that's just like home alone only we'll add a bunch of cash for the kid hire cut rate actors and oh yeah we'll make it a lot less funny br br okay maybe not the last part but that's basically what you've got here not even worth seeing if someone else rents it and as a movie for kids forget it i wouldn't let my kids see this not necessarily because of bad taste jokes but because i wouldn't want them to say what were you thinking showing us that lame piece of garbage dad
<START> all dogs go to heaven is a movie that i have always liked when i was a kid i used to watch this every other day it is underrated if you look at its imdb rating and the comments of many people in general this isn't a bad movie like many say it is a very good movie this is good and your kids will probably like it even though it's rated g some parents may find this to be a bit violent it is actually a pretty dark story where the dogs are similar to mobsters who are involved in gambling extortion and even cold blooded murder the movie follows a dog named charlie who had escaped from the pound is killed by his old friend goes to heaven but ends up coming back to earth many younger kids watching this movie may feel as though they are watching a big kids movie br br there are some scenes that may scare little kids but i'm sure they'll do fine every time i watch this movie it reminds me of when i was a little kid i'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them of when they were younger this is the movie that makes me feel that way the performances from burt reynolds and dom deluise are great and this is the last movie that a little girl named judith barsi was in unfortunately she was killed at a young age which is a shame because she had so much potential and didn't deserve what happened now that i know her story i can't watch this movie the same way anymore because her voice sounds so sad br br the animation in this movie is great the voice work is great and the story is good but a little bit different from many other kids movies this was popular at the time of its release but was over shadowed by disney's mega popular the little mermaid this is a movie that isn't conceived as well by adults but if you're a kid or if you grew up with this movie as a kid then i'm sure you will enjoy watching it
<START> black and white film good photography believable characters br br just awful br br i have wasted another perfect evening watching a film that other rated as worthy and very good there is some good acting here and the back ground setting for the plot is good more should have been done with this but it is very slow to grow and never develops it is totally bases on sex without much romance with much un needed nudity more could have been done with the main characters if you are looking for something to watch with you family this in not the movie and if not you will have trouble sitting through it though this film is long its only about 1 inch deep
