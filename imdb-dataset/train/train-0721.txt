<START> three tales are told in this film that seemed to have been shot without knowledge of this being a combined vignette film the makers relate the three vignettes by having them all connected to shrink martin kove although you never see some of the leads with kove br br the first vignette has sexy vivian schilling a woman afraid of everything under the sun she makes adrian monk look brave having a paranoia laced evening at home alone you will literally scream at vivian for doing some ridiculous things she spends the majority of her time in a nighty which shows off her amazing features but her film is the worst if not the most nail biting br br the second vignette is owned by bill paxton as he portrays the roommate from hell his geeky roommate allows him to take complete advantage of him and bill does so whenever he can br br the last vignette was funny as a man fears that death will take him at any moment much like his pal who choked to death on an olive br br not very interesting as the movie as a whole seems chopped together with very little thought involved a must for bill paxton fans
<START> the year is 1964 ernesto che guevara having been a cuban citizen for the last five years disappears from the face of the earth leaving a glum fidel castro to announce that he is probably dead when in truth he has left cuba to move to bolivia to live an assumed identity whilst living in la paz guevara undertakes an idea to overthrow the corrupt bourgeois government there once again steven soderberg takes up where 'che part one' leaves off only better this time the pacing is more on target the job of acting is ever so fine including a turn by a sickly looking benecio del toro as che guevara suffice it to say it's probably best if you see both films to get the true story of guevara what kind of a man he was i had the rare open window of opportunity to see both films at one screening talk about a long haul as with 'che part 1 the argentine' this film has no mpaa rating but contains enough salty language violence to easily snag it an 'r'
<START> and i thought the beach was bad with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time nicolas cage don't blame him for the awful script if any one can make any sense of what the hell was the point of that movie give your self a pat on the back its a cross between the village and a crappier script its starts off kinda catching your eye and then as it goes further into the plot it just makes no sense and don't get me started about the ending what was that the only thing that makes this movie exist is nicolas cage usual great humor and his ability to be funny in the weirdest situations if you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie to watch save yourself five bucks and just go back home and turn put some thing on fire and when some ones asks you why just say the stupidest thing that comes into your mind and there you go
<START> allow me to start this review by saying this i love vampire movies they can suck har har pun intended and i'll still love them because vampires are just cool in movies van helsing considered by many to be a steaming pile of crap was enjoyable to me because of the fact that there were vampires you may ask what does that have to do with this movie the answer is that i intend to inform you of how horrible this movie truly is that even a sucker harharhar for vampire movies like me can despise a movie like this so much br br the movie stars van helsing a college professor guy who isn't at all convincing he's a terrible actor like everyone else in this movie and he wrote it to add salt to the wound i honestly to not mean to offend him and i'm sure everyone had fun making this movie but watching it was actually painful i'm not sure why i watched the whole thing perhaps it was a morbid fascination like watching an impending train crash it's horrible but you can't manage to force yourself to look away its main fault is that it's just so ing boring and its plot is so damn ridiculous even for a science fiction horror movie br br but i digress by the way van helsing has sex with his mom of course he doesn't know it's her at the time he just thinks it's one of his students which is still illegal and all but not as disgusting and creepy br br if i were van helsing i would at least pull an oedipus myself when i found out i had done something so gross it would've made for one entertaining thing if he just made some comment on it but no the point isn't even brought up at all by any of the characters it's as if the writer didn't even think of it i would've at least had another character laugh at him and say ha ha you had sex with your mom which would be mildly humorous although blatantly immature i'm probably running out of room so a few more words to dissuade you from ever seeing this film there's a vampire ninja fight with an old man it would be funny but the filmmakers expect us to take it seriously it's not even worth watching the movie to see how bad it is stay far far away from it if you value your time at all br br i will say one thing positive about the movie the guy who plays van helsing is pretty slick with that knife of his there's like a minute long segment where he swings around his knife and actually does some pretty nifty tricks it would be boring in any other movie but here sadly it was the highlight
<START> my guess is that this director writer had something to say let's see what it could have been a frog storms would be creepy b can i get someone like tom cruise to say the c word many times and look like a bad patrick rafter c cast my wife and get her to say the f word every 2 seconds this aside i really liked the beginning and the frog storm the rest was a relentless over long under edited over indulgent failure glad so many of you enjoyed it br br
<START> this movie captures the essence of growing up in smalltown america for a young girl on her own the realism and subtle nuances offered to ashley judd's character ruby by the storyline capture what can only be described as a true to life setting in the panhandle of florida from the slam of a screen door to the lack of work the echoes of what life is really like on the red neck riviera provide rough choices for the young girl paradise did not come easy but she slowly overcomes obstacles and deceit and learns to be her own woman with a strength that flows from within ashley judd's winning smile and infectious gait exude warmth and command respect and admiration the careful pace of the character development resembles that of ulee's gold in 1997 starring peter fonda and also directed by victor nunez
<START> this movie appears to have been an on the job training exercise for the coppola family it doesn't seem to know whether to be an a or a b western i mean the hero is called hopalong cassidy for god's sake william boyd must be spinning in his grave br br all the b western cliches are here the two gun pearly toothed hero in the white hat with the trusty steed c'mon thunder the all in black bearded villain the heroine in distress the rancher in trouble the cowardly sheriff over the top bad guys etc br br the acting with few exceptions is strictly from the yakima canutt school of acting chris lybbert who as the hero and louis schweibert who as the villain look like they would have been more at home in a 30's poverty row quickie the addition to the cast of veteran performers martin sheen robert carradine clu gulager and will hutchins helps a little but they are not given enough to do to salvage this one br br what was the point of the martin sheen robert carradine framing sequences are we to believe that the sheen character was a ghost what was the purpose of the black gloves it just didn't make sense br br being a great lover of westerns from all genres i tried hard to find some redeeming qualities in this film the cinematography was quite good and the settings looked very authentic aside from the hero and main villain the other characters looked authentic br br if the producers were going to resurrect the hopalong cassidy character they might have given some thought to portraying him as he was originally written a grizzled foul mouthed ranch hand with a chip on his shoulder the kind of part lee marvin would have excelled in br br what else can i say but on thunder on big fellow
<START> this great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a dvd along with prelude to war the great american filmmaker and story teller frank capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused world war ii and hitler's rise br br every school child nay every american should watch these films today because they are so apropos history has been repeating itself over and over again the lord chamberlains are still alive and kicking the tactics used by the nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the communists and now by muslim terrorist groups are still working to these evil group's advantage br br by sitting back and letting hitler as early as 1935 be aggressive france america and england caused over 50 million people's deaths americans french and british today would happily let hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties br br these great films may be too simplistic for world war ii history buffs they don't tell the horrors that the soviet union caused simply because at the time america was teamed up with them fighting hitler this film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war
<START> it was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the chick flick audience to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most however this was a very irritating attempt by heather graham to become the next meg ryan who became annoying as hell in her own right her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was overanxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles this film might have been more as there was suitable budget for settings actors and a decent story line my wife and i both agreed that this was 'muck' at the end as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high better luck next time hope miss graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like from hell
<START> phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines br br at first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed i didn't find the jokes or oddness funny anymore br br its a low budget film thats never a problem in itself there were some pretty interesting characters but eventually i just lost interest br br i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking br br for something similar but better try brother from another planet
<START> or listening to for that matter even the soundtrack is a bore br br honestly this isn't the worst gay movie i've seen that would be regarding billy but it's down there very close to the bottom of the barrel br br this thing drags and drags and drags it's not that the plot is inane in the hands of a good writer it might have worked it certainly could have been much more entertaining there's not one plot point you can't see coming for ten miles down the road the dialog is flat the jokes are old to add insult to injury it's full of one dimensional stereotypical gays br br nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible much less real there was no chemistry no dynamic in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other we're just told they're in love hard to figure when they have nothing in common and aren't compatible sexually they like the same book huh br br the acting is not totally bad but the pacing is excruciatingly slow i mean almost jarmusch slow but without jarmusch quality in fact that would be a good barometer for you if you like jarmusch films avoid this one
<START> says andy nobody gets hurt everybody wins before he says it we know the opposite is true everybody gets hurt nobody wins this is a new strand in american movies or perhaps an old strand brought back at long last think eastern promises there will be blood no country for old men these movies are dark serious extremely well made and don't care about happy endings i love them before the devil knows you're dead fits the general description but creates an atmosphere all its own kelly masterson's debut script is as close as a hollywood movie will ever get to a greek tragedy paying tribute to fellow veteran director stanley donen sidney lumet expertly and soberly turns the sombre story into an outstanding old school character drama the opening shots although of an obese accountant doggy styling his trophy wife have the look and feel of a dutch master's painting by contrast the drug dealer's condo looks more like a string of mondrians great performances all around only albert finney's character charles feels a little over acted eyes wide and mouth agape almost all the time but then he is in trouble deep deeper than any of the troubles most of us will ever know for compensation marisa tomei is super hot but of course you don't need me to tell you that why her character gina would want to be with a guy like andy we're never told but that's okay action is character after all the unique and magic touch of carter burwell's music makes this fine movie a masterpiece don't miss it
<START> this movie is truly boring it was banned in chinese cinema and i can see why it's not because it's critical of the communist regime but simply because the movie is of such low quality i would never want to pay money to watch this i love movies from chen kaige and zhang yimou and i am disappointed such a poor movie could come out of china it totally seems to ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the movie for himself the shots of a person standing there doing nothing for up to a minute are hilarious and there's plenty of them the cinematography and video quality are unbelievably bad i looked this film up on the net and it seems like people actually like this film the only explanation i have for this is that some film buffs think that if a film is not in english it is automatically good i can't see any reason why people would like this this is not an art film it's of waste of celluloid that's if they actually shot it on film which they didn't
<START> possible spoilers br br i like this film and have no problem staying awake for it it reminds me of me at 20 except this is even better like veronica says two chicks at one time it brings out the horniness in me the casual conversation these two real life chicks rather than hookers teasing us every step of the way i get into the conversations too even if they are utterly b s at times so what every chick just about that i've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous self centered b s philosophy it's just a bunch of nonsense and about as sensible as that other b s philosophy chicks are often into astrological charts the only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women he's into the same b s and moodiness the brunette chick is actually the most masculine person there br br i think it's kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by veronica she'd love to pull the little blonde away from alexander but veronica plays her all the way she's brilliant she gets the brunette thinking there's something up between them and then she steals the boy child man which is only appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group the brunette knows she's been had by the end when she's dropping her face into the palms of her hands while marlene deitrich sings in the background that paraphrasing there are a million couples in paris tonight but i only have this refrain br br but do they get married in the end alex and veronica mmmm i can only imagine a super tumultuous relationship ending in a pre marriage breakup they are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stones br br i like the film though it kept me entertained it's got a nice look and it's sexy
<START> i went to see this one with much expectation quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest even a child can see the missing logic to character's behaviors today's kids need creative stories which would inspire them which would make them 'daydream' about the events that's precisely what happened with movies like e t and star wars a decade ago how many kids imagined about becoming jedi knights and igniting their own lightsabers seriously don't waste your time money on this one
<START> the fact that this film was put out on dvd still formatted to tv and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film purists and rightly so this deserves a lot better treatment br br the story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft the rules of the day and winds up with a little girl instead not the conventional way and the problems that ensue afterward the old man had bought the kid at a slave auction and soon discovers the kid is not a boy which he obviously thought was the case br br the old man bianlian wang xu zhu is kind of funny looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin the little girl doggie zhou renying is a cutie the rest of the story is how the two manage after that i usually like a nice sentimental ending but this gets a bit carried away in the final 15 minutes br br overall it's involving story complete with drama suspense humor and sadness just don't expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the dvd until it comes out on widescreen rent it
<START> massacre is a film directed by andrea bianchi burial ground and produced by legendary italian horror director lucio fulci now with this mix of great talent you would think this movie would have been a true gore fest this could not be further from that massacre falls right on its face as being one of the most boring slasher films i have seen come out of italian cinema i was actually struggling to stay awake during the film and i have never had that problem with italian horror films br br massacre starts out with a hooker being slaughtered on the side of the road with an ax this scene was used in fulci's nightmare concert this isn't a bad scene and it raises your expectations of the movie as being an ax wielding slaughter unfortuanitly the next hour of the movie is so boring the movie goes on to a set of a horror film being filmed and there is a lot of character development during all these scenes but the characters in the movie are so dull and badly acted your interest starts to leak away the last 30 minutes of the movie aren't so bad but still could have been much better the gore in the movie was pathetic and since fulci used most of the gore scenes in nightmare concert there was nothing new here the end of the movie did leave a nice twist but there was still to much unanswered and the continuity falls right through the floor br br this wasn't a very good film but for a true italian horror freak like myself this movie is a must have since it is very rare 4 10 stars
<START> the first time i saw this movie i fell in love with it the atmosphere was what caught my attention first and foremost i expected a gore fest but instead got to watch a highly intelligent killer mess with my head to a chilling soundtrack it's actually my ringer at the moment p the fact that i couldn't predict when he'd kill and when he'd disappear was a major plus in my book predictable horror movies bore me now i know the storyline had some discrepancies but if you're like me you don't even notice them until long after the movie's over and you're laying in bed mauling over the fact that you just witnessed a masterpiece in motion finally as i mentioned the soundtrack is timeless it's one of my all time favorite theatrical scores so i was very happy to hear that rob zombie is leaving it untouched in his remake speaking of the remake i read a very comprehensive article on it and now that i know that mr zombie reveres john carpenter i have high hopes for his take on this classic this movie is great for any time you have a craving for a spine tingling but it's the perfect addition opener finale you name it for an all hallow's eve movie marathon
<START> not since the simpsons made it's debut has there been a sitcom that i didn't want to turn of in a matter of 2 minutes it has of course been said that the simpsons killed the sitcom not this one though br br the first season was so so as the teenage characters were not quite as outrageous as they later became they even went to school sometimes the following seasons the character where fledged out eric the sarcastic twit donna his levelheaded girlfriend kelso the dim bulb hyde the conspiracy theorist and anti establishment punk fez the pervert exchange student and finally jackie the spoiled rich floozy as for the adult characters there was eric's mom the can you believe she is so ditzy suburban mom eric's dad the straight arrow who of course wasn't such a hard ass as he seemed donna's goofy dad and her dumb blonde mom everybody are true to their characters but special kudos to kurtwood smith who finds the perfect balance between toughness and still makes his red forman quite sympathetic without making us throw up with unexpected cuteness br br topher grace is of course the main reason why this show is so good it's a tough character to play because it doesn't allow the actor to indulge in wild overacting like the kelso character played competently by ashton kutcher i enjoyed seeing the two characters interact because they are the most different br br hyde's character is a bit harder to enjoy because he is more realistic and do we really need to see the orphan story for the umpteenth time although i will say that the writers came up with a brilliant story arc for him in the last seasons br br jackie played by family guy voice artist mila kunis is hilarious and she has a nails on a chalkboard type voice which actually fits her character the only sad part is that we didn't see more scenes with her and eric because they were f hilarious together too much story was wasted on her relationship problems since we already got that in spades with eric and donna br br last i will say that the casting of guest actors were always great a few favorites fez' humongous girlfriend in the mid seasons pastor dan the totally awesome leo played by the equally awesome thomas chong another one of fez' girlfriends who is totally certifiable and a special appearance by the teenage witch sabrina as a slutty catholic girl br br coming up next on fox whatever
<START> this movie kept me constantly entertained in comparing this to serial mom mr waters has gone back to his grittier side this is not nearly as polished br br there is a dark side here a message about how success and fame changes a person but more importantly how it changes the people around you br br there is not a false moment in this film br br the characters are somewhat cartoonish but i want to believe that is what mr waters is trying to achieve br br it is fascinating to watch how mr waters has evolved this is truly his finest work
