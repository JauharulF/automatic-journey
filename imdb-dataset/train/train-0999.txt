<START> by all the fawning people have been doing over miike and his work i sat through this flick tonight i figured if it's half as good as ringu as i assumed from these comments it might be than it will be worth my time br br no such luck br br i'm all for finding the next great director or writer but i don't think miike is the one i don't have an nyu masters of fine arts but i do know this much a horror movie has to have pacing it also has to give the viewer more credulity than this movie does br br this film's pacing had me shaking my head some of the scenes near the end dragged so badly i went to the fridge and lingered there while kou shibasaki stared at the camera for seemingly minutes on end eyes wide and mouth agape a famous director once made the claim and i'm paraphrasing a movie could be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting it roll kou is not a good enough actress to make that work she stares paralyzed at the undead girl for more scenes than i care to remember and she isn't the only one doing an impersonation of a deer in headlights other cast members apparently feel the need to imitate this non performance the script gives them little room to do much else for far too much of the time br br i like asian cinema hong kong action flicks from the last 30 years korean horror like phone and koma ang lee's work some of the trashy but fun filipino movies with gratuitous sex and fighting as well as others chakushin ari i could have done without
<START> i read that there's a girl in my soup came out during peter sellers's low period watching the movie i'm not surprised almost nothing happens in the movie seemingly the very presence of sellers and goldie hawn should help the movie it doesn't the whole movie seems like they just randomly filmed whatever happened without scripting anything maybe i haven't seen every movie about middle aged to elderly people trying to be hippies but this one gives such movies a pretty bad name br br all in all both sellers and hawn have starred in much better movies than this so don't waste your time on this pretty worthless
<START> the maxx is a deep psychological introspective lightly camouflaged as a weird out superhero story julie winters is a freelance social worker in an unnamed filthy city ridden with crime and she and everyone she knows has a lot of issues to work through the maxx is her friend and client a street bum who thinks he's a costumed superhero or is it the other way around br br the maxx is not to be missed for the artwork the story itself or the excellent voice work particularly the late barry stigler's deliciously urbane drippingly evil voicing of the main villain mr gone br br if you get the chance to see this don't miss it
<START> if you're in the mood for some dopey light entertainment this will pass the time if you expect one jot of plausibility don't bother to me the dance scene looked like it was exaggerated for comic effect it didn't look especially hot or skilled
<START> the spoiler warning is for those people who want to see for themselves what animals and landscapes pass before their eyes although i don't mention it in great detail br br earth is an approx 90 minute cinema version based on planet earth which i watched all on bbc tv the tv version was narrated by david attenborough a captivating commentator who i had wished had also done it for earth but it is patrick stewart star trek's captain picard there are regularly shots of the earth from space so that's may be appropriate in any case he has a nice enough and calm voice for it there are 12 chapters in which we follow animal life on earth from north pole to antarctica 3 animal families polar bear elephant and whale appear in more than one of these parts each chapter starts with an indication how far from north pole or equator it is we see something of each kind of animal but only mammals and birds and some fish and some beautiful shots of vegetation mountains waterfalls deserts and jungle a near perfect presentation of the variety of life and landscapes and climates on earth you get the impression that our planet is only inhabited by animals people or villages or cities aren't in the film so it's a typical nature documentary but breathtakingly shot and accompanied by delightful music when the film opened i already knew it would end far too soon for me it is a family film so no brutal killings of any animals when one is caught by his hunter the shot ends and in other cases where we see the prey being caught it's shot in slow motion which makes it less violent and watchable for young children age limit 6 in the netherlands no blood is shed some scenes newly born animals are really cute and will be adored by kids it looks like an ordinary nature film but when you know how many shooting days it took 4000 and how much money it has cost it becomes an even more astonishing piece of beauty it had it's dutch premiere yesterday a month before the actual release in a cinema of 500 seats of which 15 were taken true beauty is rarely interesting for cinema goers it seems as i knew the tv series i was of course very curious if my favourite scenes would make it into this movie some didn't but the most impressive shots big waterfalls did luckily it was the first time i ever cried in a nature film
<START> i was really surprised with this movie going in to the sneak preview knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer i'd seen i thought it was going to be a dude where's my car kind of crap fest i was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work instead i got a smart surprisingly original movie about a decent average guy who just never had sex br br yes the film is chock full o' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey look a nipple but it's done much in the spirit of bad santa rather than sorority boys all the characters are people you probably know in real life redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives br br i went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap and i was very surprised yea it's pretty over the top c'mon it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin but it's very smartly done br br in the end you're really pulling for this guy to get laid which says a lot about the movie because honestly did you really care if ashton kutcher found his car or not
<START> well i have finally caught up with rock 'n' roll high school almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979 latecomer that i am i will probably first see this summer's new documentary patti smith dream of life sometime around 2040 and no the film doesn't feel dated one bit and yes it was worth the wait this is a very high energy comedy that features loads of great music and some surprising moments it tells the story of riff randell adorably played by p j soles and the battle that she and her fellow students at vince lombardi high wage against their new repressive principal miss togar danny peary in his book cult movies quite accurately describes mary woronov's performance as an evil eve arden a typical teens vs establishment story line is beefed up here with some absurdist humor those exploding mice that giant mouse the hansel and gretel hall monitors and some truly rousing tunes riff is of course the 1 fan of that original punk band the ramones and that band dishes out a baker's dozen of its greatest songs during the course of the film including five at a concert that is a total blast indeed the sight of riff furiously dancing to teenage lobotomy at this blowout may be the picture's funniest moment and the initial appearance of joey johnny dee dee and marky in their ramonesmobile and later slinking down a street singing i just wanna have something to do is quite exhilarating the film ends with an explosive confrontation that is i would imagine every high school kid's wet dream fun stuff indeed on a side note the ramones were one of the loudest bands that i have ever seen in concert so i was very amused to note that the dvd for this film comes with optional english subtitles for the hearing impaired how many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary i wonder
<START> the 60Â´s is a well balanced mini series between historical facts and a good plot in four deliveries we follow a north american family with 3 members but we don't only see them we also follow the story of several characters as a black reverend an extremist student leader and a soldier in vietnam the filmography is just extraordinary in the first chapters we see some shots of the vietnam war in between the scenes the next chapter doesn't start where the last one finished it starts some time after giving us a little mystery on what happened in general the 60Â´s mini series is a must see not only for hippies fanatics but for everyone with little curiosity about the topic
<START> many days after seeing conceiving ada i am still in awe that any group of people would spend so much time to make such an atrocious film br br no one ought see this film in hopes of learning anything of consequence about ada lovelock her colleagues or the product of her endeavors br br likewise no one ought to see this film in hopes of being entertained br br as a sci fi film this would unquestionably be a horrendous failure somehow the main character manages to bring the past to life and interact with it on her personal computer with the advice and encouraging words of timothy leary i doubt anyone could suspend their disbelief enough to keep this from seeming absolutely absurd br br as a drama film this would unquestionably be a horrendous failure somehow the writer director manages to fill eighty five minutes with constant unnecessary annoying and trivial drama over essentially nothing i doubt that anyone could feel that all the drama in the film serves only as an irritating distraction br br i find it difficult to fully express my degree of contempt for conceiving ada the circumstances under which i saw it forbid me from leaving the theater but there is no question that i would have otherwise i am still angry that i wasted the time that it took to see it only that i might more effectively criticize this movie i wish that i were more articulate
<START> you play as b j blazkowicz a us secret agent soldier tough guy who is sent to uncover nazi secret and turn the tide of world war ii that means everything from breaking out of a nazi dungeon to thwarting hitler's war machine and even the fuhrer himself br br this is quite possibly the most influential game of its time that's because it literally inspired obsession many games existed at the time and even more do today but every so often you get a real grabber this is one of them just like tetris before it and more recently gta iii in 2002 yes doom is better in almost every respect but the shots heard around the world which led to one of gaming's biggest tidal waves were fired by b j blazkowicz the space marine duke nukem max payne serious sam john mullins jc denton agent 47 gordon freeman and legions of others owe their existence to the guys at id whether directly or in most cases indirectly but they still do br br even with its old look very aged graphics super simple gameplay this is really a game games now border on the experience level and highly rectangular levels the scope of all six episodes provides lots of fun especially discovering those secrets with treasure and a chaingun in them br br also halt bang bang bang aarrrgh never grows old 8 10 br br voluntarily rated pc 13 for profound carnage however it's exceptionally tame when compared to what games have today
<START> in the spirit of the classic the sting this movie hits where it truly hurts in the heart a prim proper female psychiatrist hungry for adventure meets up with the dirtiest and rottenest of scoundrals the vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman and begs to be involved in his operation while the movie moves kind of slow it's climax and ending are stunning you'll especially enjoy how the doctor forgives herself
<START> carmen is one of the best films i've ever seen it's hard to say whose performance is best antonio gades cristina hoyos and laura del sol are superb they dance their souls out it's a beautiful tale of inseparability of life and myth myth penetrates everyday life dance becomes life and entire life is danced out real people at one and the same time live their own lives and become somebody else act out the parts of lovers of old the magic is continuing
<START> well tenko is without doubt the best british television show ever the performances the directing the casting the suspense the drama everything is fantastic about it br br although the show fell a little later in its final season this ending movie picked up the threads nicely and wove a superb story for fans of the show and newbies i cannot recommend this movie more find it and watch it but i do advise watching the series first as the first 2 seasons are even better than this fantastic movie br br an obvious 10 10
<START> the scintillating elizabeth taylor stars in this lesser known classic as a young girl from london who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from british ceylon current day sri lanka upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd william dieterle who also directed the life of emile zola and portrait of jennie does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark and almost eerie undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful i've seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery
<START> i thought that ice age was an excellent movie as a woman of 30 with no children i still seem to really enjoy these humorous witty animated movies sid is the best character i have seen in some time better than bartok in anastasia although he was really humorous and i did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten and even more humorous than melman in madagascar i have seen the movie at least 15 times i own it obviously and i quote the movie at work on many occasions yes still my favourite scene is the part where sid says oh oh oh i love this game and sid and manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the tigers pack of wolves pack of bears pack of fleas pack of whiskers pack of noses pack a derm pack of lies pack of troubles pack a wallop pack of birds pack of flying fish or however that part goes that is the funniest part about the whole movie although i also really enjoyed the humour behind putting sloths on the map and many other parts as well the only animated movie that can remotely compare to ice age is brother bear
<START> honestly where can i begin this was a low budget horribly acted film it was so cheesy it had us all bursting with laughter to how completely retarded it was the sword fighting scenes weren't even sword fights they were playing around with some plastic swords they bought at wal mart and all they were doing was just moaning to try and make it look like they were struggling me and my family was in the mood for a really good action movie one day so we decided to go to the store and look for one and there it was the sawtooth island movie i mean it looked so great but when we watched it at home i practically died after the first scene br br oh and the plot of the film the story board the script etc was a bunch of garbage that i don't even know why the director and producer even wasted their time making it but if you happen to stumble upon this movie do not get it
<START> i didn't expect to like this film as much as i did i got it simply because i saw it on the list of top 25 most controversial films of all time it didn't look particularly great i was pleasantly surprised to find that it was one of the most cleverly composed films of recent memory br br it's about a twenty year old woman wants to know everything she stores every bit of information she collects in an enormous archive she experiments with experience in sex political activism and human relationships meanwhile film's crew is shown making the film and we view their reactions to the story and each other nudity explicit sex and controversial politics kept this film from being shown in the us while its seizure by customs was appealed the film is a narrative yet it's a documentary that shows us the behind the scenes world of the filmmakers during the narrative the fourth wall being broken this film is the most direct possible way of making a movie i have ever seen the movie predominantly works as a time capsule of 1960s psychedelic goings on freedom fighting and sexual liberation i like to think of it as much more than that br br i didn't think i would want to waste my time with the blue version of this movie but i actually really do this film is a buried treasure give it a try
<START> i found the fbi story considerably entertaining and suitably upbeat for my new years day holiday viewing its drama and action packed episodes were thrilling the hardesty character was well drawn and admirable overall the photography script and direction was perfectly creditable rather than taking the film to be a repugnant piece of propaganda as some might i enjoyed it as a well mounted portrayal of the necessity of ingenious minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime again the depiction of a family holding together even under the strain of the husband's commitment to his arguably important work i did not find to be a twee representation but an ideal and exemplary one
<START> the howling ii starts as it means to go on with a bizarre and surreal opening narration by christopher lee whose image is imposed over a moving star field oh and a skeleton appears as well for some reason he says for it's written the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with her blood and i saw her sip upon a hairy beast and she held forth a golden challis full of the filthiest fornication's and upon her forehead was written behold i am the great mother of an inaudible word i couldn't make out no matter how many times i rewound the tape and tried to sorry and all abominations of the earth this opening narration means nothing at all and is just downright bizarre after the opening credits which are set over shots of transylvanian architecture we get an on screen caption that informs us we're in 'los angeles california u s a city of the angels' i knew i was in for a long 86 minutes it's probably not too long after the events of the original howling 1981 and it's karen white's funeral after the ceremony karen's brother ben reb brown is spoken to by an 'occult investigator' called stefan crosscoe christopher lee who says that karen is a werewolf and that she will come back to life ben dismisses such nonsense but together with one of karen's friends and colleagues jenny annie mcenroe he visits stefan at his home there stefan tells them about werewolves and how they can be killed he mentions stirba sybil danning who is the queen of werewolves stefan also shows them a photograph taken at karen's funeral of a woman named mariana marsha a hunt and that she is an extremely vicious and dangerous werewolf who wants karen stefan says he will stake any werewoves through the heart with titanium ben figures out that stefan means he will stake karen as well so together with jenny he travels to the graveyard where his sister's crypt is to stop stefan however lots of werewolves turn up and attack stefan ben and jenny they survive the attack and manage to find out that stirba is to be found in transylvania they all decide to travel to transylvania and stop stirba and her werewolves from taking over the earth by fulfilling a centuries old curse once there they travel to a small town called vlkava which means 'where wolves live' and meet up with the local priest father florin ladislav krecmer and his small but loyal group of werewolf hunters hey what else can i call them oh and a dwarf named florica ludmila safarova helps too they follow mariana who they hope will lead them to stirba but stirba knows of stefan's arrival and has plans for him ben and jenny will stefan be able to put an end to stirba's plans for world domination will this film get any more bizarre or surreal watch it and find out directed by philippe mora this is one strange mess of a film it's poorly edited as certain sequences just jump around incoherently the single biggest problem is the script by robert sano and gary brandner based on his novel which is all over the place and doesn't make any sort of sense or introduces us to any proper characters that we like luckily it moves along like a rocket and is never dull or boring unlike the original something strange or bizarre is always happening to keep the viewer entertained most people will probably hate it but for those of us who enjoy 'bad' films this is right up there with the best of them there are werewolf orgies which are just freaky to watch we get some cool werewolf killing weaponry the sets and locations just seem so out of place and i don't know if this was actually shot in transylvania but it doesn't look like what i thought mid 80's transylvania would stirba's castle is part dungeon part gothic castle and part modern luxury house stirba and her servant's costumes are very over the top stirba wears an outfit that looks like it belongs in a s m video and to be fair to her she looks pretty sexy and her minions wear skimpy leather clothing too the special make up effects range from good to poor a dwarf's eyes explode someone has their hand ripped off and a priest has some creature emerge from his mouth but this isn't a film loaded with gore although there are plenty of effect sequences with werewolf transformations and attacks there is plenty of nudity as well as stirba and her minions are a real randy bunch of werewolves i should also mention the music the soundtrack is dominated by awful rock music that i hated and i ended up turning the volume down acting is weak all round and what on earth was christopher lee thinking about when he accepted this film i wonder what he thinks of it basically the whole thing is a real mess but i found it a fairly entertaining mess all the same impossible to recommend but it kept me watching through to the end speaking of which the end credits run over what appears to be deleted scenes and cut footage it also features the same shot of sybil danning taking her dress off and exposing her breasts probably in excess of 20 times if that's your thing
<START> the united states of kiss my ass' br br house of games is the directional debut from playwright david mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller it stars lindsay crouse as best selling psychiatrist margaret ford who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide in doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels downtown' to visit the lowlife place house of games br br the gambler mike played excellently by joe mantegna turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty he offers crouse's character a deal if she is willing to sit with him at a game a big money game in the backroom he'll cancel the patients debts the card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work gaining the trust of others and a fascinating relationship begins what makes house of games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control is it the psychiatrist or the con man or is it the well known man of great bluffs david mamet br br in house of games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring however in every david mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings not the direction in house of games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads showy and distracting but mainly as is the case with much of mamet's work it is the dialogue which grips you and slowly draws you into the film no one in the house of games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words everyone bluffs and double bluffs which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order this is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension house of games can also be viewed as a class war' division movie with lindsay crouse we have the middle class well to do educated psychiatrist and joe mantegna is the complete opposite the working class of america earning a living by honest' crime br br the film seduces the viewer much like crouse is seduced by mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of american cinema and the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for it's stunning br br an extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings 9 10
