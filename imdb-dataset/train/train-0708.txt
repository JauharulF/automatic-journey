<START> i wouldn't go so far as to not recommend this movie since the only problems i have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie the sort of things common to every kids movie ever made it seems that doesn't make it bad just not something i'd go far br br it is a little saccharine so i might say that for the most part anyone looking for something with a little more wit could be disappointed in an obviously for kids movie like this br br however all of that goes out the window when that squirrel the one in all the trailers comes on screen his time is limited but it seems apparent that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these guys 'hey could you stick in a little more squirrel ' every time it's getting intolerably dull that doesn't save the movie but you can leave saying 'at least there was one aspect where i couldn't stop laughing ' br br and of course visually it won't disappoint but that's almost a given with pixar flicks of all of their stuff i'd put this at the bottom but that isn't in itself bad
<START> i would of enjoyed this film but van damme just does the same old same old rubbish time after time poo knickers fight scenes as per usually the only thing this loser left out was the russians normally end up being killed in the end this film is utter doggy do do of the highest nature please please please van damme get some acting lessons you need them anyone who likes van damme has issues it seems sad that the only way van damme ever gets any acting work is when he co writes the film co produces the film and does the screen play for the film avoid van damme and his slicked back nasty wig i give this film a two out of ten because the one with the the sandman was better to add insult to injury i wasted a quid on this manure
<START> white man progress industrialization bad first nations nature animals good simple formula actually in past days the same kind of propaganda was used to defend the status quo now it is used to attack it however that being said i think the movie does succeed in overcoming hackneyed politicization because it plays to the themes of freedom and original nature in a way that appeals to everyone you may not be onside with the movie's rubbishy revisionism of how the west was won er lost but anyone can feel a sense of longing for the days when horses could run free on the western plains the movie also conveniently sidesteps the fact that there were no horses in america before the evil white man brought them there anyway i liked it the quality of the animation especially the opening shot is incredible
<START> ever read jim thompson he's hard boiled noir with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy i've ever encountered there are rarely private detectives in his work just losers psychotics and small time con artists this film has thompson nailed if god made any real mistakes in this world it was in giving us a will to live when we've got no excuse for it every character in the film balances on a razor's edge between surreal and creepy realism there's sleazy conniving uncle bud played by bruce dern and spookily well intentioned doc goldman played by george dickerson jason patric gives a wonderful often heart wrenching performance as kid collins a none too bright shy ex fighter who's more scared of himself than of anyone else rachel ward is fay the sexy femme fatale who we can't quite figure out it's not your standard film noir nor is it intended to be after dark my sweet along with the grifters are two excellent adaptations of novels by one of my favorite writers jim thompson
<START> this movie is not only the funniest film ever created it's the greatest my hats off to mr and mrs zodsworth and the rest of the wacky wacky cast good morning satan want a donut see it post haste go see it now
<START> one of the worst movies i've seen shoddy camera work crappy filter usage film was grainy script was terrible i mean come on how predictable was the big battle at the end br br some of the fight scenes were okay i guess br br some scenes were so bad it was comical like sorbo getting the horse and riding at the end lol i mean really a horse oh cant forget how the bad assassins roll around in the same vehicle throughout the entire movie one would think that after killling key witness and federal agents they woulda been tracked down etc etc really don't bother watching it
<START> the first thing i thought when i saw this films was it is not really a film at least it is not what we imagine spontaneously when we hear the word film it is entirely symbolic everything in it has a figurative meaning so if you are not used to express thing in a symbolic way you will find it strange if you are not acquainted with philosophy religion spiritual life you will think it's just a fairy tale and even a weird one chaotic for me the legend of zu is perfectly transparent and i do like it it tells us in images the story about the fight between light and darkness the fight that is as old as humanity and every one who is in search of the sens in this life is confronted with it the film is obviously made by buddhists i am not a buddhist my religion and the vision of the world and human is different but as far as we are all humans and have the same human nature we necessarily have common experiences and can understand each other it is a really beautiful film and i which we had more films like this films that have a meaning there are too many empty stories which are good only to make time pass more quickly
<START> wow after trashing the disk of timo roses rout city after about 15 minutes south park is about more than meaningless cursing i guess some people just don't get it i was interested in this movie i read quite some positive stuff and the packaging and look of the movie seemed far from the total trash i expected after rout city br br surprise the movie isn't total trash but the problem seems to be exactly that timo rose tries to walk in the footsteps of german horror splatter cinema like olaf ittenbach and the likes that means barricade is in parts extremely gory and detailed the gore fx are not really believable but ok the acting is ok but in some cases plain sucks the hillbilly chick in the opening sequence is ridiculous and doesn't get better till she's shot br br so what is the problem the movie is gory has a typical german underground vibe including the classic booby shots in blood ok fx and a modern feel to it like the packaging already promised br br 1 the script is total bs you get a typical hillbilly lost in the woods story with some guys gal camping out and meeting a degenerated hillbilly family everything is just leading towards the torture mutilation scenes and seems unbelievably random and pointless this is the first thing that makes barricade half hearted br br 2 random is also the perfect description for a lot of the camera work i liked the repetitive cut to the tweezers in the extended booby torture scene either they had no material or the editor works in a hardware store even worse the editing sure its modern and far better than a lot of other movies in the genre but its random you got an overuse of that typical exposure effect everywhere and with no meaning its just there all the time then there's some grainy noisy film look which also is just thrown in here and there for the sake of it i don't get the meaning br br 3 like the fore mentioned effects there is a lot of repetitive stuff in here for example most of the kills are edited with multiple repetitions of stabbing and punching its ok once but here its annoying and fake especially towards the end annoying also attributes the music which is permanently used without any change in the background it doesn't take long until it makes the movie hardly bearable br br 4 from all this comes the biggest problem of this movie and many others in my opinion if you make a splatter movie with trashy feel its pretty idiotic to polish it with special fx and new school editing it looks like they take it way too serious its no fun because the decent gore fx are plain wasted in this context and where the classic gore fx are ok the computer fx in scenes like the stabbing in the mouth or the gunshots in the ending look rather silly and 3d splatter mostly sucks to me even in movies with a budget and decent 3d artists br br i often wondered if the time of serious splatter movies is over and barricade is just another example it might be time to put it in the tomb its no fun has no character and is too trashy for its look the script is a cheap try on wrong turn and tcm leading absolutely nowhere you can take that literally the ending is just there and as random as many other things here i love you in a splatter flick come on barricade tries to incorporate a lot and fails you can sure fast forward through this movie for some extensive disembowelment acid face melting nipple pinching and classic friday the 13th style stabbing of a couple while fingering in a tent bloody boobies hooray but its really hard to get through this total failure especially because you can see it could have been something
<START> excellent warner bros effort starring errol flynn in one of his best screen performances it's often cited as his best and i can't really judge fully until i have seen his dawn patrol however his work in they died with their boots on takes some beating i'm a big flynn fan he's my favourite actor after james mason it also helps that he's an aussie and i think he's just marvellous a great screen presence and also a great actor he is the centrepiece of gentleman jim as the legendary boxer with the fancy footwork but he is also backed up by a literate warm and funny script and raoul walsh's direction every walsh film i have seen never loses a beat of it's pace he truly was a born film maker walsh directs the ring scenes beautifully as he does with the lighter moments and that poignant great final scene between ward bord and flynn add to that great production values the gay nineties never looked better and a lovely supporting cast and it's pretty much perfect entertainment alan hale usually played flynn's sidekick but here is his father and it still all works alexis smith is flynn's love interest the pair are head over heels in love with fighting with each other
<START> bobby is a goofy kid who smiles far too much and wants sex so he buys a van to aid in this quest the acting is lame the comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than a loosely strung chain of clichÃ©s and cheap thrills the makers of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the out there craziness of other films of the time but fell a long way short they even resort to bobby slipping on a banana skin because this will supposedly add comedic value br br i'm struggling to find a redeeming feature of the film if you like devito this is another classic devito kind of role but he's only a supporting actor and there for clichÃ© value
<START> this is the definitive movie version of hamlet branagh cuts nothing but there are no wasted moments
<START> there are probably more people afraid of the dentist than of let's say little monsters or scary looking dolls which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie really br br dr feinstone corbin bernsen has been a successful dentist for several years now but when he catches his wife cheating on him with the poolguy he snaps and he brings his anger and frustration to his work well give a mad dentist a drill and a mouth and you can probably guess what happens next br br as i said brilliant idea but not delivered as well as it should in particular the ending is a huge let down last note watch for mark ruffalo you can count on me eternal sunshine in this one br br 5 10
<START> although this was obviously a low budget production the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing one of walken's few musical roles to date he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well watch for the cartwheel also starring jason connery a great children's story and very likable characters
<START> this silly movie is really fun for the younger audiences its heros are a couple of dud detectives whose sophomoric attitudes lead them down some very silly roads chasing the big murder case you will see these detectives go to every length to solve the crime no nudity but lots of sexual implication slapstick silliness everything adolescents go for low budget but very entertaining definite cult classic potential
<START> this is a very intriguing short movie by david lynch and saying the name david lynch is probably enough for a lot of people this is your typical lynch short a blonde and a brunette are in a dark room the blonde has been crying the brunette is talking in a threatening way to the blonde and that's about it br br with a lot of silent moments but with the haunting music from angelo badalamenti there is a strange form of suspense this short feels a little like 'mulholland dr ' a movie i loved and therefore i liked this one as well it is probably especially for lynch fans but there is a chance you like this
<START> from the moment the film begins already there is a discrepancy as this film takes place on the borders of normandy and the middle east and is also an international film one would expect proper accents portrayed this is not done as the majority of the cast sound american also i find the acting to be rehearsed at best the story line a little difficult to follow from the beginning who is who otherwise the film is very accurate in costume and scenery if you want to see a movie to get a feel of what it was like in the past albeit the lack of accents then this movie is worth a rent if you're looking for a movie as epic as kingdom of heaven then look elsewhere
<START> while exploring some caves with his wife a doctor is bitten by a bat which causes some alarming side effects br br occasionally creepy atmosphere and some decent though under used makeup effects don't save this b horror flick from being a sub par tale of man becomes creature the bat people aka it lives by night suffers from its senseless story that's awkwardly plotted and lackluster in pacing the plot never seems to go anywhere much and the movie never offers an explanation for what happens or even a satisfying conclusion for it all the cast is fairly mediocre in their performances br br still i give the film some points for its haunting theme song and nice filming locations the makeup work of the late stan winston is pretty good too but it doesn't get much of a showcase here a missed opportunity for sure br br definitely one of the lesser man creature flicks out there br br 1 2 out of
<START> please make me forget please please this is the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to watch i consider the film an insult to my brain as well as my backside who both have suffered from me sitting and watching this film i have yet to see what damage it has caused my sight and my ability to complete sentences what a load of garbage and don't get me started about the acting someone please help me forget weird science come back everything is forgiven br br i am proud to give this film the first 1 here at imdb and i've voted for hundreds of films many of them c p but this is so bad i can't even believe it someone actually came up with the idea and thought it was worthy of becoming a film someone actually read the script and decided to produce the film someone read the script and auditioned for it someone saw the film and decided not to put it on a shelf to collect dust for eternity these are the questions i want answers to not the philosophical question about that tree in the woods and well you know
<START> name just says it all i watched this movie with my dad when it came out and having served in korea he had great admiration for the man the disappointing thing about this film is that it only concentrate on a short period of the man's life interestingly enough the man's entire life would have made such an epic bio pic that it is staggering to imagine the cost for production br br some posters elude to the flawed characteristics about the man which are cheap shots the theme of the movie duty honor country are not just mere words blathered from the lips of a high brassed officer it is the deep declaration of one man's total devotion to his country br br ironically peck being the liberal that he was garnered a better understanding of the man he does a great job showing the fearless general tempered with the humane side of the man
<START> in this little film we have some great characters but a very shallow plot it is actually nice to watch because singleton does a great job at presenting the esoteric conflicts and the interpersonal relationships this makes the viewer forget the nonexistent realism that this movie supposedly is for in fact what we have here is all the possible cliches and stereotypes put on celluloid in a rate higher than that of a soap definitely not a deep movie even if it wants to be but better than an average college movie
