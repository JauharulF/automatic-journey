<START> just got back from a free screening and i'm very glad i didn't pay to see this very sub par film the theater was full and the crowd was a mix of kids and adults it seemed like it was just the kids who were laughing at all the slap stick and fart jokes though good god they loved to hit these poor mice in the crotch a lot the movie is pretty juvenile unintelligent predictable and mostly annoying the characters just seem to be thrown together to fill in empty space and the relationships between them all seemed very forced with no charm at all br br visually the film is about average with nothing that really stands out they did a decent job of mimicking the clay look from wallace and gromit but other than that it's very forgettable imagery br br although i was really bored throughout the whole film i chuckled a couple times it's not an absolute failure but i most definitely would not want to watch it again if you're a parent with kids and you don't care that your kids see mindless cheap jokes then feel free to take them to see it but everyone else shouldn't waste their money
<START> wow a movie about nyc politics seemingly written by someone who has never set foot in nyc you know there's a problem when at one moment you expect the credits to roll and the movie continues on for another half hour the characters are boring john cusack's accent is laughable and the plotline teeters between boring and laughable a horrible movie
<START> finally got to see this classic tv movie on an unofficial disc recorded from an old vhs it is a classic piece of horror its a pity more of this neglected corner of horror in terms of official releases on dvd and vhs the tv horror movie recommended for all fans of the 70's tv movie much like trilogy of terror those interested should get the book on the subject by david deal television fright films of the 70's email me for a chance to see it its fabulous to see it again br br it does have it problems like many tv movies they have to be rather inventive in the effects dept and even at 70 mins it can seem to drag possibly we are all used to more modern editing but still great stuff and far better than many theatrical frights released today
<START> bollywood fans pretty much hold amitabh bachan's mard in high regard but i think it is very overrated manmohan desai collaborated before on movies like suhaag parvarish amar akbar anthony naseeb desh premee and coolie and i have seen all of them i liked so i had very high expectations before i watched mard and was bitterly disappointed my main gripe about mard is that it feels like amar akbar anthony part 2 maybe mr desai ran out of ideas after all he had been using that formula for years and years 1 first of all some members of the cast is repeated from aaa for instance the police inspector who brings up amar the muslim who brings up akbar nirupa roy and a few more 2 in aaa nirupa roy loses her eyesight in mard she loses her voice 3 in aaa there is the famous song shirdi wale sai baba well in mard we have amitabh singing maa sherawali having seen aaa for over 1000 times i noticed that straight away br br my other gripes are that some of the situations just seem ridiculous true manmohan desai made leave your brain at the door kind of movies but with mard i thought he went too far my last gripe is that compared to songs in previous manmohan desai movies i found the songs rather disappointing i know it has many fans that swear by it but i didn't like it one bit it actually pains me to write this review because i am such a huge fan and have loved his movies since i was a child
<START> i don't recall walking out of a movie theater except this once not only that but i was with 7 friends and we all wanted to go an uninteresting plot characters made of clay violence with no point i didn't care when the good guys died i didn't care when the bad guys got it the fantasy and magic was laid on thick as liver pudding and there was no coherency in short fine entertainment if you happen to be spending an eternity in hell
<START> ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel it's too easy so i'm going to challenge myself to acknowledge the positive aspects of little man first i'm impressed with the special effects it really did look like marlon wayans' head was attached to the body of a little person i never doubted it for a minute br br secondly i loved some of the unexpected cameos david alan grier played an annoying restaurant singer and his renditions of havin' my baby and movin' on up were priceless john witherspoon who coincidentally played grier's father in 1992's boomerang if you remember he coordinated the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket now plays vanessa's father in little man so that was fun br br beyond that this movie is about as believable as white chicks how dumb is it when even the doctor can't tell that it's a 40 year old man and not a baby he's got a full set of teeth how is it possible that no one seems to notice that it's not a baby little man is so bad that there's a rob schneider cameo and please if you're stupid enough to waste 8 on this movie at least do me a favor and do not bring your children this movie is way too sexual for small children lots of jokes and innuendo about sex going down eating out etc and i felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their kids to the screening i was forced to endure if you insist on seeing an idiotic film as least spare your children the pain and suffering
<START> this animation tv series is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works yes this is biology but they will never tell it is br br i truly think this is the best part of this stream of educational cartoons i do remember you can find little books and a plastic body in several parts skin skeleton and of course organs br br in the same stream you'll find il Ã©tait une fois l'homme which relate the human history from the big bang to the 20th century there is il Ã©tait une fois l'espace as well about the space and its exploration but that one is more a fiction than a description of the reality since it takes place in the future
<START> while i count myself as a fan of the babylon 5 television series the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there the pace of the gathering is slow the makeup somewhat inadequate and the plot confusing worse the characterization in the premiere episode is poor although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems i remember the gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series
<START> a few years ago i bought several 1 dvd's that contained two movies each one of them had three broadway girls an alternate title for the greeks had a word for them and this one happy go lovely it's basically a backstage musical comedy that takes place in scotland and concerns mistaken identity involving one of the dancers hitching a ride from a millionaire's limousine vera ellen is that dancer and wow what legs ceasar romero is her producer who takes a chance on her after the original leading lady leaves because he thinks she's dating the millionaire whose car i just mentioned and david niven is that rich guy who when looking for vera ellen is mistaken for a reporter who's supposed to interview her but gets stalled by romero what i've just mentioned may be confusing but mostly makes sense if you're willing to check your brain while watching this charmingly screwball comedy with wonderful musical numbers as performed by the exquisite ms vera ellen romero can be a bit frantic here but niven becomes hilariously bemused throughout the print i saw was actually pretty good considering its age and the fact that it's in public domain and vera ellen does pretty well with her lines since she's not really an actress so on that note i highly recommend happy go lovely for movie buffs who love old fashioned musical comedies
<START> the fourth in the dirty harry series this film features one of the most despicable ugliest unlikable profane disgusting females i have ever seen on film ray perkins played by audrie neenan she is the modern nasty low life version of the 1945 detour character ann savage br br her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much i never watched this film again until i acquired a profanity filter which shut her up and least some of her then i could enjoy the rest of the movie br br everywhere harry callahan clint eastwood goes violence immediately follows within minutes it happens so often it's almost laughable but it makes for a fast moving entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated one by one br br this is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base instincts and connects sad to say most of us like to see these dirtballs get it in the end and who does it better than dirty harry
<START> this type of plot really does have a lot of potential but it was butchered here honestly i sensed the cheese element in the beginning but i thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing whoa i was wrong so mad scientist makes a monster wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them but of course they escape after that it's really bad i should've counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage but i most likely would have lost count br br pan down to the blood dripping from severed leg to show us how the shark man finds the folks i hate being spoon fed every aspect of a horror film br br oh and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark man and trudging around a jungle esqe island there's nothing more cheerful than a middle aged man reciting shakespeare br br this is one where you'll find yourself rooting for the monster if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick
<START> why would anyone want to see this if this was a film posted on youtube by a teenager i might have applauded the teen in doing so much with his mommy's video camera i might have also congratulated his family and friends for doing a good job acting sadly it was made by a very experienced film maker and these were apparently professional actors making this a very very sad film sad and very pathetic actually as i said it has a definite made directly to video look about it it also has narration and acting that just scream unprofessionals how could this be the film is filled with lots of corpses and blood normally this would turn me off completely as i hate ultra violent films and don't like seeing all that gore however given that none of it is that realistic it's bearable however i should warn you that there are a few scenes that are still pretty disturbing for example the scene with the kid throwing a radio into a lady's tub and watching her naked and frying is pretty bad there are also scenes where you can hear the thought of psychos as they fantasize about killing women with a level of misogyny that is pretty awful the people who wrote this are pretty sick like killing women is meant to be for our entertainment br br after a bunch of senseless murders the film goes to a dining room table around which are a bunch of goof balls wearing black hoods without eye holes they are talking with pride about all the murders they have committed and chant it's all very funny though i am not sure that was the scene's purpose br br then the film talks about various sex crimes and killings and even vampirism and cannibalism why i don't know perhaps because they people made this got off on this sort of crap and once again you see and hear the thoughts and actions of a creepy german looking man as he tracks down people and kills them br br by the way considering the film used what i must assume are professional actors i wondered why so many people were chosen who were clearly germans while they tried to act like americans and the film was supposed to be in california the accents are strong perhaps german audiences watched this and marveled at how realistic the acting was but to any american it's obvious these folks ain't their fellow americans considering that there really was a zodiac killer who was never captured i do wonder why anyone would want to make a fan film of sorts for the sick menace i mean was this film meant as a snuff film for pervs i just can't see anyone else wanting to see this or enjoying it in fact i wonder what would motivate anyone to make such a stupid and offensive film worthless and deserving to be in imdb's bottom 100 list
<START> it is an extremely difficult film to watch particularly as it targets the innermost core of all of our lives but ultimately it is a very beautiful and deeply moving film any person who finds it cynical i have to say that they must have greatly missed the point of the film's entire message for those who actually watch the film they will see that the way the issues are dealt with is absolutely necessary and the outcome is ultimately uplifting sure it's very hard to watch a difficult subject matter and even brutal yet it's extremely relevant to society and everybody it shows the peak of what world cinema is doing at the moment i will not restrict that term to just france and everyone should try to see it i will say that it is best to go in with a clear head without being swayed by conflicting views and just let the film work for you
<START> the house that dripped blood is the third in a series of seven amicus horror anthologies if the monster club is included as part of the series this would make eight movies although that movie is very different from the others br br i look upon the amicus anthologies with great memories as i used to love them when i was in my teens my feelings for them today are just as strong br br i spent many years trying to track down this movie the synopses of the stories was so appealing that i went as far as paying a substantial amount for it when i eventually found a copy as great as though the movie is i did feel a sense of disappointment when i finally saw it it wasn't quite as good as i was led to believe whilst better than its two predecessors it's nowhere near as good as its four successors as i shall demonstrate br br the linking story sees john bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in a mysterious old house his journey begins at the local police station where he learns the stories of previous occupants the linking story later sees him visiting the estate agent who sold the house whilst this linking story seems enticing on paper it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the weakest of any amicus anthology i couldn't help but get the feeling that john bennett is a poor man's version of donald pleasance or ian hendry i would much rather have seen one of the two aforementioned actors in his role we could have even had both here one as the police inspector and another as the estate agent they could and i believe would have brought this weak element of the movie to life much better br br the movie contains four stories each of which focuses on an inhabitant of the house br br the first story sees denholm elliott as a writer of crime stories he is absorbed into an exciting story about a strangler even going as far as drawing a sketch to aid his writing soon after he begins seeing visions of his own creation some excellent direction by peter duffell particularly with the choice of camera angles helps to detract from the restrained script elliott's performance is superb as the tormented writer and he also helps to elevate the story the story ends with a semi twist but i couldn't help get the sense of a script which didn't allow it to live up to its potential br br the second story sees peter cushing move into the house he is a lonely man who is still pining for a beautiful young woman who once jilted him and who he keeps a picture of cushing's performance really brings this emotionally moving story to life he is helped by the director who chooses to include continual focus on cushing's loneliness this is taken further with a great hallucination scene that helps us to see inside cushing's mind anyway cushing sees a figure at a nearby wax museum that looks just like his girl naturally his obsession grows but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing twist at the end joss ackland plays cushing's rival but his performance is massively overshadowed by the late great peter cushing br br the third story and easily the best sees christopher lee my favourite horror actor of all time move into the house with his daughter mr lee gives one his perfect ice cold performances here he shows no love or attention for his daughter at all he even brings in a school governess to educate her the governess played by nyree dawn porter in another of her superb performances tries to find out what is wrong without giving too much away i can reveal that witchcraft plays a role christopher lee's presence is truly electrifying in every scene he's in chloe franks deserves special recognition for her massively underrated performance as the little girl who is easily the creepiest character in the whole movie the movie is worth seeing even for the sake of seeing just this one story br br the final story is played almost entirely for laughs but it certainly does entertain and that's what matters jon pertwee plays a horror movie actor who moves into the house he is very dissatisfied at the approach his producers take to movies seeing everything as cheap and fake particularly the costumes so he decides to buy an authentic cloak for his latest vampire role geoffrey bayldon has an excellent cameo as a dealer who sells pertwee an ancient cloak when pertwee puts the cloak on he starts developing fangs and basically transforming into a vampire pertwee's performance has to be seen to be believed it truly is hilarious ingrid pitt is also in this story but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much larger br br the linking story finishes with a loose connection to the final story this is particularly fitting since the inspector was looking for pertwee and naturally decides to visit the house the rest you'll be able to work out for yourself as weak as the linking story is it does have a decent if somewhat unintentionally comical ending br br i'm convinced that the blame for the shortcomings in what should have been a truly magnificent movie doesn't lie with peter duffell the director who really does his best with what he's got i think the script was just too restrained and lacking the ambition that can be found in the four later movies br br overall the house that dripped blood despite its flaws is a must see for fans of the amicus anthologies fans of other amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies if my summary provides the movie with enough appeal in your eyes check it out you'll enjoy it
<START> hey now i can't claim to have seen all of the films of jesse jesus franco and there sure seem to be a lot of them but this is one of the better and weirder of the lot that i have seen i'd say most likely he was in his prime back in the late sixties early seventies and anything lately has been a bit too strange for me and it takes a lot for me to declare that anyway this is like one big bad dream where parts of it seem to come true at various points this woman is an actress or something performs in some theater in berlin where acts of fake torture are performed for an appreciative audience and she seems to have this problem with dreaming the catch to what's real and what's not in this movie is apparently the real stuff is in sharp focus and the dream stuff isn't she seems to exist in a state of deja vu i won't say this makes a whole lot of sense but it is pretty wild and weird and entertaining shots of berlin make it seem like a lonely and creepy place so that adds to the atmosphere the ending is extremely abrupt though the film just ends and the tape went black i guess no need to let you know it was over at that point my copy was from the anchor bay euro trash collection and i say give me more euro trash i can't get enough of that crap but it's good crap
<START> fever pitch is a sweet and charming addition to the small genre of sports romances as date movies or movies a son could be willing to go to with his mother though the guys in the audience got noticeably restless during the romantic scenes br br i have lived through a milder version of such a story as my first exposure to baseball was dating my husband the spring after the mets first world series win and then i watched the mets clinch their next one because i was the one still up in the wee hours with our two little sons who have grown up to teach me more about baseball through our local neighborhood national league team's other heartbreaking failures to win it again and it was me who took our older son to his only fenway park game as i caught a bit of red sox fever as a graduate student in boston br br so compared to reality the script believably creates two people with actual jobs it is particularly impressive that drew barrymore's character is a substantive workaholic who has anti barbie skills though she pretty much only visits with her three bland girlfriends during gym workouts that allow for much jiggling and the minor side stories with her parents don't completely work br br it is even set up credibly how she meets jimmy fallon's math teacher and how she falls for his winter guy though it's surprising that his red sox paraphernalia filled apartment didn't tip her off to his jekyll and hyde summer guy their relationship crisis during the baseball season is also played out in a refreshingly grown up way from efforts at compromise to her frank challenges to him centered around that they are both facing thirty and single fallon surprisingly rises to his character's gradual emotional maturity br br while the ending borrows heavily from o henry the script writers did a yeoman job of quickly incorporating the sox's incredible 2004 season into a revised story line with lots of cooperation from the red sox organization for filming at the stadium br br the script goes out of its way to explain why fallon doesn't have a boston accent as an immigrant from new jersey but that doesn't explain why his motley friends don't the most authentic sounding boston sounds come from most of his summer family of other season ticket holders who kindly kibitz the basics of sox lore to neophyte barrymore and any such audience members br br the song selection includes many red sox fans' favorites from the opening notes of the classic dirty water though most are held to be heard over the closing credits as if you are listening to local radio and are worth sitting through to hear
<START> after hearing raves about this movie for years i finally decided to rent it and watch let me start by saying that i'm glad that the rental was free from the local library this move was slow boring unrealistic and the plot made no sense after 2 hours i was ready to nuke that backwater texas town and put the group of those characters out of their misery i realize that taste is subjective but believe me i just do not understand all of the hype that i have heard about this movie dallas provided as good a detail of the life in texas as this movie rent it only if you want to understand how movie studios can pay enough money to reviewers to convince the general public that a bad movie is good
<START> i'm far from a sylvester stallone fan and i guess the only time i really appreciated his appearance was in the french movie taxi 3 which is an almost inexistent small role and yet i must admit that this movie was actually not that bad even though i feared the worst br br when gabe stallone fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a 4000 feet high mountain top he can't possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger for almost a year he doesn't set a food in the reserve but than he returns soon after he's back they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm at least that's what the rangers believe in reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed the cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them br br this is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever but in its genre it's an enjoyable one i especially enjoyed john lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers i know him best from the tv series 3rd rock from the sun but i enjoyed his performance in this movie as well overall the acting is ok it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one liners but it also offered a very nice decor this movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment i loved the snowy mountains and valleys the mountain rivers and the forests perhaps that's why i give this movie a score higher than what i normally give to an action adventure movie of this kind i give it a 6 5 10 if you don't expect too much this is an enjoyable movie
<START> this movie offers nothing but the dumbest conversations possible as a matter of fact i most probably could not have imagined how meaningless a film how synthetic the dialogs could be until an hour ago but then again i saw this video in a movie that does not depend on a powerful script one expects to see at least good acting and tasty conversations and even some humor maybe yet this movie lacks them all you heard me it lacks them all there is not a single point i like about this movie none i hate it i'm sure anyone will do so too the name is intended to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and stuff yet it fails even at the nudity i don't know how but i beared to watch this thing for an hour or so and i definitely recommend you don't do so worst movie i've seen in my entire life if someone offers you to watch it ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave your liiiiiiiiife
<START> jack black's character tim dingman the dreamer in envy finds wealth and success in the idea of a aerosol spray vapoorize that when sprayed on doggie dung makes the poo disappear into thin air br br for a moment i was hoping that vapoorize was a real product so that i could spray it on this stinker of a movie and make it disappear into thin air as well br br although envy is not the worst movie that i have seen in the past 12 months that honor goes to the cat in the hat it does get the honor of a close second br br not funny not sad not anything a real stinkeroo br br a 0 2 out of 10
