<START> i thoroughly enjoyed a man called horse when it was released in 1970 but return played like a typical sequel everything about it budget script plot casting and acting was inferior to the original gale sondergaard as elk woman an elder of the yellow hand tribe looks nothing like an indian and neither do half of the other indians who were played by italians mexicans and latinos with cheap wigs and the old guy who played the chief acted more like a fat old squaw than a fierce leader of warriors he even used the bow like a woman finally richard harris who did such a superb job in the original seems to be coasting this time around i guess he couldn't resist the easy paycheck he got for reprising his role as horse br br to be fair there are some interesting moments in the movie such as horse's undergoing a painful purification ritual to find his vision and rally the yellow hands against their indian enemies and white oppressors but on the whole return is uneven boring corny and predictable just like most sequels
<START> remade today this film would be a very creepy very disturbing dark comedy stalking obsession and a web of lies and manipulations are given a 1948 gloss of aren't they cute harmlessness drake plays the stalker an unabashed user of people alternately pathetic and manipulative grant plays the stalking victim alternately angry and oblivious br br vastly disturbing i haven't been able to look at classic romances with the same suspension of disbelief since br br
<START> wow this movie was absolutely brilliant i really don't know why everyone says it has a slow pace i thought the pace was perfect the movie is about michael sullivan played by tom hanks with perfection who is a sort of hit man killer working for john rooney paul newman he disslikes this job but does it because rooney payed for his house and helps him financially he had nothing and mr rooney gave him everything but his children are unaware that this is his job and when one witnesses a cold blooded murder by him he is placed in an awkward position and when an atrocity occurs he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge they rob abanks and much more and build a bond they're the perfect team hanks does a great job as always as well as jude law who plays his creepy role to perfection this drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and greatly shows how the 1930s were
<START> who done it contains many surefire laughs and gags it is not only one of the best stooges films with shemp it is one of the finest short comedies columbia produced director bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the stooges but when curly howard suffered a career ending stroke it was tailored for the columbia comedy team of schilling and lane their version was released as pardon my terror it obviously was too good for the stooges to pass up and it was finally filmed by the stooges at the end of 1947 br br old man goodrich calls ace detectives shemp larry and moe out of fear that he will be murdered when they arrive at his home goodrich has disappeared and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the stooges will they find goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice br br shemp is particularly funny in this film his reactions after being given a mickey by christine mcintyre are superb he gives his trademark sound eeeb eeeb eeeb and miss mcintyre is noticeably trying not to laugh other funny scenes the close up of moe's mug looking through the camera lens and the in the dark fight with all cast members involved br br nikko the goon played by duke york is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a stooges film with his kinked hair he could almost pass for a stooge if he didn't tower over everyone else who done it is a gem among the stooges films with shemp even die hard curly fans will enjoy this one a true stooge classic 9 out of 10
<START> one of the best musicals ever made this is an example of where the producers and director were not afraid to pick actors for their talent rather than for what people might expect the lighting and set are unique giving it a very interesting effect this has a special name that i cannot think of the dialog is also unique in that no contractions are used the movie is well paced beautifully acted and interesting from start to finish a real joy is the music such an array of first rate songs from beginning to end that are perfectly performed and orchestrated also the music is very original and very memorable and i think superior to many musicals from the thirties through the sixties it certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals that might have only two or three not bad for a director with no experience in this type of movie another quality is that it is fresh each time one sees it
<START> this movie gets it right as a former usaf aviation cadet i can tell you this movie has it all the tedium of the application process the waiting for word the joy of acceptance the worry about making it through the course the sorrow of watching one's buddies perhaps the best of them wash out the anguish of paying the ultimate price the death of fllow student airmen the glory of graduation always the flying the flying the flying many are called but few are chosen we did for pay what we would have eagerly paid to do
<START> saw it as critic at the 49 internationales filmfestival mannheim heidelberg br br as every film that i know and zelenka is involved in it is simply genious br br i love his way of combining different stories and characters br br his knoflikari and the truly magic powers part of regina zieglers erotic tales iv are definitely worth being checked out go and get it folks
<START> i found this on the shelf while housesitting and bored how can people possibly give this a 10 it's not just that it's supposed to be a feel good redemption film i think because it doesn't work on that level either weak plot bad dialogue terrible acting there's just nothing there harvey keitel is decent but has nothing to work with and bridget fonda and especially johnathon schaech are just terrible the plot progression especially the relationship between byron and ashley makes no sense it seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow it's only an hour and a half but that's 90 minutes of your life you'll never get back
<START> beverly garland was born in the wrong time she was an actress ahead of her time bringing power and grace to even such lame flicks as the corman films she starred in in gunslinger she's the town sheriff's wife he gets offed so she takes over his job to pursue his killers she's better than the material she's working with by far the movie is gray stilted and mostly boring there's some unintentional humor with the tire tracks everywhere people running behind one building to emerge suddenly in front of another i've heard of false fronts but this is ridiculous and the truly stupid plot line of the newly widowed sheriff falling in love with the guy hired to kill her even if she hadn't loved her husband it had only been something like a week or two since he'd died and she ends up shooting the guy to death in the end anyway no luck with men this one br br the villain of the piece is another woman the saloon owner she's scheming to buy up a bunch of land just in case the railroad goes through and makes her rich her plan of action if it doesn't is pretty lame she'll just steal as much from the town as she can and skedaddle hell it's just her and her hired gun at the end against an entire town are you telling me these people aren't armed look what happened in real towns of the old west when bank robbers came in to rob the bank then were cut down in a hail of bullets by the armed and dangerous town folk br br there'a a lot of pointless talking and riding around interspersed with a few lame shoot outs the ending is as grim as usual in a corman flick although thank goodness it lacks the moral proselytizing at the end that was in it conquered the world the sheriff turns over her badge to sam bass and rides off into the sunset although the movie was so gray that you never saw the sun
<START> i finally saw this film tonight after renting it at blockbuster vhs i have to agree that it is wildly original yes maybe the characters were not fully realized but it isn't one of those movies rather we are treated to the director's eye his vision of what the story is about and it does not stop and to be honest i didn't want it to i do believe that sabu had to have influenced the director's of 'lock stock two smoking barrels' and 'run lola run' but i absolutely loved the way the three leads see the beautiful woman on the street to distract them momentarily i really need to see this director's other work because this film really intrigued me if you want insight culture sturm und drang go somewhere else if you want a laugh camera movement and criminal hilarity look here
<START> gus van sant has made some excellent films i truly am a fan br br however i can't help but feel that the cerebral edge of tom robbins book even cowgirls get the blues is lost in translation to the big screen alone tom robbins and gus van sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent ultimately though this one just didn't work br br it wasn't that the characters weren't well developed or the plot and content didn't come alive it's just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this we're taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and or the best and it adds to the overall roller coaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the author's precision movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion roller coaster detracting from the overall experience this is what i believe happened here br br i suggest reading the book
<START> same old same old about che it completely ignored the really interesting facts of che's true character sodeberg redid the same boring narrative of che the silly seductive tale of an argentinean rich boy who was so shocked by poverty he became a robin hood fighting alongside the poor until eventually he was murdered by the cia yeah yeah heard it all before boring and untrue the reality of che guevara is very different and far more explosive the facts show that he was a totalitarian with a messiah streak who openly wanted to impose maoist tyranny on the world he was so fanatical that at the hottest moment in the cold war he even begged the soviet union to nuke new york washington or los angeles and bring about the end of the world che urged khrushchev to launch a nuclear strike against us cities for the rest of his life he declared that if his finger had been on the button he would have pushed it when khrushchev backed down and literally saved the world che was furious at the betrayal if che's recommendations had been followed you would not be reading this review now how a homicidal maniac became a pop icon would have made a much more interesting film incredible that no filmmaker has been daring enough to show the real side of che and his posthumous media transformation that would make an oscar winning film i thought making independent film meant taking real risks and being groundbraking they only stick to safe counterculture themes to wit che cool wall street bad republican nazi bush ex hitler nra is worse than kgb christians are fanatics and stupid etc ad nauseum oooh how daring how mind blowing tres anti mainstream and edgy i wish they would have some real cojones and tackle the independent film oligarchy that would be truly daring
<START> the lady in question 1999 starring gene wilder is a well acted mystery drama that reminds me of the old black and white raymond burr perry mason series both perry and cash kept me guessing right up to the end there were many suspects with a motive for the murder but i had no idea which character it would be br br gene wilder has a special charming wit about him even in his facial expressions and vocal inflections which make him perfect for the part the portions of the movie which portrayed actors acting was done very well i'm sure this is an additional challenge for the cast to pull off i am not surprised to see that he did some of the writing for the movie even his singing was a delight i like him in this role more than his former sillier roles like the young frankenstein and willy wonka i am hoping a e will continue this series they ought to call it something like the a e gene wilder mysteries br br the music fit the period i enjoyed the cool live combo and the swing tunes i was a little unclear at the beginning whether we were seeing a flashback or whether the action was taking place in that time period and i do not agree that the inclusion of profanity is necessary to the flow of the script to me that always distracts br br overall my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed this second in a well crafted start in what we hope will be many others just like one of our other favorites raymond burr's perry mason
<START> i just watched this on turner classic movies last night for the first time ever seeing it and i loved it i like lots of the older films especially because of the absence of all the filthy language and excessive violence nudity and sex in most of today's films i also think they were made much better in many but not all cases jimmy stewart is a special favorite of mine i just thought this movie was a lot of fun to watch and i enjoyed it thoroughly if you feel the same way about the older films i don't think you can go wrong with this one i believe you've got mail is a remake even though slightly different and also a very enjoyable film of this film for a relaxing evening with a movie you don't have to be ashamed of if your kids or anyone walks in on your viewing get this or catch it on one of the classic movie channels
<START> i have seen the film a few days back on a video tape and even though it was hard to swallow it at one take because of its length and story i liked it very much i was impressed first by the script and then by the realization of this script the film takes you on a ride but that is not an easy joyful ride it goes through time and different political regimes and shows the influence of them to ordinary people's lives what i loved was the inner logic the film followed logic which just like logic in life was rather illogical and confusing at times but in the end when i thought about it all the events and twists made sense it makes no sense though to try to re tell the story as it spreads in more than 50 years of time i also liked very much nikita mikhalkov's character aleksei and the way he played it as some critics would saw with restless abandon what i didn't like about it was that i think he later played characters that remind me of aleksei in films like cruel romance zhestokij romans which i actually love and to some extent in the insulted and the injured unizhennye i oskorblyonnye sibiriada shows i think what a great film maker andrei konchalovski was before he went to hollywood and made forgettable films like tango and cash and less forgettable like runaway train i would prefer kurochka ryaba to them
<START> i didn't have huge expectations for this film when renting it for 1 at the video store but the box at least showed a little promise with its killer cut of more gore more sex can't go wrong there well needless to say the box is a fraud how in the hades did actors and actresses of this caliber sign on for a film this low br br it all opens with a drunken college girl walking out of a frat house or some other building like that and saying some useless crap to her boyfriend as a camera on a bad steadicam follows her then she gets chased by some dude in a clear plastic mask and grabbed by another they slit her wrists for no real reason and you can see when they cut her that someone drew the cuts with what looks like a crayon br br from there repeat the same theme of the girl getting chased killed unbrutally by two guys for about 84 more minutes add in one tit shot that is soul survivors br br i wouldn't have had a problem with this film had the box not frauded me into renting the flick if i rent a bad film that claims to have more violence and sex i want more violence and sex one full frontal shot in 85 minutes from a chick who is clearly androginous and gore that would not scare a child does not cut it if this is the killer cut what is the theatrical cut of course i doubt this garbage was actually put into theaters in the first place shame on the actors in this film i could see them making their screen debuts in here because they have not done anything before but they were all established before this was released i don't know if it was filmed before they had all been established and the studio sat on the film until they were semi big names or not but what i want to know is they really spent 14 million on this film
<START> i would like to say that curiosity got the best of me if only i saw a trailer i'd be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie i could have saved myself the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life and about twenty dollars this movie was a disaster waiting to happen and it is an embarrassment to hollywood br br the movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality for example this kid's remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood and even enters this house it's even covered with clothes is it not rational to believe that a remote can no longer transmit a signal under those circumstances hollywood obviously did not believe so common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite i doubt the race car could even have reached the street let alone a house across the street another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess why is it in all these movies these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eight year old the kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists please there's more reality in the matrix also the leader puts down his real pistol and accidentally picks up a plastic pistol apparently he could not tell the difference even with a glove on one should be able to do that just because they look the same does not mean anything there is other senses then sight the traps are unrealistic as well if any one of them actually worked the criminals would be dead but hollywood intends for us to laugh at the funny results of the traps i did not laugh i sighed and rolled my eyes br br but i recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie the movie they saw will seem like citizen kane compared to this one otherwise skip this one for the sake of your pride home alone 3 also raises a question we all know alex d linz stars in the movie but did he write it as well
<START> cafe lumiere is a beautifully photographed nullity unacquainted with the work of the director i am well acquainted with the filmmaker he is supposedly paying tribute to ozu yasujiro while not even approaching ozu in greatness hou has communicated nothing of ozu's depth of emotion and concentration on meaning within a closed space one of the things he misses entirely is ozu's attention to character we are not even introduced by hou to his lead character a perfect blank page there are no medium or close shots of his people one of the dvd extras offers interviews with the actors and gives us precisely what hou doesn't a good look at their faces br br there was a great spanish film by bardem called nunca pasa nada which translates to something like nothing ever happens that would be a far better title to this pointless exercise all through the film we are given clues about an obscure taiwanese composer some of whose work we hear on the soundtrack but the clues like everything else add up to nothing unless you're a trainspotter this film has nothing to recommend it
<START> when thinking of the revelation that the main character in bubble comes to at films end i am reminded of last years machinist with christian bale the only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters br br an understated yet entirely realistic portrayal of small town life the title is cause for contemplation perhaps we the audience are the ones in the bubble as we are given no payoffs in the films slim 90 minute running time audience reactions were often smug and judgmental clearly indicating how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves these characters are the ones people refer to as those that put george w back in office for a second term br br it's sobering to consider how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when watching an audience jump to their feet for the exit as soon as the credits role this film has it's merits and is deserving of consideration for the things it doesn't say outright
<START> this film was slow but tedious and the acting often drifted into the land of ham redgrave's character was unappealing as the 60 something woman trying to compete with thurman's 20 something for the love of fox's character why is beyond me the title of the movie should have been shallow people on the lake the actors played like they were in a rehearsal a dreadfully predictable ending to boot i can't believe this is on this website as a comedy
