<START> who would think andy griffith's helen crump aneta corsaut had a steve mcqueen movie in her past but that is only one of several weird and wonderful things about the ultimate 1950s teenagers battle creatures movie which might best be described as rebel without a cause meets god knows what from outer space the rebel is steven mcqueen who would shortly decide that steve sounded less prissy a good boy with just enough wild to be interesting the very wholesome yet understanding girlfriend is the aforementioned aneta corsaut it was bad enough when their date was disrupted by teenage hot rodders but they are considerably more nonplussed when they encounter a gelatinous man eating what is it that rides down to earth on its own hotrod meteor and begins gobbling up townfolk right and left but will the grown ups believe them of course not what do they know they're just kids br br the movie is teeny bopper at its teeny bopping best the actors take the rather pretentious script very seriously with many a soulful look into each other eyes and the adult supporting cast probably says kids very third sentence or so but the real pleasure of the film its creature which is well imagined well executed and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense and although clearly on the cheap side check out those miniature sets guys the blob is actually a fairly well made film and there's that catchy little theme song thrown in for good measure the 40 plus crowd myself included will enjoy the movie as nostalgia but that won't prevent them from hooting right along with the younger set at its whole milk and white bread 1950s sensibility and the film would be a great choice for either family movie night or a more sophisticated grown ups only get together make plenty of jello cubes for movie snacking gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
<START> a thin story with many fine shots eyecatchers here are the three ladies from the d r e a m team and to a lesser extent the guy accompanying them traci lords convincingly acts out the female half of an evil business couple intending to poison the world with antrax original in this movie is the bra bomb put on a captured member of the d r e a m team of course she is rescued by a co member three seconds before explosion although clearly lent from james bond's 'goldfinger' and 'you only live twice' such a climax always works well all in all a nice watch james bond replaced here by three charlie's angels
<START> keenan ivory wayans is probably one of the worst directors i swear he has no real knowledge on how to make films he has made one brilliant film and that is scary movie scary movie 2 was ok too but everything else keenan has made are real disasters avoid such titles like don't be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood i know what a title obviously this film too just anything that has keenans name in the credits br br it was an hour and a half on stupid nonsense that never made me laugh just trust me on this maybe women might like this film a little because of some of things that happen but on a whole this film will never be liked by anyone with a good taste in films 1 10 j d seaton
<START> audiard made here a very interesting movie it begins with the description of an almost deaf young woman in its working universe as a secretary she is ignored frustrated rejected hiring an intern as an assistant appears to be a way for her to find someone in her life but the guy is just coming out from jail their both being rejected by the society reunites them progressively characters'description is profund goes into details both start to help each other for she can read on lips which reveals itself to be very useful for him she will progressively evolve far from what she was at first br br it's beautifully filmed the whole is very convincing even if it turns into a film noir at the end gesture is in particular beautifully observed in audiard's filming emmanuelle devos should be nominated at the best actess cesar awards for her magistral play action towards the end of the film prevents it from being a simple etude de moeurs it's actually surprisingly entertaining 8 10
<START> this movie has a lot of comedy not dark and gordon liu shines in this one he displays his comical side and it was really weird seeing him get beat up his training is unorthodox and who would've thought knot tying could be so deadly lots of great stunts and choreography very creative br br add johnny wang in the mix and you've got an awesome final showdown don't mess with manchu thugs they're ruthless
<START> the dehumanising effect of war is a much studied subject in the movies as is the equally dehumanising but potentially life saving dehumanising effect of military training joel schumacher's 'tigerland' follows the standard template we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained typically as here vietnam but 'tigerland' has an interesting take by centring its account on a cocky dissident named bozz played outstandingly well by colin farrell who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity around this character a taught gripping plot has been constructed and it's also a plus that the action never leaves america whereas stanley kubrick's 'full metal jacket' to name just one other film of a similar type lost focus once the action shifted to asia although this is not a film of staggering originality it's supremely well done and captivating viewing throughout the best film from this director that i've seen and among the very best of its genre
<START> the screaming skull 1 outta 5 stars this movie boasts some pretty cool opening credits an offscreen narrator warning that movie patrons will be offered a free burial if they die of fright watching this movie a scary shot of a skull emerging from a placid pool and the ubiquitous scary music but sadly the movie is all downhill from there a widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion admonishing his servants and friends that the new mrs has a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy in her past well in no time at all she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can her husband assures her that it's all merely in her mind and well you can probably see where this all is going you will have figured out what's going on long before our hapless heroine because you have probably seen the exact same plot in hundreds of other movies and tv shows and done better too to add to the movie's myriad transgressions most cuts of this movie on numerous cheap dvd compilations seem to be missing a few key scenes you see the heroine slowly walking towards the window she goes to open it you know she is going to see something scary and then suddenly the scene cuts to her sobbing in her husband's arms so what did she see i guess we'll never know
<START> this peabody award winning episode is one of the highlights of the 1st season where a holodeck malfunction traps captain picard beverly data and a starfleet historian named waylan within a 1930's san francisco setting this episode is an homage to raymond chandler's maltese falcon where patrick stewart assumes the humphrey bogart role complete with fedora and trenchcoat the office itself is almost an exact replica of the one featured in bogey's maltese falcon br br this episode also briefly introduces us to a mysterious insect race called the jarada that communicate with mostly a high pitched buzzing sound communication with this alien race is difficult and it is up to picard to communicate with this race in their native tongue so that negotiations and diplomacy can finally begin the best part of this episode though is the appearance of the famous hollywood b actor lawrence tierney in the role of the gangster cyrus redblock he was such a handsome man back in the 1940's oh well
<START> this is a film that makes you say 2 things 1 i can do much better than this acting writing and directing 2 this is so bad i must leave a review and warn others br br looks as if it was shot with my flip video i have too believe my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me i have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this film one of the worst 3 movies i have ever seen hopefully the writers and director leave the business not even talented enough to do commercials
<START> the early to mid 90s were a high point in my opinion for the historical drama last of the mohicans braveheart rob roy all portrayed a distinctive passion and intensity in their respective time periods br br rob roy was a unique and intriguing taste of a time and place rarely represented by film it really has everything interesting story great acting remarkable dialog and breathtaking scenery i was particularly impressed by the apparently genuine dialog i can imagine this is how early 18th century people spoke and behaved br br something else that surprised me was the vulgarity expressed by the characters i found it to be more repulsive and shocking albeit often more subtle than most found in films set in modern times the movie had a very racy and sexually charged edge to it that was unique and most likely very realistic in the context of the era br br the pace was very tight with hardly a dull moment there was much intrigue and political subplots that complicated things a bit but yet did not detract from the main storyline br br the action was also very well done and gripping something that i will forever find remarkable is that during the highlight action piece in the film there is no soundtrack whatsoever it makes for a very tense exciting sequence since we have no musical cue as to the direction and resolution of the scene br br rob roy will always remain high on my list of favorite films i would recommend it to all
<START> i guess its possible that i've seen worse movies but this one is a real stinker the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching he's capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together br br angie harmon playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into who's behind the assassination of the president truly butchered the role there was no chemistry with gooding her demeanor was flat and wooden and the 5 inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the b list br br and what was cuba gooding thinking he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances but this was far beneath what we've come to expect from him br br poor james woods and burt reynolds poor poor poor poor poor
<START> there are some great philosophical questions what is the purpose of life what happens when we die and why do they make movies this bad the premise is absurd thre acting is one dimensional the special effects are overdone and the movie is one unending gun battle among some of the lousiest shots hollywood ever produced but then if they had been good shots everybody would have been dead in the first five minutes and there would be no movie too bad it didn't happen that way tempted to turn it off several times i stuck with it to see just how bad it could get glad i did because spoiler the last line is the crowning stupidity of the whole dopey dismal scenario it is not even worthy of second feature status at a third rate drive in in off season apart from the general awfulness of the film i worry deeply about its impact on young audiences the americans crank out crap like this and then wonder why events like columbine happen this is truly banal cinema on a brobdingnagian scale
<START> satan's little helper is one of the better b horror movies i have seen when i say better i mean the story the film hatches a new plot something that's not so clichÃ© in the horror genre something fresh but there are also some ridiculous questions that come along with it questions you will be asking yourself throughout the movie br br the film first caught my attention while i was cruising the horror section in hmv i was tired of all the so called terrifiying hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different the cover art for satan's little helper immediately caught my attention as you can see the image draws you in it's chilling i knew it was a straight to dvd release but i took a chance i mean i just seen boogey man the night before so it couldn't get any worse after i watched the movie i was semi satisfied i loved the plot of the movie it was really creepy how the killer was pretending to be the little boys friend so he could kill in some sick deranged way he actually thought he and the little boy would become partners a duo of terror it was a great idea to set the film on halloween night this way no one would think anything of a masked man beside a little kid they would simply think he was his guardian but this is also where the plot holes begin to surface br br if your son came home with a friend he met trick or treating that's fine you wouldn't think anything of it if he was 9 or round about the same age as him if however he appeared with a strange man in a mask you would be startled and protective of your child you would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself you would ask why he is with your son he doesn't know him you would tell him to please leave he isn't a family friend he's a stranger now we're supposed to teach our child not to talk to strangers in this case the mum is completely fine with it huh they never seem to think it's a tad odd that the man doesn't speak at all gruanted they think it's the daughters boyfriend but after 10 minutes of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why he's not saying a word br br the film goes down hill from there the thing that got me the most was all the mum said was do you want some cider i can't count how many times she says this in the movie it's like oh you're dying we have cider though it's all good the movie started promising and failed to deliver it was more of a horror comedy and even as that it fails to deliver i guess you could call it a dud flop etc br br the best thing about the movie is the cover art though something tells me that's not worth the 12 dollars
<START> this movie has such inexorable b class cheapness to all its scenes effects etc as to make you think they spent 80 of their budget on connery it's like watching some wing commander stuff after star wars quite apart from content br br story can be described in one word flat and oh my god i can't remember a villain so uninteresting since long long ago we're given neither a reason he's so wicked an inborn defect we're lead to think nor any real convincedness or flair to his wickedness br br if you're out for connery rather go rent hunting forrester'
<START> after you see vertigo then watch bell book and candle made within months of each other br br my second favorite kim novak film with picnic coming in as third br br all three performances are great vertigo being the best of all br br they came to my nowhere kansas prairie town near by at salina kansas in the 50s to film picnic br br bell book and candle's musical score i believe is one of alex north's perfect for this bit of comedy br br after vertigo stewart and novak did this comedy how amusing to note the dramatic contrast br br worth your time if you like kim novak the greta garbo of my youth
<START> honestly i am not even joking when i say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen this film dosen't have a single ounce of originality in its flimsy dialog or its blatantly plagiarized story line i can not even begin to count the number of things in this film that are obviously ripped off from the omen and other movies like it for example the nanny lucy in this film is actually one of the devil's minions sent to guide and protect the spawn of satan does this sound a lot like mrs baylock to anyone else another thing is that the orphanage were they first got the child burned to the ground just a few months after he was adopted just like in the omen however luckily one priest survived the blaze and escaped with sever burns all over his body yet another coincidence and to top it all off the burned priest is staying in a hospital room with pictures of jesus all over the walls much like the priest in the omen having pages of the bible plastered on the walls like wall paper please don't even get me started drawing comparisons between the ending of this movie and the omen for you because as i've stated above there are far too many to mention here
<START> the film did not do well at the box office br br i saw it in a sneak preview br br i have always enjoyed the film br br i live in 1 of the cities mentioned in the film where past players moved to br br not the best film ever put to screen but enjoyable br br robin did well with his role br br best line of the film at the beginning by robin's character jack i was that sob cleaned up here as not to offend anyone br br was glad when it came to dvd a few years back in the wide screen letter box format br br i am not a football fan or a real sports fan but you do not need to be one to like this film
<START> could not understand why jeremy irons felt it necessary to exhibit a most disconcerting accent spoken through clenched teeth and from the back of his throat in fact it rather spoiled the film for me and distracted from what was probably a fine performance by him very irritating no other actor or actress seemed to have such a pronounced accent and whilst i have always rated jeremy irons as a fine actor i would not class this film as being one of his best the film however has whetted my appetite as have some of the other comments made re this film which i have found very interesting and intend to now read the book
<START> jay chou plays an orphan raised in a kung fu school but kicked out by the corrupt headmaster after fighting with a bunch of thugs in the employ of a nefarious villain he happens upon down on his luck trickster eric tsang who immediately sees cash potential in the youngster's skills basketball is the chosen avenue for riches and tsang bids to get him a spot on a university team and to promote him in the media general success leads to a basketball championship and a really nasty rival team managed by the same nefarious villain of before br br it's all a bit shaolin soccer i guess but not so quirky or ridiculous the plot sticks pretty close to sports movie conventions and delivers all the elements the crowd expects from the set up you've seen it all before but it's the kind of stuff it never hurts to see again when it's done well luckily it really is done well here some might say 'surprisingly' with chu yen ping in the director's chair i expect he had good 'assistants' the script delivers and the presentation is slick and stylish jay chou remains pretty much expressionless throughout but such is his style and when he does let an emotion flicker across it can be to quite good comic effect eric tsang compensates with a larger than life character that he's played many times before in real life for instance who gets many of the films most emotional moments br br since the film revolves around basketball it's good that the scenes of basketball matches are suitably rousing the cast show some real skill including chou and some well done wirework and cgi add that element of hyper real kung fu skill that make the scenes even more entertaining assuming you like that sort of thing and justify the movie's plot existence br br there's only one significant fight scene in the movie but it's a doozy in the one against many style jay chou appears to do a lot of his own moves and is quite impressive he's clearly pretty strong and fast for real and ching siu tung's choreography makes him look like a real martial artist i wish there'd been more but at least it's a lengthy fight br br very much the kind of chinese new year blockbuster i hoped it would be from the trailer and recommended viewing
<START> i'm sure deep in the recesses of jack blacks mind the character of nacho libre is absolutely hilarious but no it isn't you can tell ol jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy slimy mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department br br i just sat there through most of the movie thinking is this supposed to be funny and this is the guy from tenacious d right the truth is this film has nothing to offer at all it's a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction you'll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesn't i was bored stupid about 10 minutes in but though it would surely pick up it didn't 90 minutes later i'd barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful br br it's like remember years ago when you'd see anything with your fave actor in it even some of their really early pap from before they were famous and you'd be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop yeah it's like that br br i've enjoyed some of jack black's earlier movies like shallow hall and i'm really looking forward to seeing pick of destiny but come on man if you do this to us again jack i'm gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something at the least give you a serious talking to br br i know it's a clichÃ© but this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen and for so many reasons
