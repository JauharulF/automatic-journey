<START> like some of the other reviewers have alluded to previously i'd like to know what moron actually read the script and went' yea this is it this is the next film we are going to green light and whoever that person is should have his or her head examined for actual brain activity because whoever is responsible for actually dishing out money to have this made after reading the script well i'd love to give you my email address and maybe you'd like to just give away some more money this film is atrocious in every way br br the wayans are funny at least they can be they have made some good films and had some incredibly funny performances along the way but in here not only does the premise defy all logic not only is the acting terrible not only is the entire movie offensive from start to finish not only is the direction as amateurish as you can find but they actually want you to pay to see this film maybe if it was free naaah it would still be a waste of time br br usually i'd be inclined to write some long winded detailed review about why this film is so bad but just suffice to say that let my brevity do the talking this is the lowest common denominator film making and it is about as unfunny as a heart attack br br 0 10 makes my top ten list of worst films of all time
<START> the first review i saw of page 3 said what is madhur bhandarkar finally wants to say should he say something so decisive br br the most beautiful thing about page 3 is it doesn't take sides no propaganda whatsoever this is the film that captures so many angles of an issue i don't know what do i call as an issue here and yet like any mediocre movie doesn't come up with an solution i was so intrigued when i realized that the movie ended almost in the same scenario just like it started br br the movie defines so many characters who are completely with completely different priorities and different ideologies and yet they are all a part of the system which is all the more apathetic i wish i can say more but there would be more spoilers ahead so watch page 3 if you wanna see one of the most mature films of the recent times
<START> i have read over 100 of the nancy drew books and if you are not bright enough to catch on yet nancy drew the movie was of a younger nancy drew not the 18 year old that doesn't go to school that all of the books are about this was when she was sixteen so naturally she would of not as been as smart as the one in the book considering she is only in the 10th grade other than that i thought the movie was very cute it was clean and appropriate for everyone it was funny at times i thought emma roberts did a great job she was articulate in character and cute i liked the awkwardness that nancy and ned had around each other because they obviously were not old enough to be in a serious relationship like they have in the books it was a cute pg movie that i throughly enjoyed because i unlike most people my age enjoy movies without sex drugs or profanity
<START> i happen to have bought one of those legacy of horror 50 movie pack collections and would you believe i'm still looking through them to find a good horror movie in it sometimes you find an enjoyable yet campy one like the devil's messenger or the devil bat or one of the great alfred hitchcock's films some aren't horror however and are only on there because hitchcock directed some horrors and suspense but other times it seems that they put movies like the island monster and this on because they can't accept the fact they would easily be forgotten and should be for that matter br br so we open up to sort of a westing game idea the rich yet cruel and abusive father played by carradine the one standing feature of this has died and left his inheritance to his children and servants who he still hates carradine gives a good enough performance as always but he's left mainly in a voice recording and flashback sequences leaving us to sit through the mediocre terrible performances the rest of the cast either overacts or underacts in scenes given this was an independent film of the 70's the lighting and effects are pretty limited it's hard to build a lot of tension when the viewer can't see what's happening that well in some scenes some actors like the servants igor and elga give an effort at least and i'm ashamed to admit kind of left me chuckling at the end mainly for the sheer stupidity but still with some very minor happiness that they pulled some version of a twist to an otherwise pretty obvious who done it but not enough to enhance the quality of the film you aren't meant to like the characters as they are either selfish and cruel or psychotic but it takes it to a whole new level and makes many unwatchable the death scenes are pretty bad and the suspense is not really there it proves that you would probably enjoy the 20 movie pack chilling containing films like house on a haunted hill little shop of horror's with jack nicholson and night of the living dead over it this is best avoided
<START> richard dix is a big not very nice industrialist who has nearly worked himself to death if he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him can he find happiness for the last months of his life well he'll likely be better off if he disregards the voice of the whistler br br this william castle directed entry has some great moments the introduction and the depiction of richard dix's life through newsreel a la citizen kane and some intriguing plotting in the final reels dix's performance is generally pretty good but unfortunately the just does not quite work because one does not end up buying that the characters would behave the way that they do also the movie veers from a dark and fascinating beginning to an almost cheerful 30s movie like midsection full of nice urban ethnic types who don't mind that they aren't rich and back again to a complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so br br this is a decent movie worth seeing but it needed a little more running time to establish a couple of the characters and a female lead capable of meeting the demands of her role
<START> having seen most of ringo lam's films i can say that this is his best film to date and the most unusual it's a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick ass martial arts where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters the action is fantastic the story is tense and entertaining and the set design is truely memorable sadly burning paradise has not been made available on dvd and vhs is next to impossible to get your mitts on even if you near the second biggest china town in north america like i do if you can find it don't pass it up
<START> as i watched this movie and i began to see its' characters develop i could feel this would be an excellent picture when you get that feeling and the movie indeed fills those expectations the experience is rare i had that very feeling throughout this movie robert deniro and cuba gooding junior played riveting and amazingly strong parts which were both oscar worthy the supporting cast was equally as strong creating a winning foundation for the picture to grow on i can say without any hesitation at all see this movie it will not disappoint
<START> jonathan rivers michael keaton suddenly becomes a widower when his wife dies soon after he's approached by a dr price an expert in electronic voice phenomena evp who claims he's been receiving messages from jonathan's departed wife anna via sundry electronic gadgets is anna trying to tell jonathan something is this merely a hint of something on a larger cosmic or otherworldly scale it's good to see keaton in a leading role but the story he's stuck with is convoluted and absurd at points it's as if the movie doesn't know how to answer any of the questions it brings up so it just distracts the viewer with new unrelated questions br br keaton himself is pretty good convincingly cast as the bereaving widower desperately trying to communicate with his late wife he's matured quite a bit as an actor leaving behind the frat friendly waacky hijinks roles he played 15 or so years earlier he looks a little craggy with a perhaps few more wrinkles than one might expect but he's lost none of the guile and panache that he's shown during his quarter century in hollywood br br so it's not that keaton turns in a mediocre performance it's that the script itself is subpar written by niall johnson the plot gets more confusing as it progresses each tortuous path ending in another tortuous path this is all well and good if the path leads to some sort of acceptable denouement something that ties more or less everything together and explains something but not white noise i knew less about what had happened to jonathan than i did before i'd first seen him br br keaton's really the only reason to watch this junk although he gets fine support from ian mcneice as dr price and deborah kara unger as the requisite love interest
<START> as part of our late 1950s vocabulary we well knew the ponderosa little joe hoss ben cartwright etc on that great show bonanza br br it came saturday night and everyone was glued to the television set this was a real show depicting family values there may have been a weekly crisis but it was the strong family atmosphere that pulled everyone together br br lorne greene was dominant as the patriarch of the family his words depicted wisdom we often were left to wonder that ben cartwright a widower must have been the best of husbands to that poor wife of his who had died he reared wonderful sons br br naturally we all wondered why pernell roberts left the show the show was a gold mine and roberts surrendered loads of money when he departed his career never took off as he was associated as a cartwright son he should have tried to get back into the series he certainly lost a bonanza by dropping out
<START> i have always like this great baseball movie it has a good cast including two tremendous actors and two of my favorites danny glover and christopher lloyd also in this movie is ben johnson brenda fricker big tony longo tony danza and matthew mcconaughey also jay o sanders and dermot mulroney the film has great special effects and acting from all of the film's actors the baseball scenes are all realistic the music by composer randy edelman is very good and it fits the film very well some of the actors who reminded me the actual baseball personalities stoney jackson's ray mitchell character reminded me royce clayton mcconaughey's character reminded me of steve finley and jay o sanders's commentator in my opinion resembled how al hrabosky looks today this is a fantastic movie for non and baseball fans and i strongly recommend this film
<START> when the local sheriff is killed his wife takes over until and is determined to clean up the town not everyone in town however is happy with what she's doing when the sheriff orders a curfew in town the local saloon owner also a woman hires a killer to take care of the sheriff there's no way the saloon owner could know that the sheriff and the killer would fall in love br br gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a fairly interesting concept and combine it with poor execution there's a good movie here somewhere trying to get out in more capable hands or with a larger budget gunslinger might have been an entertaining look at the role of women in the old west as it is gunslinger is a sloppy mess of a movie br br there are just so many things wrong with the movie a supporting cast with no acting ability stilted and unnatural dialogue and sets that look like sets but the biggest offender is the editing i was amazed at how many times a scene would begin with the actors and horses for that matter obviously waiting for corman to yell action the best is the scene of two riders on horseback just standing beside a building all of a sudden they take off and come racing around the corner like they had been riding hard for several miles or take the example of people who can seemingly transport themselves across town we see a man enter a building and a second later emerge across town to mount his horse br br it's not as if corman didn't have a few decent actors to work with while none were great stars beverly garland john ireland and allison hayes were all capable of turning in a good performance but in gunslinger they're not given much to work with br br i have now seen both the mst3k and non mst3k versions of the movie i would strongly recommend going the mst3k route
<START> this is a great film if this is any indication than hong sang soo really is asian cinema's best kept secret it's very similar in style to tsai ming liang and hou hsiao hsien and covers a lot of the same ground as them thematically but i think i actually enjoy this more as a whole than any single one of their films the overt minimalism is slightly less pronounced here than in their work although it still completely fits that style the camera never moves even once and somehow i found the film less self consciously slow than tsai ming liang or hou hsiao hsien which i think is part of the reason i enjoyed it more plus it doesn't keep it's subjects quite as detached as hou does i felt like the film was also somehow more complete and less open ended just barely than some of their work although that's not to say it had much of anything resembling a forward moving plot i would have a hard time believing that sophia coppola wasn't directly influenced by this film for lost in translation scenes of a young woman wandering around by herself and languishing in her hotel room wearing punk panties can't help but seem familiar
<START> so i finally saw the film my left foot last night after years of being told by my mother how amazing it is the central performance of day lewis is indeed remarkable and amazing but anyone with even minimal exposure to his other work should expect nothing less br br the fatal misjudgement in my eyes was that in becoming obsessed with proving the normalcy of this man the movie chose to show him as a complete and utter jerk on the one hand i can see that this is a logical correlation mankind always has the capacity to be objectionable and disability shouldn't obscure that i just wish that impartial onlookers wouldn't be so forgiving of aberrant behaviour and assume that circumstances automatically make it forgivable they don't acting out is normal and so yes disabled people act out but they don't do it because they're disabled they do it because they're being unreasonable a physical impairment doesn't afford you the right to throw a hissy fit in public just because someone you love turns you down br br there are certain things it is unwise to do whether you are disabled or able bodied giving someone tacit permission to boot a football directly at your head for the sole purpose of fitting in is one of them admittedly i did once save a penalty from the school's star striker with my face but i already belonged by then it wasn't for acceptance engaging in a bar brawl is another revelling in the fact that your father only extends companionship to you after you've proved yourself capable of metaphorically jumping through physical hoops takes masochism a step too far all of these things are stupid and suffering through them as a way to demonstrate your bravery doesn't make them any less foolhardy br br so yes just because you've overcome obstacles to achieve great things doesn't make you any less of a jerk being a good person takes priority setting an inspiring example for the disabled should appear way down the list
<START> i have been learning about the zodiac for four years now and i'm not saying i know much more than anyone else in fact out of most of the people who know and read and learn about z i am prolly the one with the least knowledge but i do know or at least i think i know that most of the stuff in this wouldn't happen from how he signed his name to how he killed people i thought that godfather was the worst film ever br br the cinematography was that of a five year old not saying that my films are any better but i am not someone who is making movies for the mass population br br the acting i thought for the most part was pretty good really i did the lead didn't talk that much on camera or at all i forget and don't know because i stopped watching his voice overs where good br br but really spend the four dollars and 70 cents on something else like a large pizza or something br br until i learn how to write a review psycho phil
<START> years ago when i was a poor teenager my best friend and my brother both had a policy that the person picking the movie should pay and while i would never pay to see some of the crap they took me to i couldn't resist a free trip to the movies that's how i came to see crap like the second conan movie and never say never again now despite this being a wretched movie it is in places entertaining to watch in a brain dead sort of way and technically the stunts and camera work are good so this elevates my rating all the way to a 2 so why is the movie so bad well unlike the first rambo movie this one has virtually no plot rambo himself only says about 3 words other than grunts and yells there is a needless and completely irrelevant and undeveloped romance and the movie is one giant and stupid special effect and what stupifyingly awful special effects while 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at rambo none have any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow rambo shoots hits its mark and while the bad guys are using ak 47s helicopters and rockets in some scenes all rambo had is a bow and arrows with what seem like nuclear powered tips the scene where the one bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these exploding arrows is particularly made for dumb viewers it was wonderfully parodied in uhf starring weird al plus hot shots part deux also does a funny parody of the genre not just this stupid scene br br all in all a movie so dumb and pointless it's almost like self parody
<START> brilliant use of overstated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of present day christmas ceremonies the voyeuristic element during the scenes santa pedro summarize society's behavior peering through a telescope is unique and obviously jean luc godard although he was subtle stole this theme in his film pierrot le fou highly recommended
<START> when people think of downtown chicago they think of walter payton ditka and da bears ryne sandberg the white sox breaking the curse in 2005 or the immortal michael jordan and his six championships and finals mvp's with the chicago bulls rarely in this generation do people think of the struggling side of chicago the ghettos the drug infested streets and life in the urban housing projects during the 1970's br br one of television's most formidable shows ever and a groundbreaking sitcom was good times which i remember vaguely as a small child on cbs and i enjoy regularly now on tv land br br good times was another norman lear classic the producer that gave us the jeffersons the best african american sitcom of all time and all in the family the greatest show of all time good times brought out the hardships of the ghetto and the urban housing projects and did so with charm well written and thoughtful plots and some wonderful acting especially by the matriarch and patriarch of this struggling ghetto family played by esther rolle and john amos the children in the supporting cast were also pretty good especially the ever popular janet jackson in her early years and ralph carter as florida and james evans youngest son whose character at a young age realizes that life is unfair and he has to learn to stand on his own two feet br br the eldest of the children j j played by jimmy walker is somewhat out of place on this show and is there mainly for comic relief his emotional age is about 11 or 12 even though he looks like a guy in his early twenties j j gets annoying and it is a credit to the often nasty james evans amos that he never tells j j to get his own life get a job and get out of the house j j is an aspiring painter but unlike his younger brother is never serious about getting a college degree or more important to the family getting a job to help support a household that is just above welfare status br br two classic episodes of good times was the one where the janet jackson character is running a fever of 104 and florida evans is desperately seeking good medical help for her can't afford anything but a clinic doctor who is very professional yet doesn't want to give a family from the projects any more attention than she legally has to the other episode is the one where james evans can't afford the rent a paltry low 104 a month the evans are about to get the largest of family setbacks being thrown out of the projects with no where to go florida evans goes downtown to the board of social services to try to get either a loan or a grant to help her family but the government doesn't consider her family poor because they have over 4 200 in assets for a family of five which is unfairly but unfortunately legally over the poverty line james and the kids want to hustle for the money but florida is a person of great moral character and doesn't want to do anything dishonest no matter how dire their predicament is in the end the family does find a solution to keep their heads above water br br good times a classic show from the 1970's is about keeping you're head above water in a cruel world james and florida evans both work hard in menial jobs to try to bring their children up right and avoid the social stigma of welfare i was too young to understand the message of the sitcom as a toddler in the 70s in its first airing on cbs but i really enjoy the reruns on tv land in 2006 good times is one of the classic sitcoms from back in the day
<START> about the importance of being young having friends and most of all enjoying life through the experience of four friends ligabue shows to the audience how life was back in the 70's in a small italian village the four carachters represent the four different aspects of human behavior also the drug experience is well represented
<START> who likes awful comedy shows like little mosque on the prairie the only two kinds of people i can think of who watch this are one muslims and self proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about muslims that it doesn't even matter if the show is good or funny at all which it is not two old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable badly written stale jokes br br cbc needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is if they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left i'd be curious who even writes for this show do you think it's actually muslims or hip funny young people no i bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad cbc shows since the 1960's br br when you look at the cbc comedy shows there are air farce was only finally just taken off the air thank goodness but we still have lame ducks like this hour has 22 minutes and rick mercer that we are paying for not to mention this poor excuse for comedy little mosque on the prairie it is supposed to be offencive and funny only the cbc would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny shame on the cbc for squandering our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching
<START> i can't come up with appropriate enough words to describe the horror i felt sitting in that cinema watching ramgopal varma ki aag the director's half hearted attempt to pay tribute to that classic bollywood western sholay the biggest problem with varma's remake is that he doesn't even try to make a credible film it's evident in every single frame of this movie that varma's heart is just not in it what you see on screen is a bad joke at best a gimmick on the part of the filmmaker and it pains you to see what little regard he actually shows for a film he claims he's been a fan of all his life i've seen several bad films over the years but i can't remember one that's been as much of a torture to sit through as this one consider yourself very brave if you're able to survive the entire film because it tests your patience like few films have before varma may borrow his plot and characters from the original film but his version is trite and hollow and doesn't have any of the spirit and energy of sholay ramgopal varma ki aag is actually a mockery of that timeless gem because it turns out to be everything that the original film was not way over the top too long too boring and entirely mindless much loved moments from sholay are parodied by varma and for that you want to wring his neck one of the most memorable scenes in sholay in which dharmendra as veeru climbs up the watertank and threatens to jump down to his death is turned around in this film with ajay devgan playing hero pulling a pistol to his head threatening to shoot himself how you wish he'd pulled the trigger and spared us all the agony not only does ramgopal varma ki aag fail as a remake of sholay it's a pretty bad effort even as a stand alone film the eardrum damaging background score sounds more like someone clanging vessels in the kitchen and the camera work alternates between dramatic and head spinning partners in this terrible crime of bringing this ridiculous film to screen are the film's mostly dead as wood actors sushmita sen as devi the widow takes both her role and the film too seriously punctuating her lines with pauses staring into camera for effect and generally performing like her life depends upon it mohanlal as narsimha struggles with his hindi dialogue and looks embarrassed to be delivering some of the stupidest lines in his illustrious career newcomer prashant raj playing jai equivalent raj has no acting chops to speak of and can't strum up any of the brooding intensity amitabh bachchan brought to the part in the original film as hero the new age veeru ajay devgan is entirely hopeless failing miserably in his attempts at comedy but the film's weakest link easily the most shocking casting decision is nisha kothari as ghunghroo who steps into the shoes of hema malini as basanti the endearing airhead from sholay nisha kothari is not only the worst actress in this country but possibly the worst actress in this whole wide world she gives the word annoying a whole new meaning and she makes you want to slit your wrists every time she's on screen and then there is amitabh bachchan playing babban singh ramgopal varma's version of hindi cinema's most popular villain gabbar singh the only actor in this ensemble who recognises the film's over the top tone and plays along accordingly bachchan constructs a menacing character who is a treat to watch he's meant to be a comic book villain who snarls and sneers and hisses and hams and he does all of that to good effect but because he's trapped in such a doomed enterprise his performance doesn't really help elevate the film in any way no surprises here i'm going with zero out of ten and two thumbs down for ramgopal varma ki aag it one's of those painful movie watching experiences you wouldn't subject even an enemy to it's not like varma hasn't handled a remake before with sarkar he gave us a smart gripping take on the godfather and it's a pity he's made this sholay bhature out of such a much loved classic ramgopal varma ki aag is his worst career decision ever it's also a dark spot on his resume he'll be embarrassed of forever i suspect this film will go down in movie history as ramgopal varma ka daag
