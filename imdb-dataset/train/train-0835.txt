<START> how i got into it when i started watching this series on cartoon network i have to say that i've never seen anything like this and it was the best but when i started collecting the series on vhs and years later on dvd part of bandai's anime legends collections it was amazing and truly worth watching it had a lot of exploding action that will blow you out of your seat and of course the theme songs just communication and rhythm emotions were the best br br characters and gundams my favorite characters in the show were heero duo relena treize lady und noin and zechs my favorite gundams in the show that i liked the most are the wing zero and epyon and of course the altron and deathscythe i and ii br br meaning of the show what this series also tells us that in real life wars are very hard and we can sometimes win or lose but peace can also be hard to obtain and i do believe the gundam pilots are doing the right thing and are trying to obtain world peace br br but however this show is truly the best of the best so in closing to this review after you watch this show see the movie endless waltz
<START> in keeping with disney's well known practice of stealing i mean buying out known properties and bastardizing them this live action version of the venerable cartoon classic has got to be one of the worst re makes in a year of bad re makes i grew up on the original cartoon tv series any episode of the original cartoon series will give you more laughs than this entire movie not present is penny's cool computer book also not present is the gag with the self destructing orders that always ends up detonating on the chief new are a smooth talking gadget convertible the original cartoon had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or a car and an element of a typical unrealistic hollywood romance don't fill the coffers to pay for disney executives and even their ex executives don't see this movie br br
<START> another powerful chick flick this time it revolves around diana gusman who is always getting into fights at school instead of getting expelled she takes her anger elsewhere to the boxing ring she trains to be a boxer and there she meets featherweight adrian and begins to fall in love with him this movie has a powerful message of taking your dreams and going with them even if someone doesn't believe in you in this case her dad doesn't believe in her that alone makes the movie worth the price enjoy
<START> maybe i'm biased to foxes fox stories and all but i thought this was wonderfully done br br i really enjoyed that it was shown when lily wasn't comfortable such as the fire and the room trying not to spoil too much here i think that's important for kids to see and try to understand br br after reading a few others comments i'm a bit confused one says that at the end spoiler the mother and her son appear as she's been the one telling her son about her story the movie i saw did not have the mother or son at the end merely a painting of a girl with a fox can someone enlighten me on that anyway i really enjoyed this movie although some scenes can be a bit slow which might be difficult for high energy kids to sit through still worth it if they can sit still
<START> 14 years since this show was made and it is still is the best show ever made the writing was 1st class and the production second to none this show would never be made today and that this a shame i hope if you are thinking about finding this show to watch that you do br br ag came out the year i left high school at the time my fav tv show was the x files this gives you an idea of why i first got into this show ag was a far better program with better writing but only got one reason i know this is not the only program to only get one season another example that comes to mind would be the lone gunman x files spin off it had good writing and was funny but also only got one season it does not seem right br br we also have to remember that this show was around before shows like twilight made dark shows 'cool' so i think this may have also let to the show going down hill br br watch this program and enjoy it 10 out of 10 for me
<START> what we have here is a downright brilliant piece of early 80's incompetence that will render even the biggest connoisseur of trash cinema completely speechless wizards of the lost kingdom is a very cheap and cheesy fantasy sword and sorcery adventure that doesn't have an actual plot but does eagerly shamelessly borrows elements from other films writer ed naha and hector olivera who watched enough similar type of movies to know that they needed a handful of essential characters but probably figured that all the rest would follow automatically in order to make a fantasy adventure you need one super evil villain preferably with a black cape one young hero in training one lone warrior one amiable type of furry pet one wise midget living in the woods optional and a whole colorful collection of hideous demons enslaved dwarfs and winged gargoyles to serve as filler the story is phenomenal and so original with simon the young son of a wizard having to flee from his beloved kingdom after the evil magician shurka takes over the power and killed the king simon wants to go back and save the people but therefore he needs his powerful ring which he lost during his escape simon befriends lone warrior kor the usually cool dude bo svenson who clearly needed the pay check who assists simon during the long and devastating journey full of ordeals dangerous encounters and magical showdowns admittedly it doesn't even sound too bad thus far but that's merely just because i excluded all the deliciously inept little details simon has a best friend named gulfax for example gulfax is an albino version of chewbacca and evokes incontrollable chuckles whenever he opens his poodle snout to yelp something incomprehensible the obstacles during journey back home are hilariously irrelevant to the plot and simply serve as padding footage to cover up the lack of actual content simon has nightmarish visions inside the tent of a suspicious forest nymph kor settles an old score with the pig faced nemesis whose sister he refused to marry and there's the supposedly horrible 'suicide cave' where you can only sing your way out of but the absolute most unequally brilliant sequence Â not just of this film alone but in the history of cinema Â involves the resurrection of four zombie warriors simon awakes the legendary courageous warriors hoping they will assist them in their battle but the rotting corpses only take a few steps complain about how tired they are and return back to their graves that's it so much for the zombie sub plot best sequence ever i could go on listing unintentionally hilarious little details for several more paragraphs but you get the idea wizards of the lost kingdom is a tremendously messed up so bad it's good film word of advice do not watch this joyful piece of junk alone invite friends preferably the dope headed types with a wicked sense of humor and watch it in group it will be a night to rememberÂ
<START> red rock west is a perfect example of how good a film can be with practically no budget all you need is a smart script good actors and loads of atmosphere rrw delivers all these and more br br nic cage plays an ex marine injured in lebanon who is down to his last 5 dollars after being refused a job on an oilfield because of his bad knee he roles into red rock and is mistaken by bartender wayne jt walsh not quite as his most menacing but still evil for a hit man from texas br br he pays him to kill his wife and make it look like burglary only when he gets there just to check her out she offers him double to kill wayne cage just wants to get the hell out of town with his free money and leave the sparring lovers be but a series of mishaps and setbacks results in him yo yoing in and out of red rock back and forth eventually this leads to a run in with lyle from dallas a cheeky and somehow sympathetic dennis hopper the real hit man from texas who offers to help without knowing he's making the plot more complicated br br rrw never had a big release thus most of it's audience discovered it on video or on cable tv showings viewing it in such a way might make it seem like a tv movie but it's bigger than that the slick slowly timed direction moody score and howling desert wind would have all made for a great movie in theatres but the best you can do these days is watch the dvd on a big hdtv br br the only weak point of the movie i can think of is lara flynn boyle's boring femme fatale with the nasty dyke ish hairdo i certainly wouldn't fall for her but if you assume that nic cage's character is in to militant lesbians then you'll accept it nonetheless
<START> episode two of season one is a delightful holiday tale of love betrayal and a homicidal escaped lunatic dressed as father christmas br br a woman mary ellen trainor has just murdered her hubby on christmas eve for his life insurance what begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle to survive as a deranged santa clause suit wearing psychopath larry drake perfectly over the top threatens her life as well as her precious young daughters br br this episode is warmly remembered by even those casually acquainted with the program by the way this particular reviewer watches it every christmas on routine most notable for it's escalating suspense and narrative twists and all through the houst is among tales from the crypt's best
<START> ah true memories i lived in holland at the time and looked eagerly forward to it every sunday evening and later tuesdays i saw it during my 14 16s very good for my at the time school english as dutch tv provides subtitles for other languages except for kiddies shows nowadays so you would hear the original voices and language the best series were the first three ones and then after the third series the great character nazi von gelb who was such a formidable enemy disappeared from the series i don't think they ever really caught him he always escaped leaving room to have him appear again in a next story because evidently the series also was distributed to germany and a nazi enemy wouldn't go over very well too bad because geoffrey toone did such a wonderful convincing job of portraying the intelligent nazi aristocrat who had this ongoing obsession to take revenge on england it was a true delight to see this kind of high quality performance in a youth series but ronald leigh hunt was a good counterpart and the youngsters were so normal they were very believable to me at the time and as a kid i could just imagine to be part of these youngsters who at the time were about four years older than me it was a very exciting series to me standing out in my memory of those times as a special show with the prisoner as well i hope they will publish a good quality dvd of the series that would be wonderful even the bad copies around are still enjoyable to watch the later series were not as good watered down and just not as much fun as the first three hopefully they also find the other series with von gelb to be put on dvd greetings from canada
<START> such a joyous world has been created for us in pixar's a bug's life we're immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer Â when it's in the right hands that is Â a bug's life is a warm reminder we walk out of the film with an equally warm feeling and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high calibre film productions br br it is only pixar's second animated feature the sub group of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995 with their landmark movie toy story it was a movie which defied convention re invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film br br after all it's a film about ants well all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in a bug's life but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film as humans are the focal point in dramas romances and so on how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film surely they jest however we forget that in toy story a bunch of toy box items were able to become the grandest most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you'll probably ever encounter br br not only are they all entirely amiable and likable Â there isn't an unpleasant character in sight even the villains are riveting characters Â but they're colourful they're eclectic and they're idiosyncratic and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto a bug's life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name is flik david foley and his character is rather generic to say the least out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush beautiful ant island he is the one considered the 'black sheep' of the clan as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season's harvest with his antics br br the problem arises in the fact that the ants' harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper kevin spacey who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone they go insane for lack of a better term hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack's hands however it's a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil the cogs and clockwork in flik's mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony's rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers br br if you think about it a bug's life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line's of akira kurosawa's classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which a village of hapless but good hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies Â one lone village dweller goes in search for help in the big city finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil in a bug's life the help comes in the form of a down and out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in a bar room brawl br br much amusement comes out of these scenes and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs among them are an erudite stick insect david hyde pierce a side splitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasi femme fatale ladybug who's in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug dennis hopper it's exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on screen as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on screen as is the entire movie collectively br br as i've said much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie what makes a bug's life even better is that the film isn't restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film Â the clichÃ©d kid friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we'd like however it's easy to ignore this fault and it's incredulously easy to enjoy this film br br although a bug's life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor this is still a superb movie and the start of something promising here pixar have proved that they're not just a one hit wonder but instead a much gifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manages to top their standards it's only always by themselves what more is there to say about a bug's life other than see it it's not quite the best which we've seen from the folks at emeryville california but this beats out the lot of its year Â and i'll be damned if this isn't the best animated feature of 1998 br br 8 5 10
<START> i too was quite astonished to see how few people had voted on this film and just had to write something about it although my comments are quite similar to those written already br br i like many things about the film the superb acting between mastroianni loren the way the film is narrated humanity and love slowly developing between these two outsiders and contrasted to the simultaneously continuously ongoing inhumane marching pace of the fascist radio announcer who happens to be a colleague of mastroianni's part and the adherents going to and coming from the show to me this is a very fine film about what it is to be human maybe some of you would argue that the anti fascist message is too clearly delivered but to me this didn't destroy the film in any way my vote is 10 10
<START> i realize several ben stiller movies are out or will be out this year but perhaps he should insist on quality not quantity br br i was dumbfounded at what the filmmakers thought passed for comedy in along came polly br br stiller's reuben is grating charmless and ranks as one of the worst performances of the year stiller's schtick is getting tiresome he undoubtedly has comic talent but he needs to either find another schtick or take a break find some material that is actually funny because his movies are going from painfully humorless to excruciatingly bad br br there's absolutely no chemistry between stiller and jennifer aniston which is a shame because she's a good smart actress with a promising career as long as she keeps making more movies such as the good girl in which she's terrific and less like along came polly she'll have a career of which she could be proud br br aniston tries desperately to overcome the limp material with which she's working but it's a daunting task for any actress with the exception of a few moments with alec baldwin as reuben's boss stan and philip seymour hoffman as reuben's best friend sandy there's nothing funny in this awful film other supporting characters including debra messing as lisa and hank azaria as claude are annoying azaria's accent is not only stupid it's terribly unfunny br br the premise of along came polly certainly showed promise unfortunately it needed a writer who could actually turn it into a good comedy instead of this lame dull boring excuse for a comedy
<START> first of all i've got to give it to the people that got this thing together 9 11 is such a sensitive issue that making a movie that dares to be controversial about it takes a great deal of guts it's a shame although not surprising that the movie was banned in the us br br that being said i think that the movie is superb with a couple of weak moments the movie starts up with the iranian segment which turns out to be somewhat reminiscent of majid majidi's work the absolutely beautiful heaven's children and the color of paradise much like those 2 films the clip shows what happened through the innocent eyes of a class of afgan refugees in iran absolutely beautiful clip same goes for sean penn's clip which is superb as well but just as some of the clips are beutiful others are absolutely brutal alejandro gonzÃ¡les iÃ±Ã¡rritu does the mexican clip and just like his gut wrenching amores perros he does it as brutal as he can most of the clip is a black screen with several sounds playing in the background those sounds are of the reporters and their shock as the second plane crashes those who called home from the burning towers and left messages for their families those who were angry and he combines this with flashes of people jumping from the towers a very hard clip to watch and one that you won't forget br br some clips could turn out to be very hard to watch for americans as some of the clips could be interpreted as you're not the only ones that are suffering in particular the egyptian and british clips that not only say that but turn the tables and say how much suffering the us has caused to other people br br i will also make a special mention to the clips from bosnia herzegovina france india and japan although this last one may seem terribly out of place it actually isn't br br however not all the clips are great and i make a special mention on the clip from israel which in my opinion is extremely weak while the idea was good a reporter is at the scene of a terrorist attack in tel aviv but his story gets bumped because of what happened in new york is something that a lot of us who live in countries at war can relate to the realization is terrible the clip ends up as just some entertainment reporter trying to get some air time at all costs a guy saying he's a witness and hoping that he can go on tv and soldiers and paramedics shouting just because the clip fails to capture any of the drama of such a situation br br if you happen to have the chance to see it then you should that is unless you're a conservative in which case you'd better stay out as you might get offended but if you're not then you might learn how many of us outside the us lived through 9 11
<START> i guess i only have myself to blame for the gigantic disillusion that is entrails of a virgin you already know not to expect a cinematic masterpiece when you see a juicy and proudly promoted title like this and the first impression only gets extra confirmed when noticing the film is a mid 80's production from japan now there are quite a lot of demented and sick filmmakers active in japan but kazuo komizu surpasses them all with his thoroughly depraved and sickening trilogy revolving on nothing but aggressive sex and the sadistic abuse of young girls not even attempting to tell a story entrails of a virgin simply presents a hodgepodge of un arousing semi pornographic sex and truly poor gore effects that wouldn't even please the most undemanding fan of cheesy 80's horror images of a bunch of photographers and their fashion models are inexplicably intercut with scenes of a filthy pervert having crude sex with a seemly under aged girl he dumps her not even a minute after climaxing typical and she begs him to stay even if she has to share him with other women i don't get it is this supposed to represent a general male fantasy because it's really clichÃ©d and wrongful anyways back to the bunch of horny photographers and docile models surprised by upcoming fog on their way home the group entrenches themselves in an abandoned country house where they have more appalling sex and eventually fall victim to a ridiculous sex demon who kills them all the acting performances are amateurish the dialogs inane and primitive and komizu's direction is weak and uninspired i can tolerate all that including the woman unfriendly portrayal of sex but i came too close to turning the film off during the indescribably mean spirited wrestling sequence one of the males brutally hits kicks and throws around one of the girls and calls her a filthy whore until she literally pees her panties and cries with agony this sequence is in my humble opinion the absolute low point of asian exploitation cinema one to avoid and maybe even boycott
<START> i saw this film in the worst possible circumstance i'd already missed 15 minutes when i woke up to it on an international flight between sydney and seoul i didn't know what i was watching i thought maybe it was a movie of the week but quickly became riveted by the performance of the lead actress playing a young woman who's child had been kidnapped the premise started taking twist and turns i didn't see coming and by the end credits i was scrambling through the the in flight guide to figure out what i had just watched turns out i was belatedly discovering do yeon jeon who'd won best actress at cannes for the role i don't know if secret sunshine is typical of korean cinema but i'm off to the dvd store to discover more
<START> i did not watch the entire movie i could not watch the entire movie i stopped the dvd after watching for half an hour and i suggest anyone thinking of watching themselves it stop themselves before taking the disc out of the case br br i like mafia movies both tragic and comic but corky romano can only be described as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedy br br the problem is corky romano simply tries too hard to get the audience to laugh the plot seems to be an excuse for moving chris kattan corky from one scene to another corky himself is completely overplayed and lacks subtlety or credulity all his strange mannerisms come across as contrived chris kattan is clearly 'acting' rather than taking a role it bounces you right out of the story each scene is utterly predictable the 'comedic event' that will occur on the set is obvious as soon as each scene is introduced in comedies such as mr bean the disasters caused by the title character are funny because you can empathise with the characters motivations and initial event and the situation the character ends up in is not telegraphed corky however gives the feeling that he is deliberately screwing up in a desperate attempt to draw a laugh from the audience br br if chris had not played such an alien character who never really connects with the other characters in the movie and whose behaviour is entirely inexplicable except for trying to draw laughs and the comedy scenes weren't so predictable and stereotyped all the jokes seemed far too familiar this movie could have been watchable but it isn't don't watch it
<START> it's not too bad a b movie with sanders barrie hale cowen hamilton gargan fitzgerald and even willie best we could be either with charlie chan moto the falcon blackie holmes or the saint etc in other words you get the chance to spend another hour in the company of some old friends from plain to urbane murdering and being murdered always a pleasure in my book br br barrie's a hard boiled dame out to avenge and clear her framed and dead father a police detective by planning and carrying out with her coterie a string of underworld assassinations which would surely have had the opposite effect sanders joins in the fun simply by dancing in the right club in the right place in the right city at the right time with the right lighting falling on both him and the first killer at the right time and killing him br br the story and acting's ok the only gripe i've got is near the end with the hurried and almost laughable discovery of who the evil genius waldeman was did they almost forget about his relevance in the plot that said a solid entry in the series
<START> i have been a star trek fan for as long as i can remember when they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series i was very excited br br the premiere of enterprise was well worth the wait it was well done with the perfect setting and a great acting job done by all the characters the nx 01 enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to love br br scott bakula was just superior as captain jonathan archer jolene blalock gave a commanding performance as subcommander t'pol that it just two people of this wonderful new crew that is boldly going to take us into the great history of starfleet br br enterprise looks like it's going to be a good series well worth watching and i recommend that watch it
<START> i have been a fervent hal hartley supporter since i saw his short surviving desire in high school and even then was still completely unmoored by his searingly brilliant henry fool but this 10 year later sequel is not only unnecessary it's disgraceful br br after a choppy and expeditious start fay grim devolves into pseudo intellectualism flat out boredom and finally unwarranted and unwanted nihilism and that's just the plot br br the majority of the new faces are as frivolous and poorly developed as the movie one particularly flat character ends up hogging half the time we spend with the infamous henry fool himself and it's his only spoken scene in the film br br jeff goldblum's agent fulbright it seems is the only bright character a pun surely intended by hartley as well how then is he left spoiler dead via a car bombing easily making this the gentle natured hartley's most violent film to date and tonally all wrong in a film that's already all wrong from the word go br br as for the other new characters angus james ned fool or is it grim not to mention fay herself well i won't spoil their fates as the movie does a good enough job of that all on its own when it isn't busying itself with yet another godawful canted angle which gives the disconcerting impression that hartley is moving backwards from auteur to crappy film student br br this piece is a complete disaster a dreadful mess that isn't even good humored enough to revel in its messiness instead it self indulgently crams the typically fun hipster pretenses of its director into the real world one uglier and meaner than it need be but not nearly ugly or mean enough to come close to having anything to say in doing so hartley tracks sh t all over my memories of these people and the marvelous world he originally created for them br br i have rarely been so depressed at the movies and i'm counting leaving las vegas which at least developed fresh new characters we grew to love before destroying them instead of immediately disregarding characters already beloved br br grim indeed
