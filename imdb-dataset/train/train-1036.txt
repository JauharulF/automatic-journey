<START> i just saw this movie on flix after timer taping it i grew up watching f troop and had a major hard for wrangler jane so i was shocked literally shocked to find out after seeing this film that the degenerate homicidal nurse was melody patterson who looks pretty good but also looks completely different and is unfortunately poorly photographed i would never have guessed it was her in a million years what the hell is she doing in a picture like this i agree with the guys here that the movie lacks what it's pushing no sex no gore no tease it's also a remake of the atomic brain aka monstrosity 1964 or thereabouts most of the action is tedious the main character spends enormous amounts of time running around the crazed doctor's house and basement and the neighborhood in general or being roughed up by the cop all of it boring and time filling now if the italians would have made this half the film would have been the slingblade uncle ernest jack elam henchman fondling the unconscious nude girls but you only get that for 20 seconds
<START> one more of those brilliant young men who went all out and dared to make a teen romance film can i actually call it that it would invoke the devil out of its fans on a micro budget but packed with such taste sensitiveness and maturity peter sollett you deserve more admiration and respect thanks once again for demonstrating to the powers that be in the industry that stereotypes can be flushed down the toilet one location a handful of rich characters low budget good acting and that too amateurs decent lighting worshippers of true indie cinema should watch more of this and stop watching well you know what
<START> i don't know what it is about this movie director sam mraovich somehow messed up just about every little aspect in this movie i would normally say that this is a movie that should not exist but this movie may be the most important of all time this movie should exist for the sole purpose of being without a doubt 'the worst movie ever made' i've seen bad movies in my lifetime but this somehow breaks what i considered bad into something much more hard to imagine br br everything in this movie is hilarious but the single funniest thing is that mraovich himself considers this to be a great movie br br oh wow
<START> ok so i rented this clown like chainsaw massacre esquire film not expected much but i did like the novel approach to a serial killer film from the back of the box is the following synopsis at first it was just a joke a myth around the campfire for five friends staying at a remote cabin in the texas woods but when they began to disappear one by one replaced by scattered bloodied body parts and voodoo effigies the remaining few scramble for their lives but he's out there and he's sick and all he wants is blood so obviously from the get go it doesn't make sense why is this clown in the woods to begin with why a clown why are their dolls with the word food drawn on them why why why hardly anything gets answered in this 1 hour 30 min bore fest except where this clown lives the characters are dumb guys dumb girls and a hell of a lot of bitchiness one in particular is a girl whom they brought from a restaurant up the road whom they thought they should help because she was getting hassled by some guy she knew what warrants that as an excuse to bring a girl into your circle of friends or their cabin she of course begins planting seeds of jealousy having the men have sex with her by feeding their dumb minds everything they want to hear br br the music was an average affair standard frantic keyboard music like in every horror film without differences the actors seemed to be brought from some soap opera the way they complained and whined about everything the idea that the main guy in the film takes this girl to the cabin as their first date makes for a horrible date but of course she unrealistically gives herself to him on the first night of getting to know him there was hardly a budget spent of anything it seems but there was a clown outfit and plenty of cheap 1 store dolls lying around in the woods which was a horribly bland place to shoot this whole movie been done too many times i was also waiting for the clown to jump into the house to kill the remaining 4 characters of the film in through the glass maybe but nothing exciting like that ever entered the film i guess you were just supposed to like the clown being a killer or something br br i had to give the film a 3 it was an interesting premise clown as the texas chainsaw massacre character essentially and i'll give them a star for acting serious all the way through when the movie could've totally been a b movie style video but they opted for the more legitimate style of video but ultimately i probably would've felt like renting the killer klowns from mars video again before going back to check this out ah but that cover art pretty awesome drawing
<START> although i love this movie i can barely watch it it is so real so i put it on tonight and hid behind my bank of computers i remembered it vividly but just wanted to see if i could find something i hadn't seen before i didn't that's because it's so real to me br br another user wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary i'm all for that it's absolutely obvious that most of these people who've made comments about midnight cowboy may not have been born when it was released they are mentioning other movies jon voight and dustin hoffman have appeared in at a later time i'll be just as ruinously frank i am 82 years old if you're familiar with some of my other comments you'll be aware that i was a professional female impersonator for 60 of those years and also have appeared in film you'd never recognize me even if you were familiar with my night club persona do you think i know a lot about the characters in this film you bet i do br br and am not the least bit ashamed if you haven't run into some of them it's your loss but there's a huge chance you have but just didn't know it so many moms dads sons and daughters could surprise you it should be no secret many actors actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of midnight cowboy who is to judge i can name several current big time stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities and weren't the least bit damaged by their time spent there i make no judgment because these are humans just as we all are love courage kindness compassion intelligence humility you name the attributes they are all there no matter what the package looks like br br the trivia about hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of ratzo is a gem he can be seen driving his auto all around los angeles how do you think he gets his input i can also name lots of male stars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money although the nightclub i last worked in for 26 years was world famous and legit i can also name some huge stars that had to be constantly chased out our back street looking to make a pick up br br this should be no surprise today although it's definitely action in hollywood and other cities large and small wake up and smell the roses they smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue br br some of the users thought joe buck had been molested by his grandma although i saw him in her bed with a boyfriend i didn't find any incidence of that believe it or not kids haven't always had their own rooms because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be going on in the master bedroom whose business hoffman may have begged for change on the streets but some of the users point out that jon voight was not a major star for the filming of midnight cowboy his actual salary would surprise you i think he was robbed no one can doubt the clarity he put into his role nor that it made him a star for such great work as deliverance he defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie the end of the 60s may have been one of the first films to be so open but society has always been hip br br i also did not find any homosexuality between ratzo and joe they were clearly opposites unappealing to one another they found a much purely higher relationship true friendship if you didn't understand that at the end of the movie then you've wasted your time joe's bewilderment but unashamed devotion was apparent yes voight deserved an oscar for this role one that john wayne could never pull off and he was as handsome in his youth br br hoffman is hoffman you expect fireworks he gave them superbly wayne got his oscar every character in this film was beautifully defined if you don't think they are still around you are mistaken the party attend some of the raves younger people attend if you can get in look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs you'll see every outrageous personality br br brenda viccaro was the epitome of society's sleek women who have to get down to the nitty gritty at times if you were shocked by her brilliant acting thinking this isn't real look at today's ladies who live on the brink of disrepute and are admired for it br br the brutality joe displayed in robbing the old guy unfortunately is also a part of life you don't have to condone it but it's not too much different than any violence joe pointedly named his purpose in that situation i'd have handed over the money quicker than he asked for it that's one of the scenes that makes this movie a break through one which i do not watch i get heartbroken for both br br john schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this sordidness to direct this chillingly beautiful eye opener waldo salt didn't write from clairvoyance anyone who had any part of getting it to the screen must have realized they were making history and should be proud for the honesty of it perhaps only in america can we close our eyes to unpleasant situations while other movie makers make no compunction in presenting it to the public not looking doesn't mean it isn't there give me the truth every time bravo to all
<START> i guess this goes to prove that joe don baker will do anything for a buck the concept of the film wasn't very good to start with this movie has so many bad things about it i don't know where to start the acting is horrible the cinematography is marginal at best the soundtrack was pretty bad the score is terrible there's a reason why this movie ended up on mystery science theater 3000 i voted before i wrote this and i cannot believe that 9 people actually thought this film is excellent they must have liked the two go go dancers final justice would be if they locked this stinker in the film vault outside wichita and never let anyone see it again a 1 out of 10 rating is far better than this deserves
<START> i was duped into seeing this movie after reading a positive review from another website and man was i p o'd it took me at least 15 minutes to pick it up off the shelf b c i didn't want anyone to see me then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use real money to rent it i thought that all my stress would pay off by the time i got home to and watching the movie b c the review i read said the movie was a pleasant surprise what a joke if you can make it through the first hour of the movie then your in luck b c it's not until then the movie turn's into a horror don't bother with this one folks your better off watching dankness falls
<START> due to reading bad reviews and being told by friends that they couldn't believe how bad it was i didn't go and see this film at the cinema after watching it on dvd i have to say i regret that now i'm not saying it is brilliant but i would venture to say that it is a good movie i enjoyed it br br people have skulls thicker than ned's helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary if you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal i don't think ganghis kahn has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact what kind of man ned kelly actually was is a matter of debate and quite passionate it seems in spite of the efforts of governments and some historians ned kelly has become a legend legends are stories and stories say as much about those who tell and listen to them as they do about the actual figure himself ned kelly has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of australian culture that doesn't trust or accept authority a society in which there is no dissent or challenge to authority is crazier and more dangerous than any bushranger br br so not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical kelly gang i actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie it was sentimental and romantic but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been for my fellow australians watch 'the lighthorseman' and you will see what i mean it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly perhaps the love affair business could have been forsaken for a bit more detail in other areas such as the shooting of the troopers ironically i actually enjoyed the movie because of that because it would be those details that most of the focus on ned's story would dwell and they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historians br br this movie was always going to have a hard time having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market to pay the pills and the legend as it means to australians perhaps a little of ned's spirit is in this movie because i think it rebelled against people's expectations and unfortunately missed both targets fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film for me it was an unexpected kind of movie about ned and that is why i liked it orlando bloom's performance did a lot for the movie too he really added something i think he would have enjoyed being the monster instead of the pretty elf for a change br br when you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered send me this on dvd for christmas rather than croc dundee or the man from snowy river anytime
<START> there's a certain allure i've always found in discovering the great semi unknown film these discoveries have nearly always been dramatic films in my experience unknown sci fi action and horror are unknown for very very good reasons i found high tide on video at a junk store mixed in amongst countless dozens of tapes of varying quality of course that's the only place i would find it as it is still not on dvd br br while i was watching judy davis as lillie throughout the course of this film i was somehow certain i was watching a great undiscovered performance yes i had previously seen davis in several small parts and one starring role in a passage to india but although she was superb in the aforementioned film high tide is a different animal entirely since recently watching gillian armstrong's later film charlotte gray i was acutely aware of the sort of actress which impresses her davis draws much more than a passing resemblance to cate blanchett in both manner and sensibility br br judy davis' performance is stunning i cannot say enough good things about it she shares an amazing on screen relationship with young claudia karvan as ally this film's other great actress there's a lot of drama and quiet humanity they share together the details of which i won't presume to reveal here see it for yourself there's too much good in high tide to cover in one review indeed i would hardly care to the film speaks well enough for itself in conclusion i would like to praise screenwriter laura jones for her stunning dialogue director gillian armstrong for her understanding of actors and the great russell boyd for his brilliant understated cinematography please see his work in tender mercies
<START> i registered for imdb just to comment on this movie br br i just got done sitting through this movie and the only thing that impressed me was that i somehow had the will power to not stop it br br i've seen a pretty decent number of action movies and what not but princess blade has some of the worst fights i've ever seen in a movie most of the sword fighting involves mindlessly swinging the swords back and fourth and hoping the opponent isn't doing the same i've seen a good many student films with better action and stronger plots br br so now we have a futuristic action movie with poor action and virtually no sign of the future br br most of the movie doesn't even have any action and shows the developing relationship with the princess and the farmboy terrorist and his disturbed sister the movie has multiple plot lines and none of them really pan out to be worth anything br br part of the problem may have been that i watched the dub which was quite bad the entire cast mumbled all their lines so it was hard to follow what was going on but i got the general idea knowing exactly what was said would not have saved the movie in my eyes br br if you've heard about this being a futuristic action ninja flick then you've heard wrong thats what i thought it was when i heard about it and now i've lost 90 minutes of my life don't let this happen to you steer well clear of it
<START> the most horrible retelling of a great series it should not have been named battlestar galactica because it's only the same in name alone too many changes to just have changes you have characters turned from male to female black to asian to cylon all in a way to attract female audiences when there was already strong female characters that could have just been made stronger gone are the egyptian feeling gone are the quest for earth the lack of cylons to go to terminator rejects takes away from the film especially when one is made a fembot granted the original show had a lot of cheese to it but it had a large following they tried to hold onto this following but give the fans nothing to work with and basically spit in their face as they make it their own story changes are good when they make something better not to just make them
<START> party girl capitalizes on the tremendous charm of parker posey in fact at times the movie seems to be a vehicle in which ms posey is allow to play herself as she normally is in real life br br the film directed by daisy von scherler mayer is a treat for ms posey's fans ms von scherler mayer takes us on a wild trip into lower manhattan to show us this aimless soul whose life is dedicated to have fun in the different clubs she constantly frequents this is an era that still was more naive than what that area and the adjacent meat market districts became at least there are no pretensions in the films and we see down to earth people going about their lives in a normal way if we can call it that way br br parker posey makes an amazing mary it's because of parker posey we enjoy the movie more than if another actress would have played mary she is the whole picture the rest of the cast is good
<START> i'm watching this on the sci fi channel right now it's so horrible i can't stop watching it i'm a videographer and this movie makes me sad i feel bad for anyone associated with this movie some of the camera work is good most is very questionable there are a few decent actors in the flick too bad they're surrounded by what must have been the director's relatives that's the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie music was a little better than the acting if you get around to watching this i hope it's because there was absolutely no other option the sequel yes sequel is coming on now i think i'll skip it jason
<START> while many unfortunately passed on the ballroom scene is still very much alive and carrying on their legacy some are still very much alive and quite well octavia is more radiant and beautiful than ever willi ninja is very accomplished and gives a great deal of support to the gay community as a whole pepper labeija just passed on last year of natural cause may she rest in peace after anji's passing carmen became the mother of the house of xtravaganza she was in the beach scene and she is looking more and more lovely as well some balls have categories dedicated to those who have passed may they all rest in peace there is currently another project underway known as how do i look you can check out the website at www howdoilooknyc org
<START> t rama rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s but he seems to be a filmmaker who cannot mature with the changing times styles and fashions he's like stuck with the same old fashioned film making style br br actors are not bad not good either anil kapoor generally acts convincingly his two roles of a father and his son but the flawed script often makes him look funny and pathetic rekha is good but then she's always good and here she's nothing more than such she makes the best of what she is given but she always does that in conclusion nothing great at all raveena is ok which means ordinary not bad not good nothing br br this film is melodramatic occasionally stupid maybe it's a delayed film well even then it still would be below standard the script is terrible the film is overdone and the story goes nowhere it feels like a film made in the early 1990s but the script makes it look even older the style is like from the 1950s br br don't recommend unless you're a big fan one of the starring actors
<START> perhaps in an attempt to find another hot property for adaptation the brothers fleischer thought back to their highly successful foray into the world of the newspaper comic strip with their production of 1933's popeye the sailor fleischer studios paramount although it was a part of the betty boop series miss b only made a brief appearance in the short leaving the rest as a pilot episode for the possible emergence of a full blown series br br as is now common knowledge the gruff squinty eyed brawlin' seaman became perhaps the most successful cartoon series ever outlasting and literally outliving the fleischers and their studio lasting to this day br br returning to king features for another try at luck was no doubt the reason for trying out the very popular henry comic strip character in a betty boop outing objective being the seeking of another series the reasoning then surely seemed sound henry was a most popular feature in the hearst papers' line up appearing as both a daily and on sunday's color comics supplement puck the comics weekly you know what fools these mortals be remember that one schultz in viewing the chubby little bald boy comic strip 'hero' and his on screen antics both solo and in tandem with miss betty we were pleasantly surprised in seeing just how well the character was handled the story and director dave fleischer both afforded a plethora of comic strip like situations and sight gags that seemed most appropriate for the character of little henry these mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in remaining faithful to the printed page as the henry feature was mostly done in a sort of 4 color 'mime' br br in the cartoon titled betty boop with henry the funniest living american fleischer studios paramount pictures corporation 1935 we see what is basically being a one situational exercise being punctuated with the usual array of dave fleischer's rapid fire machine gun like gags in short henry spots a puppy in the window of betty boop's pet shop it is a sort of love at first sight as henry attempts to purchase the little pup dog with the only money he had to coins in his pocket he is in formed by miss boop that it would be 2 00 in depression era money to make the purchase tears appear as the little guy leaves dejectedly br br but a reprieve is soon on the horizon as betty asks the boy to mind the store while she leaves on urgent business in return for his services miss betty promises him the little dog in return of course they have a deal and betty leaves br br getting to the work of cleaning cages and feeding the livestock affords the opportunity for the fleischer crew to fire up a whole new string of gags this time featuring bird seed henry's bald pate and push brooms but not all at once of course schultz henry's enthusiasm for mass feeding of the store's avian population by first literally seeding his head soon leads to a mass defection of the birds out of the store to the open street in a mass jail break br br betty returns to this sight and expresses her disappointment and anger with henry's temporary custodial care all bets were off no doggie for henry he begins to leave dejectedly but soon convinces the proprietress to give him another shot at fixing things up his head covered with bird seed he manages to corral all of the little feathered creatures returning them to their pet store coop happily the little fella leaves but this time he has his own affectionate little face licking puppy br br undoubetly this was a winning combination we have the carefree energy filled free wheeling of the boy the kindness of betty and the emotions of the situation and doubtful outcome of the 'boy and his dog' situation max and dave fleischer had given us a sort of almost minor mini masterpiece of a surreal comedy short br br we were quite surprised that no henry series followed judging by the fairly faithful treatment of the character it certainly could have been sustained for some time at any rate this teaming was in many ways the best of the betty boop try out pictures although the first popeye the sailor fleischer paramount 1933 was the most successful and barely had any betty boop in it save for a cameo as a carnival hula dancer the henry short was much better than the two following king features tryouts betty boop and the little king and betty boop and little jimmy both 1936 br br poodle schnitz
<START> the superb star quality of gerard philipe who died way too young leaps from the screen in this witty funny sly swashbuckling comedy with plenty of sword fencing and knockabout antics charmingly loopy in its' storytelling impossible to resist a sweet romantic comedy with a very young gina lollobrigida as the love interest a movie one will remember with great affection
<START> a sentimental story with a sentimental sound track it's about a little girl with a voice impediment who treasures her green parrot paulie the parrot thinks and talks like a human being and gives help and advice to his constant companion br br the parrot is definitely the star of the film at times mischievous and at times in fits of depression the bird captures the mood in a most remarkable and expressive way the synchronised voice too is very well done and within a minute or two you can actually believe that this intelligent little bird exists br br early in the film her father gives the bird to a pawnbroker and the subsequent scenes tell the story of paulie's constant struggle over many years to be re united with his mistress one of the many memorable scenes is when he falls into bad company and is encouraged to spy on people using the automatic teller machines paulie it seems has a phenomenal memory br br the ending is predictable but who would want it otherwise children will love this film and anybody who keeps a bird as a pet will delight in paulie's antics
<START> first of all if you'r a fan of the comic well you'll be very disappointed i'm sure low budget movie largo is supposed to be serbian in the comic now suddenly he becomes croatian pfff chicken producers it gave some spice and guts to the comic by the way in the film his father speaks serbian and he speaks croatian lol the striking n y winch building becomes a common average small yacht in h k the good looking largo becomes some unshaved tzigan turkish looking guy freddy the cool 'scarface' pilot becomes some fat out of shape sad average guy simon largo's good buddy does not exist at all he gave some pepper largo doesn't throw knifes at all but just some snake stares the whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious tv film french directors and producers if you don't have the money the ability or the technology to adapt correctly the comic please stick to some romance shooted in paris very very bad film good thing i just rented it don't count on me to watch the sequel if there is any
<START> i saw this on cable recently and kinda enjoyed it i've been reading the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half more than the first half personally i enjoyed the first story too bad that wasn't extended the second story i thought was cliched and that california dreaming if i hear that one more time chungking express is alright but it's not something that mainstream audiences will catch on to see like crouching tiger
