<START> swing is an important film because it's one of the remaining black produced and acted films from the 1930s many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable but this one is in fairly good shape it's also a nice chance to see many of the talented black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old cotton club a time all but forgotten today br br unfortunately while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances it's also a mess the main plot is very similar to the hollywood musicals of the era including a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day however the writing is just god awful and a bit trashy at times and projects images of black america that some might find a bit demeaning this is because before the plot really gets going you are treated to a no account bum who lives off his hard working wife a popular stereotype of the time and when he is caught with a hussy who by the way totally overplays this role they have a fight which looks like a scene from wwe smackdown and the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor a trashy scene indeed later in the film when the prima donna is behaving abominably her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him it seems like the film at times wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience plus they can't even do this well with some of the worst acting i've seen in a very long time br br still if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way with trashy characters bad acting and direction and poor writing this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten black culture just don't say i didn't warn you about the acting it's really really bad
<START> i two came home from school fast as i could to catch hrpuff and stuff on t v that was the most fun time in my life is to watch hrpuff and stuff on t v growing up still love it today i am 46 years old this year
<START> extremely tense thriller set in the urban chaos of sÃ£o paulo the biggest and ugliest third world nightmare in brazilian urbania for the sake of making it easy for anyone who is curious about this intriguing and truly well made film it has the grit of mexican feature amores perros with a character not too far off max cady from both cape fears although this is not by any means a film about a psychopath two partners alexandre borges and marco ricca in a construction company pay hitman anisio miklos to off their third partner and majority share holder in said construction outfit the murder is blamed on the city but things begin to look very grim indeed when witty and charismatic walking nightmare anisio decides he wants to be around the ever so nervous partners in crime not only trespassing but more importantly deconstructing the strict social codes that make up brazilian society anisio turns poverty into an attitude and he wants in the look is almost entirely handheld grainy the performances outstanding throughout especially so as first time actor and member of classic brazilian pop band 'titÃ£s' paulo miklos dazzles and baffles the viewer with his pretty funny social terror br br i saw the film at the brasÃ­lia film fest in november 2001 it has since done very well in sundance and berlin kleber mendonÃ§a filho
<START> when you see this movie you begin to realise what a drastically under utilised asset the late dudley moore was there should be a dozen movies like this in our archive br br he was already top notch talent before he went to hollywood both as a comedian and a musician but mostly he is remembered for his pairing with peter cook on television and in one or two indifferent british movies perhaps the best of these was 'bedazzled' br br he always tended to be eclipsed by cook who's jealousy and meanness rifted their partnership and enabled moore to realise his true potential in america 'arthur' is the result br br this is a truly splendid movie moore's clownish comedy as a drunkard is undeniable the script is perfectly suited to his manner with lot's of hilarious almost surreal conversational digressions there is something so british about him that i'm actually surprised he found such an appeal to american tastes tommy cooper an anarchic comedian after the same fashion tended to draw a blank it is moore's almost childish vulnerability that is so endearing br br liza minelli and john guilgud tend to play straight roles against him but still have some excellent one liners john guilgud in particular delivers his with a sarcastic and acerbic authority that is a treasure to watch he invariably steals any scene in which he features and thoroughly deserved his oscar correct me if i'm wrong but he has never played any other comic role br br there is a follow up movie called 'arthur 2 on the rocks' it never attains the same sublime levels of fun that this one reaches but it is still rather good even so guilgud only gets a cameo appearance at the beginning and as a ghost it is darker and there is some interesting soul searching it will disappoint if you watch 'arthur' first br br hollywood seemed to loose interest in cuddly dudley after these two outings he eventually returned to britain dejected and apparently dying br br but 'arthur' is a sample of what might have been we can only imagine the other great movies he should have made br br your're sadly missed dudley
<START> i wonder what audiences of the day thought when first laying eyes on walter jack palance blackie certainly he looks like no one else of the time that skull like face flattened nose and elongated body even now he remains an unsettling presence and what could be more appropriate than his emergence out of those dingy new orleans slums that appear to fester like the plague blackie is loosing on the city i'm just sorry he didn't have more scenes br br the movie itself is very skillfully assembledÂ the morgue's black humor the widmark douglas interplay the un touristy locations the battles among officialsÂall are woven into a tensely realistic thriller with a menace unlike others of the time even widmark's domestic scenes that put a woman bel geddes on the marquee manage not to be too disruptive director kazan certainly shows his aptitude for helming a studio fox product no matter how he may have felt about the commercial aspect br br widmark does a solid low key job as the public health officer but my money is on the one and only zero mostel was there ever a sweatier performer who could squeal louder or get pushed around more than the bulky fall guy e g the enforcer 1950 that scene with mostel where palance argues with mostel's shrewish wife liswood is a gem of frantic subservience as mostel tries to pacify each like some berserk pinball too bad he lost so many years to the blacklist i wonder if it was the voluble kazan who named him br br but it's not only the professionals that add color the locals add both character and authenticity especially the two asian guys interviewed by the cops that whole scene has an improvised air as if kazan recognized their potential and fashioned a nifty little scene on the spot then too that colorful hiring hall with all the deck hands is pure inspiration and what about those flea bitten coffee shops that have me running to the nearest denny's br br anyway the movie is still a well staged riveting thriller with an apocalyptic air that oddly foreshadows many of today's mega hits
<START> actually the answer only occupies a tiny portion of this excellent imax movie that educates us on our delicate selves c g and special cameras assisted by imax incredibly display the inner and outer workings of an average human be it adult men and women boys and girls or babies nearly every human body part aspect is specifically detailed digestion reproduction featuring a marvin gaye hit the heart etc some especially revealing moments include how an infant can be immersed underwater and also how the brain's impulses look it is amazing how we function br br the subject matter skips around an awful lot but at all times we still learn a hell of a lot about our bodies that we should be required to know
<START> i ve finished seeing the movie 10 minutes ago wow i still cant believe what i've watched br br this is absolutely the worst movie ever if i would list all the flaws in the movie this review would take me a lot of sentences very funny flaws because of being that bad though br br you got to be amazed with the skill of the commandos assigned to rescue the plane they didn't even know how to move br br ice t is so bad actor and the thing i don't understand is how the production wanted him to be like a hero but he's a zero br br of course the major flaws will be the landing of an 747 needing only 3 or 4 tips from a guy in transmission to land the plane amazing as well as the dead bodys that had almost no blood at all br br but i strongly recommend of watching this movie as its very interesting to see how bad can something get
<START> i have never seen a worse movie br br it is possible to take a shootem up video game and make it into a decent movie br br mistake 1 absolutely no connection to any of the characters in this movie you don't bond with any of the characters because you don't get a chance br br the only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is the deck hand salish as played by clint howard except for this unique character the outcome of the movie is meaningless as all the characters were lifeless from the begining br br mistake 2 the worst gunfight scene ever i love gunfights i love when the heros open up on the badguys and clean house heck i even like to watch a badguy clean house sometimes but this gunfight was weird i guess that the best way to describe it is apathetic i've seen people shoot with more feeling and emotion while playing the videogame in this movie it looked and felt like the actors were simply walking through shooting everything that moved without emotion br br why where's the trash talking where's the snarls of rage amongst the gunfire these are supposed to be kids that got caught at a rave gone bad but even real soldiers acting professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity br br if you want a good horror movie about a secluded house full of monsters i recomend sam rami's evil dead series do not see the disaster that is house of the dead i hope that they burn the master and all copies of this movie
<START> normally i don't watch action movies because of the fact that they are usually all pretty similar this movie did have many stereotypical action movie scenes but the characters and the originality of the film's premise made it much easier to watch david duchovny bended his normal acting approach which was great to see angelina jolie of course was beautiful and did great acting great cast all together a must see for people bored with the same old action movie
<START> jennifer cassi gina philips from dead and breakfast returns back to the house she grew up in which she recently inherited from her deceased sister unbeknownst to her grandmother fay dunaway who's still living in it jennifer decides to sell it as she's in dire need of the money much to granny's chagrin she also begins to have troublesome recurring nightmares of a mysterious raven there was really no one to relate to in this film jennifer seemed cold distant unsentimental and narcissistic whereas the grandmother seemed spiteful sad and also narcissistic the film is good and well made but with no one to empathize with i found it hard to care about what happened to them br br my grade c
<START> this could have been a very good film if i had been able to watch it the hand held camera was very bouncy from the opening credits i was worried several of us watching it felt very nauseous by the end but we did stay until the end because it was such a charming and interesting film giving some insight to the young pop culture in south africa the black and white film did enhance the artful feeling of it the acting seemed very authentic some of the dialog was a little hard to understand but a theater full of non south africans seemed to find most of it funny if you get motion sickness at all though you may seriously consider skipping this film it's quaint but not worth the nausea
<START> we're talking about a low budget film and it's understandable that there are some weaknesses no spoilers one sudden explosives expert and one meaningless alcoholic but in general the story keeps you interested most of the characters are likable and there are some original situations br br i really like films that surprise you with some people that are not who they want you to believe and then twist and turn the plot i applaud this one on that br br if you know what i mean try to see also nueve reinas nine queens a film from argentina
<START> i don't know why i'm taking the time to review this waste of time movie if you stick with it long enough in hopes of a satisfying conclusion Â good bad or surprising Â don't it finally fizzles out after stiff formulaic predictable dialogue and acting indoor scenes are so harshly lit you think if the camera were zoomed out one millimeter further you'd see the klieg lights costumes hair do's and sets are starched pressed and immaculate are we supposed to imagine common people really lived like that in early 20th century arizona other reviews' comparisons to sam peckinpah are an insult to peckinpah at least that director wove his violence into the context of chaos and mayhem hard men's gore is gratuitous exploding squibs from wooden impersonations of bad guys with manicured fingernails huh i can believe heston thought he might have been making something of worth with this film he does get to clutch his gun in his cold fingers but coburn i'll never guess why he signed up for this travesty want to see a movie about the end of the west as we knew it the end of westerns as we knew them watch the shootist or unforgiven again the last hard men is a mockery of an obituary to the western
<START> me neither but this flick is unfortunately one of those movies that are too bad to be good and too good to be awful which makes it utterly pointless and a total waste of time there's nothing more uninteresting than a mediocre movie and my name is modesty whatever the subtitle is takes mediocrity to a new level it's full of b actors but isn't any fun whatsoever because it takes itself seriously it sets itself up as a thriller but then turns into some kind of growing up drama flashback style the beautiful alexandra staden smothered beyond recognition under makeup more resembles a cast member from top model than modesty blaise i'm not one of those die hard comic book freaks who wants every adaptation of his precious graphic novels to be pitch perfect in fact i've never even read modesty blaise all i wanted was a decent movie to watch but this wasn't it the film feels half finished with a weak and very unexciting conclusion to a rather weak plot it also takes its audience for idiots explaining every tiny detail of the plot to us and showing flashbacks of things that happened three scenes ago i guess they think we all have alzheimers br br now i love a good b movie what's better than just turning your brain off and swallowing the cinematic equivalent of a calzone and modesty is directed by none other than scott spiegel who brought us the wonderful splatter crap flick from dusk till dawn 2 texas blood money i loved from dusk till dawn 2 because it brought everything a bad b movie should bring to the table nudity gore guns you name it modesty is just dull the flashback concerning modesty's life isn't interesting the acting isn't bad enough to be laughed at in fact i kinda liked nikolaj coaster waldau's hey buddy pseudonyms are your friends performance as the baddie br br so overall it's just lame weak uninspired call it what you will don't watch anything because tarantino presents it people this is just a very forgettable half hearted thriller and it never tries to be more than that allow me to round off this review with a very lame pun seriously even i'm cringing my name is modesty a modesty waste of time 4 10
<START> it had all the clichÃ©s of movies of this type and no substance the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it the production was good however the script and acting were b movie quality the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors the good actors didn't hold their own nor did they lift up the others br br this movie is not worthy of more words but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines james wood and cuba gooding jr play caricatures of themselves in other movies br br if you are looking for mindless entertainment i still wouldn't recommend this movie
<START> a charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town cats and death soon follow them that about sums it up br br i'll admit that i am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie but in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film and believe me there is plenty of that to go around it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience br br the characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on fear greed pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people although it can be argued that that seeming failing in actuality serves the telling of the story the supernatural premise and the fact that it is a stephen king screenplay not that i have anything specific against mr king are quite nicely supported by some interesting fx work makeup and quite suitable music the absolute gem of this film is without a doubt alice krige who plays mary brady the otherworldly mother br br king manages to take a simple story of outsider or people who are a little different okay a lot in this case trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan
<START> one of my favorite twilight zone episodes and the next day we were in the supermarket at hollywood blvd and la brea my father and i and guess who was coming toward us in the aisle barney phillips but no hat on at least i don't think he had a hat on br br we asked him about his third eye and he said something like he left it at home and everybody he met that day had asked him about it br br a friendly guy we used to see all kinds of character actors in la in those days br br btw i was a teenager and it took a long time for me to get over the three hands on the other alien br br robyn frisch o'neill br br hollywood native and resident 1947 to 1963
<START> this film pulls you in from the get go because it grabs our attention by acknowledging yeah that this story is opening with a clichÃ© Â a funeral br br in hands other than judi's i wouldn't have given it an 8 as this material has been done over and over again the great reunion of a once famous pick one please team army platoon theatre group singers band br br but this movie never stoops to cheap sentimentalization and when you think it is going to it swoops off in another direction a case in point is the flowers that are sent by an admirer to judi br br the band members are an interesting group and ride above the clichÃ©s too one is in jail one has found religion one is an alkie and one has sunk into dementia but the joie de vivre rediscovered by judi ignited by her granddaughter's interest carries us along and makes us overlook the sometimes simplistic nature of the plot br br the cast are a who's who of talent leslie caron the incomparable jazzist cleo laine with her amazing high notes a last performance from joan sims brava joan a cute as a button flirtatious ian holm having a ball and olympia dukakis as a money grabbing divorcÃ©e living in the highlands of scotland with her ghillie and her whiskey the closing scene is standard hollywoodland fare the judgmental children of the star converted to fun loving supporters the old lovers reunited the youngsters swept up in the old timers' music life should be this simple but i would watch it again and intend to with my own granddaughter for in the right hands sometimes one just loves these brazen old clichÃ©s 8 out of 10
<START> this is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen i rented it as a joke expecting to get a giggle out of the first few scenes and let me just say i've never laughed so hard in my life the first scene where ninjas randomly pop out of the air and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredibly funny stupid action movie moments of my life this is not a dinosaur movie but more a movie that makes fun and doesn't mean to at all of the action genre i didn't see the first two but judging by the complexity of the plot i don't think there's to much i missed if you wanna see a movie that goes great with a six pack or any herbal remedy than i insist you rent this movie and sit back and watch a 100 years of advancement in cinema get thrown in the trash and get shat on by carnosours
<START> honestly when i saw this movie years ago i immediately wanted to turn it off as i sat there for the next 10 minutes or so i realized that the actor playing navin stole the show his facial expressions and comedic demeanor makes me shake my head as to why he hasn't been in more comedies he has this marty feldman thing going for him but much much more talent taking nothing away from marty the movie really shocked me by how close it was to the original jerk but then again it was so much more i really think that if this movie was released first and i saw the steve martin movie 2nd i'd think the 2nd was a cheap rip off i know it sounds like a bold statement but it's true i actually like steve martin a great deal but his performance is 2nd to the actor in the jerk too i wish i could get a copy of it for my collection i urge you to see it if you can find it
