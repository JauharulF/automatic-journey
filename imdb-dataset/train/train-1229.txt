<START> over the years we've seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what keeping 8 simple rules going after john ritter died comes to mind but this is probably the first time i cared the idea of having that 70's show without eric or to a lesser extent kelso is ridiculous they tried to cover it up with a comeback of leo and increasingly outrageous story lines but it always felt like why bother when you don't have a main character anymore it just didn't really connect it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasn't even funny the last season felt like the season too much for every single character simply because eric used to take a lot of screen time and now we'd be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were focusing on the gimmick that is fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working because the whole deal was that he'd say something weird from out of nowhere and you can't say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours they also brought in the standard cousin oliver only this time it just wasn't a kid whenever you heard somebody knock on the door you started praying it wasn't randy please let it not be randy the deal with randy was that he'd do really awful jokes usually as red would say smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and donna would be in stitches i think more than half of the last season was donna pretending to be amused the problems had started earlier though what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasn't about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera everybody started being in love with everybody emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching as the world turns i'm guessing this was character development but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from family matters to be fair the last episode also because it had a cameo by topher grace a cameo in his own show was really good even if not that funny either br br by the way yet more criticism on season 8 what the hell was with the opening theme not only did they use the same joke twice a character not singing fez scared the hell out of me dude don't open your eyes that far but the first five seasons or so among the best comedy ever broadcast
<START> the movie had so much potential but due to 70's technology constraints and also a weak script killed the main plot of the film the book version of the film was much better and well conceived if it had been done right in the beginning with sources from the book it could have been a very cool classic
<START> an average tv movie quality totally formula story of religious fanatic ron perlman who gives good i'm not just the president of 'psychos r us ' i'm also a client who gets control of a biochemical virus think the virus from the movie the rock too bad for him that he also gets stuck in a bank building during an earthquake with bank robbers and the government agents trying to stop him led by the impressively physiqued mildly entertaining wolf larson backed by fred dryer along with the standard in the wrong place at the wrong time spunky female the forever bland erika eleniak and lived as a wimp but died as a hero at the last minute male brandon karrer has the standard background story to give sympathy to the religious fanatic wife and son killed in a police raid a few years previous br br basically a decent rainy day movie br br favorite line spoken by ron perlman after he finds the vial of the virus hidden in erika eleniak's cleavage a woman and her mystery br br worth a rent
<START> it's often said that tobe hooper just struck lucky with his grisly 1974 horror film 'the texas chain saw massacre' and every time i see another hooper film that view is only reinforced it would seem that hooper wanted to make his own version of films such as scanners and firestarter in 1990 and so we end up with spontaneous combustion a film with a couple of good ideas and a whole load more that are borrowed from other films put it all together and you get a messy boring film that most people would do well to miss the film leads the audience to believe that it might be half decent initially with an intriguing back story that focuses on some experiments carried out on two young people in the fifties the couple have a child and shortly thereafter burn to death as a result of the experiments done on them fast forward some years and the baby is now an adult named sam but naturally he's not a normal person and soon finds when it's discovered that he has the ability to set things on fire at will br br the film stars brad dourif who must have seemed like a good casting choice given his success with child's play two years earlier but actually was an uninspired decision as the central performance is really terrible and not helped by the terrible supporting performances the turgid direction and dull script also don't do the film many favours and the trend of lacking in favours is continued by the special effects which are very unrealistic and have nothing on the films that this one is ripping off all of which were made some years earlier the plot is really slow and it's almost an hour before anything of note happens and i didn't care for it even then it soon becomes obvious which direction the film will go in and it all boils down to the sort of tedious ending you would expect the final confrontation is a big disappointment and nothing is really explained during the film not that any revelation would have been interesting anyway overall this is a rubbish film and another reason why tobe hooper is a long way from being a great horror director see firestarter again instead
<START> i find myself comparing all stand up acts to this one performance now even older recorded performances i once thought were funny just don't seem as funny after seeing eddie izzard in this award winning look at history language disparities and englebert humperdink
<START> a terrible storyline amis at his worst pointless and self conscious 'decadence' obvious shock tactics and patchy acting make this film rather like rancid aluminium embody everything that went wrong with the much vaunted british film revival the humour is at best limp and the pretentiousness of the whole set up including some kind of internet terrorist group ooh how contemporary really begins to grate br br final summary a half baked attempt to be 'edgy' that does no one any favours still it's always a pleasure to see katy carmichael on screen br br
<START> this was on the 30th anniversary dvd for blazing saddles itself brilliant but not this nowhere did i see mel brook's name on here and i can guess why he's got a lot more sense to not be associated with this pilot my gawd who would find this funny sure there may be a race issue but for me it just wasn't funny well cause it's simply not funny it's like the writers didn't even try to be funny just to cash in on being tied with blazing saddles did they expect this show to go for several seasons when they made this pilot flat out they didn't care it was a quick cash cow which thank god didn't cash out i guess it's useful for historical purposes only or only to demonstrate how stupid and unimaginative hollywood writers can be
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this true to form take on the dick tracy persona this is a well done product that used modern technology to craft a imagery filled comic era story if you are a fan of or recently watched some of the old dick tracy b w movies then you're sure to get a kick out of this rendition the pastel colors and larger than life characters rendered in a painstakingly authentic take on an era gone by is entertainment as it's meant to be i personally find madonna's musical element to be a major part of this film the cd featuring her music from this movie is one i've listened to often over the years it's just so well done and performed musically and tuned to that era in my mind madonna's finest moment both on screen but especially musically this is sure to bring out the kid in you
<START> i saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources i would like to point out that if your not ready to try and work out continuously who is who and what it all means you will hate this film br br i am still struggling to understand the roles of the actors in this film the film jumps from different stories and does not allow you to really empathise with any of the roles br br for the political buff's and those interested in corruption in other world governments out there this film is probably quite good but to the average movie watcher this film is awkward very boring in places and you will leave the cinema confused and annoyed that you paid the entrance fee br br see it if your ready to focus 100 on every minute detail or politics interest you don't see it if you actually like watching films
<START> well the movie isn't exactly funny br br okay i admit there are a few humorous lines but definitely nothing that is laugh out loud funny for example right before a steamy sex scene between eleniak and one of her male costars sh is handcuffed to the bedpost and he cannot remove her shirt before leaving the room to retrieve the key he tells her okay don't go anywhere br br see humorous but not funny br br the plot and acting are pretty good br br but erika eleniak definitely steals the show she's hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that one can't help but rewind and re watch br br there are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines br br overall 5 stars i'd only give it three if not for erika eleniak
<START> wow i loved this film it may not have had the funding and advertising that the latest hollywood blockbusters get but it packs twice the emotional punch the tale revolves around this one family from utah and it's the connections between the people in the family that provide the film with its punch the main lead giovanni ribisi plays his part very well at no time does he leave you to believe that he's acting all his feelings it's his brother elias koteas who stole the show for me though when the two were in scenes together they bounded their lines off of each other giving fantastic performances great cast great film
<START> i'm really surprised this movie didn't get a higher rating on imdb it's one of those movies that could easily get by someone but for romantic comedy moonstruck is really in a class by itself it's setting and ethnic charm are things people seem to take for granted the casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie few movies in the 1980's were as good as moonstruck and it's funny too out of
<START> this movie is a re write of the 1978 warren beatty movie heaven can wait but it is written for the stand up comedic style of mr rock the premise remains the same lance barton rock is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with god's representative mr king to come back to earth as someone else as in beatty's movie he chooses the murdered charles wellington a rich white man all because he fancies sontee jenkins regina king who happens to turn up at wellington's house during the murder the role of mrs wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multi millionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo sontee simply does not work also the intercuts used to show rock as wellington and then as the real 'white' wellington fail miserably improvements could have been made to the original beatty plot which in itself did not masterfully portray the life after death idea but they certainly were not to be found in down to earth
<START> i couldn't believe some of the horrible dialog coming out of people's mouths and the end reel of bloopers attached to body of the film was a real hoot and we get titty shots of angelique pettyjohn sort of and loren crabtree to boot br br a teleportation device activated by psychic angelique pettyjohn brings an alien container to an underground lab out in the desert according to director fred olen ray they were leftover sets from the klaus kinski film android which gives the film an increased value beyond how cheap it looks br br inside the container is a midget alien played by ray's son who starts clawing people to death it was pretty funny watching this little 'creature' in a black reptile suit with what looks like large beetle shells attached to it running around in the dark we even get to see the little thing stamp and tear at a poster of et which i thought was hilarious br br and then there's what looks like a snake that also comes out of the container that gets hammered to death by william fair after the mini creature chews into frank mcdonald's neck in the kitchen a low budget take on alien i suppose br br the whole thing ends abruptly looking like they ran out of film at the end before the blooper reel comes in with the end credits talk about a lack of funding br br fred olen ray also mentions in the director's commentary that they also weren't sure if aldo ray would make through the shooting and remember his lines he barely did br br low budget cheese sneeze it's fun to watch i'll grant ya that br br 4 out of 10
<START> a hint i think may be gathered by the various comments on this thread br br i was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film who want to make it mandatory or compulsory br br i think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying it is so polarizing br br the global warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to force others to do right it appeals particularly to more liberal leaning people because it doesn't have to do with bedroom morality which is what usually gets conservatives who want to force you to be good going br br and that's the problem with the film al gore is a politician and a very successful one at that he just can't help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would the political appeal is just too great br br and there we are left with a scientific issue that may be of huge importance reduced to a political issue appealing to those in the body politic with a predilection to force other to do right br br another interesting question is how did the environmental movement get hijacked by such people
<START> spoilers br br i wasn't sure what to think of the movie not too much of a kids film definately should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying but i was surprised that i was a bit entertained by it br br i was a bit disappointed by the 81 minutes of time we had even less without the credits and the trailer gets you to think the rodent is a main creature but alas they torture him right until the end of the movie those two gripes docked the movie 2 stars but i do recommend the movie even for a sequel br br 8 10 br br quality 9 10 entertainment 7 10 replayable 7 10
<START> this isn't among jimmy stewart's best films i'm quick to admit that however while some view his film as pure propaganda i'm wondering what's so wrong with that yes sure like the tv show the fbi this is an obvious case of the bureau doing some pr work to try to drum up support but as entertainment goes it does a good job plus surprisingly enough for the time it was made the film focuses more on crime than espionage and commies instead it's a fictionalization of one of the earliest agents and the career he chose now considering the agent is played by jimmy stewart then it's pretty certain the acting and writing were good as this was a movie with a real budget and a studio who wasn't about to waste the star in a third rate flick so overall it's worth seeing but not especially great
<START> ok first of all ignore the last person' review they admit to falling asleep through it so it's no wonder they didn't understand what was going on as thriller horrors go this film ain't too bad it is certainly very watchable right from the opening scenes you get a general idea exactly what is going to be the cause of all the craziness that follows and come the end you are proved right with everything being made clear br br i enjoyed this movie it was quite eerie at times and as old films go it was passable great to watch late at night i give it a generous 7 out of 10
<START> i waited until the 4th of july to write this because well because it just feels right to be doing it on this day br br in 1924 d w griffith needed a hit he had not had a big one since orphans of the storm 1921 he'd been working steadily since then but his movies had been smaller in scope and had failed to hit the right chord with audiences he was planning a film about patrick henry when he was contacted by members of the daughters of the american revolution dar who asked if he might expand his ideas to encompass more of the american revolution this movie is the result by the time he had finished he had a 14 reel history lesson and there wasn't a trace of patrick henry anywhere br br we all know the story of the revolutionary war but griffith threw in a love story with patriot farmer nathan neil hamilton falling in love with tory aristocrat nancy montague carol dempster a leading lady for griffith for many years complicating matters is the fact that nancy's father hates nathan well not just nathan he hates all rebels it does not help matters when during a skirmish on the streets of lexington someone jostles nathan's arm causing him to discharge his gun and accidentally wound nancy's dad br br paralelling the love story is the mostly true but partially embellished story of capt walter butler lionel barrymore a renegade british officer who feels he owes allegiance to no one with thousands of indians form the six nations on his side he hopes to crush the colonials and become monarch of his own empire br br comparisons with birth of a nation 1915 are inevitable the montague family might just as well be the cameron's from the earlier film while nathan could be a part of the stoneman family the sequence of the battle of bunker hill is staged very similarly to a scene in birth of a nation with the attacking army in this case the redcoats storming a trench packed with patriots the only thing missing is henry walthall charging across no man's land to stuff a flag into the muzzle of a cannon amazingly enough the battle scenes in america seem to lack the energy of the battle scenes in birth and fail to draw the audience in something is clearly missing it isn't scope g w billy bitzer's camera work is quite good maybe what is missing is dare i say it sincerity br br the brutality of capt butler and his men is well underscored although much of it happens in long shot or offscreen don't expect any heads to be lopped off in closeup like we saw in intolerance 1916 in one scene butler's second in command capt hare louis wolhiem gouges out the eyes of a captive colonist we see only the beginning of the deed for the remainder the camera focuses on hare's face as he obviously has a good time doing this lionel had been working with griffith on and off since 1912 a story goes that he approached griffith for work and d w knowing the reputation of his famous family said i am not hiring stage actors to which lionel replied and i am nothing of the kind sir he makes a very good and quite believable villain louis wolhiem appeared with lionel's older brother john three times in sherlock holmes and dr jekyll and mr hyde both 1920 and later in the tempest 1927 as capt hare his wild staring eyes and disheveled hair not only mark him as a villain but make you think he is quite mad also br br neil hamilton later remarked that america was his first time on horseback and i was scared to death he hides his displeasure very well though and we can believe he was quite the equestrian by the time shooting was over mr griffith was very much in love with carol dempster and at one point asked her to marry him she refused and soon left his stock company after which her star status gradually waned br br speaking of horses one accidentally amusing moment which had to be unscripted came during the depiction of paul revere's ride he rides his horse right up on the front porch of a family to announce to arms the regulars are coming but as he tries to leave the horse cannot negotiate the steps backwards and stumbles spilling his rider on the ground i am amazed griffith did not do another take br br so is america a classic yes don't wait for july 4th to see it it is enjoyable anytime
<START> disney has now made straight to video sequels to a good bunch of their many animated features two of these were made for their 1991 classic beauty and the beast well these ones aren't really sequels as they are both set in between the events of the first film the first of these two straight to video films was beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas which seems to be disliked by quite a few fans of its theatrical predecessor but i think that can usually be expected with sequels however this second one belle's magical world is definitely inferior br br the film features three short stories all of which take place while belle is in the castle and the place is under the spell of the enchantress the first is the perfect word where a misunderstanding at the table between belle and the beast leads to trouble and neither wants to be the first to apologize the next story is fifi's folly where fifi and lumiere's fifth anniversary is coming up and lumiere is unprepared so belle helps him however fifi sees lumiere practicing romance with belle and thinks they're actually in love the film ends with the broken wing in this story belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing but a bird in the castle will probably mean trouble if the beast finds out as he hates birds br br the plot description i gave is for the original vhs version of disney's third beauty and the beast movie apparently in the dvd version there is another story added called mrs potts's party but i've only seen the original version however since i highly doubt that one story would stand out as a classic over the rest i see no point in watching the special edition anyway the first thing i will say about belle's magical world is that the animation is very 2 dimensional compared to what we're used to from disney which would obviously disappoint many people i didn't like beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas that much but you certainly can't say the same about its animation i'm sure the stories in belle's magical world could entertain many kids mostly younger ones i think and each story has a moral so they could also teach them some valuable lessons however for adults the film really doesn't have a lot i personally didn't find any good humour in it found that the constant conflict between belle and the beast got tiring and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way they're not very well written in the perfect word the way belle says to the beast you're acting rude and foolish is a bit cheesy and i think there are quite a few other cheesy moments in these stories br br by the time this straight to video movie first came out i was around eleven or twelve years old i don't know what i would have thought of it at the time as i had lost interest in disney by then and it would be years before i would gain any of that interest back even when this movie was first released i think i was a bit past the age group it was aimed at i never saw beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas until a couple months ago but unlike that film i never even heard of this one until recently i think just after seeing the first sequel to disney's 1991 hit well as much as i like the theatrical original i wouldn't have been missing much if i never became aware of this film's existence for little kids i'm sure belle's magical world can be highly entertaining and probably somewhat educational with its morals but i do not recommend it for adult disney fans
