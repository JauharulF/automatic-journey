<START> this movie is bad news and i'm really surprised at the level of big name talent who would ever agree to appear in such a piece of junk as this i imagine there were a few strangled agents sprawled across hollywood blvd as a result of this fiasco what really gets you is that it could have been good the directors star appeal and the subject matter was sufficient fodder to spark interest and ticket sales but this is a flop the multiple story lines all go from bad to silly by the pictures end and you end up feeling like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten what spike is able to achieve is revenge against any italians who may have beat him up when he was a kid or insulted him as the movie does quite a number on perpetuating outdated and probably offensive italian stereotypes as with any spike lee film there is some really thought provoking and magical camerawork he does have the gift of grabbing your psyche and transporting you into his vision if only for a few memorable scenes but the question remains can you endure the other 2 hours of head scratching and clock watching as you wonder and wait for the ending that has to be there somewhere
<START> despite being a 2001 movie the direction is the kind of 90's art house style that was considered old and out of date a few years ago the cheesy cuts and effects were painful to watch the script is decent enough and a few scenes did kind of captivate me like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night but the story line with the detective who's sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was just plain terrible the performance by the actor who plays selma blair's married boyfriend seriously bothered me i did sit through the whole thing though which is rare for the kind of random what is this movie you just find on tv and decide to watch
<START> this film is in short a cinematic masterpiece the film is moved along brilliantly by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer the film opens during the spanish civil war as a group of children seek their revenge on another child in fact they are acting out in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them later we meet three of these children again as adults at a sanatorium here we see what life has wrought on each of them one is a reclusive sexually repressed patient another man is a hustler who has become ill the third child a young lady has become a nun and is serving at the sanatorium this film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche br br this film has a climax that is definitely not for the squeamish members of the viewing audience but it is logical as well as profoundly moving the acting is excellent and the script is quite well written there is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of dread throughout this film this is not a film for thrill seekers but a film for a thoughtful audience
<START> it's hard to say which comes out on top james cagney's charm and energy or the mouth opening excesses of busby berkeley's three grand showstoppers at the close i give it a tie with footlight parade one of the funniest and quickest of the early thirties musicals although the movie clearly belongs to cagney joan blondell adds immeasurably to the good natured story line br br and what's the story line it's about chester kent cagney who produces musicals and who now is just about out of business as the talkies take over he starts doing prologues live musical entertainment offered on stage before a movie starts he gets the idea to do bigger ones and more of them moving them around the country he's a ball of fire and ideas and he needs all the ideas he can get to keep relentlessly producing these things but a rival is spying on him and stealing his ideas nan prescott blondell his wise cracking secretary loves him but he's too busy too notice an office girl in black rimmed round glasses ruby keeler wants a chance to dance his wife turns up saying she didn't divorce him after all a blonde gold digger is setting her hooks in him his partners are cheating him my gosh what's next this may all sound like a lot to digest but everything happens fast with cagney bouncing strutting striding finger snapping barking orders and occasionally until the big last number when he goes all out singing and dancing doing a step or two just to show how it's done br br instead of let's put on a show gang we have we need to build three shows in three days so lock the doors and let's start rehearsing these three super prologues are going to feature 40 chorines spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract with forty kent units in deluxe movie houses the whole apollo movie house circuit exhaustion threatens feet ache but all those unbilled chorines in skimpy costumes which include ann sothern and dorothy lamour you can quickly spot sothern but lamour is more generic stay the course dancing their hearts out giggling and chattering and looking remarkably unsweaty br br and then the curtains go up as each prologue is presented in separate movie houses one after the other on the same night with the owner of the apollo circuit going to determine that night whether he'll save chester's skin or not br br first up is honeymoon hotel with dick powell and ruby keeler in a 9 minute production number that features a lot of wholesome lasciviousness with brides and grooms some might even be married bedrooms and beds and doors with do not disturb signs br br then on to the next theater and 11 minutes of by a waterfall that probably had the warner brothers accountants worrying about bankruptcy this number is so excessive dozens of swimming girls trees fountains a huge grotto with waterslides a giant pool you'd never think there was a depression on berkeley pulls out all his tricks synchronization human patterns legs and arms doing all sorts of precision things and he does it in the water with a lot of underwater photography looking up the girls are sure game they come up smiling with water in their eyes and still hit their marks the whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting ruby keeler who has a couple of quick shots in the water is the only one who looks a bit cautious br br and finally the smash finale 11 minutes of cagney dancing and singing with keeler to shanghai lil with all sorts of bar girls and their customers unusual in that the races are mixed up there's cagney and keeler dancing on the bar dancing on a table cagney fighting there are what looks like fifty or sixty marching marines hupping back and forth rifles tossed and caught then this is true a human picture forms of franklin roosevelt and the nra eagle this may be the only hollywood musical production that has ever featured roosevelt a big federal agency and a bevy of sexy chinese prostitutes br br that's entertainment folks it's great br br of course chester's prologues get the big contract and nan gets chester the movie is full of juicy clichÃ©s that make us smile ruby keeler is so endearing as she earnestly stomps out her taps with her arms flying that you want to help her along joan blondell makes us forget about a lot of hollywood females who might have been more beautiful but who had a lot less wit and personality the movie however belongs to cagney who grabs and shakes it and to berkeley a man for whom too much was never too much
<START> this film had so much promise i was very excited about this film in the end it was laughable at best painful at worst the acting styles ran the gamut from really really flat the angels the wife and daughter to over animated casper's character i felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other pay special attention to the scene regarding the bug it's pretty much an insult to the audience's ability to figure things out in defense of that scene though it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie i had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations too bad they didn't make use of it i didn't feel like i was transported to exotic locations anybody could insert stock footage of the coliseum in rome however to end on a positive note i thought the sets were pretty good i really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers it is my opinion and that's all it is that if the schmaltz factor would have been much much lower and the action factor would have been greatly increased this film would have been good
<START> i have seen a lot of movies in my life but not many as bad as this it is a movie that makes fun of fat people has no real story has bad actors is not funny and much more is this a movie that you would like to see i guess not br br i guess that the makers of the movie was trying to be original and creative but it looks like it was made by a 12 year old child with absolutely no cinematic skills at all the so called funny parts is as funny as throughing pies in the faces of people or breaking wind of cource if this is the kind of humour that you like then this is the movie for you br br dont waste your money on this movie
<START> you believe in god or you don't you believe in jesus or you don't you believe he is the son of god or you don't the choice is up to you br br director denys arcand has really done everything he could to bring back jesus to a mere historic figure social worker son of two humans instead of the son of god the holy spirit and mary who opened heaven again for us encouraging the big bang a world come from evolution instead of seeing the beauty of creation the film depicts a theologian bringing some modern findings to the actor who plays jesus in the passion play who happily incorporates them in his play br br the depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where the passion play is performed in montreal has a sexual relation with one of the female players of the passion play instead of showing his love for god through celibacy more often than not the director's abhorrence of the church is clearly visible br br the director has tried to make a parallel between jesus' life and the passion play actor's life this is an admirable attempt but depicting the resurrection with the transplantation of the passion play actor's organs in other bodies signifies how the director thinks about jesus br br my opinion is not important god's opinion is but i wouldn't want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when standing before jesus' throne
<START> this movie was for a while in my collection but it wasn't before a friend of mine reminded me about it Â until i decided that i should watch it i did not know much about close to leo Â just that it was supposed to be excellent coming out of age movie and it deals with a very serious topic Â aids br br although the person who has aids Â is leo Â the scenario wraps around the way in which marcel the youngest brother of leo coupes with the sickness of his relative at first everyone is trying to hide the truth from marcel Â he is believed to be too young to understand the sickness of his brother Â the fact that leo is also a homosexual contributes to the unwillingness of the parents to discus the matter with the young marcel i know from experience that on many occasions most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young this does not automatically means that he will not be able to accept the reality and act in more adequate manner then even themselves with exception of the fact that the family tried to conceal the truth from marcel they have left quite an impression for me Â the way they supported their son Â even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and his sickness the fact that they allowed the young marcel to travel along with leo to paris to meet his ex boyfriend was quite a gesture from themÂ most families i know will be reluctant to do that there is a lot of warmth in the scenes in which the brothers spend some time together Â you can see them being real friends concern about each other br br close to leo is an excellent drama which i strongly recommend
<START> just watched this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself seriously even if you read all the negative comments on here you will be nowhere near able to comprehend how awful this film actually is although it has to be one of the most hilarious things i have ever seen never bothered to post a comment on here before but this piece of crap really warrants it br br firstly the entire plot is ridiculous and nonsensical brother of the lead character either ben or arthur i forget which is which and frankly it's never very clear wants to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight because homosexuality is abhorrent to christians but apparently mass murder isn't then there's some other crap thrown in about one of the gay couple's ex wife trying to force him to remarry her at gunpoint this leads to nothing but provides us with one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole film i don't make sense you don't make sense that's who makes sense brilliant br br then there's the acting which is just atrocious it must be seen to be believed my personal favourite is the apparently stoned civil rights lawyer woman who is clearly reading her lines off of something yet still managing to mess them up enough said the gay couple couldn't be less convincing there's the vaguely attractive and completely gormless guy and his boyfriend who looks like that little cartoon dough man of the bisto adverts only fatter and less talented br br the film has also been filmed by someone who is incapable of holding a camera even remotely still and the number of mistakes throughout is amazing the whole thing kicks off with the fat main guy in bed with a pair of boots on yep br br but anyways we all know how terrible this thing is so i'd like to highlight some of the most priceless comedy moments that the film provides br br when the fat guy sets the church on fire and then prances like a six year old girl across the car park to make his escape hilarious br br mildread no idea what relation she is to the main characters sometimes they know her sometimes they don't but she pops up in a couple of scenes nonetheless hilarious br br the stoned lawyer already mentioned her but she's so funny she's worth another mention br br the evil brothers dinner of crackers that he lays on for his guests br br the evil brother's anti gay potion br br the evil brother's cats br br the ending which i won't give away because it must be seen to be believed i warn you though make sure you're not eating at the time the tub of lard main character director producer gets naked it's foul br br basically ben and arthur is indescribably bad but unintentionally the most comical thing you'll see for a long time literally nothing is good about this excuse for a film the goon of a director even manages to make the opening credits into a joke by writing his own name about 15 times
<START> astonishing screams the la times from the front of the dvd box they must have been referring to the fact that such a sorry piece of crap was ever released the film revolves around a bunch of girls who have a disease which forces them to become cannibals and murder innocent people just to stay alive their skin peels off throughout the film we also see severed legs heads etc that are about as convincing as a halloween fuzzy felt set there is an awful lot of talking b ll ks a bit of human cuisine and some weird zombie hunter chap who imprisons the sufferers of said skin illness in his closet strapped to a chair before stabbing them in the head chopping them into bits br br you get the picture considering there is no acting talent on display at all and the gore is laughably unrealistic what is the point of this whole farrago again looking at the video box the guy responsible for it is an underground cult director would that be like those weird religious cults where they brainwash you into thinking one way when clearly the opposite is true because that's the only possible reason i can think of for anyone to derive pleasure by watching this tax write off then on the same paragraph he compares himself to mike leigh ken loach and george romero hahahahaha oh stop it now you're just being silly br br do you enjoy this film are you offended by the above opinion if so you must be a member of said cult do they pocket your wages do they let you see other family members do they force you to watch andrew parkinson films till you think he's the best director since a hitchcock do tell this sounds like a panorama special brewing to me and say hello to the critic of the la times when you return to your colony will you 0 10
<START> before watching this film i had very low expectations and went to just see the cars eventually i even regretted going for that reason plot is almost non existent character development is non existent so many clichÃ©s and so much jaw dropping cheesiness existed in the movie that i could only stare and wonder how it was even released if not for the exotics i wouldn't have even rated this movie a 1 an attempt at a coherent story line is destroyed by the sheer absurdity of this elite racing cult and the laughable characters that make up its members in fact the movie's plot is so predictable and simple minded that an average child could foretell the majority of the storyline bad acting bad plot bad jokes bad movie br br don't see it play gran turismo hd instead and it'll satiate your thirst for fast sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste
<START> i saw this movie again as an assignment for my management class were to mainly comment on the different management styles and ideas on quality of the product i did rent this one back in the eighties and i remember it to be good but not great movie i've always liked michael keaton's style and delivery he was a perfect fit for the movie br br i am surprised to see some of the low ratings for this movie i grant you yes it's no oscar winner but it does have decent comedic value it's more of a subtle comedy rather than a all out comedy farce i also find some of those that felt this was an inaccurate film on cultural and business differences i beg to differ i grant you again that there are a lot of generalities and dramatizations but then again this is hollywood film not a documentary from what i've read about differences between automakers on both sides of the pacific at that time many of the principle ideas were accurate for the time br br some of the basic differences were that japanese workers made to feel as part of the company as a whole teamwork was emphasized they perhaps made the company above all else where american workers had more of a management verses labor type of relationship the individual was more important than the company i'll probably get some hate email over that comment i'm sure br br another difference was how quality was viewed and whose responsibility it was to fix in many japanese plants defects or problems are examined and fixed at the time it is discovered rather as one character in the movie put it it was the dealers meaning car dealer problem br br many of these things are probably dated but i'm sure some are still around as many us car makers are still struggling to keep up with the japanese if one is more interested in the subject of american european and japanese automakers i can recommend a book that studies this subject in more detail and was done around the same time period the book is called the machine that changed the world by james womack daniel jones and daniel roos it's about a study of automakers during and before the time period that this movie covers parts are bit dry but i think you'll find that it backs up much the movie also
<START> i was so eager to see this one of my favorite tv shows i saw universal trademark followed with a newly acquainted title and theme song which still impress me computer animation on some scenery like a solid title name the jetsons or a dimension view of a spaceship approaching an amusement park and more made this version splendid and fantastic shortly after that till the end i couldn't believe my eyes how lucky i was that i could forget all i had seen just songs by tiffany and its theme song in new arrangement were in my head anyway i wish to see this space aged family also the flintstones and yogi bear in all graphic computer design as toy story or bug's life the best style for hanna barbera's in my opinion
<START> lee chang dong's exceptional secret sunshine is the single most emotionally ravaging experience of the year it is an instantly sobering brutally honest character piece on the reverberations of loss and a graceful memento mori that resonates with a striking density of thought yet remains as inscrutable as the emotions it observes through its layered naturalism and stunningly trenchant view of small town dynamics lee implicitly deconstructs the traditional korean melodrama by pulling apart the cinematics of excess and ripping to shreds the arcs that shape its characters and grounds the proceedings into a crushing grind of stoic realism br br secret sunshine remains an immensely compelling fluid work throughout its 142 minute runtime its bravura first hour is filled to the brim with subtextual insinuations remarkable foreshadowing and adroit reversals of tone brought about by humanistic capriciousness adapted from a short story lee infuses the film with his sensitivity for the sublime paradoxes of life last seen in his transgressively comic and irreverent oasis understanding how personal revolutions are forged when views of our universe are changed lee not only sees the emotional cataclysm of a widow's sorrow through an inquiring scope but also feels the tumultuous existential currents that underpin the film when religion becomes a narrative scapegoat in comprehending the heinousness of the human experience br br do yeon jeon's you are my sunshine best actress accolade at cannes in 2007 is well deserved her performance as the widow shin ae remains an unrelenting enigma as a character pulled apart by forces beyond her control the sheer magnificence of this performance is central to the film's turbulent nature with jeon essaying one cyclonic upheaval after another there's a tremulous sense of collapse that the film to its credit never approaches instead it finds a delicate balance that saps the charged theatricality and subsequent banality from ordinary tragedies and its fallouts she becomes the centre of the film's universe as well as ours filmed in glorious hand held cinemascope the film demolishes the cinematicism of frames and compositions by becoming visually acute just as it is quietly harrowing when the camera never relinquishes its gaze from shin ae through times of happiness guilt and remorse br br lee captures the details of life in the small suspicious town of miryang Â the awkwardness of communal situations its uncomfortable silences and its devastations spun out of personal dramas shin ae's interactions with the townsfolk rarely inspires dividends especially when they are merely done out of obligation to fit in for the sake of her son jun seon jung yeop the one recurring acquaintance is jong chan song kang ho a bachelor mechanic of uncertain intentions who helps her en route to miryang in the film's enchanting open sequence set to a captivating stream of sunlight song has situated himself as a comedic anti hero in south korea's biggest films but his nuanced low key delivery here purports the director's thought process of never having to reveal more than plainly necessary br br if pain is ephemeral then grief can never truly dissipate and lee finds complexity in subsistence when shin ae attempts to head down the path of reconciliation only to be faced again with unimaginable heartbreak she unsuccessfully employs the fellowship of evangelical christianity as a foil to her sorrow but lee knows better than that when he understands that religion in the context of the human canvas of strife and misery is never a simple solution but lee never rebukes the essence of religion as he realises the value of salvation for some through a higher power even if it serves a form of denial in others the scenes in its latter half which deal with religion doesn't allow itself to become aggressively scornful which is a feat in itself considering how many filmmakers let the momentum of the material take over from what they need to say to be true to its story and characters br br lee's first film since his call to office as his country's minister of culture and tourism is an uncompromising dissertation on human suffering in a film so artless and genuine it arduously reveals that there's nothing as simple as emotional catharsis just the suppression and abatement of agony secret sunshine leaves us with tender mercies pulled out of evanescence and points towards a profound understanding of despair and faith
<START> you can't really go far when the initial story isn't all that great the premise of cyborg's needing blood is just dopey br br the script is blasÃ©' the actors don't have much to work with the sets were staged out in the desert to cut costs it's a trademark that if the background is the desert then the movie has no budget br br lack of budget is okay if there's a story solarbabies and blood of champions are examples of decent work from no but this movie looks as if they had to scrape their change together just to buy the cameraman a sandwich again forgivable if only the story didn't just plain suck br br finally this movie commits the biggest crime of all it doesn't finish it simply ends as if it's a commercial break away from the rest of the movie but the rest never comes just odd br br just bad
<START> the story is seen before but that does'n matter if you can figure out to make a proper storyboard it is clear that the director haven't spent his work on the storyboard alongside this the cameraman spent far too much time leaning angles that do not match the message of the movie the funniest is however if you take a look at the movie's website you can read that it was on purpose that the director has chosen to make the film with bad camera angles because it remind us about hunting but i have never heard of hunting with poor camera angles it will have 1 stars because the story is ok it is a pity that ti west has not spent more time to review his story it is as if the movie was more important than the planning because you have a camera does not mean you should make a movie right away come everyone can make a movie but not all will be just as good so a word of advice to ti west are stop and labeling what you want use your time to start planning and not filming until everything has come down on a storyboard you certainly have the ability and desire so don't abuse your talent
<START> i did not expect a lot from this movie after the terrible life is a miracle it turns out that this movie is ten times worse than life i have impression that director writer is just joking with the audience let me see how much emptiness can you audience sustain dialogues are empty scenario is minimalistic in few moments photography is really nice few sarcastic lines are semi funny but it is hard to genuinely laugh during this comedy i've laughed to myself for being able to watch the movie until the end if you can lift yourself above this director's fiasco you will find good acting of few legends miki manojlovic aleksandar bercek and very good performance of emir's son stribor kusturica br br in short too bad for such a great director emir kusturica is still young and should be making top rated movies instead he chooses to do this low budget just for my private theater movie with arrogant attitude toward the world trends and negligence toward his old fans
<START> i'd read about flavia the heretic for many years but i only got to see it early last year when i went on an insane movie buying binge and for whatever reason it has been on my mind lately though it's been some months since i watched it br br it's a striking film set in italy somewhere around the 15th century definitely medieval era though i don't think any specific year is ever given this being the time of christian ascendancy the age is a time of utter madness and the movie captures this very well br br flavia our protagonist is a young lady who encounters a fallen muslim on a battlefield he seems a warm and intriguing fellow and she's immediately taken with him her father a soldier of a a family of some standing comes along almost immediately and murders the wounded man right before her eyes but she'll continue to see him in her dreams br br her father ships her off to a convent that seems more like an open air insane asylum the residents so harshly repressed by unyielding medieval christianity slowly go mad flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns but in a mad world only the sane are truly mad and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the insanity around her her take on the times in which they live strikes a chord with flavia who being young and apparently sheltered is beginning to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trapped br br the movie is unflinching in its portrayal of that world showcasing a lot of unpleasantness we see a horse gelded a lord rape one of the women of his lands in a pig sty the pious torture of a young nun through it all flavia observes and questions rejecting eventually the christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would gain the movie some criticism over the years for seeming anachronistic i disagree with that criticism flavia's views though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely mirror for example then contemporary feminist commentary the movie was made in 1974 revolve around what are really pretty obvious questions it is perhaps difficult to believe she could be so much of a fish out of water in her own time but that's the sort of minor point it doesn't do to belabor flavia is written in such a way to allow those of our era or of any era to empathize with her plight getting bogged down on such a matter would be missing the forest for the trees br br flavia is heartened when the muslims arrive invading the countryside and she finds in their leader a new version of the handsome islamist who still visits her dreams smitten with her almost immediately he allows her to virtually lead his army becoming a joan of arc figure in full battle gear and directing the invaders to pull down christian society and wreak vengeance upon all those she's seen commit evil br br is she the herald of a new and better world she may think so but muslims of that era weren't big on feminism either as she soon learns the hard way as they say meet the new boss br br this is really just a thumbnail of some of the things that happen in flavia the heretic the movie is quite grim and with a very downbeat rather depressing ending not a mass audience movie at all to be sure it's quite good though and doesn't belong on the nunsploitation pile on which it is often carelessly thrown i think there's much value in the final film and i'm glad i saw it
<START> home alone 3 is one of my least favourite movies it's the cream of the crop or s if you tend to be more cynical as it ranks up or down there with stuff like battlefield earth and flinstones viva rock vegas in fact it could even be worse than those two since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity this just made me cringe in pain constantly and clap when the credits started rolling no other movie has made me cringe in pain now i will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious br br first off the plot is ridiculous it revolves around a chip in a remote control car that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it dumb stuff br br the action that ensues is similar to that of the other two home alones with boobytraps and all but watching these boobytraps being executed is rather than being funny incredibly unpleasant to watch i didn't laugh or even so much as smile once rather i cringed constantly and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid the bird rather than providing comic relief was unfunny and annoying br br the acting as done by a bunch of no names ranges from poor to atrocious there is not a single good performance here alex d linz is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid while the terrorists act and judging by their movie credits look as they've been hastily picked off the street and well that's it br br i can see some people saying man it's for the kids don't dis it man well man kids may like this but they can get a hell of a lot better see monsters inc and toy story before even considering getting this out hell even scooby doo and garfield which suck see those reviews for more are better than this br br so in short this is an irredeemably atrocious movie this was clearly recycled for the money as it almost completely rips off the first two the only thing is it completely insults the first two as well no human kid or otherwise should find any reason to see home alone 3 ever it's that bad br br 0 5 stars
<START> i have to admit that i stuck this one out thinking something would have to happen besides the dead body in the first scenes and her disposal of him i was wrong it was a cinema verite of betty hits the beach encased for the first part by mordant morven i really don't care what young lassies from scotland do these days who thy screw what drugs they take visually the stroll through the cabo de gata in andalucia was pleasant and surely the high point for me the nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend as the movie came to a close i had two thoughts 1 that's all there is 2 now i see why her boyfriend killed himself rename it bare bitch boredom or what i did on my trip to spain i'm such a sucker for sticking these things out
