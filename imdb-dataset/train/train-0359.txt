<START> seriously i've read some of the reviews on this film and i have to ask were you people watching the same movie br br yes i give the set directors a lot of credit for being able to recreate 1930 vintage los angeles but so what br br none of the characters are likable the story seems aimless karen black is simply not a very good actress donald sutherland is just icky and his character homer simpson makes me wish for the animated version d'oh then you had the creepy child actor the creepier billy barty and so on br br this is one of those films cinema buffs love and the rest of us look at each other and go what the heck
<START> this may be the only film that actually comes close to capturing on film the essentially uncapturable world of the american college experience of the late 60s early 70s go ahead name another movie that even approaches this one getting straight rpm these are caricatures return of the secaucus seven has its moments but that's a retrospective film about self obsessed individuals more than a film about a time and a place depicted in that time and place drive he said portrays with subtlety and nuance where it should and a swift kick in the shorts where that's the only appropriate way the anti draft movement the ambiguity of big time college sports especially when there's a war on the sexual revolution of the period and the general unreality of the day believe me it was like that br br the whole cast deserves commendation as does the director of course but particular praise should be reserved for bruce dern as the basketball coach and karen black the hero's very unusual except for that time love interest william tepper as the lead also rates a real round of applause both for his perfect capturing of the student athlete of the period and for actually playing real college basketball in the film remember anthony perkins in tall story yikes br br all in all a classic of a kind and the last film someone currently in 6th grade should be writing comments on boring repellent um right sonny please go back to your arnold movies why isn't this film available from imdb
<START> oh dear this movie was bad for various reasons i was expecting to see a very low score for this film and was a bit surprised by the over all score sorry but to rate this highly as many have is a joke once you get past the one shot black and white movie gimmick which was a nice idea the movie drags on even at a run time of only 66 minutes the credits sequence at the start was so annoying too in the van the guys suffer a flat tyre and change the wheel wow that was needed in the story how slow were the guys chasing and actually managing to wound campbell they did not seem to bother continue chasing him sigh i am only too glad i got this free with a special edition of evil dead
<START> the first time i saw this film i loved it when i was 11 i was more interested in the music and dancing as i've grown older i've become more interested in the acting as well while the first half is just a retrospective of michael's career from the jackson 5 up to bad it was still entertaining to watch the badder sequence could've been left out though the kids were pretty good speed demon and leave me alone were funny especially when the police officer tells michael i need your autograph right here after stopping him for dancing in a no dancing zone but it's smooth criminal that's the icing on the cake joe pesci did an excellent job as the toughie and that hair was wild the dancing is perfect and so are the special effects the only thing i could have done without was the spiders any fan of michael's should see this if you haven't already i give it a 10
<START> first thing first in this genre movie the first thing you need is a good music and thats where mr shankar and his party fails br br music is completely pale and uneffective on other hand there is ajay devgan who has removed a letter 'a' from his spelling done good job but was of no use to a bad casted movies like this br br asin is like a doll which is used to amuse public even though she is good to look at but her role in movie is to dance actually she is dancing member of a rock band and i don't think any rock band have there dancer as a member of band br br in nut shell this movie is a piece of crap a piece of t watch it if you wanna get fooled
<START> worst movie on earth i don't even know where to begin but i hope i can save another person from punishing themselves with this movie when it comes to acting and lighting this movie is similar to a bad porno without the sex the actors are some of the worst i've ever seen and couldn't have been worse even if they were trying to make a complete mockery of this movie the movie must have had a record breaking low budget which i'm sure was wasted almost solely on the movie's cover this movie has now become a running joke with friends of mine and has become the standard for comparing other garbage movies i would like to point of that no other movie even begins to compare i feel personally responsible for suggesting a friend and me watch this movie and am surprised she still considers me a friend after the torment i put us through don't see this movie
<START> anyone who does not find this movie funny does not understand simple comedy this movie is not a complex comedy it is full of one liners and sight gags and will make anyone who wants to laugh laugh the alien who is doing a nicholson impression will crack you up
<START> sandra the making of a woman is a standout among exploitation films and is so for two reasons 1 an excellent yet effortless performance by monica gayle and 2 the fact that gary graver was at the helm of the project these two talents both of whom are quite underrated make sandra a film that should be seen br br another key element of the film's success is its realism there is nothing fake or hollywood about this set in california film it is truly a slice of life the modest house in which sandra lives at the beginning of the film the simple dresses worn by the character the scene where sandra wakes up in the morning to find uschi digart bouncing at her front door and sandra sits on the couch without make up while digart tries to sell her some cosmetics looking truly as if she just woke up but nevertheless beautiful the harmless weirdo sandra picks up who likes to make love with her while he wears a bra the one room apartment into which sandra moves all of these elements of the film seem totally real and as such the viewer is drawn into sandra's little world from the beginning and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed sandra also makes her case for free love with eloquence and dignity and she comes off with a lot of class br br this film could have easily failed in less competent hands and could have gone off in any of the usual sexploitation directions but the garver gale team see to it that sandra is not only the making of a woman but the making of an excellent film
<START> other reviewers have summarized this film noir well i just wanted to add to the whew comment one reviewer made regarding elisha cook's obviously coke fuelled drumming episode this was a doozy i must say cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performance br br a bit of trivia that i am surmising about cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 barbara stanwyck film ball of fire he was a waiter in the nightclub where barbara was singing and legendary drummer gene krupa was drumming most energetically is it too much to suggest that cook's spazzy drumming in the later film phantom lady was very much inspired by krupa's work as witnessed by cook 3 years earlier br br if you watch krupa in ball of fire i think you'll note some clearly similar body movements one hopes of course that he was not influenced by any drugs at the time
<START> leave it to geniuses like ventura pons the spanish director to convince the higher ups in his country to subsidize this misguided attempt of a film the sad state of the film industry in that country is a product of trying to make a film out of such thin material most of the pictures that are made in spain fall under two categories those about the spanish civil war that love to present past history as the writers deem fit the other type of films show the viewer with a lot of gratuitous sex because the 'creators' don't have anything interest to say br br as the film opens we get to watch pere's penis as he attempts to cut it off and place it in one of the platters at a party later on sandra will show all she has been given for the audience to admire the story of pere's attraction to sandra a married woman that seems to be happily married is false from the start br br our only interest in watching the film centered on an earlier better made picture by mr pons amic amat but alas it has nothing to do with the mess we are punished to watch in this venture as far as the comments submitted in imdb all the negative votes come from spanish viewers which speaks volumes coming from them
<START> when i saw this at a shop i thought it looked really good and original like wolfs creek meets texas chainsaw massacre and i mean it only cost three quid around 6 to be honest i don't think it was even worth that br br it seemed like the directors the 'butcher brothers' couldn't decide whether wanted to do a artsy sort of horror or a gory slasher horror it ended up with a clichÃ© ridden gory sadistic hour and fifteen minutes with all the characters being one dimensional and you couldn't care less what happened to them but to try to make the audience care about the characters they added a useless monologue at the end and the beginning of the film which to be perfectly honest wasn't needed br br the only good part really was the middle end i won't ruin it for you but that was the only good part br br overall a pointless watch it felt like a two hour film but was in fact only 75 minutes if you want an artsy film don't bother if you want a slasher movie don't bother the film moves so slowly with nothing ever happening
<START> quentin crisp once stated that when things are shown too beautifully one is a romantic when things are show unbearably grim they are realistic and when something gets the ironic treatment they're spot on unfortunately for leon de aranoa he falls into the second catagory this director has obviously tried too hard to make a spanish ken loach type movie without being able to capture the comedy and warmth between the characters that elevate loach movies from merely being 'depressing' los lunes al sol is just that only depressing things are unrealistically grim the characters ultimate moments of misery all reach a climax at the same point and if the glum story isn't enough aranoa washes the tale over with a visually grey and grimy colour palette the films was ridiculously over rated at the goyas a movie that shows empathy for the weaker citizens in society in this case unemployed harbour workers does not automatically make for a good movie even though i would be the first to sympathize with the fates of these people this movie only manages to make me grow disinterested in their fate in 21st century spain unemployed people do not live like beggars and the public transport ferries have decent restrooms and it's hard to come across a bar with so few punters and such little happiness to be encountered in it leon de aranoa obviously doesn't have a clue about working class spain and does it no favours pretentious is the only conclusion i can draw the scene where the men watch a football match for free has been directly copied from a film which deals much more 'realistically' with the subject of the 'poverty' trap namely purely belter which is afar more engaging humorous and yet sad
<START> at the start this one is from england so of course i had 98 chances that it will be intelligent and very good cinema i never heard of this film before from the minute i saw helena bonham carter i said to myself oh here's comes the feminine version of my left foot i was right but i was also wrong wrong because the two movies are very differents my left foot was a john ford alike movie and this one is a chaplin alike movie not because this is funny but chaplin at that great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes i was right because in 1990 handsome daniel day lewis turn a little bit ugly by playing an crippled person and he did it with a great sense of reality here very beautiful bonham carter did exactly the same thing but with very feminine emotions the story is well written and it's very intelligent for me miss bonham carter gives one of the greatest woman's part of the 1990's with emily lloyd in breaking the waves gee and look at her eyes she had the most beautiful eyes of cinema since jobyna ralston louise brooks michele morgan and ava gardner she's also a true talent as seen on many other movies see this one you won't regret it and a very fine job by branagh too
<START> perhaps i'm out of date or just don't know what electra is like in current publications but the electra that i read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan she usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way br br this movie was fairly weak on the dialog the acting wasn't particularly convincing and the action was spotty i was really looking for something more along the lines of frank miller's book electra assassin which is much darker than anything in this movie br br special effect where cool action was interesting at times but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical tha hand was not menacing enough and electra was not bitchy enough she's the girl you love to hate but in this story i just didn't care either way
<START> it is always sad when fringe movies such as this are overlooked by the majority of filmgoers panic is a wonderfully compelling and poignant study of a character who feels trapped in the pointlessness of his own life br br william h macy as alex is as convincing as always this fine actor seems to have a special talent for pulling at your heartstrings no matter how flawed his characters may be we may not always condone the lifestyles of the protagonists he plays but the emotions of fear and confusion that he evokes in us are often all too painfully familiar the title panic initially seems paradoxical given the lack of overt emotion at one point alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry yet as this story unfolds it becomes increasingly obvious that rage and desperation not indifference are the driving forces behind this man's existence br br more than once i was reminded of his performance in fargo another strongly character driven movie in both fargo and panic we witness a middle aged man who somehow seems to have stepped out of synch with the rest of life he has lost his way and the only way back deceptively appears to be though the darkness he knows he is making bad choices but desperation overpowers self control and common sense br br alex connects with sarah a 23 year old woman mesmorizingly played by neve campbell whom he meets in a doctor's office thematically this union is less coincidence more the work of fate alex finds a certain comfort being with sarah sensing perhaps that she is a fellow drifter like him someone who has lost her way and is floating aimlessly through the rest of her life waiting powerlessly for its inevitable conclusion br br opting for movies such as this is a shrewd and convincing way for neve campbell to answer those critics who question her acting abilities too often it is the characters she has played who are the weakness offering campbell no depth in which to flex her acting muscles this performance however may be an eye opener for many br br in a perfect movie world not only would there be many more films like panic but also they would reach and be appreciated by a much wider audience if you watch movies for the richness and depth of characterization rather than merely the latest state of the art special effects then for you panic is unmissable a
<START> first ifc runs town and country and now this the difference between that stinker and this pink panther rip off is that town and country was watchable this isn't br br i can only surmise that the cast signed up for this so they could goof off in europe on somebody else's dime belushi is especially irritating his scene with candy doing a z grade dom deluise was torture speaking of torture five minutes of the talentless shepherd and i bet the prisoners at gitmo would crack like walnuts br br the real crime besides this being green lighted is shepherd's character a mousy wife who takes a monte carlo casino for a half million bucks if you buy that i have some oceanfront property in arizona you might be interested in
<START> be warned br br this is crap that other crap won't even deign to be in company with because it's beneath them okay got that out of the way let me say something more substantive br br i've seen ashes of time a very long time ago thinking it was a fresh take on the material which is based on a highly revered wuxia tome of a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director wong kar wai well despite of all of that wkw hasn't succeeded at adapting the novel on screen according to a lot of wuxia fans mostly it is just shots of dripping water beads of sweats legs of horses running etc i couldn't sit through most of the movie br br fast forward many years later when i wanted to give mr wong's movies another shot after hearing many praises especially from cannes i was intrigued by his latest 2046 a friend told me to start w chungking express because it is his most accessible movies so wrong i was just p o that i got duped into wasting my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness some professional reviewers mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern big city blah blah blah it's all fine if the director has a point of view with something to say as to why these things happen and tell it but no he merely shows what is faye wong's acting is very typical of hong kong's style garbled enunciation deer in the headlight wide eye expression try to be cute and girlish kind of acting the rest of the cast is equally uninspired br br i think the word auteur is a euphemism for a director who tries something new and different which is to be applauded but not one who hasn't yet mastered the art of cinematic story telling which is what mr wong is for the last 17 years
<START> the title says it all tail gunner joe was a tag given to the senator which relied upon the ignorance of the public about world war ii aircraft the rear facing moving guns relied upon a latch that would prevent the rear gunner from shooting off the tail of the airplane by preventing the gun from firing when it pointed at the tail when the senator was practicing on the ground one day he succeeded in shooting off the tail of the airplane he couldn't have done that if the gun had been properly aligned the gunnery officer responsible for that admitted in public before a camera that he was responsible he had made the error not the senator the fact that the film did not report that fact shows how one sided it is this film was designed to do one thing destroy the reputation of a complex person br br a much better program was the pbs special done on him he was a hard working intelligent ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary disadvantages to rise to extraordinary heights he made some mistakes some serious mistakes but shooting the tail off an airplane was not one of them br br the popularity of this film is due to the fact that the public likes simple stories one sided stories so that they don't have to think
<START> if you are one of the people who finds according to jim great television comedy this is going to rock your world and might i add kudos for proving that good talent good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than abc which prefers to air crap like jim belushi's show year after year br br k 911 is a big steaming brown german shepherd sized thank you for all of the geniuses who loved the first movie it's exactly what fans of that film and the lesser belushi deserve jim's comedic chops and choice in projects are never far behind his ability to butcher a blues standard look for him to try to showcase all of his diverse lacks of talent into every project he hurls at the public like a surly zoo chimpanzee br br if you enjoy jim's work this movie is your reward
<START> i read all of nancy drew as a preteen and collect the books as a grown up i loved the effect used at the end and a little bit at the beginning of the movie where line drawings in the style of the books morphed into scenes from the movie it was a neat way of pointing out connections between situations in the movie and the books for example the scenes with the oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios i remember from the books i thought ned was perfectly cast and emma roberts was a wonderful 21st century interpretation of nancy drew just like the picture of betty crocker she keeps up with the times
