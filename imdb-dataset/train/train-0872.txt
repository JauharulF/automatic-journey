<START> a cast of 1980's tv movie and tv series guest stars misty rowe pamela hemsley clevon little seymour cassel among several others in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models of course the models and other people start turning up dead causing all sorts of complications br br over done not very good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an r rating but not enough good material to engender any real interest this is best described as the sort of movie that gave the cable channel cinemax the alternate name of skinamax i really can't see the point of watching this unless you need to see every sleazy thriller out there i also have to comment that this film is filled with smoking to the point that it becomes laughable when anyone lights up
<START> slow and nice images changed one another with sometimes annoying music you know bjork in background for the first 75 of the movie if you did not have enough sleep that's a good time br br but in the last 20 of the movie director decides to bring idea of re birth re incarnation or else through s m images spiritual lovers are cutting each others bodies with knives for me it was very much disturbing and actually changed general impression of blend of abstract art and images of modern japanese mystery br br operator and director are great but weird br br did not enjoy it at all
<START> i don't think i could have enjoyed it more though certain things were disturbing i'm not going to say what if you haven't seen it you'll have to find out for yourself at any rate what movie can lack with robert downey jr 's puppy dog eyes all in all the plot was developed sufficiently nothing seemed too rushed as movies like this tend to be the characters were like able and there were plenty of hilarious scenes in it the idea over all is that the story is very well tied together even if certain aspects may be unsatisfactory by matter of opinion but like i said before it's hard not to love any movie with robert downey jr
<START> i must admit i'm a little surprised and disappointed at some of the very negative comments this film seems to provoke i think its a great horror sci fi film colonel steve west alex rebar returns to earth after an historical space flight to saturn while in space he contracted some bizarre and unknown disease he wakes up in a hospital bed he looks in a mirror and before his very eyes his face is melting escaping the hospitals supervision he hides out in some local woods surrounding a small town unfortunately he starts to develop a rapidly growing hunger that can only be satisfied by eating other people he must feed on human flesh and drink the blood of others to survive stalking human prey he begins his reign of terror its up to his old friend dr ted nelson burr debenning to find him and try and help him he has to work alone as his boss general perry myron healey wants it kept ultra quiet nelson can't even tell his wife judy ann sweeny however sheriff blake micheal alldredge becomes suspicious as general perry turns up just as some of the local townspeople start turning up half eaten i don't really understand why this film gets such negative reviews what do people expect anyway i really like this film the star of the film are unquestionably rick bakers special make up and gore effects which for the most part are excellent and the fact their all prosthetic effects and no rubbish horrible cgi makes them even better writer and director william sachs isn't afraid to use them either we get some nice long lingering close up shots of the incredible melting man and they hold up very well even now photography music and direction are a little bit dull but professional enough the script manages to create some sympathy for the the monster shots of him looking longingly into ted nelsons house or when he sees his own reflection in some water and reacts violently the ending set in a large factory of some sort is pretty downbeat so don't expect any happy ending which surprised me also the script doesn't really do anything with the premise he just walks around melting and killing with his friend trying to stop him maybe a bit too simple personally i think the worst bit of the film is near the start when the fat nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion her screams are also portrayed in slow motion too it looks and sounds totally ridiculous you need to see it to believe it i like this film a lot and recommend it to 70's and 80's horror sci fi fans a bit of a favourite of mine
<START> after watching about half of this movie i noticed something peculiar i found myself constantly switching through tv channels to see what else is on not exactly a good movie trait br br this movie is listed as being in a number of genres and i must say it mostly failed misserably in every one of them 80 through the movie i switched over to watch an old rerun instead bottom line the whole movie felt as if the ones making it didn't exactly know what to make and ended up in a concoction with no discernable taste
<START> s i c k really stands for so incredibly crappy i killed myself there was absolutely no acting to speak of the best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the box the budgeting of this movie was sufficient the filming was sub sesame street the production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits the props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store the ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh if there is a book out there for this movie i'm sure it's better i would avoid this at all costs i did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it just kidding
<START> coming from the same director who'd done candyman and immortal beloved i'm not surprised it's a good film ironically papierhaus is a movie i'd never heard of until now yet it must be one of the best movies of the late 80s partly because that is hands down the worst movie period in recent decades not talking about iranian or swedish cinema here the acting is not brilliant but merely solid unlike what some people here claim they must have dreamt this wondrous acting much like anna the story is an interesting fantasy that doesn't end in a clever way that ties all the loose ends together neatly these unanswered questions are probably left there on purpose leaving it up to the individual's interpretation and there's nothing wrong with that with a theme such as this pepperhaus is a somewhat unusual mix of kids' film and horror with effective use of sounds and music i like the fact that the central character is not your typical movie clichÃ© ultra shy but secretly brilliant social outcast girl but a regular normal kid very refreshing i am sick and tired of writers projecting their own misfit like childhoods into their books and onto the screens as if anyone cares anymore to watch or read about yet another miserly lonely childhood as if that's all there is or as if that kind of character background holds a monopoly on good potential the scene with anna and the boy snogging for quite a stretch was a bit much evoking feelings of both vague disgust and amusement considering that she was supposed to be only 11 but predictably it turned out that burke was 13 or 14 when this was filmed i have no idea why they didn't upgrade the character's age or get a younger actress it was quite obvious that burke isn't that young why directors always cast kids older than what they play hence dilute the realism i'll never know
<START> featuring a few of hammer's all stars this highly effective slice of british horror revolves around a house and the fates of it's previous tenants whose stories are all told to a scotland yard detective in search of a missing actor br br story number one which is probably the least impressive of the four deals with a writer and his wife who've just moved in the house and plan to stay just for a short time so that he may write one of his horror novels he creates a demented character named dominic who's a very creepy looking strangler and soon finds himself going mad as he starts to seeing this beastly looking man everywhere he goes after his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help a sub plot is introduced which frankly didn't really work for me i won't spoil it for you br br the next story the best in my opinion stars the wonderful peter cushing as philip grayson a man who's moved into the home for his retirement years and soon makes his way to a nearby wax museum that deals in the macabre where he's very startled to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past soon thereafter an old friend who also has a history with this woman is in town for business and drops by to see him the two men are in for a rude awakening as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than meets the eye br br story three stars one of my very favorites christopher lee who plays john reid after moving into the home with his peculiar daughter jane the nanny that he hires becomes awfully suspicious as to the way reid suppresses his daughter well come to find out if she knew what lee did she would have certainly understood br br the final story is a rather light hearted vampire tale that stars john pertwee and ingrid pitt after buying a cloak from a mysterious merchant actor paul henderson finds himself turning into the very creature that he's portrayed several times in his career br br overall the pacing and direction were very good as was the most of the performances there were nice gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complement the ambiance this one's a keeper and comes highly recommended
<START> updated january 1st 2006 br br parsifal is one of my two favorite wagner operas or music dramas to be more accurate meistersinger is the other though it's hard to imagine it as the top of anyone's pops the libretto by the composer as usual is a muddle of religion paganism eroticism and possibly even homo eroticism and its length may make it seem to the audience like hearing paint dry br br wagner being a famous anti semite klingsor may be one of his surrogate jewish villains naturally entrusted the premiere to an unconverted not for want of rw's trying hermann levi who was his favorite conductor go figure kundry a most mixed up gal and another likely jewish surrogate is both villainous or benevolent depending on the scene br br considering that many video versions of parsifal seem on the stodgy side this film of the opera is in comparison a breath of fresh air hans jÃ¼rgen syberberg the director has brought considerable imagination to it but it's hard to know why he made some of his choices for example the notorious dual parsifals of each gender the puppets the death mask of wagner set and various dolls and symbols such as the nazi swastika in one of the traveling scenes if i remember the real engelbert humperdinck wrote the actual music to pad out the scene changes though wagner himself died much too early to be an actual nazi many of his descendants as well as his second wife cosima were at least fellow travelers including their grandson wolfgang wagner who still runs the bayreuth festival at an advanced age in fact wolfgang's son gottfried wagner in complete opposition to his father has tried to come to terms honestly with his great grandfather br br syberberg too seems politically ambiguous from what i've read in 1977 he made a well known film on hitler hitler ein film aus deutschland sometimes called our hitler in english since it lasts all of 8 hours and hasn't been widely distributed most people have not seen it including myself br br armin jordan the conductor of the audio cd on which this film is based plays amfortas sung by wolfgang schÃ¶ne edith clever yvonne minton plays kundry michael kutter and karin krick play the dual parsifals both sung by reiner goldberg and robert lloyd and aage haugland both play and sing gurnemanz and klingsor br br though the opera takes place over a long period of time and all except kundry have been described as having aged considerably between acts 2 and 3 no one looks a day older by the end of the opera the magic of the grail in this opera the grail is the cup from which jesus drank at the last supper and not mary magdalene as in more recent times an idea i find preposterous br br the conducting and singing are all quite serviceable and the dvd seems to have improved the sound if not the picture to a great extent yes i agree that kna's approach is superior even on the second stereo version but he is probably superior to all recorded versions on the whole br br not a parsifal for all wagnerites but i think it works quite well as a filmed opera
<START> okay so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way but from the beginning hidden frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances and have always been willing to mistakes they've made they advice people to see newer episodes first so they can see just how good the show is and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes the cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on screen br br the influx of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with fans attests also to the show as the story lines go from strength to strength the show has pushed barriers with its various story lines depression drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality and these may have rubbed a few people the wrong way but that is what star trek is and was all about it portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way dealing with them subtly and smoothly br br yes they have used some characters from trek history but they have done them justice characters like shelby lefler and necheyev vastly underused in the show had a rebirth in the new frontier books but they lost their sizzle after a while when peter david when more towards wild fantasy versus serious sci fi and hf shows those characters in a completely different light which serves them better br br the site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved they release bloopers for every episode so the fans can see what a laugh they have because they are people doing it in their spare time with a dedication that would make many professional actors wide eyed in shock br br what this series now drawing to a close after 7 years has accomplished on such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing bringing people together inspiring others to do the same hf will live for a long time after it ends as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place
<START> this would have to be one of the worst if not the worst movie i've ever nearly seen i couldn't watch it all the way through purely and simply it's gratuitous violence just for the sake of it and the ridiculous story line only adds to the lacklustre and incompetent filming sick and only suitable for those with a love for manic mutilation after murdering several hundred men women and children seed is finally caught after effortlessly killing several more police officers that finally get a tip as to his whereabouts he's sentenced to death by electric chair and miraculously survives buried alive he digs his way out and plots revenge against those that put him away and flicked the switch needless to say more gruesome murders ensue
<START> i only watched this movie because i was so impressed with olivier martinez in swat but this is no swat swat had a plot and some likable characters and made sense bullfighter had none of these br br i should have realized that it couldn't possibly be any good after all the always painfully bad michelle forbes had a starring role br br one poster here called the movie incoherent another called it the worst movie ever both gave the movie far too much credit i am so glad i got it from the library for free yet i still feel ripped off br br imdb needs to include a 0 in the rate this film vote just for movies like this one
<START> without mental anachronism this film which i would like to find in dvd offer an extraordinary diving in the vital and mental context of thought of the people before the disenchantment of the world that there is thirty years a director and a scenario writer could test one such empathy and such a romantic truth to do it of them masterpiece leaves me astounding it would be necessary to be able to see and re examine it film for better seizing than the temporal and cultural distance us to make lose of capacity to be included understood analyze and finally to accept of such or such example of primitive thought because this thought maintaining almost impossible to feel in the secularized world however contain certain keys of our behavior that only them future generations will be able to analyze with sufficient relevance if somebody knows where i then to get a numerical copy or vhs to me or dvdÂ thank you in advance
<START> almost a two person play and as such the dialog and the performances of the leads will be important neither are particularly good this might have been stronger in fact if it had first been crafted as a two person play and then worked into a film br br anyway a twitchy vampire who seems slightly autistic becomes infatuated with a stripper as a result of watching too much porn in his crappy home he wants to have her tell him about the daylight he would have been better off finding someone with a day job or someone who excels at painting a picture with words like a poet but then they might not have a hot bod br br after he gets her to do whatever he wants and he's not terribly good at it he intends to feed on her at 6 am at which point the sun rises much is made of that deadline despite the fact that he also says that he can go without feeding it will just make him hungrier additionally he claims he can't let the stripper go since she knows about him but he lets a number of other people go who learn what he is there are a lot of inconsistencies br br why this vampire chooses to live in a house so poorly boarded up that light from streetlamps and neighboring buildings pours in as if it were daytime i'm not sure with all the time in the world you'd think he'd have done a better job or fixed the place up a bit he's clearly not a wealthy vampire br br this is supposedly a remake and i'm curious to see the original version of this dance of the damned although that was directed by katt shea and the other films she directed for corman stripped to kill stk ii were pretty bad
<START> possible spoilers this movie's reputation precedes it so it was with anticipation that i sat down to watch it in letterbox on tcm what a major disappointment br br the cast is superb and the production values are first rate but the characters are without depth the plot is thin and the whole thing goes on too long for a movie that deals with alcoholism family divisions unfaithfulness gambling and sexual repression the movie is curiously flat prosaic lifeless and cliche ridden one example is the portrayal of frank hirsch's unfaithfuness his rather heavy handed request to his wife to go upstairs and relax a bit followed by her predictable pleading of a headache leads even more predictably to his evening liaison with his secretary hey nancy i've got the blues tonight let's go for a drive all according to well worn formula we don't feel these are real people but cardboard cutouts acting in a marionette play also the source of the obvious friction between frank and dave hirsch is never really explored or explained dave's infatuation with the on again off again gwen is inexplicable in light of her fatuous inability to defecate or get off the pot his subsequent marriage of desperation to the shirley maclaine ginny character is from the moment of its being presented to this viewer anyway obviously doomed to fail and it was clear by the conventions of this type of soap opera that it could only be resolved by someone being killed the moment the jealous lover started running around with the gun i started a bet with myself as to who dave or ginny would get killed the whole thing was phony with a capital 'p' br br having said that maclaine's performance and that of dean martin are the standouts here but on the whole i find the movie's interest to be purely that of a period piece of hollywood history
<START> nat voiced by trevor gagnon along with his brainiac friend iq voiced by philip bolden and the always hungry scooter david gore are kids with big dreams they want to be the first flies in space and what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon the apollo 11 is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang out br br the first thing you notice is the animation of the film i found it done very well done the scenery had depth to it as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scenes i didn't see the movie in 3 d as it was broadcast on hbo however i could see that there really wasn't any scenes which took advantage of the 3 d effects except a fight between characters near the end i also wasn't really impressed with the design of the characters to me they didn't look like anything resembling a fly especially in the coloring the flies were an unusual blue gray that was kind of distracting to me br br the performances from the cast was not bad but it wasn't good either there were many times i focused more on my computer than the story the writing was certainly written for a younger audience with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh i saw nothing for adults like jokes that they'll get the punchline for the adults to understand the meaning br br history was not followed in this film in fact i think it was completely ignored as the main focus was the flies i also hated when a well known astronaut popped up on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the film was a work of fiction and no flies were on apollo 11 i did like how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration though br br if you are an adult this is not for you it was not made for the entire family this is certainly just for kids but save this one for a rainy day
<START> rented and watched this short 90 minutes work it's by far the best treatment modesty has received on film and her creator peter o'donnell agrees participating as a creative consultant the character and we who love her are handled with respect spiegel's direction is the best he's done to date and the casting was very well done alexandra staden is almost physically perfect as a match to the original jim holdaway illustrations of modesty a terrific find by whoever cast her raymond cruz as a young rafael garcia was also excellent i hope that tarantino co will go on to make more in the series i'm especially interested to see whom they'd choose to be the incomparable willie garvin
<START> great screenplay and some of the best actors the world has ever produced montand gives the concept of the 'lone wolf' police detective a whole new dimension of intensity and most importantly credibility br br when a typical hollywood cop heroe loses family friends and pets to murder he is usually given his minute of grief but when the sixty seconds are over he pulls himself together packs his gun and goes gleefully shooting up his enemies one by one br br montand's marc ferrot however is really devastated by his girlfriends murder of course but also by finding out that she had another lover in his confusion and wrath he does not seek revenge but needs to keep going to find the real perpetrator of a crime where his fingerprints are all over the scene thus all his actions become unescapably logical this is the main reason why this movie glues us to our seats but definetely not the only one
<START> this waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great film nothing new or original is added other than perry's backflashes which are of marginal interest it lacks the documentary feel of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective also painfully missing is the sharp quincy jones soundtrack that added to much to the original film i can't understand any high ratings for this at all it's quite bad why does anyone waste time or money making crap like this and why did i waste time watching it
<START> the comic banter between william powell and jean arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plots ever powell is probably the most suave detective of the 30's and arthur has a unique voice which often sounds like a succession of tiny tinkly bells they are extremely fun to watch so take the brashness of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold eric blore also has some comic turns as powell's butler br br powell's contract with mgm included a clause which allowed him to reject being loaned out to another studio but he wanted to work again with arthur and he liked the script so he eagerly accepted the assignment they had worked together in two 1929 paramount films the canary murder case and the greene murder case both in the philo vance series
