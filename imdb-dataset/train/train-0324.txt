<START> this movie can be interpreted on many different levels don't listen to the other comments bashing the movie and saying that it is a played again story or w e and that it is just about drugs it has very overt superficial metaphors about drugs however the rest of the movie and why i think it was personally made is really not about that at all it is really mocking psychology and the conditioning of society it shows for a split second that the main character's brother is watching those sick videos online why my interpretation is that it is to demonstrate that all of this gruesomeness that we are exposed to makes it easier for us to be mechanical in our professions instead of seeing people as people as far as the scene about logic it is also reaching out to the people who were in the federally mandated 1 smart classes who are confused and frustrated because life isn't as predictable and mathematical and logical as it seems on a macroscopic level you have to apply heisenberg's uncertainty principle along with all the other laws and principles of uncertainty not just to physics but to life and leave room to change your plans and adjust along the way one of the best movies i have ever seen it just might go way above your head it isn't for you it is for those people who are are having trouble coping with life not working out like a math problem when you are critically analyzing a movie or writing your critical review's try not reading the back cover first written by marketers and parapsychologists
<START> when i heard that adrian pasdar was in drag in this movie my expectations that i would watch the entire movie were low the only reasons i gave it a chance were the magnificent julie walters and the recommendation of a friend br br what i thought would be a broad mrs doubtfire type of farce turned out to be a gentle and insightful comedy pasdar is entirely credible and empathetic as the ambitious business man who needs to release the female part of his being by cross dressing on occasions he transmits these needs to the audience in a thoroughly believable fashion julie walters is magnificent is as her habit as the landlady who teaches him unconditional love
<START> man has been to the farthest reaches of the earth and now he is traveling to new worlds but with new worlds come ancient evils the vampires of space and not just a handful but entire tribes in this film which i saw as bloodsuckers but i guess also goes as vampires wars we see what happens when the imperialist earthlings meet the imperialist vampires br br i will make this review very short because it's undeserving of a good review the best i can say for this film is it has a good cast of b list and upcoming stars natassia malthe was quintana and was far more attractive here than in bloodrayne 2 michael ironside is muco and is always a fan favorite as i say he's the poor man's jack nicholson and we even get carrie ann fleming as damian's wife who horror fans will now recognize as the eponymous jenifer from dario argento's jenifer so this movie as bad as it is isn't without some names attached but the same can be said of uwe boll's work br br the concept of the military tracking and killing vampires in space isn't necessarily a bad idea but it easily falls into the realm of cheese and this film falls hard the acting especially from the vampires is over the top and i just didn't find the explanations of their existence very convincing worst of all the vampire tribes have the names voorhess and leatherfaces i understand this was supposed to be a clever reference for the horror fans but it wasn't clever at all it just sounded dumb and out of place unlike the much more subtle references in james gunn's slither such as naming stores after lesser known horror directors br br that's all i want to say if you can stand lots of cheese on this day i couldn't and i'm from wisconsin and want to see average actors with poor costumes fight vampires in space although space looks a lot like any other forest on earth check this one out if you can find it i don't personally recommend this when you can watch other cheesy vampires films jon carpenter's vampires or other cheesy space movies or maybe even some good ones but hey do your thing
<START> a simple and effective film about what life is all about responding to challenges it took a lot of gall for homer and his friends to be able to grow into manhood without falling in the trap of a prefabricated future that runs from father to son to be a miner in the local mine and never get out of that fate it took also three different challenges for homer and his friends to conquer a personal and free future the challenge of the first ever man made artificial satellite sputnik 1 a soviet satellite a milestone in human history a turning point that homer and his friends could not miss did not want to miss then the challenge of science and applied mechanics to calculate and to devise a rocket from scratch or rather from what they could gather in books and order in their minds finally the challenge of a world that resists and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack even with an untimely accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity and even then homer proved he had the guts to accept the challenge that was blocking for a while his own plans and dreams but there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough homer is the carrier of the project but he is also the carrier of the inspiration he and his friends need if he is the one who is going to get the university scholarship because his friends gave him precedence his friends will also be able to get on their own roads and tracks and step out of the mining fate thanks to the energy his inspiring example sets in front of their eyes it is hard at times not to follow the example of the one who is like a beacon on a difficult road but the film is also effective to show how the father resisted this dream because for him science was not the fabric of a true man like mining or football the working class fate that was so present in those 1950s and 1960s and still is present in some areas is too often enforced by the traditional thinking of the father if the mother does not have the courage to speak up one day the working class fate i am speaking of becomes a tremendous trap here too the film is effective and it should make some parents think this might have been the fourth challenge homer had to face the challenge of taking a road that was not the one pointed at and programmed by his own father br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne
<START> 'nobody knows anybody' is a conspiracy theory thriller about a satanist nut bomber targeting the religious festivities of seville during holy week he also happens to be the best friend of the film's hero the plot is set up by the bomber as a computer game with himself and the hero as players and seville as the virtual environment the very real alleys and streets of the city begin to take on the labyrinthine qualities of those old pacman type games looked at this way the scene where the hero and his female sidekick are chased by black hooded penitents with rayguns may not seem as silly as it plays br br from the start we are aware that the narrative is being constructed as a game the hero's job is to create crossword puzzles for a popular newspaper at one point the crossword grid on his screen becomes the chessboard on which he is later playing against his girlfriend's father clues are liberally scattered as the camera mystifyingly closes in on images that are only later shown to have been significant e g the advert in the bar the detective paper chase elements are made part of a game in progress rather than an investigation after the fact the film borrows heavily on 'se7en''s pattern narrative and anyone with a catholic education will presumably get the significance of certain events happening on certain days in the run up to easter br br in this reading the game is on the level of narrative with the hero fighting against an enemy in this case the computer to win and save the day but there is a second game the film itself which subvert the first there are another set of of clues which point not to the killer's intentions but the filmmaker's and his hero's in the first ten minutes there are references to chess a writer called navokov and a cult leader called sarin if we remember that the chess loving nabokov's 1930s pseudonym was sirin we see another game afoot one where we suspect not the villain but the hero himself br br in a nabokov novel like 'pale fire' an author figure creates a text which is designed to hide his own motives provoking a game between writer and reader to uncover the real text throughout the film are scenes which are visually distorted e g the image contracting or which are ambiguously defined dreams and hallucinations that make us suspect the hero's point of view the opening references to games are all linked to him in the early sequences much is made of the character's sexual and creative impotence so the film could be his attempt to master his life to be a winner in a way he can't for real no sooner has he won the game than his writer's block vanishes the words he types are the title of the film suggesting he is the overall author further that title in spanish reflects on itself negatively a very nabokovian involution that suggests a hero like kinbote trapped in his own solecism br br this jumble of post modern literature borges eco pynchon et al are alluded to also fincher 'x files' 'run lola run' chris marker the idea of the city and its history as a map and a text and as a cultural history haunting the present bunuellian anti clericism and alex de la iglesia's 'shock' films result in a film that is just that a jumble each clever clever allusive element cancelling out the last dissipating interest the lack of clarity about the game's rules renders it incomprehensible and eventually wearing br br ironically in a work of such overdetermined artifice the film's main interest lies in its documentary quality as a record of a narrative taking place in a real city with its own events taking place independently such an ambiguous blurring of fact and fiction can create a masterpiece like 'sans soleil' or 'london' but ultimately you need to have a light touch to match your cleverness
<START> running man viciously lampoons the modern day american media complex and hits its target dead center it may be an easy target but they pull it off none the less rm effortless takes on pro wrestling featuring some pro wrestlers as the hunters network television the nielsen ratings the american government suggesting it's entertainment oriented anyway crime punishment and a half dozen other things along the way it's a far cry from the original stephen king novella and arnold is not the ben richards of the novella either but who cares it's basically a arnie flick with all the well choreographed action sequences and one liners such an undertaking requires
<START> john candy's performance in once upon a crime is possibly his best ever it's been my favourite movie since it came out i spent 5 years searching for it that's how good it is if you disagree well that's your opinion enjoy the movie
<START> if you have plenty of time to waste it's ok it moves at a good pace but to pull this movie off it would need to be a little longer with a little more background on the sitter br br the acting is ok mariana klaveno as the sitter does the best job and is the most believable br br william r moses played a pretty good part as the husband br br gail o'grady as the wife had a weak part and the reasons for her going back to work were not developed br br the ending is sort of silly like most of these sitter movies there are parts that are interesting but overall it leaves you wondering why you spent the time
<START> just think it cost a total of 250 000 to make clerks how the hell did they spend 45 million to make this glorified music video a practically unknown cast two or three sets no special effects that i could see i know it must have been spent on that expertly crafted economical tension filled screenplay shoot that bar set must have cost a bundle anyway i guess jerry bruckheimer wouldn't be caught dead producing anything for less i'm just surprised he didn't blow up anything br br anyway it wasn't an awful film i guess the female leads seemed to have some good chemistry and the soundtrack was ok imo it just seems a pity that this rather mediocre project could have been made for 5 million without any loss to the production and 6 more 5 million dollar indy films of merit could have been made as well
<START> spoilers with a gathering of family members and servants of the late christopher dean john carradine to hear his last will and testament they get somewhat of a surprise in that the dean fortune some 140 million dollars the money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the dean mansion there seemed to have been a mix up in the story when we later find out that it's really an overnight sleepover not a weeks vacation at the mansion for the guests to qualify for dean's money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrise br br the first victim of the dean curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the departed christopher dean estate the local sheriff dan garcia rodolfo acosta acosta has his head chopped off refrigerated and then served on a platter to a shocked group of guests later that evening cute little chin greg and laura's jeff morrow marry anders little pet pooch is found dead outside floating in the pond br br the movie has all the people staying at the dean mansion being picked off one by one until it's revealed who the killer really is we then have what seems to be a double twist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest the real killer ends up not only getting all the loot 140 million dollars but then ends up not having to split it with his accomplice by doing him or her in by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot br br nonsensical who done it and haunted house movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikable characters that even a mother much less the audience would have trouble liking there's everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the selective guests that includes incest s m sadism and of course double dealing and back stabbing not even counting murder you just couldn't care less who of the guests survives to collect the dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them do br br even the big surprise at the end isn't really that much of a surprise since the killer's identity is divulged with the film maker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself we then have a plot twist that eliminates the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is the final plot twist that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie

<START> my family has watched arthur bach stumble and stammer since the movie first came out we have most lines memorized i watched it two weeks ago and still get tickled at the simple humor and view at life that dudley moore portrays liza minelli did a wonderful job as the side kick though i'm not her biggest fan this movie makes me just enjoy watching movies my favorite scene is when arthur is visiting his fiancÃ©e's house his conversation with the butler and susan's father is side spitting the line from the butler would you care to wait in the library followed by arthur's reply yes i would the bathroom is out of the question is my newmail notification on my computer arthur is truly funny stuff
<START> this insipid mini operetta featuring a eddy mcdonald prototype in a valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes it's silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers in under a minute he is packed off to morrocco where he lives a double life as the red shadow the leader of an arab tribe that would rather sing than fight br br alexander gray and bernice clare possess fine light opera voices with little acting ability and there's a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along br br this two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers with more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation
<START> say what you will about schmaltz one beauty of this film is that it is not pro american it is a morality about some americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion it is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose br br to me the most interesting part of the film is the education of fanny and david farrelly bette davis' mother and brother as fanny says we've been shaken out of the magnolias br br in today's political climate where led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used 9 11 to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings we sunk to the level of the 9 11 murderers to seek blood thirsty vengeance it can't all be blamed on mr bush after all we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re elected him after his lies had been exposed now with complete justification we americans are reviled throughout the world br br today we watch this film with a new awareness that the rise to power of nazis in germany was not due to a flaw in the german character but a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify our committing immoral and heinous acts i'm not comparing george bush to adolph hitler but i am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror hatred and hyper nationalism to do despicable things br br sadly the blackmailer who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement no matter how immoral is most like the leaders of our country those who support them and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand that they can't even be bothered to vote br br a film like watch on the rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be a force for the betterment of humanity and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals br br geoff
<START> offering a killer combo of terrible writing terrible acting and terrible direction it's a tossup whether kinjite forbidden subjects is offensively bad or just hilariously bad it's almost as if someone ran a competition to make the sleaziest seediest cannon film as if a glance at a cast list including characters like 'lesbian pedophile ' 'perverted gentleman ' 'porno actress' weren't enough it's your only chance to see charles bronson's cop throw a lowlife on a bed and grab a dildo but don't worry it's okay as the offscreen screams make clear he's only torturing him for information after all even if he is a bit overprotective of his nice catholic daughter he's a nice catholic cop who regularly brings local catholic priest william o'connell a packed lunch and who believes in poetic justice or at least ensuring that the bad guys end up in the slammer with the horniest inmates maximum security can provide to give them a taste of their own medicine but then that's what you get for telling him look i think you're a little bit unstable still when later offered a bribe he may snarl i'd like to shove this up your ass but i don't want to get my hands dirty he's clearly learned where to draw the line instead he just makes him eat a 25 000 watch and sets fire to his cadillac the anal obsession even follows through to the film's title despite the poster featuring a naked japanese girl on a porn film set the film's only direct example of kinjite forbidden subjects as alex hyde white's english teacher explains to a group of japanese businessmen is er talking about your bowel movements in polite society br br bronson isn't just too old for this as the opening fight makes only too clear he's too old for love interest peggy lipton and she looks old enough to have grown up kids a better actor than he ever got the credit for when given the right material here's he's given less a properly thought out character than a series of outrageous reactionary quirks when he's not widening the circles of suspects he's accidentally dropping them to their death off the sides of buildings he's definitely not a p c copper with a special loathing for the japanese as if it wasn't bad enough that they're buying up american businesses what's worse they double park on a public thoroughfare no racial minority goes unassaulted be they black pimp or pakistani hotel clerk no cop clichÃ© unrecycled be it a boss who bangs his fist on the table or a dead meat partner perry lopez and his spectacularly bad hair dye that's so prominent it deserves screen billing all its own the twin plot strands bronson's l a cop trying to take down juan hernandez's pimp who deals in underage girls and james pax's porn obsessed japanese businessman Â take forever to intertwine and then in the most unlikely of ways after copping a feel of bronson's daughter on a bus some oriental guy touched my holy of holies in the film's idea of poetic justice pax finds his own daughter kidnapped by hernandez you half expect the writer to pop his head round the corner of the screen and say how d'ya like them apples br br somewhere underneath all the laziness is the germ of a good idea even if it is too muddily developed to ever be clear quite what that idea really is but the execution is pure rising sun the archie bunker version shot like out takes from an r rated 80s music video with an outrageous and rather lazy dockside shoot 'em up and blow'em up finale that sees a small army of machine gunning sidekicks suddenly appear to up the gratuitous body count the last of bronson's mostly bad to in different collaborations with j lee thompson Â and sadly thompson's last film as director it's a poor signoff for two undervalued players who increasingly never seemed to be that discerning about what pictures they said yes to
<START> you know what kind of movie you're getting into when the serial killer main character is being transported to the electric chair in what seems to be a bakery truck only to have the prison vehicle collide with and i'm not making this up a genetic engineering tanker truck the goo which spurts forth melts him and fuses his dna with the snow creating our protagonist the killer snowman br br my favorite portion of the movie however is an over the shoulder shot of the snowman thrashing some poor schmuck in which his hands look suspiciously like a couple of white oven potholder gloves br br mmmmm schlock
<START> i first saw this movie when i was about 10 years old unfortunately i could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night now i bought it on dvd because i can remember that i liked it br br this is really not an ordinary horror movie it has some horror elements but i rather categorize it as fantasy i liked it but i hoped for a bit more horror and scary scenes especially the scene when anna's dad comes into the paperhouse trying to kill her is a bit short br br now to the plot this movie is about a young girl named anna who gets ill while she is ill and has to lie in her bed because of her high fewer she turns on to finishing her drawing about a house the paperhouse when she fells a sleep which often strangely happens just immediately she finds herself near the house on a big green field she realizes that the house is exactly like the one she has drawn and that every new detail also appears in her dreams one day she draws a boy into the house to have somebody to talk to as she forgets to draw his legs because he is sitting behind a window the boy cannot walk later she is being told by the doctor that a boy also has this strange disease and she realizes that with the boy she has drawn she also got that boy into her disturbing dreams she also notices that it gets harder and harder for her to wake up from her dreams as she misses her father who is ofter abroad she draws her father into the house she makes a mistake and her father is looking very angry on the painting she tries to rubber him out but realizes that she cannot change anything already drawn and next time she falls asleep the horror begins her father is mad and blind because she draw s on his head to mark him as 'invalid' and tries to get into the paperhouse and kill anna and his friend her dreams became a horrendous nightmare they manage to escape and to kill her father and anna can finally wake up than anna finds her self in the hospital where her parents are sitting beside her bed the doctors thought that she fell into a coma or so they tell anna that the other boy died and that they want to travel to the ocean to get over those tragical happenings anna draws a watchtower and notices that the same watchtower can be found near the hotel they traveled to she runs to the watchtower and meets the boy i am just not mentioning his name because i cannot remember it and do not want to go back to the previous html page and can say good bye to him and forget those terrible dreams forever br br there were a few thing i did not understand in the movie first of all it was the ending which i absolutely dislike i think it is too long while the main part of the movie becomes a bit too short how does the boy fly a helicopter and speak to anna as he is supposed to be dead why did you have to put such a stupid radio on the wall i hated that scene it was so dumb to me it almost ruined the main horror scene br br things i liked were the scene with the photograph of anna's dad which was the first real scary and horror scene i liked the boy the actor was awesome he was even better than anna i also liked how anna tries to get her father out of the painting while she is asleep and how she is looking for it in the garbage br br overall a good movie i give it a 8 out of 10
<START> when john singleton is on he's on and this is one of his better films not quite as tight as boyz n the hood but close to it and with much of the same stellar cast this film was very well written very well put together and very well shot there's very little to criticize and most of my complaints are superficial eg where did fudge get the money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive stuff no mention of a rich background and why doesn't professor phibbs have an office a professor of his stature should have one and while we're at it for an engineering student hick or not remy's a pretty dumb character i'd think that he'd have a bit more in the way of basic intelligence he talks and acts like a total buffoon br br but that aside the film was very sharp a good array of characters and points of view and singleton doesn't take sides in the story many of the characters are unsympathetic and he does a good job of interspersing the panthers and supremacist scenes together to show the folly on both sides br br much of the cinematography was excellent i especially loved the scene where kirsty swanson gets intimate with taryn and wayne each scene spliced together really well also the malik deja scenes were really well shot as well br br the dialogue was a bit much at times this film had a tendency to get really preachy at times and it also tends to hammer the points it was making over your head when the points would be just as clear with out the bluntness we really didn't need the us flag with 'unlearn' typed onto it give some credit we're not morons and to top it off although most of the time singleton uses melodrama quite well sometimes it gets way too cheezy like deja's death which is fine until she screams out 'why ' which simply ruined the entire effect and scene br br but the acting in general was top of the line fabulous performances by omar epps perhaps the best i've ever seen kirsty swanson who knew buffy could act michael rapaport surprised the hell out of me after true romance and beautiful girls i though he was a one role actor and of course ice cube and laurence fishburne are always outstanding br br downside jennifer connelly was flat though it's not completely her fault her role was stereotypical and one dimensional generic to the highest degree and tyra banks who had the role was nothing short of horrid she whined and whined and whined yet another in the long line of models turned actresses who failed miserably though there are a few who prove the exception to this rule br br finally the soundtrack wow an amazing soundtrack which is definitely worth buying which fits the film like a glove each scene has a twin song although the tori amos songs started to really annoy me by the end not her best work liz phair rage against the machine ice cube how can one go wrong br br all in all a really good watch a really strong cast great script great film 8 10
<START> this movie is spoofed in an episode of mystery science theater 3000 i think mst3k was at its best when they ripped this movie br br terrible acting bad makeup poor effects chick in skimpy 1960's underwear i give it a 2 br br the villain is hard to understand due to the makeup the assistant says things like 'not you' that sound like nachoo think sneezing it's just poor oration the long eyebrows are hilarious on one of the characters br br i still don't know what 'the projected man' means in terms of the plot i missed some of the beginning though br br what is up with this 10 line minimum on posting
<START> this movie is really nothing besides an admittedly well crafted series of tense sequences punctuated with an inevitable gotcha at the end of each really there is no character development and no real plot to speak of there are only the most skeletal of motivations for the characters to do anything while they trudge forward to their unavoidable dooms it's all just an excuse to show a creepy ghost kid who seems to have gotten some of the family cat mixed up in his ectoplasm and his ghost mom with long black hair hanging in her face kind of like the ring take down a bunch of cardboard cut out two dimensional excuses for human characters br br this english language version of the grudge is the equivalent of cinematic junk food satisfying momentarily but not really what you ought to be living on br br not recommended
