<START> the entire 10 15 minute presentation is done in a very non threatening and non medical way that even preteen children can easily understand it dispels many of the myths surrounding menstruation that were going around in those days 1946 while sex is not explicitly mentioned the part about fertilization is this is also purportedly the first hollywood production to ever use the word vagina in the dialogue br br it is cute how the animated character is shown topless in the shower in a purely animated character way with no defining features as was the way of the day many of the betty boop cartoons showed her undress without revealing any defining features either max fleischer was a bit of a card and did this with many of the betty boop cartoons which required frame by frame viewing to find them br br there is no mention at the beginning or end of the film as to who the female narrator is in fact there are no credits whatsoever other than those mentioning kotex and kimberly clark corporation br br this title is nearly impossible to attain but for those who are bittorrent downloaders it can be found out there in the ether this is one of those keepers that will become increasingly hard to find as older short subject features fade into obscurity
<START> i think the film is educational however it fails to treat the issue which sparked so much controversy plural marriage also the film fails to reveal what the lds church espouses big opportunity was missed to tell the world what they actually believe i could not get a clear idea of what it is lds views are on central topics of religion br br i have many lds friends and they are nice people would have been nice to get a clearer picture of how they view their prophet's more controversial statements maybe these statements are just too controversial to be treated in a film format but it would have been great to hear the whole story of joseph smith's truly interesting life after all it gives insight into american thought on religion in the 18th century hope they do some documentaries on this fascinating subject allowing historians to comment on smith's life we may have a mormon president some day after all smith ran for president
<START> man to man tries hard to be a good movie it has its heart at the right place it aspires to be epic and it has a message that no doubt everybody will appreciate but there lies also some of the problems of this picture it strives so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged so it is only adequate that the images which are used by this picture are simplistic man to man doesn't let the viewer decide what he thinks is right but is hammering its message in his head joseph fiennes exemplifies this in his role he does his best to look concerned genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression his repertoire has to offer add that the movie is overlong and loses its speed towards the end you would be easily led to the conclusion that man to man is not worth watching but there are enough points to defend it it is entertaining has some humorous scenes and the show stealing kristin scott thomas of course you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like the elephant man david lynch but you'll be leaving the theatre satisfied it tries to grab your heart even if your brain thinks that it is too obvious and succeeds most of the time
<START> errol flynn had one of his favorite roles as the brash braggart from a fighting irish family who went on to become the heavyweight champion of the world at a time when john l sullivan ward bond went around claiming that he could beat any man alive both flynn and ward bond give what is probably among the best performances they ever gave on screen br br raoul walsh has directed the colorful tale with robust style capturing the family life as well with scenes that are warm hearted and full of good humor all the warner contract players make up the fine cast including the always reliable alan hale as flynn's rambunctious father proud of his son's fighting abilities and alexis smith who makes the most of her role as a feisty society girl who enjoys taking flynn down a peg with saucy one liners dealing with his conceited manners br br all of the 1880s atmosphere is captured in glorious b w although it's too bad warners didn't have more faith in flynn to do the film in color he was entering a rocky phase of his film career at the time engaged in a widely publicized rape trial that had all of the tabloids busy sorting things out br br the fighting scenes are among the best ever choreographed for the screen with flynn obviously in fine form and making very little use of doubles for most of the action and the scene where bond turns over his award plaque to flynn at a social gathering is one of ward's finest moments in a long career as a character actor br br summing up maintains interest all the way through whether you're a sports fan or not
<START> flight of fury starts as general tom barnes angus macinnes organises an unofficial test flight of the x 77 a new stealth fighter jet with the ability to literally turn invisible general barnes gives his top pilot colonel ratcher steve toussaint the job everything goes well until the x 77 disappears even more literally than barnes wanted as ratcher flies it to northern afghanistan delivers it to a terrorist group known as the black sunday lead by peter stone vincenzo nicoli who plans to use the x 77 to fly into us airspace undetected drop some bombs which will kills lots of people general barnes is worried by the loss of his plane sends in one man army john sands co writer executive producer steven seagal to get it back kill all the bad guy's in the process br br this american british romanian co production was directed by michael keusch was the third film in which he directed seagal after the equally awful shadow man 2006 attack force 2007 luckily someone decided the partnership wasn't working an unsuspecting public have thankfully been spared any further collaboration's between the two apparently flight of fury is an almost scene for scene word for word remake of black thunder 1988 starring michael dudikoff with many of the same character's even sharing the same name so exactly the same dialogue could be used without the makers even having to change things like names although i must admit i have never seen black thunder therefore cannot compare the two flight of fury is a terrible film the poorly made written waste of time that seagal specialises in these days it's boring even though it's not that slow the character's are poor it's full of clichÃ©s things happen at random the plot is poor the reasoning behind events are none existent it's a very lazy production overall as it never once convinces the viewer that they are anywhere near afghanistan or that proper military procedures are being followed the action scenes are lame there's no real excitement in it the villains are boring as are the heroes it's right down there with the worst seagal has made br br flight of fury seems to be made up largely of stock footage which isn't even matched up that well the background can change peoples clothes change the area changes the sky the quality of film changes very abruptly as it's all too obvious we are watching clips from other better films spliced in hell seagal never even goes anywhere near a plane in this the action scenes consist of shoot outs so badly edited it's hard to tell who is who of course seagal breaking peoples arms the whole production feels very cheap shoddy br br the imdb reckons this had a budget of about 12 000 000 which i think is total rubbish i mean if so where did all the money go although set in afghanistan which is a war torn arid desert flight of fury looks like it was filmed down my local woods it was actually shot in romania the romanian countryside does not make a convincing afghanistan the acting is terrible as one would expect seagal looks dubbed again br br flight of fury is a terrible action film that is boring amateurish is an almost scene for scene remake of another film anyway another really lazy poorly produced action thriller from seagal why do i even bother any more
<START> this film gave me nightmares for months and i'm 17 this is the scariest movie ever made that is no exaggeration i saw this movie at school in english lessons and no one else was scared which amazed me after reading other reviews i'm glad i'm not the only person who found this so scary
<START> i loved the first two movies but this movie was just a waste of time and money for me and the studio i'm still wondering why they made this horrible movie the thing with the plastic gun and with the toy car that can go into another house are ridiculous joe pesci and daniel stern in the first two movies were so funny but the terrorists in this one are so stupid and not funny believe me this movie is just a waste of time
<START> was lucky enough to be an extra in this great film and loved every minute of the filming went to the premier in london and had a great chat to phil peter martin and jon as did my wife fantastic after party too then a few weeks later had trip to the cinema with members of our bike club what a brilliant film it deserves to be up there with all the great biker films now we have the dvd sue my wife can't get enough of it neither can the kids get a bit of stick from the club who seem to think i'm a film star now oh well one can only dream i think they are just jealous the only downside of the first part of the filming was the weather rain rain and more rain but hey we was in wales hopefully there will be a follow up so keep me posted jon danny beck
<START> i became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other i have ever watched that may be because i can see the characters as my own grandparents attempting to make sense of a world at war the ending and use of pachabel's cannon are both amazing
<START> there is nothing not to like about moonstruck i'm from a new york italian family and i actually get a little homesick when i watch it the actors actresses the plot the subplots the humor they were all fantastic it starts a little slow but a lot happens in that two days i fell in love with laboheme because of this movie on my list of favorite movies moonstruck is number 3 it's a feel good movie where you leave the theatre humming that's amore or repeating some of your favorite lines old man if you give those dogs another piece of my food i'll kick you till you're dead chrissy bring me the big knife who's dead do you love him loretta good because when you do they drive you crazy because they know they can i always put moonstruck on when there's nothing good to watch because it makes me happy
<START> being someone who lists night of the living dead at number three in her top five favorite movies of all time and at the same time loving this student film parody i feel i must defend this movie against the previously posted scathing reviews this short but sweet opus has always been a crowd pleaser at horror and science fiction movie marathons where those who attend have a love of the genre yet know not to take zombie movies too seriously this film is a tribute to the original not an insult it is intended to be funny and many others who i have heard chant for and applaud it agree with me that it succeeds especially for those of us who have seen notld 50 times watch for the director cameo as news reporter jeff drexel and also if you have the opportunity catch his alien parody loaf
<START> a beautiful shopgirl in london is swept off her feet by a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds herself married and living with him at his villa in british ceylon although based upon the book by robert standish this initial set up is highly reminiscent of hitchock's rebecca with leading lady elizabeth taylor clashing with the imposing chief of staff at the mansion and almost immediately her own husband who is still under the thumb of his deceased but dominant father taylor a last minute substitute for an ailing vivien leigh looks creamy smooth in her high fashion wardrobe and her performance is quite strong however once husband peter finch starts drinking heavily and barking orders at her one might think her dedication to him rather masochistic this feeling hampers the ending as well still the film offers a heady lot for soap buffs romantic drama a bit of travelogue interpretive dance an elephant stampede and a perfectly timed outbreak of cholera from
<START> well its about time i had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season's entries while there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries at least this episode turned out well its rather funny that director rob schmidt who only has the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included tale of the mummy and graveyard shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season in right to die we are treated to the story of cliff and abbey at the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation abbey has caught cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back while they speak they find themselves in a car accident where cliff is left with only scratches and bruises but abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire and this is just the setup people once in the hospital cliff must decide whether or not abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes there's also a side effect too every time she flatlines abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever from the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists i never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it right to die should have the right to go on living forever
<START> i've been willing to put up with a lot from late spring summer action fluff movies but in general that's been due to the fact that most of them have reasonable payoff i e cool special effects interesting plot twists comic value steve buscemi etc this movie however had none of this all that we got was the cheap thrill of several minutes of eva longoria's cleavage an issue of maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket there is an embarrassing lack of plot suspense back story character development continuity etc i would get into specifics but quite frankly i've already maybe willingly forgotten most of the movie br br the entire time i was in the theater i was kicking myself for not just spending the afternoon watching a 24 season on dvd save your money on this one folks unless you really really really like eva longoria's cleavage
<START> excellent film showing the pathetic lives of two nutty old ladies they couldn't live together nor apart babbling constantly sometimes at the same time they hashed and re hashed the past going on and on about what coulda shoulda woulda i found myself laughing at times but mostly i was taken with how utterly sad and abandoned these two women were see this one
<START> this movie is plain fun i has nothing to do with the original america pie but it is fun to watch br br another try but better than band camp and the naked mile at least funnier br br just after first five minutes i was laughing my ass out so i decided to call my friend and we would watch it together we had a few beers and we had fun br br you will not find any deep message in this movie but it's worth watching br br so lay back and just enjoy
<START> can any one help find out the title and artist of the song that was played at least halfway through the movie i can't remember what scene was playing the words in the song are of a ballad some of the lyrics go like it's natures way of telling you somethings wrong it's natures way of telling it in a song it's natures way of forgiving you please help me with this question thanks so much i have been searching the internet for days i can't get this song out of my mind so now this will challenge me to find some one out there who may be able to help mer with this matter i wish i would of been paying attention to the scene when it was playing
<START> tough guys sexy women lots of swearing and a most unconvincing monster that rises from the depths of a polluted lake you'd think monster would be fun but it isn't really it does star tony eisley and john carradine however and in my book that makes it worth viewing at least once in an interview with fangoria in 1987 eisley recalled that herbert strock had directed the bulk of the film but somehow kenneth hartford who only directed the footage featuring his children andrea and glenn portraying characters named andrea and glenn in a particularly inventive turn received full credit considering how awful the end result was strock was probably glad that he hadn't been credited monster has the look and feel of a mid to late seventies tv movie which is why i like to leave it on in the background every so often as entertainment it falls flat on its face but as a reminder of another age and a vanished type of film making it's very effective the only thing that's missing is a car chase
<START> warning spoilers galore br br tim burton remaking this sui generis movie is about as sensible as remaking psycho oh that's right some idiot already did that i rest my case br br movie opens with chimpnaut blundering a simulation proving he's not that smart from the outset marky mark appears in shot without his characteristic underpants showing then is turned down by a plain woman who prefers the touch of chimpanzees br br the perfunctory establishing shot of the space station orbiting saturn for no apparent reason interior of ship a bustle with genetic experiments on apes must we travel 1 300 million kilometers to saturn to conduct these experiments the special effects team decrees it br br marky's chimp gets lost in that staple of 60s sci fi cinema the time warp marky then demonstrates the space station's mind boggling security ineptness by stealing a pod without anyone noticing while simultaneously demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deep space rescue mission into a worm hole for an expendable test chimp with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies br br before anyone can say pointless remake' marky has surfed the worm hole crashed on an alien planet removed his helmet without any thought to the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest if it weren't for the kliegs backlighting the plastic trees br br surprise it's apes doing the chasing or at least it would have been a surprise if no one saw planet of the apes thirty three years ago br br since marky mark did not get to show his pecs take down his pants or bust his lame whiteboy rap he was characterless michael clarke duncan's gorilla teeth being inserted crookedly helped immensely in establishing his lack of character helena bonham carter aka irritating chimp activist at a loss without a shakespearean script did a fine job of outdoing both marky and clarke as most cardboard cutout paul giamatti the orangutan slave trader secured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz though i have grown bilious in hearing puns relating to this movie one review headline captured the essence of this planet of the apes re imagining' the apes of roth' while everyone else minced about looking like extras from one million years bc or greystoke tim roth as chimpanzee thade chews massive amounts of scenery and hurls kaka splendiferously as entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic thade was his character lacked a behavioral arc thade is mad when we first meet him and he's pretty much at the same level of mad at film's end nice twist br br the original pota 1968 featured a leading character charlton heston's taylor who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets yet as that film progressed taylor unwittingly found himself locked in a battle to prove mankind's worth as their sole champion the original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation not salvation when taylor discovers the statue of liberty he is forced to realize that his species had not prevailed is there anything that cerebral or ironic to marky mark's leo or roth's thade no but there's lots of running br br the slogans cry take back the planet but it's the apes' planet in this movie humans and apes crash landed here together the humans having degenerated to cavepeople allowing the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor the apes deserved to inherit the planet along comes marky mark in true anthropocentric arrogance taking it for granted that humans have to be the apex predators simply because they're there taking it back' is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001 complaining a planet where men evolved from apes ' and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy anuses br br heston was cast in the 1968 pota because he had established his reputation as a maverick he was ben hur michelangelo moses to cast him as the mute dogged animal in an alien society was to stupefy an audience's expectations how crazed must a world be where our man charlton cannot command respect marky mark has currently only established that he has tight underpants br br though heston was denigrated constantly by the ape council he dominated the screen with his charisma and stupendous overacting when marky mark tries to instill fervor in the mongoloid humans it's like that unpopular guy in school suddenly being made classroom monitor who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him burton tries to elevate marky to humanity's icon but he comes off as a chittering deviant in the original film the apes deem taylor a deviant yet he was to audience and apes alike an icon of humanity that irony again br br it was apt that a man who elevated scene chewing to an acting technique heston should play the father of this film's primo scene chewer thaddeus roth as roth's ape dad charlton utters his own immortal lines turned against the humans this time damn them damn them all to hell ' br br the movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end while thaddeus is giving marky an ass beating lesson a pod descends from on high with marky's chimpnaut in it apes demonstrate their hebetude by bowing in obeisance to this incognizant creature while marky proves his own hebetude by muttering let's teach these monkeys about evolution ' firstly they're not monkeys you ape secondly it was genetic tampering and imbecilic plot fabrications which brought the apes to this point not evolution and what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the concealed lasergun is called misanthropy not evolution br br giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that estella warren's half nekkid role was actually integral to the plot be still my pants br br no matter that he was humankind's last underpanted hope in the end cop apes take marky away to plot point prison where he was last heard ululating it's a madhouse a madhouse '
<START> this is at least the third remake of this movie so if while watching it there is a sense of deja vu don't be surprised all they did was change the setting of the story and tell it differently but the differences are not significant and it doesn't get any better because the plot is flawed to begin with it never works and like its predecessors the acting is mediocre br br the plot has a unique ending which will surprise any one who has never seen the movie before but the ending doesn't fit the story had this movie ended ten minutes earlier it would have worked and have been very satisfying and i would have thought it more worthwhile but here is the spoiler and that in the end crime does pay because the criminal is not caught i never like this message resulting from a movie
