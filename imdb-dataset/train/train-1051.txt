<START> the sight of kareena kapoor in a two piece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching tashan Â the mega disappointing mind numbing new film at the cinemas this weekend bad films are bad films and we see some every week but tashan is not just a bad film it's a terrible film terrible because it takes its audience for granted terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they've got big movie stars onboard written and directed by vijay krishna acharya tashan is what you'd describe as a road movie but one that's going in all the wrong directions saif ali khan stars as jimmy cliff a call centre executive who's hired to teach english to bhaiyyaji that's anil kapoor playing an ambitious up gangster desperate to go cool jimmy's got his eye on pooja the gangster's pretty young assistant played by kareena kapoor who uses jimmy to swindle her boss of 25 crore rupees determined to recover his money and also to punish both jimmy and pooja bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job so you have akshay kumar as bachchan pandey the gangster's faithful aide from kanpur who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that's hidden across the length and breadth of the country much like those bad eighties potboilers tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot but the treatment's so over the top so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional three act structure you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed that garish item song in the desert the bullet dodging action scene at a rajasthani fort kareeena's bikini moment even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala and believe it or not even a dhanno style horse driven tonga in all fairness not all these set pieces are badly done the item song in the desert is quite neat actually but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture because you're just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really little do you expect in a seemingly fast paced road movie to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweethearts you see the problem with tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making what's more i don't think they cared either the film reeks of arrogance arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work tashan is like an overcooked stew there are films that kill you softly and then there's tashan a film that kills you with excess packaged snazzily with glossy finish camera work exotic locations and fancy costumes every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story doesn't hold borrowing narrative from tarantino and style from stephen chow doesn't help either because they don't blend with the film's wafer thin plot one may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging but anil kapoor's grating hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists and saif ali khan fumbles through the film foolishly unable to find his feet kareena kapoor meanwhile queen of over the top delivery does a decent job but of course if tashan is salvaged to some extent it's thanks to akshay kumar's irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character you cringe when he's cupping his crotch repeatedly and you scowl when he delivers those double meaning dialogues but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when he's up there despite some good music from vishal shekhar the songs seem like they're only prolonging your misery well that's because tashan is a test of your patience in case you didn't know tashan means style i'm sorry to say this film has none
<START> an unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of the secret of nimh and the land before time this was a very touching bittersweet cartoon i remember this very well from my childhood it was funny and sad and very beautiful well it starts out a bit dark a dog who escaped the pound and gets killed by an old friend ends up in heaven and comes back but it becomes sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animals some scenes were a bit scary contrary to other cartoons like the dream sequence of charlie but everything else was okay and the songs were fair a memorable role of burt reynolds and dom deluise i just love that guy ahehehe and judith barsi of jaws the revenge may god rest her soul poor girl she didn't deserve to die but she is in heaven now all good people go to heaven overall this is a very good animated movie a don bluth classic enough to put anime and disney to shame recommended for the whole family and know this if you have the original video of this you'll find after the movie dom deluise has a very important and special message gotta love that guy ahehehe
<START> one of the finest pieces of television drama of the last decade throughout the five hours ones perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged as it explores many facets of modern day british society david morrisey is as usual brilliant at first coming across as a heavy handed copper in conflict with the heroine but then proving to be intelligent and caring as he works with her in uncovering the truth i have never seen surrane jones before i believe she comes from the world of television soaps her performance was magnificent as she maintains her humour and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother i could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this magnificent drama but their efforts would mean little without such an absorbing script that constantly challenges your assumptions about any of the characters it is programmes like this that restore one's faith in television drama whilst at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for most of the garbage that is increasingly filling the airwaves
<START> this is absolutely the dumbest movie i've ever seen what a waste of a splendid cast that's james cromwell as the ignoramus playing deputy i could go on and on but i would obviously be spending more time on this review than anybody ever did on the script the only thing this movie is about is us vs them and how to revel in profane slapstick beyond any reasonable human being's tolerance this is one of the 10 worst movies i have ever seen and i love james garner
<START> what hopkins does succeed at with this effort as writer and director is giving us a sense that we know absolutely no one in the film however perhaps therein lies the problem his movie has a lot of ambition and his intentions were obviously complex and drawn from very deep within but it's so impersonal there are no characters we never know who anyone is thus there is no investment on our part br br it could be about a screenwriter intermingle with his own characters is it maybe by that i don't mean that slipstream is ambiguous i mean that there is no telling hopkins's film is an experiment on the face of it one could make the case that it is about a would be screenwriter who at the very moment of his meeting with fate realizes that life is hit and miss and or success is blind chance as he is hurled into a slipstream of collisions between points in time dreams thoughts and reality nevertheless it is so unremittingly cerebral that it leaves no room for any hint of emotion even to the tiny quite rudimentary extent of allowing us a connection with its characters br br i didn't think the nippy and flamboyant school of shaky machine gun speed camera work and editing disengaged me but reflecting upon the film i am beginning to realize that it had a lot to do with it there are so many movies of the past decade in which the cuts or camera movement have sound effects as well as other atmosphere deteriorating technical doodads i suppose in this case it was justified in that its purpose was to compose the impressionistic responsiveness of dreams however i knew barely anything about slipstream when watching it and i came out the same way and i just do not care because hopkins made no effort to make us care there are interactive movies and there are movies that sit in a rocking chair and knit unaware of your presence slipstream is the latter
<START> what the hell is in your minds this film sucks each minute i was getting more and more bored i strove to watch the end because i hope something at least would at last happen but instead of that i got amazed how dull the end was treated what is this story about this bloody bogeyman how comes he doesn't die he is a bloody human being for god's sake a mere boy that killed his silly sister 15 years ago then what his stay on a psychiatric hospital made him immortal this film a fascinatingly stupid it's a must of silliness i'm gonna resell it right now to some silly guy who will understand this silly film
<START> as we all know a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known the two leads always have to get together late in the third act i was trying to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end up together a clue was given right from the start but you'll never realize it until the end it's a simple hook but it works it had to be you cover a lot of the usual ground but takes a fresh spin when ever possible i liked all the ny characters and i loved the locations it's a postcard of ny also it was nice to watch a film and not find anything offensive in it so if you like a good old fashion romantic movie then this is for you
<START> this crime thriller is sort of like a film noir though changes the context from post war to cold war and has something relatively decent to say about humanity in pickup on south street policemen are good guys criminals are genuine guys and the only enemies are the commies who are ultimately differentiated from the good guys in that they are emotionally personable driven by an actual care for their own worth as shown in the constant tracked in close ups that speckle the movie br br this movie revolves around characters the personalities in this film are rather unique and detailed skip the pick pocket who is able to stare down any danger and sometimes while going through their personal possessions moe the informer who is just trying to save up for a spectacular funeral but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of nearly all the other characters and the audience candy the ill named innocent girl who only thinks she's doing government work and doesn't fully comprehend the conspiracy she's involved with and joey the ex boyfriend evil commie baddie who is trying to hide everything from everybody and ironically is the worst person at doing it throw in a bunch of very colorful supporting characters such as the guy with the chopsticks and the policemen and pickup on south street treats you to a splendor of personalities as they hunt down the mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frames br br polarisdib
<START> fascinating downer about a would be male hustler in new york city forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled con man extremely bleak examination of modern day moral and social decline extremely well directed by john schlesinger who never topped his work here and superbly acted by jon voight and dustin hoffman packs quite a punch overall yet the fantasy scenes some of which are played for a chuckle are mildly intrusive as is the mod drug party the relationship that develops between the two men is sentimental yet the filmmakers are careful not to get mushy and this gives the picture an edge it might not have had with a lesser director than schlesinger originally x rated in 1969 and the winner of the best picture oscar screenwriter waldo salt who adapted james leo herilhy's book and schlesinger also won statues 1 2 from
<START> there is no way to avoid a comparison between the cat in the hat and the grinch who stole christmas so let's get that part out of the way first of all let me start by saying that i think grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film cat was well just awful br br jim carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian and fearlessly commits to over the top outrageous characters mike myers fell back on his old bag of tricks br br why why why mike myers the kids could care less and the austin powers demographic isn't going to spy this film so what was the studio thinking br br the cat was also apparently related to linda richmond can we talk why a new york accent not entirely consistent with anything dr seuss has ever written myers was even allowed to sneak in his scottish shtick i wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to edit out of before they just gave in and said as long as you don't say fahklempt' you can keep the accents meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort either with the costume make up or dialogue br br the jokes what few there were were crude and age inappropriate when myers picks up a garden hoe and delivers to the camera dirty ho everything but the rim shot was missing and even that wouldn't have helped br br the same folks who created 'whoville' clearly had a hand in the creation of the town and the houses in 'cat' the sets and props were very appealing giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing direction and myers br br there was some fun to be had with alec baldwin and kelly preston dakota fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in a movie based on a dr seuss classic and stayed true to the genre br br call the spca this cat should be neutered and never be allowed to reproduce again please please no sequel
<START> very sweet pilot the show reeks of tim burton's better films edward sissorhands big fish charlie the chocolate factory the cinematography the narration the music the external sets all scream tim burton there has to be a connection or a strong influence i just haven't researched enough to know where it is br br as i've seen in the forums yes anna friel is playing a poor man's zooey deschanel every time i see her on the screen i see zooey don't get me wrong anna friel does a great job her character is very sweet and lovable and you easily get attached to her it's more of a distraction that i keep thinking why didn't they get zooey deschanel br br lee pace does a great job too i kept trying to remember where i knew him from and just looked it up wonderfalls great short lived series from 2004 if you enjoy pushing daisies you must go rent wonderfalls which is another brian fuller creationÂ hmmmm br br loved seeing swoosie kurtz world according to garp and ellen greene little shop of horrors again two underrated character actresses that never fail to bring it with their performances
<START> i loved this movie chris showerman did an amazing job not only is he an incredible actor but he is gorgeous with an awesome physique he did a great job on the delivery of his lines plus transformed into george better than fraser did a great performance for his first major roll this movie is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love my kids have watched this movie numerous times since we purchased the dvd the day it came out in addition to the movie the extras on the dvd are just as hilarious two thumbs up on this one i highly recommend it to everyone
<START> from the upper shelf of great classic books comes this masterful story written by pearl buck the book like the movie is called the good earth it relates the story of wang lung paul muni a simple chinese farmer who begins his day with a trip to the 'great house' where he has taken a slave woman called o lan luise rainer and made her his wife almost from the beginning she begins to adapt to his kindness by saving a small peach seed and planting it near her new home during the following years o lan proves her worth by steadfastly sharing her husband's toil troubles and changing fortunes through the passing years they raise a family and watch their simple household weather both feast and famine indeed it's at the lowest point in their lives that each discovers the value of companionship loyalty and love with the changing times their growing family is both aided and threatened with friends and relatives like their uncle walter connolly who is a scoundrel and charlatan but is compassionately tolerated wang has his 'old father' charley grapewin to advise and remind him of life's fragile and fickle nature two notable actors who make impressive appearances in this film are keye luke who plays wang's elder son and phillip ahn who plays a nationalist soldier the film is in black and white and is wonderfully adapted from the novel highly recommended for all audiences
<START> bette davis brings her full trunk of tics to this miserable flop which is another variation on the hilariously mismatched lovers theme sadly cagney and davis are truly mismatched in acting styles and the mix is not simply unpalatable but distasteful the only distinction in the film comes from eugene pallette who literally phones in his usual part as the deb's misunderstood dad jack carson's performance can only be described as an act of mayhem on the audience
<START> i see what the director was trying to do but he missed the mark the main actor was really good but the editing around his moments takes you out of it the camera work ie lighting and exposer is kind of amateur which i could forgive if the direction was more fluent but it wasn't the sound was a bit off and that takes you out of the film as well i see could see this director doing a little bit better in the future so not a total right off but don't expect a dv movie nearly as good as 28 days later or anything keep your expectations low and you'll get more out of it at least it was only an hour and a half oh yeah and other than the lead the acting was pretty bad if you ask me but i'm a movie snob so take that for what that's worth
<START> rounding out the 1929 30 all talkie our gang release schedule a tough winter features two storylines first wheezer and mary ann home alone on a wintry day decide to make some taffy little wheezer relays the directions to mary ann from a radio cooking show the problem wheezer relays information from different shows and mary ann ends up putting soap in the mix funny moments occur when the rest of the gang shows up to pull the taffy and end up getting it all over the house br br the second storyline deals with stepin fetchit a neighbor handyman of the gang and his interactions with the gang br br a tough winter to my knowledge has never been shown on television although it is available on home video the reason for this is the stepin fetchit characterization which shows a shifty sly and slow moving character our gang producer hal roach called fetchit a skilled comic and used this our gang entry as a pilot for a fetchit comedy series that never saw the light of day understandably fetchit's characterization is offensive to many people today which explains why the film has been shelved br br although there are some funny moments both with fetchit and the taffy a tough winter is a plodding and meandering effort if one positive came out of this film it was that the hal roach studios grew confident and experienced in making talkies the sound in the film is good and some of the sound effects used are very funny for this reason this film in part paved the way for the excellent 1930 31 our gang films br br 3 out of 10
<START> the form of the film is that of a suspense shocker there are surprises twists and turns reverses and excitements at times this is truly an edge of the seat film but it disappoints and disappoints severely br br the villain of the piece is not believeable his character does not hold together i refuse to spoil the film but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not be he whom we see at the end br br the second major disappointment of the film is that finally it becomes little more that a bloody slasher film there is little qualitative difference between this and one of the friday the 13th films not that every film need always be totally tasteful but this film does drip gore on occasion br br though the film features the magnificent sean connery even he does not measure up to his usual standard and often just seems to be walking through the paces
<START> footlight parade is fascinating on so many levels there is no way the supposedly staged theater prologues could have been produced in any theater on earth of course think of the huge pools and three story tall fountains for by a waterfall for instance berkeley directed john garfield in they made me a criminal six years later and had the dead end kids singing by a waterfall as they took their showers br br shanghai lil is the best production number in the picture it's a catalog of '30s warner bros sensibilities note the african guys mixed into the scene with white and asian prostitutes you would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were porters on a train or maids in a big house here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others i also get a thrill when the military dancers do a card section presentation of roosevelt's image there's also the nra eagle the logo of the controversial national recovery administration of the new deal fdr was the new president and hopes were so high that he'd pull the nation out of the depression you'd never see something so working class oriented coming out of mgm of course warner bros wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the f d r administration br br dear little miss ruby keeler was never better than she is playing the chinese hooker lil she hardly even watches her feet as she dances which was one of her signature flaws br br the pre code stuff is fun the by a waterfall number is wonderful in that regard the girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus speeding through times square with all its lights on the spread eagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen for 35 years in a few months the production code would eliminate such naughty pleasures
<START> karloff and lugosi together again this is one of those films that casual fans will pass over and tend not to appreciate as much it's not an all out horror film like the duo's previous two hits the black cat and the raven but it is very worthy of both's talents and is a fun film when re visited br br the invisible ray was directed by lambert hillyer a director who mainly made westerns but curiously in these final days of the laemmles' reign at universal he found himself helming this and the laemmles' final horror film dracula's daughter both are crisp clean cut fantasies that are very light on horror content despite the fantastic elements br br just as lugosi went wild in the raven much needs to be said of karloff's hamming in the invisible ray the one aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfying is that karloff's character rukh acts so madly before he is poisoned by radium x that there really isn't much of a change once he starts glowing this is very similar to the complaint people have about jack nicholson in the shining he's basically a loony right from the start there isn't any real transformation same here halfway through karloff simply has an added purpose for revenge in his mind i still enjoyed his performance though just as i did lugosi's over the top antics in the raven br br meanwhile lugosi completely surprises you and gives a restrained and thoughtful turn as rukh's rival in science dr benet lugosi also has some of the best lines in the film including a memorable warning to the police trying to catch rukh of which i am in alignment with horror film writer john soister on and if he rukh touches anyone the inspector inquires lugosi hesitatingly replies in a way that only lugosi could deliver they die just as lugosi could be so off he could also be more perfect than any actor this is one of those moments br br therefore karloff and lugosi's interactions are all very good as we get the mad antics of karloff pared off against the cool logic of lugosi karloff would go on to play similar mad scientists many times however one wishes lugosi would have gotten to play more straight roles like this one he only had one more chance ninotchka br br the invisible ray is a fun film and a real treat to the true karloff and lugosi fans it is one of those films that improves on each viewing not because it is a masterpiece but because of the charisma and talent of its' stars and how this story complements the darker more horrific pairings they had the special effects by the always innovative john fulton are terrific and the supporting actors are all adequate frances drake looks as beautiful as she did in mad love and plays a strong woman something seldom seen in classic horror films the scene in the end when karloff stalks her and she doesn't scream is one of the most haunting moments of the film a terrific fun film
<START> man i really wanted to like these shows i am starving for some good television and i applaud tnt for providing these opportunites but sadly i am in the minority i guess when it comes to the cinematic stephen king as brilliant as king's writing is the irony is that it simply doesn't translate well to the screen big or small with few exceptions very few the king experience cannot be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read many people would disagree with this but i'm sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed king story is but a pale memory of the one they read the reason is simple the average king story takes place in the mind scape of the characters in the story he gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view in short king takes the reader places where you can't put a panavision camera as an audience watching the filmed king we're left with less than half the information than the reader has access to it's not too far a stretch to claim that one becomes a character in a king story they read whereas one is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed for as long as king writes hollywood will try shooting everything that comes out of his word processor without any regard to whether or not they should i don't blame the filmmakers for trying but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive stephen king adaptation that works the task is akin to turning lead into gold or some arcane zen mastery oh well better luck next time
