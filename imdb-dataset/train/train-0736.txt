<START> this is one of those movies that they did too much promoting for if you watch t v then you might as well not watch the movie almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews except one which just happens to be jennifer annisten being the funny one it is typical jim carrey humor and it is really funny just don't go see this movie expecting to be surprised all in all if you like jim carrey or comedies this is a must see otherwise just watch the previews and you'll be just as satisfied
<START> my personal vision of hell is being locked in a room without the ability to close my eyes or block my ears and have this movie play for eternity on every available surface in that room the whole notion that streisand plays a boy man only begins to scratch the surface of how ridiculous a premise this movie is the single most important thing about watching any movie is the concept of willing suspension of disbelief it is impossible to do that in this movie
<START> if the answer to this question is yes then you should enjoy this excellent movie i've just seen it a couple of hours ago here in paris where the action of the movie takes place and i can still feel the huge trauma i received in the back of my eyes what a visual shock i've never seen such a beautiful black white photo and such a drastic change in the way of doing animated movies i strongly believe there will a before and after renaissance similarly to what we saw with pixar movies or the akira and ghostintheshell experiences this is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated movies and i hope this french initiative a small unknown french studio with a few young folks who had a dream named renaissance will receive the success and recognition it deserves vive la france
<START> this is one of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be i dread to think what the blockbuster approved edit must have looked like because the director's cut on dvd was a bore of the epic proportions naturally you don't expect it to be the godfather but an acting class or two might have come in handy br br also there were so many cute guys in this movie but they were woefully under exploited i like watching a bevy of hotties writhe around in their bvds as much as the next guy but even i have a right to expect a little more it wasn't a total loss though at least we got a peek a drew fuller's covered junk and truly upsetting haircut and there's huntley ritter looking even cuter than he did in bring it on and acting about as well there's always a silver lining kids you just have to look really hard for it and occasionally you have to make use of your pause button
<START> this was my first and probably the last angelopoulos movie i was eager to get into it as it featured mastroianni one of my favorite actors and was a film by theo of whom i've heard a lot the opening was promising a long shot over a jeep of soldiers across the albanian greek border ok but that was all nothing left the movie had big holes and i don't know which to mention first the main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman during a long walk it's like a 15 minutes monologue killing the action and viewers patience nothing happening on screen for 15 or even 20 minutes apart this old lady telling a story all that is presumed to be shown through action was simply told to the camera by the old lady in a moment the equippe of tv was heading to the bar they turn the corner and immediately the winter begins probably shot in different days continuity leaked a lot of problems with the story telling it went from absurd to irrational never sticking to a style making the viewer asking questions that never got answers poor mastroianni given a role which lacked integrity or charm on the other hand as many greeks or albanians or balcan people would agree with the movies showed lot of historic ethnic or politically incorrectness just for the sake of making a movie about humanity as a red in another review a lot more to say but no time to lose on a poor movie which was not movie at all but lunacies of a person impressed on film and paid with state money
<START> maximally manipulative anabel sims betsy drake sets out to trap her ideal man aided by her co worker julie esteemed pediatrician madison brown cary grant goes from bemused to betrothed in the space of 90 minutes on film but to the viewer it's all eternity can a movie receive less than one star this one is a prime candidate
<START> i teach japanese for an online high school and i include cultural activities so that the students can learn about the country as well as the language and watching gung ho is one of the requirements the students can either buy or rent the movie stereotypes or not this helps the students to see that other people view the world and their lives differently than we do many of my students have told me that they enjoyed the movie so much they are going to get a copy for themselves it is really interesting to see what we value in this culture and what they value in their culture i just wish i could get a cleaned up tv version i'm not really into the crude language the auto workers use all the time
<START> jane porter's former love interest harry holt neil hamilton and his friend martin paul cavanagh come to tarzan's hidden away jungle escarpment searching for the ivory gold mine that is the elephant's graveyard first seen in tarzan the ape man only we soon discover both men have hidden intentions namely jane will tarzan stand for that not likely in fact tarzan won't even stand for any disturbance done to the elephant's graveyard and knowing this martin attempts to take tarzan out of the picture only he later finds himself in a world of trouble later he and his party including jane who leaves with them after she believes tarzan is dead is captured by a native tribe intent on feeding them to the lions will tarzan be will and able enough to get to them in time br br this film is adventure filled with loads of scenes involving tarzan and other facing down wild animals and a climax that grips the viewer's interest and doesn't let up the cruelty displayed towards animals and the portrayal of native people may disturb some today but all should remember this is basically fantasy adventure entertainment and shouldn't be taken so seriously
<START> my god this movie is awfully boring i am a big fan of gina gershon when i rented this movie i expected a romantic drama and some great performance from gershon gershon is great as always but she is not right actress for this role she is too good for rade serbedzija the romance between gershon and serbedzija's characters is too unconvincing and i absolutely hated serbedzija's character a wonman organizer he is not charming in anyway in the movie how did dr lauren graham gershon is beyond my comprehension maybe sean connery robert deniro or harrison ford would have done a better job on this role but they don't have the european ish looking i guess any way i was so bored druing the movie if you are looking for a good gina gershon movie check out bound her best film so far if you are looking for a romantic film about a younger woman and an older man try some harrison ford or sean connery movies gina gershon is so underrated and she deserves better chance than this i wish her to make better choice in the future
<START> i think this movie got a low rating because it got judged by it's worst moments there is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut scratching scene but apart from that there are actually quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud jason lee is performing some wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie and julia stiles manages to be pretty damn funny herself apart from that this movie behaves like most romantic comedies after about 40 minutes into it you know how it is going to end which is better than most of them where you already know after 5 minutes anyway better movies to watch but definitely not the worst pick cheers
<START> it looks to me as if the creators of the class of nuke 'em high wanted it to become a cult film but it ends up as any old high school b movie only tackier the satire feels totally overshadowed by the extremely steretyped characters it's very un funny even for a turkey
<START> i was so disturbed by the real footage at the beginning of the film that i felt sick to my stomach and ended up shutting the movie off how any can give this film more than a rating of 1 baffles me i know that the intent of the movie is to shock but showing actual footage of a dog that had been skinned alive holding back vomit as i type please i shut it off after the scene with the decomposing baby i had had my eyes covered most of the time up to that point no wonder this movie was found at the bargain bin in hmv i really have no desire to see any other movie by this uwe person anyone who enjoyed this needs therapy period
<START> very entertaining and a great cast as noted i'd like to add that bruce dern did a fine job also as is usually the case worth renting if you can find it which has proved difficult for me also note that the amazon link from this page currently goes to a different movie of the same name
<START> this 1919 to 1933 germany looks hardly like a post wwii czech capitol oh sorry it is the czech capitol and it is 2003 how funny br br this is one of the most awful history movies in the nearest past rÃ¶hm is a head higher than adolf and looks so damned good gÃ¶ring looks like 40 when he just is 23 and the fÃ¼hrer always seems to look like 56 and the buildings folks even buildings have been young sometimes especially 1919 were a lot of houses in germany nearly new the wwi does not reach german cities no crumbling plaster then the reichstagsbuilding there have never been urban canyons around this building never and this may sound to you all like a miracle in the year 1933 the greater berlin fire brigade owns a lot of vehicles with engines some even with turntable ladders but none with a hand pump br br one last thing what kind of playmobil castle was this at the final sequence for me this was a kind of adolf's adventures in wonderland
<START> this movie is pretty awful but i have some interesting information about it br br it was filmed in 1976 at northern arizona university in flagstaff az as well as at oak creek canyon near sedona az a good bulk of the extras in the film are then drama students from nau i was a freshman there that year minoring in theatre but for some reason i didn't get involved with the production i did however know several people who did and can supply this rather odd fact br br there is a scene in this movie where two of the principals as part of their hazing ritual have to run naked into the woods they are seen from behind in the movie doing just that the thing is those aren't the actors at all but two guys i knew from the theatre department the identity of these stunt posteriors will remain anonymous at least to this website unless they decide to um reveal themselves
<START> problem child is one of the goofiest movies ever made it's not the worst though some people will disagree with me on that but it's not the best either it's about a devilish 7 year old boy who wrecks comic havoc on a childless couple john ritter amy yasbeck who foolishly adopts him this film is too silly and unbelievable because i don't buy for one second that a child could act as unrurly as the kid does in this film it's asinine and preposterous although i did laugh several times throughout i really don't know why but i can't recommend this film i know i'm being too kind to it if there is one positive thing about problem child is that it's better than the sequel which was just awful br br out of four
<START> this show made me feel physically sick and totally detached from british society as a whole it was programmes such as this and blue peter that pretended that there were are no class divisions in britain they'd always say things like go into your loft and you may find this or go into your back garden tonight and what about us 'scummy' working class kids who never never had a loft and a back garden which was nothing more than a 1 meter square of balcony on the 14th floor of a council block public service broadcasting yeah right and on top of that it was awfully depressing to see those stupid middle class up their own backside kids mess about with bits of old plastic having 'fun' do me a favour and why don't you go and slit your wrists or do a coke overdose on mama and papa's money you make me sick
<START> scanners ii the new order is just as good as david cronenberg's classic scanners scanners was made in 1980 and scanners ii in 1991 so their's an eleven year gap between the two movies the film captures the style of scanners which is a good thing it wouldn't be scanners without a head explosion so scanners ii has a head explosion scene that's just has gruesome as the first scanners ii the new order has some other imaginative gory scenes that are done well the plot to scanners ii the new order is a new take on the series since it has the scanners being used as a vigilante force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young scanner named david kellum discovers he's being used and decides to get revenge br br scanners ii the new order is a great sequel to david cronenberg's sci fi classic scanners and should be seen check this out 10 10
<START> in the process of trying to establish the audiences' empathy with jake roedel tobey maguire the filmmakers slander the north and the jayhawkers missouri never withdrew from the union and the union army was not an invading force the southerners fought for state's rights the right to own slaves elect crooked legislatures and judges and employ a political spoils system there's nothing noble in that the missourians could have easily traveled east and joined the confederate army br br it seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity when jake leaves the bushwhackers it's not because he saw error in his way he certainly doesn't give himself over to the virtue of the cause of abolition
<START> this is a great film from reading other reviews i can see that i'm not the only one who shed a tear tamilyn tomita acted with such skill and conviction she made the ending heartfelt and memorable in the hands of a lesser actress her last scene would have seemed trite and corny one would never guess this film was done on a tight limited budget the cinematography is gorgeous and there are a number of big name actors the script is so wonderful i can see why they all wanted to be in it if you watch the long long list of credits at the end you'll see that half of hawaii pitched in to make this film happen and for good reason the soundtrack available on cd is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood throughout the film my only complaint is that i almost didn't want the film to end
