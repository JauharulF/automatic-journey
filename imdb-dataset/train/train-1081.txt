<START> a river runs through it is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers norman and paul brad pitt and craig sheffer whose reverend father tom skerritt is a strict man whose two passions are his faith and fly fishing and for him and his sons there is a fine line between the two this story describes the slow progression of the brothers' lives and how their lives separate on two different paths it is a touching movie narrated by the director robert redford playing the elderly norman and reflecting on times long gone and people long dead br br certain themes recur in the movie such as memory death eternity and dreams most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero of paul he is a capable charming and brave man but has his fatal flaws br br the closing lines sum up the point of the movie then in the arctic half light of the canyon all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the big blackfoot river and a four count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise eventually all things merge into one and a river runs through it the river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time on some of those rocks are timeless raindrops under the rocks are the words and some of the words are theirs i am haunted by waters
<START> this was by far the best war documentary ever made from the very beginning of the first episode when sir laurence olivier described the horrific events in oradour sur glane 'the day the soldiers came' to the final days of the war when the mushroom clouds appeared over japan i never missed a second of this classic series and i remember it well even though it was screened way back in 1974 each and every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail this whole series should be compulsory viewing for as many of the world's children as possible so that the tragedy of world war two is not repeated and that bigotry hatred greed and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious zeal
<START> i have just managed to get hold of the celestial region 3 dvd of the five venoms and what a super job they have made of it a fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must have for any kung fu fan br br the story is pretty straight forward and has been mentioned already so i won't go into it again needless to say it's the fight scenes that many buy the movie for and they do not disappoint only problem is they are a bit few and far between and seem over rehearsed bruce lee could take these lot on and drink a cup of tea at the same time all kicks and punches come with the all important type writer clicks and air whooshes which is a cool effect though quite amusing br br i give this movie a b good but not great in a way i feel it could have been that bit better golden swallow by the same director a decade earlier had as good a story and better action
<START> i'll probably get a lot of flack for hating this movie guess i didn't approach it with the proper dewy eyed nostalgia of the generation before me but suffice it to say st elmo's fire was pretty crap freaking tastic even as far as brat pack films go br br here is yet another lovely example of the smug self indulgent neurosis that is everything 80s rent anyone the plot is virtually non existent and the philosophies are kitchy at best poorly delivered the rest of the time the complete lack of anything resembling sympathetic characters doesn't help the situation there really was no growth no forward movement at all even the climactic suicide scene was effectually neutered by once again refusing to let death or anything resembling reality or adult life enter in br br each cookie cutter figure simply goes about making you hate them in the blandest most predictable way possible the stalker is a creep for no discernible reason other than he is a stalker and andie macdowell is gorgeous the jackass does everything in his power to constantly remind you he is well a jackass the gorgeous slut hides really soulful deep pain with a wild lifestyle the poet moods and mopes around for a full 3 4 of the film until he can reveal he actually is full of teddy bears and sunshine and rainbows the virgin finally becomes a whole happy human being after getting every virgin's desire of one hot roll in the sack with a jackass before he ditches her to really change for real this time the cheating bastard cheats until it is time for him to get caught and finally the feminist go around dousing holy water on any soul that utters commitment br br which brings me to my final beef what bond of super cement was holding these people together as friends i can't imagine being with just one of them now think of the vortex created by all that narcissism centered in one bar and they were all so terrible to each other heads in toilets near rape and sleeping around with everrrryone the cherry was after two bffs act like total baboons after screwing the feminist she's like umm actually i don't want to be with either of you anymore let's be friends and we can hang out in a totally unawkward way every day knowing that i may hook up with one or the other at any given point but neither of you are satisfying enough for commitment not that word and they all smile as if to say golly gee i never thought of that what a great idea br br only it's not kinda in the way that watching this movie is not
<START> last year's remake of 'the hills have eyes' was one of the better attempts to update the vaguely exploitational horror flicks of the 1970s for a new audience alexandre aja allowed for an admirable degree of character development and when the violence started it was mean and savage and all carried out in a landscape of impeccable photography and production design i was one of the few people who actually thought that it was better than the original and looked forward to a second visit to the particularly dark and cruel world of the savage desert mutants br br 'the hills have eyes 2' released just a year after the original seems a rushed and ill conceived attempt to cash in on the franchise with little thought to quality jonathan craven's screenplay could have been written in a weekend and given the speed with which this movie made it into cinemas probably was it falls back on every hackneyed genre clichÃ© in the book while offering absolutely nothing new to the desert mutant mythology i always let out a groan of disappointment when a sequel replaces civilian characters with the military soldiers are always so lazily written and never fail to thoroughly bore with crude caricatures of strutting macho bullshit in my mind 'aliens' was the only movie to successfully make such a transition due to james cameron's talent not simply for directing the best action sequences around but never forgetting that an audience has to care about the people being butchered he was also ably assisted by some genuinely talented actors with 'the hills have eyes 2' it's clear that video director martin weisz is no james cameron and the cast of television bit parters haven't the talent or even the inclination to turn their cardboard cutout characters into anything approaching living breathing human beings br br needless to say every character is a broad and generic clichÃ© they act in dumb and illogical ways making dumb and illogical decisions that lead them to predictably dumb and illogical deaths the latter half of the movie becomes just another tedious chased through dark corridors scenario 'the descent' on which sam mccurdy coincidentally also worked as cinematography proved that even this most derivative of sequences can still be carried out with genuine originality and suspense but we see no such innovation here br br 'the hills have eyes 2' is just a very lazy movie devoid of any suspense tension or surprise with not a single individual involved remotely interested in producing anything of quality it's a tame and tired excuse for a sequel and deserves to spend the rest of its life in a blockbuster's bargain bin
<START> cheesy script cheesy one liners timothy hutton's performance a little over the top david duchovny still seemed to be stuck in his fox mulder mode no chemistry with his large lipped female co star he needs gillian anderson to shine he does not seem to have any talent of his own
<START> even though the book wasn't strictly accurate to the real situation it described it still carried a sense of japan i find it hard to believe that anyone who was involved in making this film had ever been to japan as it didn't feel japanese in the slightest almost everything about it was terrible i will admit the actors were generally quite good but couldn't stand a chance of saving it before the film started i was surprised that there were only ten people in the cinema on a friday night shortly after the movie had opened in japan 30 minutes in i was amazed they stayed i stayed so i would have the right to criticize it the whole movie was punctuated my groans and suppressed laughs of disbelief from my japanese girlfriend everyone i saw walking out of that cinema had looks of confusion and disappointment on their faces br br to the makers of this movie you owe me two hours
<START> i've just purchased the restored version of a film that i remember with much affection from childhood and it's certainly made for a curious afternoon's entertainment bedknobs definitely makes more sense in its complete form the deleted scenes especially those with mcdowall link events together quite neatly what is a little disconcerting is the way the scenes have been remastered clearly the soundtrack to this footage had been lost or damaged so some bright spark at disney decided to dub the scenes with new dialogue which would have been great except that half the cast weren't around to do it some for better reasons than others and the whole thing has a rather shoddy quality to it some of the lip synching is pretty poor and david tomlinson's voice has been dubbed by a bloke who sounds absolutely nothing like david tomlinson there's actually a hint of german in it i think however good to hear the full versions of all the songs although 'step in the right direction' is still absent and the moments of magic in this film still shine through and i challenge you not to giggle when young paul gazes so innocently at angela lansbury and coos but what's that got to do with my knob
<START> if this is someone's favorite movie they need some serious help there is nothing funny or clever about this crapfest i haven't seen the original movie this is the remake of some 1950s film but it simply has to be better than this newer bastardization br br a major gets kicked out of the military for being a fringe element and winds up teaching children at an rotc school unfortunately the major is daman wayans so the children are in for a world of annoying humorless asininity can wayans whip these losers into shape can they get him to become a little more human the film bombs as most wayans films do with only a few sparkling moments william hickey gets about one minute of screen time fair too little this charming old man known best to me as a tales from the crypt actor known best to you as uncle louis from christmas vacation shines every moment he's on screen which isn't much here br br bam bam bigelow also makes an appearance as a biker which fits him perfectly i wouldn't mind slightly more bam bam but i think he carried the role of biker about as far as it could be carried for a military film br br and then there's the attractive teacher who someone falls for major payne even though he treats the kids poorly has no social skills and is simply impossible to convert into someone you would want to spend time with she must either be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate i'm not sure which though it would seem stupid since the movie makes it clear she gets out of the house often enough br br wayans had one shining moment a dance sequence where he performs a series of moves including a very nice robot and with the help of music from 2 live crew this scene was enjoyable but hardly made up for anything else that made this film dog spittle br br seriously avoid this film if you want to see a film a bout a loser who helps loser kids become heroes rent or buy ernest goes to camp at least he's a lovable loser and actually funny maybe if major payne had fought a badger i'd feel better but he didn't forget payne forget wayans you can do so much better

<START> the most positive thing i can say for this dull witted local comedy production is that it's inoffensive in fact it's so astonishingly bland that one wonders how many dozens of re writes by committee it went through to have such a complete removal of personality it's not witty it's not entertaining it's not insightful and it's not charming it's just a staid laughless progression of four losers who must change their ways and their attitudes towards women to be allowed to attend their best friend's wedding br br with acting that would be sub par for the local amateur dramatics society a plot line so tired it'd make a forty third season of 'allo 'allo look fresh and jokes about as humorous as watching decaying vegetables sione's wedding nonetheless scored ten yes 10 nominations in the nz film awards recently br br fortunately somebody saw sense and it didn't win any
<START> i don't like sean penn's directing very much and this early work the indian runner is no exception the movie has no core it's colored with a kind of redneck anti authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty taints most of penn's work his latest work even more so than the earlier frank miller robert rodriguez clint eastwood sean penn the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally banal product ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty but ending up being for the most part glorified pro wrestling matches and moralistic almost as if hallmark cards had developed a line of hell's angels greetings and make me long for the days of deliverance which is a fine movie viggo mortensen's acting is much much more believable here than that ridiculous eastern promises thing he did with cronenberg and that's about it the movie is dead meaningless and seems to be an exercise a series of techniques more than a story kudos for charles bronson however who proves he can act and i wanted more of sandy dennis' character a lousy 3 out of 10 for this the indian runner crap
<START> this scary and rather gory adaptation of stephen king's great novel features outstanding central performances by dale midkiff fred gwynne who sadly died few years ago and denise crosby and some really gruesome gore effects director mary lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style and manages to make this one of the few versions of king's work that is not only worth seeing but genuinely unnerving the depiction of the zombie child gage miko hughes later in new nightmare is equally noteworthy as what could easily have been a laughable character is made menacing and spooky as for the people who think that this one isn't scary watch it alone in the dark eventually with your squeamish girlfriend and i guarantee you that pet sematary will creep you out some horror movies like this one or the texas chain saw massacre shouldn't be watched in group recommended for horror fans
<START> takashi shimizu had a great opportunity with a remake of his original film ju on the grudge while i haven't seen that film i would have to wager that there's more imagination and originality or some rip off originality in other words skill with known tropes of the japanese ghost movie than in his own directed remake maybe the script was written to somehow have some kind of warped appeal or i would guess accessibility for an american audience what starts off with some potential the hint of something very screwed up going on with bill pullman's sudden movement just goes into a total jumble and as a horror movie gimme a break br br tension could have been built on the situation a nurse going to take care of a disturbed woman in a house that is haunted but he undercuts everything he wants to get his audience to feel scares how's about some music timed just so you know when exactly to expect something a black cat yeah why not just make the ghost boy thing sound like a cat for creepiness which in effect is only creepy if you want cats plot why not just shuffle between past and present without any semblance of an actual flow of how a story could be told meaning while the flashbacks are inserted and are meant to be organic with the story overall they aren't or for that matter have us care about anyone in the cast br br by the time the characters or those that are there for exposition get around to telling us what is going on or whatever there's little point to care the film making is shoddy i e the 180 degree rule is broken many times over and not in a forgivable or intriguing way and the performances are wooden even when looking frightened or shocked gellar especially is disappointing but pullman who shows up later after his first scene is sorely miscast even when shimizu tries for some average old boo scares like when the woman is in the office building and chased by the grudge ghost it's still silly just watch when she's going on that elevator and the ghost is in the background of shots either you'll go with it and if so more power to you or you'll laugh hysterically at the results count me in the latter br br i'm not totally sure where this project went wrong was it shimizu having to retool it for the studios or him not giving enough leeway with his revamp of his vision or maybe raimi had some say in it and made things more confusing and or dull than they would be with someone else the grudge gives us a lot of information that doesn't make sense or at the least give us some horror fodder to chew on it's cineplex trash of a sad order
<START> what the is this this must without a doubt be the biggest waste of film settings and camera ever i know you can't set your expectations for an 80's slasher high but this is too stupid to be true i baught this film for 0 89 and i still feel the urge to go claim my money back can you imagine who hard it stinks br br who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations well actually you couldn't possible care less and why should you the makers of this piece of garbage sure didn't care they didn't try to create a tiny bit of tension the director stephen carpenter i guess it's much easier to find money with a name like that also made the kindred 1986 wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did soul survivors complete crap as well but at least that one had eliza dushku this junk has the debut of daphne zuniga who yeah that's right the melrose place chick her very memorable character dies about 15 min after the opening credits she's the second person to die the first victim dies directly in the first minute but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares the rest of the actors they don't deserve the term actors actually are completely uninteresting you're hoping they die a quick and painful death and not only their characters br br my humble opinion 0 10
<START> val kilmer love or loath him sometimes he gets under the skin of a character and pulls out a performance that makes you go 'hey this guy is a great actor ' he did in the leather pants of jim in the doors and he's done it again in the leather underpants of john br br revolving around the fall and fall of uber porn king john holmes kilmer strutts to his knees as we unravel one of the biggest murder mysteries hollywood has never solved for over twenty years with holmes the key suspect to a brutal manson style slaughter br br what kilmer does so effortlessly is exhude the low life of the celebrity the do anything to anyone craving that overwhelms anyone who had it and then lost it go see him you'll know what i mean
<START> an american woman her european husband and children return to her mother's home in watch on the rhine a 1943 film based on the play by lillian hellman and starring paul lukas whom i believe is repeating his stage role here bette davis lucile watson george coulouris geraldine fitzgerald and donald woods an anti fascist a worker in the underground movement many times injured and wanted by the nazis kurt muller lukas is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother in law but he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests coulouris is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him out br br great performances abound in this film written very much to put forth lillian hellman's liberal point of view it was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe american homes the movie's big controversy today is that paul lukas won an oscar over humphrey bogart in casablanca humphrey bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous rick but lukas is transcendent as kurt the monologue he has about the need to kill is gut wrenching just to mention one scene br br though this isn't what one thinks of as a bette davis movie she gives a masterful performance here as kurt's loyal and loving wife sara her acting tugs at the heart and the love scenes between kurt and sara are beautiful and tender br br the last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions lillian hellman is not everyone's cup of tea but unlike the little foxes she has written some truly sympathetic wonderful characters and a fine story given a casting and production values by warner brothers highly recommended
<START> i have found this movie available for streaming on netflix and thought i'd give it a try br br the plot revolves around ryan and theo taylor colm feore and david cubitt who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away ryan and theo at first argue about who did what but later theo finds out that his brother ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a terminal illness so ryan and theo spend their time patching up their differences br br this is such an incredible film i have only seen colm feore in season 7 of 24 but he was phenomenal in this david cubitt an actor i have never heard of before did a phenomenal job as well br br i would recommend this to those who are interested in the gay and lesbian genre this is one movie you don't want to miss br br i give this film 10 stars out of 10 excellent film
<START> this movie was so bad i couldn't sit through it without doing something else there was no plot and no point i was thoroughly bored and for a film about a stand up comedian i couldn't recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description politicians with no charisma speaking technical jargon could not be less entertaining br br so how was this made is there no quality control in film watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experience br br it's hard to imagine that adam sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was able to survive after this kind of exposure he was not funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy
<START> the movie is an extra long tale of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the original adventure's spirit the quite horribly american patrick swayze is cast as the british hero allan quatermain despite the obviousness of his nationality br br the movie continues throughout to hollywood ise the story by changing both the plot and the characters to fit more comfortably into the accepted mold the movie manages to be predictable throughout even to those who are not familiar with the story and is plagued by some extremely bad acting and terribly disappointing fight sequences br br all in all a terrible addition to the already quite bad collection of movies based on the legend of king soloman's mines and allan quatermain
