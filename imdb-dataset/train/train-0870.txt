<START> when i first heard about the show i heard a lot about it and it was getting some good reviews i watched the first episode of this forensic fairy tale as it so proclaims itself and i really got hooked on it i have loved it since this show has a good sense of humour and it's fun to see a good show like this the cast is excellent as their characters and i wouldn't want to change them in any way br br for those unfamiliar with this show pushing daisies centers around a man named ned aka the pie maker played by lee pace who discovered a special gift when he was a boy he could bring the dead back to life with the touch of a finger he first did so with his dog digby however there is the catch if he keeps a dead person alive for more than one minute someone else dies he learned this when he brought his mother back to life and his childhood crush's father died in ned's mother's place the other catch is if he touches the person again they're dead again but this time for good he learned this when his mother kissed him goodnight his father took him to boarding school and when he left ned never saw his father again br br almost 20 years later ned owns a pie bakery cleverly titled the pie hole a co worker of ned's olive snook kristin chenoweth has a crush on ned but ned rejects her moves trying not to get close to anyone learning from past experiences private investigator emerson cod chi mcbride discovered the gift that ned has and decides to make him a partner in solving murders ned touches the victim asks who killed them and when the minute is up he touches them again and they solve it that's how they usually solve it throughout the episodes the murders have very interesting plots and be what people least expect br br one day ned discovers that his next murder to solve is his childhood sweetheart charlotte chuck charles anna friel he brings her back to life and decides to break the rules and keep her alive in her place the funeral director who stole jewelery from the corpses died when emerson finds out and when chuck wants to help with solving the murders he doesn't agree a bit for a while we hear him call chuck 'dead girl' this is all kept in secret from olive chuck's aunts vivian and lily ellen greene and swoosie kurtz respectively and everyone else for that matter in case anyone recognized her from obituaries the news etc vivian and lily formerly synchronized swimmers hadn't left the house in years emerson ned and chuck agree to work together ned and chuck grow to love each other though they can't touch each other ever again br br this show is funny has terrific characters contains great plot twists and will definitely get your spirits up i hope it doesn't get cancelled at 13 episodes
<START> as i write this review in 2008 we are mired in a remake culture movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as they can with thoroughly pointless updates including 'king kong 'the wicker man' and practically every film that ever starred michael caine this lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon however as 'dough for the do do' proves an entirely pointless colorized version of bob clampett's surreal masterpiece 'porky in wackyland' 'dough for the do do' sucks the life out of the original by splashing colour all over clampett's original footage and adding some lame new footage overseen by friz freleng freleng was an entirely unsuitable director to be tampering with clampett's source material although in truth no director could hope to come close to clampett's inspired insanity inevitably then 'dough for the do do' is nothing more than the raping of a classic with an appalling new title attached for cartoon fans like myself its equivalent to a colorization of 'casablanca'
<START> in 1930 europe received quite a shock when luis bunuel's 'l'age dor' was released causing a riot in paris when screened there resulting in it being banned for something like over forty years three years later in 1933 when europe had gotten over the shock it was once again turned on it's ear with 'ekstase' a symphony of sorts to love the film starred a young unknown german actress named hedwig kiesler who would later change her name to hedy lamarr when she moved to america to escape the madness of adolf hitler as eva a young bride who has just married a cold distant loveless husband played by emil jerman only to discover that she has made a major mistake one divorce later eva is footloose fancy free is out one day skinny dipping in a lake when she discovers adam a handsome young engineer played by aribert mog who takes a real fancy to her and she him after a wild night of passion eva's ex husband turns up once again hoping to win eva back only to find he now has a rival i won't spoil what transpires czech director gustav machaty who directed the original screen version of 'madam x' another parable in romantic obsession directs from a screenplay by jacques koerpel frantisek horky machaty from the novel by robert horky the film's velvety cinematography which reminded me of avant garde photographer man ray's photos of the era which goes for some impressionistic use of light shadow a lot is by hans androschin jan stallich the film's brisk editing is by antonin zelenka the films art direction which goes for a lush nearly art deco look is by bohumil hes if i have any quirk about this film it is the music score by giuseppe becce which goes for an over the top melodramatic feel to it that gets old fast certain themes are repeated over over again wearing out it's welcome fast kind of like some of david lean's over use of certain musical themes especially in 'lawrence of arabia' and 'dr zhivago' some years back a brand new restored print was made up of the best source material cobbled together from various european existing prints available restoring it to what is quite possibly the closest version of what it originally looked like before the vatican condemned it as decadent yeah right like the church never did anything wrong and the hayes office cut it to ribbons when it was finally released in the u s a in 1936 in a hayes office approved cut likewise minimal dialog in german with english subtitles it was meant to be a mainly visual experience not rated but contains that infamous nude skinny dipping scene by hedy lamarr done tastefully mind you some suggestions of sexual content likewise that would scarcely earn it a pg 13 rating nowadays worth a look if you have any interest in early european cinema or avant garde experimental cinema
<START> whoever says pokemon is stupid can die this movie is superlative i even shead a tear when celebei died i don't cry much this film is a touching animated thriller br br in this fourth installment of pokemon ash and friends must stop the bad jerk from making celebei the ultimate evil weapon with his dark ball in the time sam and celebei travel through time and continuously are hunted by game hunters i like the part with the double battle and sam has the apricorn pokeball if you've played pokemon gold silver or crystal you know what it is br br i also enjoyed having miramax in charge instead of warner brothers putting the mini movie at the end was a great idea the pokemon in this movie come to life more than ever
<START> this is a film i saw when it first came out and which i have seen a few more times over the years it's always enjoyable br br one thing is that the comedy does not take sides it skewers labor and capitalists equally only sid seems outside the classic struggle even though he's responsible for it br br spoiler warning do not read further if you haven't seen the film br br this is a fantasy though presented fairly plausibly ask yourself could someone support most of his or her weight in a single strand of fabric it would cut through almost any support br br also when cornered in an alley sid uses a garbage can cover like a knight's shield cute symbolism br br someday i'll get this on dvd
<START> some of the best movies that are categorized as comedies actually blur between comedy and drama the graduate and butch cassidy and the sundance kid which were made also in the late 1960's are perfect examples are they comedies with dramatic undertones or dramas with a lot of humor in many respects the odd couple falls into this same category of being both comedy yet highly dramatic with deep underpinnings about human nature much of what happens may be funny to the audience but the characters are not laughing br br despite the rather light hearted tv show of the 1970's the original odd couple is not merely about a neat guy and messy guy who are forced to live together because of their marital situation it's really about two opposites who must face why their marriages fell apart and how their detrimental idiosyncrasies reveal themselves outside of their marriage neatness the characteristic of felix ungar jack lemon perfectly cast and messiness the characteristic of oscar madison walter matthau are only the beginning and somewhat superficial as the story unfolds we find there is a lot more to these men than simply neatness versus messiness br br briefly the story is really about felix ungar who has to face an impending divorce from his wife francis who we never meet but is an important character throughout the story on the verge of suicide ungar goes to the only place he knows the apartment of oscar madison where a group of poker buddies hang out every so often we learn that ungar is not only a member of this poker club but the group knows what's happening to him and try in their inept way to help out madison figures the best way to help ungar is to let him move in with him until his suicidal tendencies wear off br br unfortunately for madison he doesn't know what he's getting himself into madison is a carefree happy go lucky if rather irresponsible slob who's refrigerator was last cleaned probably when herbert hoover was still in the white house madison's idea of serving snacks is grabbing moldy cheese and sticking them in between two pieces of bread and then throwing the contents of a bag of chips on the table on the other hand he enjoys booze and women in short having a good time br br ungar is not only altogether different he is diametrically opposite he is not only an obsessive neatness nut that finds more joy in disinfecting the apartment than meeting women but he knows more than most women do about cooking and fine eating at one point he calls his ex wife not to talk about reconciling but to get her recipe for meatloaf at another moment ungar was going to spend the rest of the evening cutting cabbage for coleslaw when madison seems unimpressed ungar finally confesses he was only doing it for his roommate because he can't stand coleslaw who is this guy but he has another endearing trait felix is also a hypochondriac he obsesses about his health to the point where he makes strange noises in public places claiming he's helping his sinuses he seems to have every health condition in the book and if they made up more felix would probably have them ultimately he is overly self absorbed br br running throughout the movie are references to marriage at one point when madison is trying to convince ungar to move in he says what do you want a wedding ring but little does he know that it is not the neat guy who can't deal with the messy guy but the other way around their friendship becomes an inadvertent hellish relationship and the climax occurs when oscar invites two lonely british sisters for a get together with both comedic and tragic results this is one of the best comedies of its type ever written and not to be missed with superlative performances by walter matthau and jack lemon in roles that are hard to imagine better played by anyone else it is unfortunate that writing of this caliber is sadly lacking from most comedies being produced today
<START> i've waited a long time to see dr tarr's torture dungeon and after i watched it i was really disappointed by it it's not the baroque film i expected it to be the trailer which i saw on a something weird dvd is much better than the entire film which is remarkably forgettable there are almost no stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is interesting but it doesn't even come close to other baroque styled movies out there from fellini or jodorowsky the characters are dull and there's almost nothing dramatic going on even though we see rape crucifixion insanity etc br br the main problem with dr tarr's torture dungeon was the fact that it was a talk a thon more than anything else it was almost like watching a book i just wanted the film to have moments of silence or mood or something instead we see listen to the main characters chit chat endlessly about dull stuff br br a missed opportunity
<START> i'm sorry but this is just awful i have told people about this film and some of the bad acting that is in it and they almost don't believe me there is nothing wrong with the idea modern day japanese troops get pulled back in time to the days of busido warriors and with their modern weapons are a match for almost everything when the troops first realise something strange is happening does every single person in the back of the transport need to say hey my watch has stopped imagine lines like that being repeated 15 times before they say anything else and you have the movie's lack of greatness in a nutshell
<START> the best that i can say about this film is that it was mildly amusing at times and that it was an adequate time killer unfortunately this film is also so annoying that i wanted to slap these characters around this is the kind of film that is so sweet it hurts your teeth the intentions were good i suppose but things get awfully tiresome when the dialogue is so nauseating when the two leads aren't together on screen this really isn't bad at all but be afraid during those frequent moments when the loving couple starts talking to one another
<START> where to begin how best to describe just how awful this movie is br br let's start with the campy hick humor it isn't very funny add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors meat loaf is horrible and deborah harry is even worse pity poor art carney who should have known better than to do this movie br br and then there is the plot a roadie whose life goal is to work an alice cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for alice cooper at least they get what they want br br and then just when the movie should end they can't come up with a more plausible last scene than a well i won't ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie br br there are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a b movie or perhaps worse gailard sartain is one of them for me and he has a more prominent role that's a sure sign that the movie probably won't be very good if nothing else the movie lives up to the low expectations even exceeds them by being worse than poor br br let's just say this this is the movie against which all bad movies are compared and none are worse than roadie
<START> this is an excellent stand up dvd eddie izzard is the funniest person i have seen in years his routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it i highly recommend this one the part about the history of europe is a bit slow but the ending jokes in french are quite good because you don't have to speak french to get it although if you do it is still hilarious also the parts about being a transvestite are quite good the first scene about san francisco is not great but funny the first time skip over those if you can it's almost not worth watching however this really is a funny funny stand up show that everyone should see i was dead at the time
<START> roman troy moronie is my comment on the movie what else is there to say br br this character really brings out the moron in moronie a tough gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words well it seems that it would have been frustrating to be tough and yet not be able to express oneself intelligently br br roman moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the greatest of all morons br br there is of course great comedy among the other characters michael keaton is f a h and so is joe piscipo br br i just like the fact that moronie kept the movie from an r rating because he could not pronounce profanity
<START> my friend and i picked paperhouse out of a random pile of movies on our weekly excursion to the horror section neither of us had heard of it but the blurb on the box was really promising and the movie didn't disappoint though i still probably wouldn't call it a horror movie exclusively br br 11 year old anna madden draws a house and visits it in her dreams she is definitely asleep when she's seeing the house but it's so real in a sense that it's almost like a completely separate reality which in view of later events doesn't seem like a far cry from the truth anyhow she finds she can add to the house its contents and its surroundings by simply adding to the picture br br while this is going on anna is getting increasingly more ill with a fever and besides that is getting totally obsessed with the house and her drawing on top of that she and her mother are also dealing with her absent father he has a job that takes him away for long stretches though one gets the impression there's actually more to the story than that br br ok so the drawing stuff sounds nice enough but frankly there's something really menacing about it the dreamworld is eerily surreal the house for instance is just a grey block in the middle of a desolate field the folks who made the movie did a great job of making us very uncomfortable with this alternate world ongoing dream br br one of the things anna adds to the house is a boy mark who seems to be the same patient her doctor keeps talking about i'm not giving that away you know from the moment he appears that it's the same kid in reality mark can't walk due to an illness in anna's drawing world he can't walk because she didn't draw him any legs she blames herself for his real life illness and tries to rectify the situation but everything starts getting really weird she even brings her absent father into the drawing with disastrous results the bits with the father are really terrifying br br i don't want to give anything away so i'll stop there there seems to be a lot going on in this film i'm sure you'll have a ball analyzing this thing do death with your pals after you watch it is it a simple a story as it seems or are there actually layers of meaning i don't know but either way it's quite fascinating there was a nightmare on elm street ish quality about it in that at a certain point reality and dreams intersect i love things like that br br my only complaint is that it feels like it could have ended many times but didn't i'm satisfied with the ending it had some of you sensitive types might want to have kleenex handy though it really could have a variety of conclusions anyway it doesn't exactly feel drawn out once it's actually over but while you're watching and it keeps fading back in it's a little nerve wracking br br still paperhouse is a really good film it's well done and acting especially charlotte burke as anna is top notch burke who has never before or since appeared in a film is a real gem i don't know why she never went onto do anything else but either way she's really convincing and enjoyable to watch br br paperhouse isn't exactly a horror movie it's sort of a fantasy suspense something else type of movie with some definite horroresque moments but you can still watch it with your family and not be worried that your little brother or grandmother will get grossed out by blood splashing or something br br give it a chance you won't regret it and maybe you should read the book too
<START> brazilian films often get more positive appraisals than they actually deserve rather incredibly contra todos against everybody original title which the producers discarded god against everybody got very low gpa grade point average in this website it seems to be bluntly rejected by female spectators at large actually it is not so brutal i mean as far as graphical violence is concerned its brutality is intrinsic as it portrays would be lumpens i mean underdog citizens who in fact possess high tech equipment who coldly perform murder orders in exchange of grana graÃºda is this post modern man is his her only worry a quick almost impersonal ultra permissive lay amidst over satiating meals the picture is probably the best brazilian film of 2004 so far its shining editing style Ã  la godard its curious soundtrack counterpoints its more than efficient overall cast and above all its original narration with subtle non chronological hidden points that only come to light in the epilogue deserve at least an 8 mark
<START> i gave this film an 10 10 with some reluctance as it's hard to praise something that so haunted and terrified me for years the sheer menace on the woman in black's face is just pure horror and the accompanying music just worsens the dread br br i saw this when it was first on tv when i was 10 and it really did disturb me for years i'm fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this too so many movie reviews go on about how disturbing or terrifying a film might be but you can believe all those who have posted on this board this really is incredibly powerful stuff i mean i really like horror films and generally find them quite funny more often than not but this really is menacing and will probably disturb most people i haven't seen it since i was 10 and i'm tempted to watch it again but fear i might have some sleepless nights i can't quite put my finger on what it is exactly but i think it's something to do with the fact that fear is the woman's greatest weapon and that we as viewers are just as susceptible as we feel the fear so intensely it's remarkable that other viewers' feelings are so unanimous br br i've also seen the stage play which was an excellent production but nothing can compare to this
<START> this film is absolutely awful but nevertheless it can be hilarious at times although this humor is entirely unintentional br br the plot was beyond ridiculous i don't even think a 2 year old would be convinced by the ludicrous idiocy that the film makers tried to slap together into a story however on the positive side some of the horrifically inane plot twists provide a great deal of humor for example wow lady hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in her back yard it gets worse and even funnier but i'll spare you br br the acting is generally laughable most of the kids' roles are sort of cute but not very believable on the other hand annie is pretty awful all around the adults don't take their roles seriously at all but this is largely a good thing if they'd tried to be believable the film would've been even worse which is difficult to imagine br br once you get past the overall crappiness of the movie there are actually a few standout moments of almost not crappiness the scene where lady hogbottom's son runs away with the maid is surprisingly hilarious though it's an annoying letdown when they get caught by the police the butler character while very minor is a ray of sunlight that almost but never quite pierces through the gloom br br watching this movie actually caused me physical pain nevertheless there were a few redeeming parts that made it almost watchable without beginning to hemorrhage internally judged on its good parts alone the movie would be about a 5 unfortunately the rest of the movie hardly deserves a 1 thus i give it a 3 br br that's being pretty generous i'd say
<START> i've been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too some of the users are stuck in a 'realist' type of mentality this film was meant to be a 'fantasy' a 'what if' fun film it was never meant to be 'real' or serious it was thoroughly enjoyable for everyone i knew when it came out even though it shadowed the tragedy of the challenger explosion i was 30 at the time and totally enjoyed this one my young son loved it too later i shared it with my daughter and she too loved it spacecamp is a fun family film that should be enjoyed for just that fun all the 'realists' in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film so sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real spacecamp one in alabama and one at vandenberg afb in california they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt 'letdown' i guess their parents didn't explain the difference between fantasy and reality oh well if you love fantasy fun films and haven't seen this one i highly recommend it enjoy
<START> this movie is brilliant the comments made before is from someone who obviously doesn't get it the movie is campy yes but it is uplifting and fun this movie is an underground hit and brings comparisons to absolutely fabulous it is a must see
<START> anton newcombe makes the film and he is the main subject watching him knock up a song if not a whole album quickly showed the guy to be a real talent he thinks he is god but is so prollific and interesting the dw are not really that interesting in comparison musicly or otherwise hey do you haver a drivers license anton says to the cameraman well lets go pawn this guitar great use of archive home video material great to see rock docs still being made a cool doc about the creative process if you like this go see nirvana live tonight sold out on dvd a good experience anton is this film 8 out of 10
<START> swayze doesn't make a very convincing alan quatermain compared to stewart granger which growing up was my ultimate hero in films like the 1952 scaramouche the 1952 prisoner of zenda and the 1950 king solomon's mines patrick swayze fails utterly even the portrayal of an older alan quatermain by sean connery in league of extraordinary gentlemen was very good in an otherwise big flop also alison doody lacks the grace of deborah kerr in the role of the leading lady and last but not least the impressive siriaque in the role of umbopa makes it very hard for anyone to fill his shoes for someone who was disappointed by richard chamberlain's 1985 version i now highly recommend it if you can't get your hand on the granger version
