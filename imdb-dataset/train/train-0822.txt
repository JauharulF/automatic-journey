<START> by no means a masterpiece and far from errol flynn's best istanbul still has much going for it the locations and beautiful technicolour cinematography bring us back to a time long since past errol flynn does show moments of his past glory and is ok as jim brennan a pilot who's past comes back to haunt him the picture is actually a remake of 1947's singapore and the story seems awfully contrived and cliche' by today's standards also many of the supporting cast seem to be simply going through the motions in this picture many people have also compared it to one of the all time greats casablanca while watching the film i could see many of the similarities but hey casablanca has inspired countless imitators so take that for what it's worth in closing if you are a fan of flynn or old fashioned love stories you might want to give this film a look otherwise i'd recommend casablanca or the maltese falcon as a good introduction to some of hollywood's classics
<START> refreshing lost' gem featuring effective dialog combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and involve you enough to care what happens to them the douglas and widmark characters are realistic heroes palance is his usual evil presence widmark win the fisticuffs fight scene a car chase of less than 60 seconds with a logical' end and a lengthy chase on foot that shames the overdone chase sequences of contemporary hollywood you know how it will likely end but the suspense and interest are sustained throughout the end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see the film seems to slow a little past the middle but stay with it for the rewarding conclusion
<START> i watched the canadian videotape of this movie as the witching which somehow made its way to new york state audio was quite bad i had to raise it to about 7 8 just to hear it and the soundtrack often was overwhelming the dialog orson welles was a mumbler worse than usual and some of his dialog and of others was run through an echo chamber a ghostly figure who keeps reappearing had her voice distorted some closed captions would really have helped br br a group of witches or satanists the end credits say the group was not meant to represent any real group have a ritual in which they get naked and cause a miscarriage by stabbing a doll the woman who had the miscarriage and her husband move to a town named lilith where he's been offered a job at a toy factory despite one of the akas of this movie apparently being the toy factory we never see it and it's only occasionally referred to at all br br on the way to lilith her husband gets impatient with some of her questions about what his new boss mr cato wanted to know about their religious persuasion he drives aggressively and causes another car to go off the road and blow up after the police arrive she takes a doll that fell out of the car the second of many handmade dolls in the movie br br it turns out mr cato and all the townspeople are witches and that they are the ones who caused her miscarriage though she doesn't realize it they want her because she has an innate talent for necromancy of which she was not really aware br br some images in the movie have some impact but on the whole the movie is not very involving the movie does seem a bit of a mess and this is no doubt largely due to its re editing and the addition of new footage the original version according to the end credits was called necromancy a life for a life the magic of dvd could let us see both versions on one disc but re releasing this movie probably isn't a priority
<START> in my humble opinion this movie did not receive the recognition it deserved robert redford lives near me here in provo utah at sundance i enjoy most of his work and this was my favorite i'm sorry that more people didn't appreciate it my grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it came out on the big screen she gave it to me to read after we had seen the movie together the movie and book hit an emotional spot within my heart and i was weepy for several days after seeing the movie sometimes love isn't enough to keep our loved ones from hurting themselves we see this in our own family relationships yet our love and our families and their stories endure throughout generations of time the cinematography was perfect and breathtaking i was awed by its beauty and how well it brought to life the words of the author of the book norman maclean but when i am alone in the half light of the canyon all existence seems to fade to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the big black foot river and a four count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise eventually all things merge into one and a river runs through it the river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time on some of the rocks are timeless raindrops under the rocks are the words and some of the words are theirs i am haunted by waters these words taken from the book and spoken at the end of the movie by robert redford who is narrating as norman maclean are basically scripture in my opinion any possible flaws the movie may have are overshadowed by the beauty and grace of the story and the cinematography it was beautiful
<START> you know those films that have you trapped in the cinema you're stuck there in the best seat in the house centre of the row in your own special sweet spot that you swapped three times before you got just the right seat and after about what feels like 13 hours you are still trapped there uncomfortable and itchy thinking when the f is this film ever going to end you know the feeling think of a i and the village br br well visitor q delivers a weird variant of that feeling i sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when the thing was going to f ing start it is interminable so arty it hurts this is the first miike takashi film i have watched apparently he makes films by the dozen and if they are all pretentious w nk like this i suspect it will be the last br br i'm not against pretentious w nk david lynch is up there amongst the top 10 directors for me but visitor q is cut rate cheap and nasty pretentious w nk br br as you may have worked out by now i hated it
<START> this film as low budget as it may be is one of the best psychological thrillers i've ever seen if you accept that it's low budget from the start you can appreciate just how good of a story it is how very well written the script is and how great the filmmaker was to produce something so wonderful with so little money br br all the elements of a great film are here the visuals though shot on digital were gorgeous in places the bizarre dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly well in the scene with the talking dog that scene was just amazing it's such a trippy piece of work but not done in a pretentious way and because of that i have a whole lot of respect for this film it comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there
<START> it doesn't even merit a review other than as a warning to potential viewers it's a somewhat generic ghost story about an actress haunting a studio during the filming of a wwii period drama there's no fear involved no suspense whatsoever nor any surprises one shocking moment that looks a bit too silly to be shocking the visual style is very flat and dull although there is some really nice editing once in a while the story never comes together and the films is really just a total bust 4 10
<START> this movie is incredibly realistic and i feel does a great justice to the crime that many people do not understand because of a lack of experience the many people who think they could fathom what goes through a victim's mind are arrogant as a victim i feel that dawson did a fantastic job in her role of maya i agree that this is an incredibly brave film this looks at rape from a different more realistic standpoint than any other movie i've ever seen on the subject the end did drag on a bit long but i know that many victims imagine this kind of justice since the chances of an attacker being sent to jail for their crime is around 1 it's good to see a movie that sticks closer to reality than most would dare to
<START> i watched this film in a very strange way i had put it on my netflix list and couldn't remember why other than that i knew philip seymour hoffman was in it since the film has no opening credits i couldn't even remember who had directed it br br as my wife and i watched it i turned to her about 45 minutes in and said you know i keep wanting to decide that i hate this film but something about it just won't let me stop watching it then there's a stretch of about half a dozen scenes in the middle of the movie that are truly electrifying in the actors' performances br br it was only as the end credits rolled that i realized it was a sidney lumet film and i thought wow i'm surprised that lumet took on what was really a dirty petty little story about really mean broken people but it's a testament to his talent that i was so taken in when i didn't even realize it was him br br philip seymour hoffman is really really good in this movie like scary good put this up against capote and i would argue the oscar should have been for this film instead br br i also highly recommend the narrative special feature with lumet hawke and hoffman talking about making the movie it's entertaining and educational with hawke playing the student eager to learn at the master's feet lumet definitely teaches you the first rule of working with actors kiss their asses constantly br br there are a lot of violent melodramatic movies out there that are empty ciphers when all is said and done and there is an element of that in this film that the actors fill the air with sulphurous blasts of emotion and when the smoke clears there's nothing left nothing resonates on a deeper level br br but lumet has given us network and twelve angry men films that each in their own ways have been elevated into the highest echelons of cinema br br this movie isn't at that level but there's something about it that lingers and maybe that's enough br br my final comment is about the comments if you look at the number of comments about this little movie here on imdb and the depth and intelligence of the comments pro and con it's a pretty good indication that something special is going on with this film
<START> those of you who know the group deus know the lead singer tom barman he directed this movie a bit like he creates music it's a mix of everything this is a comedy though mostly absurd and cynical a drama none of the main characters have a happy life to say the least and it does not really have a goal br br the movie starts on a friday morning in antwerp belgium with scenes of several persons some of them have nothing in common but they will come in contact with each other during the day and night there are several main characters a teacher who writes books nobody reads a young researcher with a morbid taste of death and his sister a gallery owner two young men constantly in touch with the law a man who works in a movie theater and two young women throughout the movie there walks a man who has something to do with wind all characters have their troubles with their family or friends or just with life itself br br the movie is set in antwerp and shows several beautiful shots of the city and the port the events of the day are not easily explained i advise to simply watch the movie there is simply too much to tell but i can say this barman has an excellent use of the camera and uses a lot of music mostly dance music not really rock to set a mood especially the party is filled with excellent music br br this movie is an experience on itself it will not leave you any wiser about life perhaps only that you have to live it and not waste it or have any false moral truths br br in short see it it is definitely worth it
<START> i didn't expect much when i rented this movie and it blew me away if you like good drama good character development that draws you into a character and makes you care about them you'll love this movie br br engrossing
<START> i could not agree less with the rating that was given to this movie and i believe this is a sample of how short minded most of spectators are all over the world really are you forgetting that cinema used to be a kind of art before some tycoons tried to make it only entertainment this movie is not entertainment at least not that easy entertainment you get on movies like titanic or gladiator it has style it is different it is shocking that's why most of you have hated it so much because it does not try to be pleasing to you it's just a story a very weird one i admit but after all only a weird story it is not a great story not even a great cinema work but i believe it is worth a 7 stars rating only for the courage of both author and director to shot a story that is not made to please the audience thus selling billions of copies and making the big studios even richer this movie is for me european artistic like movie made in the us and everyone involved in the making of it deserves respect be it for the courage or be it for the unique sense of humor
<START> as a poker enthusiast i was looking forward to seeing this movie especially as it had scotty nyugen in it br br basically scotty nyugens short spots in this film are all it has going for it br br the characters are unlikeable and annoying the soundtrack is awful and the plot well there isn't one br br i honestly got a headache and found myself reading the barcode number on the dvd box after twenty minutes i was that bored its actually ashame that nyugen was in this movie as otherwise i wouldn't have wasted 16 buying it off ebay br br take it from me avoid like 7 2 offsuit dire
<START> the film looks super on paper a romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a smuggling thriller should be generic cross breeding gold especially with this excellent romcomic cast br br i'm afraid lawrence kasdan simply gives his two stars too much rope though and they duly go and hang themselves adam brooks' script may well be to blame but you'd expect better from the kevin kline of a fish called wanda instead the two ping pong off one another and the unlikely burgeoning romance is never reconciled satisfactorily with the reason either of them are in and dashing around france br br jean reno co stars amiably as the cop with a heart and i guess wishes he was a star with a part mind you he went on to do those pink panther remake s so perhaps he was ok with this 3 10
<START> this is a very exciting and romantic film i have seen it several times and never get bored with it everything is realistic and it is a good plot the actors are excellent liam neeson jessica lange tim roth and brian cox br br i actually prefer this film to braveheart as braveheart contain so many historical misstakes there is many exciting scenes watch out for the bridge scen and the last fencing scene this is really good and surprising scenes br br the music are lovely it really suits to the movie the setting is amazing
<START> i had quite high hopes for this film even though it got a bad review in the paper i was extremely tolerant and sat through the entire film i felt quite sick by the end br br although i am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema i thouroughly enjoyed both woody allen's 'everything you ever wanted to know about sex ' and michael hanneke's 'funny games' i found the directors' obsession with this ten year old wanting to drink women's milk totally sickening and when the film climaxed in an orgy where the boy drinks both his mother's milk as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film i almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and sentimental pap that it is br br don't get me wrong i enjoy the vast majority of european cinema as well as independently made films so this flick should have pleased me enormously avoid this film at all costs it should be relegated to the annals of history as a lesson in bad cinema
<START> cruel intentions 2 is bloody awful i mean uber bad words can not explain how bad it is but i'll give it a go anyway br br the plot of cruel intentions 2 is very similar to the first film sebastian robin dunne is kicked out of a private school and is forced to move to new york there he decides to make a fresh start and just a life a normal life and settle down unfortunately he has to deal with his step sister kathryn amy adams wants to drag him down sebastain starts to fall in love danielle sarah thompson the innocent daughter of the headmaster of the school kathryn wants sebastain to just sleep around with the whole school which had been describe as a 'whore house' kathryn also wants to get revenge with cherie keri lynn pratt who humiliated her during the school assembly kathryn wanted to make the freshman into the biggest slut in the school a similar sub plot to the first film br br cruel intentions 2 is basically a cancelled tv show which was turned into a prequel there are so many problems with the film it is poorly written unfunny and badly acted luckily for amy adams that the show never took off because now she is a fairly big actress whilst cruel intentions had a sense of realism and can been seen to be set in the real world cruel intentions 2 is set in sitcom land and as described on amazon co uk 'a randy version of saved by the bell' there were some dark themes involving sex and drug use in the first film but in cruel intentions 2 tried to make it funny and some of the ideas in the film shouldn't be such as kathryn having an affair with a teacher other ideas also don't work such as the secret society where all the popular kids meet to discuss the downfall of other students the film also had a major problem of sexualised 15 16 years old i know that teenagers do have sex sometimes a lot but when done on film or television is treated very seriously one famous sense was when daneille encourages cherie who is around 14 15 in the film to simulate sex on the back of a horse to the point where she has a orgasm the idea of turning a girl around 14 15 into a slut is just very wrong with me and shouldn't be made into a subject of comedy the jokes in the film fall flat whether if it's a verbal gag like 'she goes all moist when she sees you' to a visual gag where sebastian pushes kathryn face first into mud br br there is a lot wrong with this film which i don't have time to go into but i say it should be avoid just watch cruel intentions whilst not a classic still is a decent film and treats the subject matter well br br this film is just a pervert's wet dream having school kids having lots of sex with each other
<START> what happens to washed up rock n roll stars in the late 1990's they launch a comeback reunion tour at least that's what the members of strange fruit a fictional 70's stadium rock group do br br tony stephen rea has the concession on condom vending machines when he runs into the son of the promoter of a famous music festival it was at that festival in the 70's that strange fruit broke up the 70's are retro and the time is right to wide that wave he sets off in search of the other members of the band br br part of what broke up the band was the death and replacement of keith the lead singer and brilliant song writer the band was known for its excessive lifestyle and now they are all back amongst the working class from which they came beano the drummer played by timothy spall who was brilliant in secrets and lies is a layabout the bass player is a roofer and their lead singer is still a rocker while he owns a huge mansion he has been forced to sell it as his fortune has not lasted brian the lead guitarist is dead so a young guitarist is hired to replace him br br somewhat reluctantly the band agree to give the reunion a try abandoning their day jobs they begin to rehearse and their manager approaches their label about reissuing their albums but he wants them to start touring again first and so they hit the club circuit around europe the club scene is not kind to these overweight dated old rockers br br it is on tour that the film really starts to develop all of the old conflicts rearise with the figures of keith and brian hovering throughout they all hang together because they are all in search of a second chance for the greatness that eluded them earlier and they rediscover some of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so enjoyable br br still crazy starts as spinal tap ii but gradually becomes a more dramatically focused film following the relationships of the band members while it is still a very funny movie it is the evolving characters struggling to deal with the deaths of brian and keith and with their own personal demons that make the film work
<START> i will begin by saying i am very pleased with this climax of the bourne trilogy please oh please don't ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel just leave it alone right moving on as talented and versatile as matt damon is it seems as though he was just meant to play jason bourne br br if you are a fan of the first two bourne movies you will not be disappointed by the third installment it sticks to what works and adds a little more i was very pleased to see how well all the information we obtain in 'identity' and 'supremacy' all mesh in 'ultimatum' to finally paint the full picture of jason bourne's troubled past the action sequences are fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat the fights between bourne and the assassins are always fun to watch i have always been a fan of movies surrounding cia agents and how the cia gather their intel and this movie is right up that street making it even more exciting for me br br if you choose to watch the bourne ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments you will still thoroughly enjoy the movie but i would still recommend you watch them first this would allow you to fully understand the character jason bourne and become attached and be a part of his world this allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more i'm not sure which is the better of the first 2 but i personally think 'ultimatum' might just might have the edge when comparing the trilogy
