<START> okay first of i hate commenting on this thing but i felt like i had to stand up for this movie so many people were bashing on it and i felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinion br br first off bend it like beckham is not meant to be the most profound movie of the century if that's what you're looking for go somewhere else just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artsy it's supposed to make you feel good and you're supposed to have fun watching it and those two things are handily accomplished br br secondly the acting though not halle berry in monster's ball is still good the movie doesn't need acting like that honestly so don't look for it it's a family movie if that's what you wanted you wouldn't or shouldn't even be looking into this movie honestly br br lastly it has a really cute story i think it's thought out well and it's entertaining to watch it's also very true to life for the most part for that culture so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about when you're finished if you're looking for something with deep thought out plot lines and big dramatic scenes this is not for you br br lyndsay
<START> seems that the cast should ensure at least an average movie and so i sat down for 102 minutes of unbelief beside ed harris no one seems to own the skills of acting even sean connery who i normally worship must have had an off day during the entire filming of just case not once in during the whole movie one actor could convince me br br this made this movie look cheap and unreal br br the story makes up a little it is thrilling and the plot is unexpected br br conclusion only watch this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do
<START> i used to write comments at imdb but i don't do so anymore it happens that imdb has become massive and consequently subjectiveness has ruined scores what do i mean that anyone that is not particularly fond of movies and doesn't have any expertise on the subject watches some crap or the opposite and in case he likes it delivers a 10 and if he doesn't he goes for a 1 this of course cannot measure anything correctly now for the film i truly regret ever having delivered any 10s to some very few films because then i must score this one with 12 or 13 which is not possible this documentary has something that i don't expect to watch ever again in my whole life in any other film it is simply mesmerizing and it's not just a way of saying it really is the last 25 minutes have a load of energy visual rejoice and wisdom the words spoken by the starring guys that really there's no possible match i don't keep movies rarely would i find any sense in doing so but this one is the kind of film you should buy and keep and watch from time to time maybe 10 or 20 times as years go by i got nothing more to say this is a genuine objective 10 for me
<START> this is one of disney's top five animated features in my opinion cinderella was a perfect return to the full length feature animation film as opposed to the compilation films of the 40's and expensive depth via the multi plane camera returns to the film in no other way although disney adapts the story somewhat liberally you gather the idea of the era via the dress and set stylizations a clear time period the story takes place br br cinderella is more mature than snow white and a multi dimensional character actually all of the characters are somewhat well developed except for the prince left the most flat we know he has a sense of humor and a great smile but that's about all like snow white disney has some permanent impact on the story in popular culture in most versions of cinderella the stepsisters are attractive just not as pretty as cinderella and their character takes away from their otherwise nice appearance br br favorite disney additions the mice also appreciated the continuity cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film the addition of the homemade gown as well as the following assault from the stepsisters was always horrific as a child i remember view master showing this with a black background and a large red light on it the broken slipper shows the unwillingness of evil lady tremaine to give up her hold over cinderella and admit defeat audley would go on to characterize the most wicked of all disney villains satanic witch maleficent in sleeping beauty
<START> while i do not think this was a perfect 10 i do agree it was way above a 6 which is what it's rated here no brokedown palace was not perfect and yes it's plot has been done many times before that doesn't mean it shouldn't be done again if it is done well and i think this movie had some strong moments the acting of claire danes as already mentioned many times was flawless as was kate beckinsell and i think bill pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances pullman's wife the crooked cop skip or trip or whatever his name is the cinematography was also beautifully filmed there was a lot that's good to this movie even if there were some negatives three major ones that i found as well br br here is what i didn't like about it the friendship between the girls in fact the girls' own individual personalities were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic it would not have been improbable to lose interest before then because despite the positives more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much jumping around without the character and scene development i think would have been appropriate for this type of film that however is not my major problem and warning spoiler alert br br the ending as mentioned dozens of times already was awful it was awful in two respects firstly even though it would have been predictable and very hollywood i wanted a happy ending yes it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this there is a sense that justice will be served and i did sit through it to see that i was genuinely shocked at the ending and it was performed with excellence by all involved but i feel both girls should have got out or barring that at least the cop should have got what was coming to him i mean nothing happens to the bad guys they all get away with it very disturbing br br also i do not understand the ambiguity of the ending i understand endings that are inspired to make one think but this was not a mystery or clue type movie we were watching and i would have liked to know something about what actually happened who was guilty etc with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since i somehow doubt there will be a sequel i did not want to be kept guessing br br still there was a lot to like about this movie and the acting is definitely at the top of the list i would rate this a 7 5 and say it is definitely worth a look
<START> there has been a lot of love that has been put into wes anderson's fantastic mr fox unfortunately all the love is for himself granted there has been a lot of time and effort been put into making this ever so self consciously quirky universe but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try and make it funny the worrying thing is that i think it was and this is the best that wes anderson could come up with br br the animation is good in the close up shots of the animals however when the camera is further away everything becomes really harsh on the eyes and to be perfectly honest looks like a bit of a mess there wasn't really anything special about the acting either with wes opting to choose his buddies and big names over more specialised voice actors that could have probably made the film better i'm pretty sure george clooney's voice acting resume consists of two cameo appearances in south park one of them where he played a dog br br the film is too smug and trying way too hard to be clever and different and is typically despite the film being set in england all the good animals are typical americans playing baseball whilst the bad guys are stereotypical english with the most insulting english accents i cannot stress how much of a waste of time this film is i didn't laugh once
<START> i rented domino on a whim not even knowing it was inspired by a true story and even though it's the least likely and true biopic you'll probably see i found it to be rather awesome br br with richard kelly writing he crams together a mass of plots and narratives into 2 hours of pure entertainment and once you've seen it more than once you get it and appreciate it br br domino is a model turned bounty hunter who leaves the perfect hollywood life to pursue a not so subtle or perfect career it has an edgy acid trip style provided by director tony scott and with fast paced music and editing it provides the visual flare to keep your attention with slick performances and unexpected comedy the movie is well made and enjoyable and should have reached a wider audience br br i suggest it to anyone who wants to think and be entertained at the same time for 2 hours
<START> the folks at disney have a lot to explain first and foremost why anyone thought this lesser sitcom material would ever make even a half decent motion picture in the kooky 60's teleplay the unique idea of martians among us had not yet been given the sophisticated x files treatment quaint visions of little green men have long since been dispelled by the likes of e t close encounters and aliens 1 3 br br any charm the property had was mainly due to the endearing relationship created between the late bill bixby as tim and ray walston as the unworldly visitor the conceit that martians have antenna seemed dopey back then now it seems positively idiotic yet christopher lloyd's uncle martin sports the metallic appendages in an early shot the antenna on a sign for the tv station tim works at is supposed to make us think martian when's the last time you saw a tv with rabbit ears eh br br disney doesn't trust quaint or relationships and crams this flick with youth wooing special effects that include a talking space suit named zoot yes you read that correctly uncle martin's silver space suit speaks he is supposed to be a real hilarious cut up figure again i got stretch socks that are funnier than zoot whenever the action lags and it lags constantly computer graphics are put into play to liven things up tim is here played by the amiable jeff daniels who can't or won't do anything to save this floudering mess zesty christine ebersole brings some comic zeal to her neighbor lady role even ray walston himself is dragged painfully into the procedings all to no avail this alien visitor is dead on arrival br br constant talk of sitcoms turning to screen makes me only hope that the i dream of jeannie movie won't feature a talking harem outfit i pray that samantha's cat in the movie bewitched doesn't have lines i live in fear that i love lucy the movie will proudly feature a cg conga drum named bongo br br paging michael eisner mickey mouse take me to your leader
<START> any one who has seen mel gibson's the passion of the christ and was bothered by the gory violence would want to see this film instead though it wasn't a success in th box office or tv ratings the fox movie channel still finds a real good motive to show this anually i liked the way that they trained chris sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in hebrew though sarandon didn't have long hair like any other jesus would in other films his looks are pretty close to what a jewish man would appear what surprised me or startled me was the scene where caiaphas told jesus about pilate and don't ever forget that you are a jew though that may have not been a racist remark colin blakely was trying to make chris sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of the prominent men of those days keith michell's portrayal of pilate was hulking comparing with his previous performances in the story of jacob and joseph and the story of david but if you compare his portrayal of pilate with telly savala's or hurd hatfield you can say that he really painted well the impression of a roman procurator
<START> come on tina fey you can do better then this as soon as the movie started i knew how it would end sure it was funny at times even laugh out loud funny but there isn't enough laughs to save this movie i don't recommend buying this at the most i recommend renting it but thats all baby mama has some funny scenes but is predictable and fails to have the heartwarming ending it strives for br br tina fey and amy poalher made a good team mean girls is one of my favorite movies tina fey and amy poalher both did great in that and they do good in this but this isn't there best baby mama had a great supporting cast dane cook sigourney weaver and steve martin add to the casts greatness br br another pregnancy movie has hit the cinema world after the great knocked up and juno baby mama looks very average when compared knocked up and juno are hilarious heartwarming and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face baby mama's ending was unfunny and dull br br baby mama wasn't the best comedy of the year and it doesn't try to be i recommend it but don't expect it to be totally hilarious expect a average comedy that doesn't give the big emotional ending it tries to have i give baby mama br br 4 10
<START> recherche is a good word to describe this movie br br let's say every movie has a selling point a gimmick transformers' gimmick is the awesome effects as well as fan boys nostalgia sleepless in seattle's gimmick is situational in their tag line what if someone you never met someone you never saw someone you never knew was the only someone for you many romance relies heavily on these gimmicks and some through draw of big names leap years employs both by using the irish folklore as the circumstance and featuring considerably famous names within the country br br so now that the audience are in the cinema besides all the usual elements in characters conflict or consequences crisis resolve and denouement they also look forward to stimulating dialog more absorbing situations as a result of the leap years interesting sub plots and perhaps to a certain extent a good twist in the middle or towards the end of the story that favors the circumstances of the characters br br this is what jean yeo is trying not to achieve if they've tried to their goal was apparently in the other court at the other stadium on the other end of the planet she and her writer alain layrac utterly failed to provide stimulating dialog most of the lines were contrived it seems that they have a bag filled with lines which she would like to use in her movie okay these are the lines and quotes which i've heard or read from either movies i've seen or books i've read before and they all sound good to me if they sound good to me they will sound good to the audience therefore all i have to do is piece them all together i am going to use all of them the result is cathartic i can't say that the lines were unnecessary and bears no relation to the story or in driving the plot on but they seem to spring out of nowhere catching you off guard with these quotable quotes br br on a personal level i know people who cite quotes based on most of the situations in our dialog trying to make it meaningful to themselves while nodding along i don't go out with them anymore because the urge to punch them is overwhelming br br secondly the characters portrayed are silly and one dimensional with exception to the unnatural dialog which implies their motivation necessary to drive the plot there was no sense of conviction in them i haven't an idea who they are they are all simpletons spouting lines from the advice column of a female oriented magazine br br the gimmick in the leap years is not enough to drive the story on because the circumstances are too shallow then again there are movies with less but fared better than this aren't there they made it up with my first and second point moreover the sub plots are inconsequential not that it's a bad thing for movies and thin bad thing br br jean yeo and the producers are trying to pass off the terrible plot with fancy locations and passable photography this is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to attain the approval from some viewers than the others with the good use of cinematography soundtrack and filming location these non discerning viewers br br it is not even the kind of movie that is so bad that it's good it is just bad don't watch this
<START> busy is so amazing i just loved every word she has ever done freaks and geeks dawson's creek white chicks the smokers after the first time i saw home room i went and got it the next day i am a big fan of her and she has a lot of fans here in israel if someone hasn't saw is excellent movie than don't waist more time and go see it now i recommend to all of you to see all of her movies i saw busy in the late night show with conan and she was so beautiful and cute i just love her everybody who saw the movie in home room she looks very scary but in real life she is so beautiful you have to see all her half nude pictures for stuff magazine maxim she looks so good there danielle
<START> this film and it's sequel barry mckenzie holds his own are the two greatest comedies to ever be produced a great story a young aussie bloke travels to england to claim his inheritance and meets up with his mates who are just as loveable and innocent as he is br br it's chock a block full of great sayings where else could you find someone who needs a drink so bad that he's as dry as a dead dingoes donger great characters top acting and it's got great sheilas and more fosters consumption then any other three films put together top notch br br and some of the funniest songs you'll ever hear and it's full of great celebrities definitely my two favourite films of all time i watch them at least once a fortnight
<START> this was a disappointment none of the nuance of the original the brits just seem to be able to make a truly unsettling film with none of the over the top histrionics of the american version the original series combined both creepy stories and subtlety of performance with great attention to lighting and settings i have watched the series many times and am still enthralled br br just another poor adaptation along the lines of the dreadful adaptation of cracker get hooked up with bbc america or bbc canada and watch for such delights as waking the dead spooks silent witness and judge john deed watch the original touching evil then look for wire in the blood for more of the truly understated elegant performance of robson green hollywood needs to have a look at this actor
<START> while the main story is supposed to take place in morocco this movie was shot in foggy romania in 18 days on a very tight budget however broken their cards may be the actors and the crew play them with remarkable skill and commitment so that in the end i found the result both touching and graceful nikolaj coaster waldau provides a formidable performance as the bad guy the script and direction provide some gems whether you will like the movie or not however will probably depend on your take on alexandra staden in the title role other reviewers have pointed out staden's inadequacies as modesty blaise they may have a point but i found her interpretation delightful and very fitting modesty manages to overcome terrible odds through discipline innate talent and courage staden appears to be doing the same here
<START> i haven't seen anything this bad since i walked out of the james bond movie moonraker twenty years ago i managed to sit through the entirety of this one only because of tilda swinton but there was nothing she could do to save this beast br br as a cross between pi orlando and tron this movie failed miserably in every aspect of moviemaking the characters were cardboard and unable to evoke any kind of sympathy the plot was wholly unbelievable the acting was with the exception of swinton amateur the computer graphics were worse than in tron timothy leary was extremely annoying i could go on but what's the point br br the only good thing i can say about this film is that tilda swinton was in it i have no idea why an actress of her caliber consented to appear in such a dud but she most likely regrets it now br br don't waste your money or your time on this stinker there's nothing worth seeing here
<START> for a good half hour or so i remember myself thinking hey this could very well be bill rebane's best achievement ever the opening sequences are atmospheric there immediately are some scary moments to enjoy and our director even refers to his own notorious stinker the giant spider invasion in a playful way the concept is shamelessly stolen from william castle's house on haunted hill with three old and extremely bored millionaires luring nine losers to an isolated mansion to win 1 000 000 in an elimination game naturally the participants start vanishing quickly and one by one and it takes the remaining greedy boneheads too much time before they realize either the old folks are sadists or there's another murderer amongst them the film begins ends with an odd narrator telling a lot of senseless stuff that isn't relevant or even interesting to the plot but there's some nice t a to admire in the first ten minutes and that dumb bimbo shelly i believe she's called is really hilarious to observe after the first half hour naturally the inevitable happens and the cold turns into a textbook rebane production with retarded plot twists the dumbest dialogs ever and a total lack of excitement there wasn't any budget for bloody murder sequences but our multi talented director tries to compensate this with endless footage of disco dancing girls and an amateur rock band the film also has four or even five different climaxes and none of them are a slight bit satisfying maybe it was an inspiration for lotr return of the king avoid this film you'll live longer and happier
<START> f ck me i've seen some incredibly horrific movies in my time but this takes the p ss br br honestly i can't express in words how bad this film actually is besides the plot that isn't really there the comically crap acting the hilariously dreadful excuses for zombies you know what i could go on all day every little thing in this film is either stupid pointless crap or embarrassing i express to anyone who wants to watch this movie don't br br i'm ashamed to say i have this on my rack it's hidden away right at the god damn bottom of the huge pile i couldn't even give this horse sh t excuse for a film away that's how bad it is
<START> lots of singing and dancing in this one especially by gene kelly two sailors go on liberty to see if they can find love and romance they meet up with a woman who is trying to break into show business musical lovers only
<START> my first attempt at watching this ended in 8 minutes roughly after the tv report scene which i couldn't handle it went approximately like this br br reporter 1 hmm there's a pyramid in our skies reporter 2 i think it's aliens awkward silence reporter 1 in other news br br a few days later i watched it to the end and it wasn't as horrible as i've imagined but there are serious problems with this about half of the plot can be easily discarded and the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something br br what use are the detective the eugenics people and the monsters which are disposed of momentarily by horus more amusing was the monopoly scene we're all powerful gods who have lived for aeons and of all the games in the multiverse we happen to play monopoly monopoly monopoly even erich von dainiken looks coherent compared to that br br the other half is terribly lacking what did our protagonist do to get himself cryo frozen why was there no big event when he was released at the end he had those pesky followers remember what happened to normal humans what's the deal with the masked guy how did the blue haired girl appear what's with her eyesight etcetera etcetera br br visually it's ok more or less if you disregard the egyptian gods looking like walking turds with rotweiller heads
