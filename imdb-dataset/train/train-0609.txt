<START> down to earth is the best movie it is so funny and it's really sweet too it has a good plot and it's unique it isn't like those movies that are all the same with the similar story lines and it's not all comedy and no story this movie also has a very good ending
<START> this show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel it is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera it's tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style br br it also borrows from an early cbs game show pioneer beat the clock by inventing situations for its contestants to try overcome then it rewards the winner money if they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters even better while the game format is in slow motion versus beat the clock the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality br br this show has elements of several types of successful past programs reality television hardly but if your hooked on the contestants locale or contest this is your cup of tea if your not this entire series is as i say drivel dripping with gravy it is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000 br br it is slick well produced so it might last a while yet after all so do re runs of gilligan's island green acres the beverly hillbillies the brady bunch this just doesn't employ professional actors the intelligence level is about the same
<START> this is simply the funniest movie i've seen in a long time the bad acting bad script bad scenery bad costumes bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you find yourself reeling with laughter br br so it's not gonna win an oscar but if you've got beer and friends round then you can't go wrong
<START> thats my bush is first of all a very entertaining show by parker and stone i thought its often very very funny and its quite subversive and crazy south park fans would surely get something here br br another surprise is the production value here a lot of money must have been put into this and it shows a lot of expensive little details its not a little show and comedy central is not an extremely rich channel but they put a lot into this show obviously in a way i understand that was the death of the show as well though too costy it surely could have been done cheaper and went on the will was there br br the critics liked it and it had its little fanbase but it failed gaining a big audience as we know the show stopped after 8 episodes which i guess is almost 1 season br br as i really liked the show it has its faults the problem of the show is kind of that it doesn't know what it wants to be really its like it tries to be a sitcom and a parody of a sitcom at the same time the actors do a good job and some of them are well casted but in my opinion they seem to not always get 100 the bizarre humor they're supposed to present br br i personally think that the show needed some characters that were more down to earth for the show to work in south park you have kyle and stan that are kind of a realistic touch in the more looney universe i think thats kind of what makes south park work you need some sane characters that you can relate to in a realistic way and that makes the insane stuff so much more interesting too because that forces you to take them seriously at some level if everything is archetypes and stereotypes its difficult to get emotionally included in the show which really is thats my bush biggest problem kyle and stan is characters in south park that makes sense of the insanity in the show we have nothing like that here and this show suffers from it br br another anchorpoint is parker and stones flirting with republicans its the only thing about them i don't really get what they're trying to do not portraying bush as nothing else than a dumb homer simpsons lovable kind of character is kind of subversive in a world where a lot of people that can't stand him and think he's the worst president since nixon and a parallel comedy world of letterman and so on that only satirizes his every move but its difficult to understand if parker and stone actually means anything by it its like the joke is on us but somehow it doesn't hit the mark it seems awkward because it doesn't remind you of the real bush at all br br besides that i actually thought the show was very enjoyable some of the jokes in here are hilarious the pro life supporter who was a surviving aborted fetus is probably one of my favorite jokes by them in any show and the show is packed with great material and is sometimes insanely funny if you use your head a little while watching it
<START> pandora's clock is a gripping suspense thriller that's a cross between a virus movie and a disaster film this movie which aired in two parts on nbc in its debut showing in 1996 is about an airplane flight that becomes infected with a virus when one of the passengers just happens to be carrying this disease the u s government debates on whether the plane should be destroyed or not while the pilot richard dean anderson and a virus expert daphne zuniga try to figure something out to avoid disaster i'm not really a big fan of tv movies and miniseries but i liked pandora's clock it's one heck of a thrill ride jane leeves tv's frasier robert loggia and edward herrmann as the president also star br br out of four
<START> this movie is tremendous for uplifting the spirits br br every time i watch it i see hear funny little things that i missed before br br the soundtrack is unbelievable mick jones foreigner and chris difford squeeze penned the songs making strange fruit the best thing that ever hit today's music scene br br unfortunately strange fruit are a strictly fictitional washed up '60's to 70's band that were never good to begin with due to drug use and inner fighting one wonders what might have been while listening to their fanatstic soundtrack br br the fruit draw inspiration from the rolling stones deep purple david bowie and the who br br each member of fruit are quite memorable stephen rea stars as down and dead broke tony costello who is asked by a festival promoter to reunite his band for a reunion tour with hopes of reaping monetary benefits costello haply approaches ex roadie karen knowles played by juliet aubrey to help him rekindle the flame of a dream long past br br juliet gathers up the bitter jimmy nail les wickes blundering timothy spall david 'beano' baggot and extravagantly glamouresque ray simms bill nighy tumbling in is another ex roadie the hippy toker jokester hughie billy connolly who never let the flame burn out br br as juliet searches for the last member of their motley band the elusive guitarist songwriter brian lovell played by the brooding bruce robinson the reunited members squabble just like old times fighting over each others' rusty talent br br the band is then given the chance to do a small dutch tour to prepare for the festival with young hendrix like luke shand hans matheson taking the place of lovell the crew hits the road the sparks fly as their memories flame forward threatening to burn their unfinished goals br br be prepared to laugh sing cheer and cry as these memorable characters etch themselves back into your hearts
<START> ingrid bergman is a temporarily impoverished polish countess in 1900s paris who finds herself pursued by france's most popular general and a glamorous count and that's on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate such is the failproof premise that entrains one of the most delirious plots in movie history there are backroom political machinations by the general's handlers a downed balloonist and ecstatic bastille day throngs but the heart of this gorgeously photographed film is the frantic upstairs downstairs intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats yes it's rules of the game redux before it's all over even gaston modot the jealous gamekeeper in rules puts in an appearance as a gypsy capo no less things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end resulting in some confusion for this non french speaker but what the heck elena and her men is another deeply humane renoir masterpiece
<START> while this was a better movie than 101 dalmations live action not animated version i think it still fell a little short of what disney could do it was well filmed the music was more suited to the action and the effects were better done compared to 101 the acting was perhaps better but then the human characters were given far more appropriate roles in this sequel and glenn close is really not to be missed as in the first movie she makes it shine her poor lackey and the overzealous furrier sidekicks are wonderful characters to play off of and they add to the spectacle disney has given us this is a great family film with little or no objectionable material and yet it remains fun and interesting for adults and children alike it's bound to be a classic as so many disney films are here's to hoping the third will be even better still because you know they probably want to make one
<START> in the days before gore and sex took over real horror films were made castle of blood is in my estimation one of the finest although other reviewers have given it mixed ratings in an odd sort of way it reminds of the more recent the others which was in the theaters a couple of years ago br br director antonio margheriti remade his own picture in 1970 titling it this time web of the spider aka nella stretta morsa del ragno why he did this i do not understand although the remake starred anthony franciosa and klaus kinski and was very good in its own right perhaps he saw a good story and wished to tailor it more to american audiences i do not really know it is interesting that he did the original in black and white and the remake in color br br castle of blood is excellent italian gothic la danza macabra is said to be an unpublished work of edgar allen poe who appears in this film poe and lord blackwood owner of a haunted castle bet american writer alan foster george riviere that he cannot spend all souls night in said castle and survive foster eagerly accepts the bet but soon regrets it for he is witness to a series of murders committed by ghosts it seems that the ghosts come back to life once every few years but are doomed to re enact the crimes they committed in life lord blackwood conveniently forgot to tell foster that his blood is needed for them to resurrect themselves on the next all souls night br br it does not take foster and the beautiful elisabeth blackwood portrayed by the incomparable barbara steele long to fall in love even though their romance is doomed because elisabeth is one of the ghosts i will not give the ending away but will just say that castle of blood is every bit a romantic tragedy as it is a horror story br br comments this film is greatly atmospheric even by the excellent standards of the italians my personal opinion is they do true horror better than anybody and the somewhat dim black and white filming only enhances this in fairness web of the spider was fine in its own right even with color and greater brightness i loved the lingering shots something most modern day directors do not have the patience for indeed when alan first enters the doomed castle we are treated to several minutes of him doing nothing but roaming around from room to room the dread ands unease building in his face and mannerisms by the time the first ghost appears the audience is thoroughly primed and ready there is wonderful dialogue between alan and the ghosts something else not often done in standard ghost stories there are also memorable scenes very visual for this type of film elisabeth's murder and the dance scene reminds somewhat of the similar dance of the ghouls in 1962's carnival of souls were particularly good br br sadly few general interest viewers will ever hear of much less see this film that is a shame for this one is a cut above the rest i got my copy from sinister cinema and am not certain if it can be purchased anywhere else for persons interested in this genre it is a must see
<START> i can't believe it imdb really does have every tv show known to man i have not seen this show in over 20 years i only remember two episodes and i barely remember those i remember that tony may not been on from the start because one of the episodes i remember is the one in which everybody trying to get tony to join but he rejects them but typically at the end of the show he becomes a member of power house with everybody cheering br br the other one i remember is the one where lolo for some reason pretends to be dead complete with funeral and mourners i don't remember why he plays dead or how the show ends br br this is one of those shows that i convinced myself that i must have dreamed up since no one else had ever heard of it
<START> monty berman and dennis spooner followed up 'the baron' with this a fantasy series about three superhuman spies which preempted 'the six million dollar man' it was a favourite of mine when i was a youngster and i enjoy watching it still stuart damon and william gaunt had an unmistakable on screen chemistry as craig stirling and richard barrett while the luscious alexandra bastedo pouted her way through her role as sharron macready the late anthony nicholls made a wonderfully gruff tremayne by far the best episodes were those written by tony williamson terry nation and brian clemens while spooner's own 'the interrogation' compared favourably with 'the prisoner' i regret that there was never a second series the concept had so much life left in it would craig and richard have been competitors for sharron's affections what if tremayne had learned of the champions' powers did the champions have any other abilities other than those we saw we never found out alas
<START> the original thunderbirds earned a place in tv history it was and still is much beloved indeed the entire first 10 minutes of the wallace and gromit movie the wererabbit is a direct lift of thunderbirds down to a direct replay of the original thunderbird 2 launching sequence if you don't believe me get the movie and then get a copy of the original episode where thunderbird 2 is launched br br this movie was a crass attempt at making a kids' movie when the original was loved and enjoyed by kids and adults alike in the original the thunderbirds spent all of their time rescuing people who were often trapped when mother nature or technology went horrible wrong yes there was also the occasional criminal act the thunderbirds put their own lives and resources at risk for no reward the very essence of heroism and selflessness there was little physical violence the thunderbirds challenged the imagination to a degree how many of us would dream of someday building a thunderbird 2 and don't underestimate the power of entertainment to do this many japanese attribute their fascination with humanoid robots to the old astroboy cartoon br br but this movie was a poor re image of the original this movie came across as a meld between thunderbirds and loony tunes i mean we have anthony edwards as brain imitating porky pig's stuttering much of the action consists of kung fu power rangers type fighting indeed there were funny sound effects when someone got nailed on the head with a frying pan the tech that fired our imagination was absent instead we have these kids running around using a plot device that was never in the original series having the entire team take off at once leaving the base occupied by the kids and brain then there was a dose of use the force luke mysticism thrown in when tintin would levitate something or another coupled with the the hood using aerodynamics that looked like they were lifted from crouching tiger hidden dragon about the only thing missing was for the hood to go tintin i am your uncle with a breath mask voice the heart that made thunderbirds unique was gone br br the only bright point was ron cook's portrayal of parker he caught it perfectly but the actress playing lady penelope came across as a child huh br br and this is why we hate this movie when someone puts out something that was popular to a fan base and expects the fans to shell out money to watch and then delivers something than wasn't even close to what the fans expect well i am sorry that is just plain wrong ok so if they were making a kids' movie fine next time distribute it straight to video where many of these belong but don't package something up in a familiar wrapper and change the innards
<START> what are people on here talking about i must have seen a different movie than you guys i was so bored that i walked out of the theater what is up with this stuff i only laughed once and not even that hard whoever greenlit this movie should be taken out into the street and beaten i usually always find something i like in a movie but this is crazy slackers makes not another teen movie look like a classic it ranks up there with such trash as body shots con air and conspiracy theory as one of the worst of all time avoid at all costs i thought the studio would be handing out money to people as they left the theater as a sign of their apologies but to my dismay that wasn't happening looks like i will never see that money again or the two hours
<START> this excellent series narrated by laurence olivier brilliantly it should be said charts the beginning to the end of world war 2 the origins are not entirely examined fully from germany's fall at the hands of the versailles treaty which helped propel hitler's demonic rise but as one reviewer says that must be hard to do in a 26 part series with so much to cram in br br apart from the expected combat photography action there are plenty of personal emotional and human tragedies that are told giving the viewer an amazing insight especially if you're not necessarily a world war 2 buff fan episodes showing 'testimonies' and what life was like on the home front of the main allies adversary britain germany japan russia and the u s a were quite eye opening showing the extreme savagery of the war on the frontline and of course the sufferings of civilians the death camps etc were very well handled and exposed i'd fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation of which it could be said i am one at 47 br br certain things are quite strangely left out like the advent of the new jet era beginning with frank whittle's experimental gloster jet and the gloster meteor's combat debut as well as that of the german messerschmitt me 262 especially as the v 1 was seen making its debut and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the v2 this is probably a small oversight not referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons which ww2 brought forward from a more barren old science but a great series that made its mark and has done so ever since when thankfully repeated br br a series to own as a box set in history terms on dvd for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan jeremy isaacs and thames tv should be well proud
<START> i must warn you there are some spoilers in it but to start it off i got spanish judges on february i think it was mention it was the last copy but as i see it wasn't back ordered but either way i have it i thought it was good i wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor matthew lillard i'm surprised no one on the reviews mention the scar although it is kind of low budget getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending man what a good actor br br the story it about a con artist known as jack matthew lillard who claims to have merchandises called the spanish judges if you don't know what spanish judges are or haven't seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read i won't even say what they are i figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was he needs protection so he hires a couple who are also crooks max and jamie vincent d'onofrio and valeria golino as well as a crook that goes by the name of piece mark boone junior he has a girlfriend who won't even tell anyone her name because she's from mars as she said so they mainly jack call her mars girl everything starts out fine but then it turns to one big game a game that involves some lust lies and betrayal br br there was some over acting in it matt and valeria as well as tamara were not one of them there were some scenes they could've done better and the score could've been a little better as well some of the score was actually good the theme they used for the beginning and the end before the credits was a good song choice that's my opinion the fight scene in the end could've been a little longer and a little more violent but what can you do one more comment on matt damn he plays a smooth slick con man br br i know this is a review but i need to make a correction towards necro one of the reviewers valeria golino is not a newcomer according to this site she has been acting since 1983 to me and hopefully to others she is well known as charlie sheen's italian love interest in both the hot shots movies but good review br br although i think it's one of the rare films i've seen and it's really good which is why i gave it 10 stars above i will give the grade of what i thought when i first saw it br br 8 10
<START> a boy and a girl is chased by a local warrior because the boy killed by accident the warriors father or whoever he was and they travel through the nature of africa's most ruff areas br br the acting in this movie isn't that good except for that elephant kid but it's a very good adventure and it's not very censored there is some blood flesh and nudity which lighten up the movie a bit br br i give this movie a 7 because of it's picture of the african nature and it's action
<START> 1st watched 11 7 2002 2 out of 10 dir john bianco pretty lame gangster movie about a godfather like family in brooklyn who like to say four letter words a lot and kill people the only thing of interest here was their attempt to show the feds being a lot like the gang this is the only attempt at good film making the rest of the movie was predictable and cheaply made the quality of the photography on some of the scenes inside bars and floozy joints almost made you think there was a problem with your dvd player because of the bad contrasts and some of the actors were hard to hear at times because of the bad sound the acting was pretty much characatures of all your favorite gangsters from better movies with corny names like vinnie knuckles' and jimmie tattoos' and the plot pretty much followed those patterns as well so go see a better gangster movie before you put your money out for this one
<START> well what can i say this movie really got to me it's not so bad as many say i really loved it although the idea seems so simple and rather boring it isn't first of all i enjoyed the soundtrack bryan adams it really goes with the movie second the simple story and the drama of spirit gets your attention one thing i like the most is that they didn't give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses it makes the movie more realistic not many animations seem realistic now do they but i don't know making animals talk is just so lame br br one of the most beautiful animations of 2002 in my opinion i recommend it to everyone not just the kids because it is very relaxing
<START> what ever happened to michael keaton what a great actor and he proves it in this movie this movie is actually funny and the reason why this movie is funny is for two reasons an excellent script and michael keaton this movie is one of the funniest comedies in the history of hollywood this movie is the ultimate spoof of gangster movies in this movie hollywood actually pokes fun at itself by using the the gangster movie genre as the basis for a truly original comedy the rest of the cast is funny too especially the supporting cast if you like to laugh and want to watch a movie that contains nonstop humor then this movie is for you
<START> looked forward to viewing this film and seeing these great actors perform however i was sadly disappointed in the script and the entire plot of the story david duchovny dr eugene sands connie carla '04 was the doctor in the story who uses drugs and losses his license to practice medicine dr sands was visiting a night club and was able to use his medical experience to help a wounded customer and was assisted by angelina jolie claire taking lives '04 who immediately becomes attracted to dr david sands timothy hutton raymond blossom kinsey '04 plays the big shot gangster and a man with all kinds of money and connections timothy hutton seems to over act in most of the scenes and goes completely out of his mind trying to keep his gang members from being killed gary dourdan yates csi vegas tv series plays a great supporting role and portrays a real cool dude who is a so called body guard for raymond blossom angelina jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby red lips which draws a great deal of attention from all the men this film is not the greatest but it does entertain
