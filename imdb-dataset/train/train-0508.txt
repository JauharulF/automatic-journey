<START> green street as it was called in the uk or hooligans is a bad film the story is full of fantastical ideas and premises that anyone who lives in england has been to a football match or knows the first thing about football will spot immediately br br my first main gripe with hooligans is the poor casting of the two main characters don't get me wrong i like elijah wood and have a great respect for his work but despite his best efforts he struggled to pull off this role the main motivation for his character is anger at the system and anger at betrayal however he spends much of the film placid and cheery only displaying his pent up aggression in one brief scene towards the end of the film this linked with his looks and physique make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football hooligans at no point during the film was i convinced that a he could handle himself in a fight against such thugs and b the 'firm' of thugs would accept such a person into their fold br br the other main character is played by charlie hunnam charlie looks the part and is fairly convincing as a thug unfortunately being a native of newcastle upon tyne in the north of england he demonstrates the worst east london accent since dick van dyke tried to go cock en y in marry poppins details such as this probably will not bother an american audience who will be less attuned to regional dialect in the uk but being from the uk it was a problem i couldn't ignore and it contributed to ruining the movie for me the supporting cast all gave convincing performances and were well cast especially the role of bover the lad playing this character would have been much more suited to the main role that charlie played with a film like this you have to convince the audience that your characters are plausible unfortunately the casting failed imagine if you made a film like the godfather and had sean hayes jack from will and grace playing michael corleone's part you would not be convinced the story in hooligan is also full in implausibilities i am no football hooligan but i am a fantatical football fan i know how cliquey a group of 'regular' football supporters can be as such it deem it impossible for a non football fan who is not a fan of the club in question is not from the area in question and not even of english nationality to be embraced by a 'firm' who equate to a secret organisation in some severe cases my final and biggest problem with this film is the way it portrays football hooligans i take objection to the film's idea that despite being very violent individuals hooligans are excused as they live by some sort of code of ethics in their own world and should be admired for being brave and loyal to each other this is complete rubbish football hooligans are complete scum they take football the national sport of england and use it as an excuse to terrorise frighten and intimidate people they only represent a tiny percentage of football fans but give the whole game and people of this country a bad reputation they are not brave or loyal they are cowardly and evil if the 'gse' in this film truly loved their club west ham why would the devote their lives to being a stain on its name hooligans are an embarrassment to football and to english society football hooligans do for the reputation of football what hitler did to the reputation of germans although this film tries intends to show the 'gritty' side of football violence it does nothing more than promote it as some kind of excusable activity for extreme fans of the sport it does not show the poor innocent by standers at football matches who have their day ruined by some idiot throwing coins lighters glass into the crowd it does not show the innocent home and property owners who have to put up with graffiti and broken windows it does not show the real fans of football clubs who suffer indignity and embarrassment when their teams supporters are banned from travelling to away matches or abroad to european games because the thugs among them ruin it for everyone if you want to see a good film about football violence watch the bbc drama 'the firm'
<START> students often ask me why i choose this version of othello shakespeare's text is strongly truncated and the film contains material which earned it an r rating br br i have several reasons for using this production first i had not seen a depiction of the moor that actually made me sympathetic to othello until i saw fishburne play him i saw james earl jones and christopher plummer play othello and iago on broadway and it was wonderful plummer's energy was especially noticeable but in spite of jone's incredible presence both physically and vocally the character he played just seemed too passive to illicit from me a complete emotional purgation in the aristotelian sense jones in fact affirmed what i felt when in an interview he noted that he had played othello as passive seeing iago as basically doing him over unfortunately this sapped my grief for the character destruction thus i felt sympathy for jone's moor but not the horror over his corruption by an evil man in contrast fishburne's othello is a strong and vigorous figure familiar with taking action thus iago's temptation to actively deal with what is presented to othello as his wife's unfaithfulness is a perversion of the general's positive quality to be active not passive 1 the horror of the story is that this good quality in othello becomes perverted fishburne's depiction is therefore classically tragic br br second fishburne is the first black actor to play othello in a film both orsen wells and anthony hopkins did fine film versions but they were white men in black face 2 why is this important why should a black actor be the black man on the stage 3 certainly in shakespeare's day they used black face just as they used boys to make girls perhaps then the reason is the same female actors bring a special quality to female roles on the shakespearian stage because they understand best what shakespeare's genius was trying to present a gifted black actor should play the moor because his experience in a white dominated culture is vital to understanding what shakespeare's genius recognized the pain of being marginalized because of race an important theme in othello is isolation caused by racism although it is a mistake to insert american racism into a shakespearian play there can be little doubt that racism is still working among the characters many including desdimona's father think that a union between a venetian white christian woman and a north african black christian man is unnatural br br third shakespeare was never g rated he never has been his stage productions were always typified by violence and strong language but shakespeare's genius uses these elements not as sensationialism but for artistic honesty
<START> i had absolutely nothing to do the past weekend and tagged along with my friends to check out a movie any movie and since the only movie we'd not seen was inspector gadget we decided to go in for that br br big mistake this is a movie that might appeal only to kids oh and it's not like i don't enjoy movies targeted at the younger audience but this movie had absolutely nothing to hold my attention if you have nothing to do at home go to sleep better than wasting hard earned cash on this go check out the film if you're a kid or if you're a parent with a kid
<START> i gave this a 10 out of 10 points i love it so much i am a child of the 80s and totally into heavy metal for many years those are the reasons i like this movie so much its so cool to see those posters in the bedroom of that boy judas priest lizzy borden raven twisted sister and his vinyl collection unveiling the wicked by exciter rise of the mutants by shock metal master impaler and killing is my business by megadeth also the soundtrack by fastway is totally incredible and fits very well with the plot if you are into metal then trick or treat is your friend don't buy or watch this movie for ozzy or gene simmons because they are in the movie for seconds watch it because the soundtrack and the story that will take you back to the glory 80s you will not be the same person after
<START> having read many of the other reviews for this film on the imdb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based upon this point i cannot comment having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously however what i can say with certainty is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass let's be honest here this film is just so much fun br br okÂ so i must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character s but let's put this into a clear perspectiveÂ do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic 1960's batman series does not remain faithful to the original dc comic book character or perhaps is there still unrest in same persons that the 1980 film version of flash gordon was too much of a departure from the original series br br the point is yes this film is incredibly camp but that's precisely its charm br br former tarzan ron ely plays the eponymous hero in this and bears more than a passing resemblance to gary busey to boot and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite michael berryman br br best scene far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke lemonade and milk at a formal occasion also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein savage tackles his nemesis captain seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen Â priceless br br simply put the film doesn't take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it great fun from start to finish and you'll be singing the john phillip sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed
<START> people tried to make me believe that the premise of this rubbishy supernatural horror thriller was inspired by the actual last words spoken by an authentic serial killer whose name escapes me at the moment whilst awaiting his execution in the electric chair he claimed that his soul would return to life and continue to go on a never ending murder spree it's not a highly original idea to revolve a horror film on by the way other low budget turkeys implemented the exact same basic premise like house 3 shocker and ghost in the machine anyway the first power a k a pentagram isn't a completely terrible effort but the script overly reverts to clichÃ©s and lacks genuine thrills the film starts off as an okay albeit mundane serial killer flick in which obsessive cop hero lou diamond philips pursues a maniac who carves bloody pentagrams into the chests of his victims he receives unexpected help from a spiritual medium played by the gorgeous and underrated tracy griffith she leads him to the killer but also begs not to execute him as that would result in an even bigger catastrophe thanks to tess' helpful hints detective logan quickly captures the killer and celebrates his death penalty but patrick channing made a pact with satan himself and returns to the rotten streets of california to do some more killing the first power gets pretty bad once the murderer reincarnates as a vengeful spirit instead of using his newly gained satanic powers to wipe out the entire world that's what i would do in his position channing simply prefers to play cat and mouse games with his nemesis the copper he annoyingly calls him buddy boy all the time and possesses the bodies of logan's friends and colleagues in order to trick him even though never really boring or poorly realized it's a very weak film to endure mostly because you constantly get the feeling of dÃ©jÃ  vu writer director robert resnikoff shamelessly uses every dreadful clichÃ© the killer got sexually abused as a child and even the players' lines can easily be predicted as soon as griffith explains she's able to predict the future you just know that somewhere at some point in the film she's going to say the ridiculously overused line i tell people who to live their lives but my own life is a mess yawn lou diamond philips' performance is adequate enough but it's rather difficult to take that youthful rebel of la bamba and stand and deliver serious as a tough copper there also are decent supportive roles for mykelti williamson forrest gump carmen argenziano when a stranger calls and b movie horror legend david gale re animator appears in a minuscule cameo at the very beginning of the film
<START> i waited ages before seeing this as all the reviews i read of this said it was horrible i rented it expecting the worst and while it is hardly the best sandler film out there there are much worse sandler frequently talks to the camera and the film does not take itself seriously but that is all part of the fun a great way to waste an afternoon and you might even find yourself laughing once a twice a good film well worth renting
<START> the story line of the thief of bagdad is complex owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together the screenplay by lajo biros and the dialogue by miles malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points the young king ahmad of bagdad is angry at his vizier jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas he discovers while in disguise that people blame him for jaffar's deeds and hate him he is imprisoned by jaffar where he meets abu the young thief the two escape and take a boat to the city of basra there the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the princess of the city passing by ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden he tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss then he is captured when jaffar comes to win the princess of basra for himself ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns abu into a dog jaffar then asks for the princess's hand and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the sultan of basra the blind ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace accompanied by abu as his dog the prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her so jaffar sends his servant halima for ahmad and the dog in hopes the prince can rouse her he does awaken her she boards a ship to find a doctor to cure ahmad but she is captured by jaffar who then throws the dog overboard she then allows jaffar to take her in his arms on his promise to restore ahmad's sight and turn abu back into a thief the princess sees a vision of ahmad he is in a boat jaffar sends a storm to beset him and abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel then corks him in again for freeing him he gets three wishes his first is for sausages in the meanwhile the princess pleads with her father to refuse jaffar but jaffar shows the sultan a new mechanical toy one of whose six arms stabs him to death abu makes a second wish to find ahmad the cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the all seeing eye abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye battling a giant spider then scaling the goddess's statue abu gazes into the 'eye' and sees ahmad in a canyon he has the genie take him to ahmad ahmad uses the eye to see the princess she smells a flower and forgets everything at once abu wishes they were in bagdad but the genie laughs and leaves jaffar tells the princess that she is in love with him omitting mention of ahmad ahmad tries to fight his way to the princess but jaffar smashes the 'eye' abu finds himself in the land of legend where the old men who rule want to make him their king he steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead to hurry to save ahmad and the princess the thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner using his bow from the flying carpet to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse but another shot from the bow finishes him ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his princess but when he tries to make abu his vizier the young thief refuses saying that what he wants is adventure not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be this fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer alexander korda the production was designed by vincent korda who was also art director while georges perinal did the colorful cinematography the directors credited are ludwig berger and michael powell with tim whelan alexander korda william cameron menzies and zoltan korda participating the extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of john armstrong oliver messel and marcel vertes the production apart from its gorgeous and expensive looking visual splendors i claim is dominated by two other elements the choral music of miklos rozsa and the performance by conrad veidt as the evil jaffar rex ingram plays the genie with a curious accent plus his usual intelligence and power june duprez is lovely and effective as the princess mary morris is a sad and beautiful halima and miles malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious sultan as ahmad john justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some he is memorably good in his winning role this film has a spaciousness about it that is found i assert in other korda works also its imaginative content stands in contrast to very strong realistic sets costumes and set design elements this is one of the most memorable idea level fantasies of all time worthy to be enjoyed over and over
<START> love it love it love it this is another absolutely superb performance from the divine miss m from the beginning to the end this is one big treat don't rent it buy it now
<START> for starters and for the record the term necromancy describes the black magic art of bringing the dead back to life and it does not in any way relate to having sex with cadavers that is called necrophilia and yes i know it's an obvious difference but i'm already getting a lot of remarks from acquaintances and relatives that i sport a perverted taste in movies this movie is quite the opposite of perverted or sleazy in fact and merely just qualifies as boring inept and terribly bad necromancy makes at least one top five ranking namely in the list of most incoherent movies ever made now director bert i gordon is not exactly famous for delivering masterpieces on his repertoire there are titles like earth vs the spider king dinosaur and food of the gods but he really surpassed himself here with a totally senseless redundant and utterly nonsensical tale about witchcraft and secretive little towns shortly after the tragic experience of seeing their baby being born dead lori and her husband frank move to the quiet little town of lillith where frank suddenly got offered a prominent job in a toy factory lori is suspicious and senses an atmosphere of morbidity especially with the town's patriarch and owner mr cato behaving very obtrusive and mysterious that's another thing how can anybody own a town and everybody in it either way lori gradually discovers that everybody in lillith is a witch and mr cato exclusively lured her to the town because of her supernatural ability to resurrect the dead since many years already cato has been trying to bring his deceased son back to life and he's prepared to make any human sacrifice it takes i honestly don't see the point of the whole movie it's a blatant rip off of rosemary's baby Â one of the alternate titles even is rosemary's disciples Â but the script is muddled and imbecilic beyond belief why isn't anyone allowed to have children for as long as cato's son remains dead that's just really selfish when where and how did lori suddenly learn to resurrect the dead necromancy definitely contains a few genuinely uncanny and atmospheric moments but these are unwarily accomplished either by complete coincidence or through a total lack of budget the grainy photography provides the film with an eerie ambiance and the set pieces look cheap enough to be creepy orson welles' performance Â undoubtedly the low point of his career Â is pitiable and still it's the best aspect about the entire movie
<START> i have never seen a barbara steele movie that i haven't liked and have always been a sucker for a good haunted house story especially for such wonderful pictures as the legend of hell house and the original versions of the haunting and house on haunted hill so i had a feeling that castle of blood would be right up my alley and boy was it ever this french italian coproduction while perhaps not the classic that steele's first horror film black sunday remains to this day is nevertheless an extremely atmospheric chilling entry in the spook genre filmed in black and white it manages to convey a genuinely creepy miasma the film concerns a journalist who bets one lord blackwood and an author named edgar allen poe that he can spend the night in blackwood's castle on the night of all saints day when the spirits of those killed in the castle reenact their fate the viewer gets to see these deaths and they are pretty horrible for the most part the film does indeed send shivers up the viewer's spine and in the uncut dvd that i just watched thanks to the fine folks at synapse even features a surprising topless scene and some mild lesbianism and barbara is wonderful in this movie her otherworldly beauty is put to good advantage playing a sympathetic spectre her mere presence turns a creepy ghost story into something truly memorable not for nothing has she been called the queen of horror
<START> i saw this when i was 17 and haven't seen it since the 'cbs late movie' used to show it on a regular basis at one point i remember how sad and upsetting it was it truly made me sick to my stomach effects then weren't what they are today but nevertheless it conveyed the feeling of being alone in the amazon after losing both parents and searching for a way out very well i remember the bugs and maggots the most so realistic they were eating her flesh it's a dark film which was controversial subject matter at the time even though likely it was strongly edited for tv i wish i remembered more details and if i ever get the chance to see it again i can comment more i have been looking for this for years i believe it may have been shown on cbs under yet another title i have no idea whether it was ever released on video
<START> this movie makes a promising start and then gets very confused and muddled kamal hasan has made a lot of effort in getting the period look right pity he did not spend more time on the plot most of the small characters in the movie show up for no particular reason br br overall very disappointing i would recommend avoiding this movie
<START> a well cast summary of a real event well actually i wasn't there but i think this is how it may have been like i think there are two typically american standpoints evident in the film 'communistophobia' and parallels to adolf hitler these should be evident to most independent observers anyway boothe does a great performance and so do lots of other well known actors the last twenty minutes of the film are unbearable and i mean it anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal that's why it's so terrible it all happened and it probably looked just like that but actually did that last scene on the air station really take place
<START> tyrannosaurus azteca is set during the sixteenth century where famous spanish explorer hernando cortes ian ziering has landed in mexico with six of his best men including lieutenant rios marco sanchez they intend to claim the land in the name of the spanish maybe steal some gold too if the opportunity arises within minutes they have their first sight of local aztec savages within minutes after that cortes his men are captured held prisoner if that wasn't bad enough it turns out that a couple of tyrannosaurus rex live there like to eat the locals in an effort to win their lives the spanish offer to help the locals get rid of their monster problem but with various hidden agendas ulterior motives it's not just the dinosaurs they have to watch out for br br directed by brian trenchard smith who coincidently made one of my all time favourite exploitations films turkey shoot 1982 which i throughly recommend to one all also more commonly known under the spoof sounding title of aztec rex the title was changed by the sci fi channel when they aired it maybe as the original title tyrannosaurus azteca sounds like it might be a foreign film this is yet another idiotic cheap looking sci fi channel 'creature feature' that's all you need to know really based on around the real spanish conquistador cortes during his expedition to mexico the film definitely doesn't strive for historic accuracy although i will admit that the story tries to do something slightly different here but ultimately tyrannosaurus azteca is still just a 'creature feature' with a bunch of people running from some poor cgi computer graphic of a monster despite it's period setting not too sure what else i can say despite being set centuries ago the usual clichÃ©s are here the character's are the usual cardboard cutouts make stupid decisions the selfish one the heroic one the backstabbing one the faceless victim who exists just to get eaten the pretty woman are all here easy to spot the film is predictable silly dull doesn't really entertain on any level although it does move along at a decent pace there's one or two half decent moments of gore if that sort of thing interests you the story isn't that good has plenty of holes too this is also the sort of film that you will have completely forgotten about within a few days br br now i have seen commented on plenty of sci fi channel 'creature features' usually the cgi computer effects are terrible while tyrannosaurus azteca doesn't exactly buck the trend i will admit there are a few effects shots which look alright but then they are usually ruined by an absolutely awful effects shot straight afterwards there's a few decent gore effects here too there's a cut out heart a guy's leg is bitten off there's some blood splatter a cool shot of a guy left holding his own intestines after he has been attacked by the dinosaur there's a few dead bodies seen someone is stabbed with a spear the t rex gets to eat a couple of people too the production values are really cheap the aztec set looks like one of those theme park attractions made from styrofoam those spanish men must have been imprisoned in the worst enclosure in cinematic history with the fence supposedly keeping them in lower than a mans waist they could have simply stepped out of it run away it was so low br br with a supposed budget of about 900 000 i can't see where the money went shot in o'ahu in hawaii in apparently fifteen days the acting isn't great from no one i have ever heard of br br tyrannosaurus azteca really isn't any better than any other cheap sci fi channel 'creature feature' despite an almost interesting unusual premise that basic statement should basically be enough for you to decide whether you will enjoy this or not at a guess probably not
<START> this film ends with a speech in which the narrator tells us the fates of two of the lead characters and that the names of people and places have been changed before telling us that relation to actual people and events are purely coincidental this ending line actually sums up everything that has gone before it as rino di silvestro's messy film completely lacks vision and if there is any point to the plot it wasn't put there on purpose werewolf woman is often seen as a guilty pleasure or a 'so bad it's good' film but i completely disagree normally i enjoy films like this but werewolf woman is indeed a bad film and despite all the sex and savagery on display it doesn't even make for a fun watch and that really is unforgivable the film really doesn't have much plot but the thin sliver we are given involves a young woman who also happens to dream that she is a werewolf she dreams of going out and finding men having sex with them and eventually killing them back in the real world she falls in love but her lover is killed and she goes out for revenge br br the film is made up of scenes of sex and gore which are padded out with extremely dull talking sequences in which various characters mull over the recent events these scenes are probably there to forward the plot and build characters but they really don't do that and succeed only in turning what could have been a passable exploitation romp into an extremely underwhelming film it would seem that the director was more interested in style and atmosphere than the plot and this is shown by the fact that the film looks and sounds nice the sex scenes are often overlong and not very erotic but the gore works well the premise is ripe for giving way to a very sexy slice of exploitation as there's plenty of naked women and the fact that the central character has a werewolf origin means that there could be plenty of erotica but this isn't capitalised on and while i can stomach huge doses of bad acting and poorly done plot lines i really can't stand watching films and being bored overall i wouldn't even recommend this film to big exploitation fans there's plenty of better stuff than this out there and while the title may sound intriguing the film isn't

<START> this tv production of 1970 starring susannah york and george c scott is another proof of how difficult it is to adopt jane eyre to the screen and how much can go wrong in doing so it is true that the movie suffered in the transfer to dvd some scenes which were complete in the original were shortened and so badly edited that there are striking continuity gaps and that even one crucial scene between jane and rochester starts in the middle of a sentence but even if the editing were better the film would not be the script is bad the portrayal of the characters is untrue to the novel and nearly all actors are miscast as a consequence one does not have the feeling of watching an adaptation of charlotte brontÃ«'s novel at all the problem is not only that a number of scenes are shortened or left out this is the case with all the short adaptations but that the remaining scenes do no at all capture the tone the spirit the atmosphere and the concept of the novel br br this jane eyre for example completely leaves out gateshead and begins with jane's arrival at lowood while this is perfectly all right since some scenes must by necessity be left out it is not understandable that instead of using the time gained so to speak and thoroughly portraying jane's friendship with helen the influence helen has for jane's development the lecture in christian stoicism that she teaches her the film nearly exclusively concentrates on the physical ill treatment of helen which is driven to absurd extremes in this adaptation what helen has to suffer is bad enough as described in the novel but here miss scatchard is portrayed as a kind of sadistic prison ward who deliberately wants to drive helen to a premature death and this is about all which happens at lowood if you compare that to the deep impact the years spent in lowood have on jane in the novel one can only state with regret that the movie does not even touch the surface of that particular episode in jane's life and this is the problem throughout this adaptation it rushes from scene to scene very often without transition and nowhere comes even near the essence of the novel the dialogues are an odd mixture of made up lines and lines from the novel very clumsily patched together and the scenes between jane and rochester are so shortened that both share only 5 minutes together on screen before they fall in love and the little conversation they have contains nothing of the brilliance the intensity and also the humour of the conversations between rochester and jane in the novel but the scriptwriter not only did brontÃ«'s language injustice but in addition managed to ruin her moral set up with just one sentence when rochester and jane go to see rochester's wife after the would be wedding rochester says yet i once loved her his wife as i love you now the whole moral concept of the novel depends on the fact that rochester is indeed an innocent victim of an amoral scheme and was trapped into marrying a mad woman whom he never loved and that his effort to seek a true life partner is if not sanctified by god's and man's law yet understandable and forgivable but this one sentence completely undermines brontÃ«'s whole carefully constructed moral concept and turns rochester into a dirty old man who wants a new young wife because his old one is of no use to him any longer br br from the errors regarding the script to the errors regarding the casting now i am by no means one of those who insist on physical resemblance between an actor and the literary figure he portrays but by no stretch of imagination is it possible to picture lovely blonde blue eyed and full mouthed susannah york as the novel's plain heroine in addition ms york was in her thirties when the film was shot and looks it played by her the novel's shy reserved and inexperienced young jane becomes a perfectly poised graceful and mature woman completely sure of herself and her deserts i do not say that susannah york does not play well and convincingly but the woman she portrays is not brontÃ«'s jane eyre to cast george c scott as rochester must have been motivated by the desire to have a rochester who looked old enough to make the 18 years difference in age between jane and rochester plausible scott looks as if he were around 50 but acts in various scenes as if he were 70 br br to compliment the maturity of the leading actors all passion desire and despair seems to have been deliberately wrung out of the script the scene between jane and rochester after the wedding the emotional climax of the novel has become a calm rational conversation between two middle aged persons at the end of which rochester falls asleep when jane returns to him in the last scene he is just as mildly pleased as a grandfather who has just been paid a visit in his old people's home by his favourite granddaughter the only character who displays an appropriate amount of emotion is st john of all people ian bannen plays him so passionately and his eager plea for jane's love is so touching that one gets the impression that bannen was modelling his st john on the rochester of the novel but good though bannen is his st john is just as far from the novel as york's jane and scott's rochester the only redeeming features of this very disappointing jane eyre are the locations and the score and i would only recommend this production to those who want to watch and compare every single adaptation of jane eyre
<START> i loved it having been a fan of the original series i have always wondered what the back story would be it didn't fail to delight me i also love the fact that apart from eric stoltz i didn't recognise one person this is refreshing much like bsg it has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent can't wait for the series to start airing well done to ronald d moore and team excellent job the special effects dialogue and acting were all spot on and i felt emotionally tied up in the storyline i know there are purists out there that will probably disagree with my assessment but i felt that caprica was far superior to most of the sci fi stuff produced in the last decade
<START> i grew up watching the original disney cinderella and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn br br accordingly i was excited to see that cinderella 2 was coming on tv and i would be able to see it br br i should have known better br br this movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have just been left alone it holds absolutely none of the originals super charm it seems to me quite rough and almost brutal right from the don't sing a longs to the characterization br br while i remember the character's telling a story through a song this film's soundtrack was laid over the top and didn't seem to fit jaq's transformation into a human is a prime example where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall and in the ballroom there's old barn dance type country music it's as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set the upbeat fiddles certainly didn't fit br br even the artwork and animation in cinderella 2 isn't up to scratch with the original the artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed and we see part of cinderella's hoop skirt which doesn't feel right br br the movie itself could have been it's own story i think that it should have been just that i wouldn't say that i hate it but i believe that it had many shortcomings it seems to downgrade in a significant way from the beloved cinderella original
