<START> nicolas mallet is a failure a teller in a bank everyone walks all over him then his friend a writer who's books no one likes has a plan to change his life our hero tells his boss he is quitting he intends to spend the rest of his life making a great deal of money and sleeping with a great many women and he manages to do just that br br if it were not for the amount of death murder suicide natural causes in the film this would be a farce there are numerous jabs at marriage politics journalism and life br br jean louis trintignant is a likable amoral rogue romy schneider is at her most appealing definitely worth a look
<START> i first heard of this movie after purchasing the 1976 flick snuff i was told that devil's experiment was much better so naturally i went ahead and ordered the guinea pig box set i was really interested to hear that charlie sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one so my interest was peaked br br devil's experiment is a short film with no story no character development just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes they torture her in various ways like beating her spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol forcing her to listen to hi pitched noise for 24 hours smash her hand with a mallet burning and putting maggots on the burns throwing guts at her and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye br br i must say that a lot of this movie was fake like the beating scenes but then some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out the scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about the worst is the eye scene i didn't shutter when watching it but simply thought damn that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie i did enjoy the flick but i don't know if i can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer 7 10
<START> wow something of a surprise though flawed it is far better that i expected br br the brand new space liner arcturus with some 3 000 passengers is in the final days of its sixteen day trip to jupiter without warning the ship's cerebral central computer sounds a disaster alarm and orders everyone to evacuate br br soon there are only a handful of people remaining including one of the ship's astrogators penny the captain cary and the director of the shipping line kenyon br br it turns out that the alarm was false and that the main cerebral is acting br br erratically the remaining passengers and crew must escape the ship and br br avoid personal conflicts in order to survive br br the film starts out very well the opening commercial is a very nice touch there are obvious parallels to 2001 a space odyssey and to the historic br br sinking of the titanic the film does slow down at times and has pacing br br problems but is generally well made and well acted
<START> are highlights of this 1917 feature the pride of the clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies on an island off the coast of scotland the villagers live the simple lives of fisher folk my copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read but the film boasts some stunning ocean scenery and the camera work on boats is splendid maurice tourneur directed pickford in this pleasant film pickford was already a major star in 1917 and this film seems to have been written just for her plucky young woman succeeds over misfortune pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is very funny and the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done not a great picford film but still worth seeing matt moore pickford was married to his brother owen moore is the love interest and is good as the strapping island lad leatrice joy is one of the villagers but i couldn't spot her either my copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the village warning bells are rung very effective
<START> this film is deeply disappointing not only that wenders only displays a very limited musical spectrum of blues it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely boring the only highlight of the movie is the interview of a swedish couple who were befriended with j b lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories wenders's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly alluding to world's culture or actually american culture traveling in space but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid yawn i had expected more of him
<START> doc savage the man of bronze is a horrible movie poorly scripted over acted and just plain silly that being said it is actually an enjoyable movie on some level this movie begs to be watched in a group with an ample supply of cheap beer it's one of those movies like santa claus conquers the martians or yor the hunter from the future so bad it is almost good if you have the right group of people this movie is a blast to watch it's campy it's fun it has a theme by sousa if you're looking for a good movie though look elsewhere 3 10 br br btw i've heard rumors some studio is exploring the possibility of a remake
<START> like a streetcar named desire also directed by gadg both on stage and screen panic in the streets depicts a new orleans in which its major claim to fame the birthplace of jazz doesn't even rate a mention it was richard widmark's seventh film and arguably went a long way to establishing him as the fine actor he really was rather than merely a psychotic killer gadg himself appears in an uncredited small role as a morgue attendant but the film is rich in talent beginning with jack palance still being billed as walter jack palance as the local mr 'big' followed side kick zero mostel barbara bel geddes emile meyer tommy rettig plus the rock solid ever reliable paul douglas as the cop who comes round to doc widmark's point of view it's a very rewarding movie more so for being little seen catch it if you can
<START> i kind of liked the lonely lady give pia a break she looks great and she has really nice eyes what's not to like the scene where she gets raped by ray liotta with a garden hose was kind of gross and cruel actually a lot of stuff that happens in this movie is gross and cruel but its a trashy movie a lot of movies that are trashy are not all bad i liked this better than valley of the dolls which was not only trashy but boring as well at least this wasn't boring br br pia gets naked a lot and seems miscast as a writer watching her talk about pushkin and byron with a guy three times her age is flat unbelievable i'm sure pia's a nice person in real life she just doesn't project the writer vibe she looked much happier when she was working as a hostess for that guy from saturday night fever and wearing a glittery disco dress br br a couple of the scenes are funny the one where she tells the two timing actor that she's pregnant and he rolls his eyes and snaps at her to stop hanging around all the while he's practically fawning over every bimbo who flounces by br br pia's nervous breakdown scene is good it was probably a mistake to go so supernova on it the vortex of floating faces and freeze frame scream whoa and her subsequent catatonic stupor is kind of overdone br br the acceptance speech is a hoot though i want to see someone do that speech in a drama class br br but again this is trash we're talking about you could find worse on any movie of the week back in the eighties
<START> this movie is a must for all people that enjoy soccer as an art what strikes first about this movie about a soccer world cup is the way it is filmed besides following the play like a tv broadcast there is generous footage dedicated to follow individual players in the games this brings forward the emotions and situations these men go through as they attempt to reach glory today's tv broadcasting style so different than that of 1986 is still inferior in quality compared to this movie br br the players are not the only stars the audience the referees the journalists covering the matches and the environment itself all play a central role in the development of what today is history in this movie you can see how all these factors play together in a very explicit way in that regard today's tv broadcasting style has not yet reached this level of quality although it is now much closer than before br br there are several highlighted players maradona argentina elkjaer and laudrup denmark francescoli uruguay platini france lineker england rummenigge germany butrague o spain socrates brazil and sanchez mexico br br this movie is not a collection of the best soccer moves of mexico 1986 although most of them are well covered across all the movie there is a stress for presenting several aspects of the game and the competition itself based on the progress of these players and teams even at the cost of skipping relevant plays of the games themselves this is what makes this movie so interesting and unique br br because of what happened because of referees during mexico 1986 much of the comments about this movie and world cup are extremely maradona biased much of these comments do not take into account that there is a referee and two linesmen that they are as human as the players and that all of the abovementioned make mistakes one way or the other soccer rules do not allow referees to use tv based replays to make decisions so for the most part referees have to decide on what they perceive as a consequence referees play an active part in the development of a game their influence can be seen in several parts of this movie br br the sequel movie for the 1990 world cup compared to this one is just a source of bitter disappointment much of it comes from the fact that it became too involved in the game whereas this movie tells things from a more distant unbiased point of view
<START> if you've seen this movie you've been to puerto rico i've lived in puerto rico all my life and have to shamefully admit that we pr are living a real chaos right now drugs being the main reason for the shootings and killings we have almost every day these people will shoot anyone anytime and anywhere and many innocent lives have been lost because of this we don't feel safe anymore and in addition to this our so called justice is no longer moved by truth and rightness but by money influence and power ladrones y mentirosos is based on real deplorable facts and truly portrays puerto rico's three main problems the drug related killings money and power manipulating our courtrooms and innocent people and children being corrupted and even dying because of this ricardo and his wife poli with their true to life plot and their award winning direction were brave enough to present all this as bad as it is puerto rico is a beautiful and friendly country living a nightmare that doesn't seem to end they recently won the copper wing award for best director in the world cinema competition at the 2006 phoenix film festival
<START> i don't know the stars or modern chinese teenage music but i do know a thoroughly entertaining movie when i see one br br kung fu dunk is pure hollywood in its values it's played for laughs for love and is a great blend of kung fu and basketball br br everybody looks like they had a lot of fun making this the production values are excellent and modern china looks glossier than los angeles here br br the plot of the abandoned orphan who grows up in a kung fu school only to be kicked out and then discover superstardom as a basketball play and love and more etc is great this is fresh fun and immensely entertaining br br with great action and good dialogue this is one simply to enjoy for all ages and for our money was one of the best family movies we're seen in a long time br br please ignore the negative reviews and give dunk a chance we were really glad we did a good sports comedy movie
<START> you'll notice that the chemist who appears in two scenes and gets to speak is played by stephen king don't give up your day job is the standard thing to say but that's not fair king acquits himself reasonably well he's no worse than any other member of the cast and better than most the story on the other hand is pure rubbish please give up your day job br br never have i seen so many dreadful performances of which the lead actor's the lead actor's is probably the worst gathered together in the one film everyone acts hammily but not in any entertaining way they all somehow manage to go over the top without expending or manifesting energy i blame screenwriter director tom holland it can't be that all the actors are really this bad what are the odds against that admittedly i've never heard of any of them before but still i don't think i could walk into a talent agency and walk out with this many bad performers if i tried one actor despite my best efforts would turn out to have talent so what's more likely that tom holland rolled a dozen consecutive snake eyes or that he wrote a lousy script and then directed it poorly that would also explain why actors are bad in direct proportion to their prominence in the script the more direction an actor got the worse he performed you want me to bend over like a hunchback talk from the back of my throat show all my teeth and look bored all at the same time okay br br this theory is confirmed by the fact that holland undeniably managed to co write a lousy script several writers here have commented on the fact that billy halleck is not a likeable character but that's a misleading way of putting it he's not a knowable character all we find out about him before the supernatural stuff starts happening is that he's fat and that all he can think about is food all i can think about is food he tells us helpfully and in the end br br sigh i suppose i ought insert a spoiler warning here br br in the end he becomes evil why i can only shrug perhaps he's under some kind of enchantment yeah that's probably it by evil perhaps i mean inexplicable it's not so much badness as a socially undesirable suspension of ordinary means end psychology anyway his actions at the end make no sense nobody's actions make much sense and this is despite the fact that the characters do little but explain their motivation for the benefit of the audience br br by the way here's my nominee for hammiest line delivery i don't think you'd like it in fact big dramatic pause i don't think you'd like it at all
<START> nobody could like this movie for its merit but if you have a sense of humor and enjoy schlock movies for their mst3 quality then this is for you it ranks up there with road house for its preposterous characters sets and story line the bad writing really cracked me up i want you to dust those guys off instead of dust those guys f 14s take off from the carrier but when they get into formation they're f 16s without a hint of anger or skepticism segal goes back to work for the general who only minutes before was overseeing a covert mind wipe on seagal segal runs out of bullets and resorts to a knife to kill the guards so naturally the guards all drop their guns and fight with knives too the hand grenade is a dud but explodes anyway the little stealth fighter can fly all the way from california to afganistan without refueling then segal flies it back to california the long way i e by way of europe even though there's a carrier giving him air support 20 minutes away in the arabian sea the cic in the carrier consists of 3 black pcs 2 flat screen tvs and pictures of gauges and maps on the walls what a hoot
<START> powers booth is hypnotic as cult leader jim jones who led his peoples temple followers from 1953 until 1978 when he led them in a mass suicide in 1978 where over 900 died a very well done movie which may seem a little dated due to the 70s time period but well worth the time 8 of 10
<START> you'd think that with ingrid bergman and warner baxter that this film would have been a lot better sadly the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brain addled br br the film begins with ingrid bergman coming to work for the stoddard family everything is so very peachy and swell the family adores bergman and things couldn't be more perfect well that is until the mother fay wray dies the stock market crashes in 1907 wiping out the family's fortune and bergman is forced to go back home to france this portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet but not bad br br later after the family's fortunes have improved bergman returns the four boys are now all grown and there isn't really a conceivable reason why they'd hire her once again as a governess but briefly everything is swell once again but when wwi occurs the four all go to war gosh in the midst of this one of the sons david brings home his new wife susan hayward miss hayward's character is as black and white as the others though while they are all good and swell she's obviously a horny she devil to make things worse she comes to live in the family home while david is at war br br now here is where the movie gets really really dumb brain achingly dumb hayward begins an affair with one of david's brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her not hayward with jack why why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman this was exactly the sort of excuse bergman needed to get rid of the gutter snipe once and for all this is just a case of lousy writing and made me mad and most likely did the same to the audiences back in 1941 br br the rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for hayward's evilness to be exposed this just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess as expected however the truth eventually comes out and everyone is swell once again happy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut hayward br br the film suffers because of poor writing hayward's affair made no sense at least in how it was handled and having characters who are so gosh darn good or evil with nothing in between sinks this movie to the level of a second rate soap the only thing that saves it at all is the acting they tried as best they could with a turgid script suffice to say that the columbia pictures writers who did this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken
<START> in the areas where they overlap this fine movie is light years ahead of 2004s innocence which gave the impression of a rheumy eye and heavy breathing ogling young girls here the effect is much more realistic and really gets inside the heads of the three protagonists as they fumble their way through an adolescence riddled with pitfalls the three principals all unknown to me give very sure footed performances the kind in fact that may be so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this quality of acting in other films so i wouldn't be too surprised if they are not heard from again it would be nice if this could get away from the art houses and into the multiplexes where there's just an outside chance it might 'speak' to the bubblegum crowd it isn't aimed at
<START> i have been familiar with the fantastic book of 'goodnight mister tom' for absolutely ages and it was only recently when i got the chance to watch this adaption of it i have heard lots of positive remarks about this so i had high hopes once this film had finished i was horrified br br this film is not a good film at all 'goodnight mister tom' was an extremely poor adaption and practically 4 5 10 of the book was missed out particularly i found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this there was not much dialogue it was rushed and far too fast moving but i was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between william beech and tom in this film which was a true let down the casting was not all that good either i thought this could have been really good but it was so different to the book anextremely poor adaption one of the worst i've seen this deserves a decent remake that'd better be 1000 times better than this pile of garbage
<START> and it is this film i imagine that if indeed there is a negative afterlife damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity br br okay maybe it's not that bad but it is probably the worst film i have ever seen next to manos the hands of fate and i have seen a lot of bad movies believe you me br br this is just a crummy b movie bad film making at it's finest or is it worst the thing i really didn't like about this movie is the moronic duo they threw in for comedy relief now a little comedy relief is a good thing but most of the movie is focused on the adventures of these two morons rather than on the heroes of this film who are actually in it for less time than them br br to be fair crown international really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and doing a poor job editing but honestly this was probably a bad film to begin with so crown really couldn't have done that much to hurt it br br this really needs to be in the bottom 100 list i wouldn't wish this one on my worst enemy br br actually it's my kind of campy b movie it was bad but i still liked it despite my one star rating
<START> en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway a female reporter runs into a strange hitch hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination the strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area in the first story an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman's husband but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie and in the second story a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on br br the zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer garrett clancy and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed anthologyÂa nice idea but with only two stories it falls woefully short and that's not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver the acting is lousy with joe haggerty as the tale telling ebenezer jackson giving one of the strangest performances i have ever seen the locations are uninspired the script is dreary there's a sex scene with zero nudity and the ending well that beggars belief br br to be fair some of sykes' creative camera work is effective although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused and joe castro's cheapo gore is enthusiastic an ear is bitten off eyeballs are plucked out a face is removed brains are squished and there is a messy decapitation these positives just about make the film bearable but be warned the zombie chronicles ain't a stroll in the park even for seasoned viewers of z grade trash br br i give the zombie chronicles 2 10 but generously raise my rating to 3 since i didn't get to view the film with the benefit of 3d although i have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn't have made that much of a difference
<START> i noticed that a new hope and the empire strikes back are in the top 10 but that this one isn't even in the top 100 br br this movie has a bad reputation because of ewoks but there are so many reasons to love this movie br br the rescue of han solo from jabba this official wraps up the han solo in debt sub plot that was established when we first met the character in a new hope br br the emperor was finally revealled well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw the emperor as kids br br the speeder bike chase alright so this was a special effects moment but it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films br br the 3 part climax 1 the battle of endor led by han and leia 2 luke confronts his father the fall of the emperor 3 the destruction of the second death star lando's moment br br the final celebration with our heroes like i said this movie gets a lot of crap because of the ewoks but i think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the empire our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other br br all in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the star wars story
