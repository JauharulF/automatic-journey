<START> without being one of my favorites this is good for being a change of pace even if only for a few minutes br br it all starts with a big fight between tom jerry and spike who is renamed butch here they're all beating each other but suddenly spike makes a heroic and admirable decision he stops the fight and suggests that they all should be friends so all of them sign a peace treaty and become friends which isn't going to last for long br br meanwhile the three become affectionate patient and kind to each other they even save each other when one of them is in danger of life the relationship goes nothing but excellent until a very big steak appears and they all become greedy the three are guilty to return to their usual fights and rivalries br br but still to see tom jerry and spike as friends is truly a delightful and grateful experience even if only for a while br br oh by the way as a curious fact two songs from the wizard of oz are played here in instrumental versions we're off to see the wizard and somewhere over the rainbow
<START> this was one of the most ridiculous and badly directed movies i've seen in a very long time i've never liked spike lee but thought i'd give this one a try bad mistake the movie is supposed to show how the son of sam real life murders affected a neighborhood in the summer of 1977 what it really did was center around the most boring characters that i doubt anyone cared for as far as their drug problems marriage problems and so on etc the scenes that depict the murders are just that and nothing more a shooting and then it's back to saturday night fever what's even more ridiculous is spike lee's choice to show up as a reporter in the movie spike trust me you're no hitchcock stay out of the movies it makes them even worse off the most silly scene had to be the dog speaking in a goofy voice which was depicted in a scene before it where it was supposed to have been shot spike what were you thinking when you made this film not thinking at all is my guess people who think they'll see a crime drama take my advice and do not waste your time or money on this loser you're better off watching jerry springer in this case waste of film i gave it a 1 out of 10 awful dud
<START> as an army veteran i was deeply offended by this film in my opinion it is a disgrace to those who fought in the vietnam war to say that the real sf soldiers i knew were offended by this crap is an understatement if the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon it was it would have been better received but it was taken seriously my many people especially overseas silly as it sounds wherever i went in europe in the late 80's people seemed to judge me and americans in general by this film unrealistic hmm let's see a monosyllabic muscle bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to se asia to free some american pow's in a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an m 60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats and he never misses running with a 32lb gun held up with one arm i could go on but i'm getting a headache i gave this a 2 10 only because it's slightly better than rambo iii
<START> you have a strong stomach holden was actually 55 years old at filming but looked near 70 and he only lived another 8 years at one point holden said i am over twice your age okay try triple grandpa the old enough to be your father theme they were shooting for didn't work granted senior citizens sometimes wind up with legal teens more power to them but that doesn't mean i want to watch it it's not a matter of judgment but the digestive track i like my food where it belongs lenz is fun to watch and the 70s cars clothes furniture etc make it worth it if it comes on cable late at night and you want to watch something to wind down for bed it would have been nice to see the blonde friend of lenz the one who hocked her guitar get more scenes pleasingly spacey who was this chick i'm going to try and find out
<START> i went to a screening of this movie and while it had a couple moments that made me laugh it had some very major flaws it first of all presents itself to be the humorous exploits of a real life divorcee trying to find love in la what it morphs into is a depressing narcissistic and unfunny romp through the history of the film director's love life and professional life jokes wear thin quickly and you find yourself suddenly not caring how this man's dates progress the ridiculousness is that the director simultaneously presents himself as an extremely annoying and heavily flawed character and then expects us to be concerned
<START> i don't buy kung fu movies for a plot i buy them for fight scenes a bad plot can be forgiven for excellent fight scenes but not the other way around br br the story was decent but moved too slowly for my tastes there were about 3 or 4 mediocre fight scenes throughout lasting only a couple of minutes apiece the last fight was a bit longer but by that point i was so bored i didn't even pay attention to it
<START> strange almost all reviewers are highly positive about this movie is it because it's from 1975 and has chamberlain and curtis in it and therefore forgive the by times very bad acting and childish ways of storytelling br br maybe it's because some people get sentimental about this film because they have read the book i have not read the book but i don't think that's a problem film makers never presume that the viewers have read the book br br or is it because i am subconsciously irritated about the fact that english speaking actors try to behave as their french counterparts
<START> i first saw the trailer for frailty on yahoo movies way back in the day after hearing stephen king praise it to high heaven not really a fan of either star i still wanted to see it because i'm a huge thriller fan br br i was not disappointed the acting was superb especially from the two young boys usually i loathe child actors but young adam and young fenton were excellent bill paxton really did a good job of directing it too it was beautifully shot br br one must also note the plot twists the three twists at the end hit hard and fast and i didn't see them coming the final twist of the film coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed gives me chills to this day even though i've re watched the film so many times br br a true gem
<START> i don't know where to begin so i'll begin with a snippet from the back of the cover of this movie alive combines the tension of vincenzo natali's cube with kitamura's own versus i have not seen versus so i can't comment on that but i think cube was an excellent movie which i recommend to everyone however in this case someone has clearly confused tension with boredom br br i'll just go ahead and spoil the entire plot because besides being one holy swiss cheese of a plot it's also moldy cheese and the movie is not worth spending any time on even if you don't know the plot beforehand so it doesn't matter if i have misunderstood the plot don't hit me it's probably because i had to struggle to keep my eyelids open br br so the american military in nevada once lost a ufo i the nambi desert this apparently makes sense because they're both deserts so surely they're practically the same place different continents or not a monkey broke into the ufo and acquired an alien something which was passed on to a japanese researcher who had to eat the monkey to survive in the desert what ever the alien thing is now passed on to anyone who's bloodthirsty enough to kill the current host the japanese military wants to use it for military stuff so they decide to make it pass from the current host the researcher's daughter to some other dude but instead of just picking someone out of the military which is full of people who are bloodthirsty and already on the military's side they decide that it's probably a good idea to pick some criminal out of death row instead oh and the reason they pick this particular criminal from death row is because he was the first person in history to not die from the non lethal electric shock which is the standard execution method because everyone dies from the placebo effect when they get electrocuted i don't know if they do this so they can giggle in the staff room at how everyone dies even though it's not deadly or if they just want to cut down the electricity bill br br then the movie turns into what the matrix would have been if it had been really lame and superfluous fighting bores us to tears for what feels like an hour and oh wait now they remember that they already had a dude who was infected with the alien thing so the entire movie up to this point was actually a totally waste of time and also human lives then everyone dies the end br br the only one moment in the movie where i didn't want to go away and sleep or eat a sandwich instead was when a dude was pinned to a wall by a pipe through his chest and he's hanging around up there and another dude walks by the dude hanging on the wall says i'm in pain shoot me and the living dude looks at him and it's not like he's a mean dude or anything so he really looks sorrowful and doesn't want the guy on the wall to suffer so he shoots him br br rhetorical pause br br in the stomach gee thanks a freakin' heap
<START> i am not a huge fan of camp kitsch and the so bad it's good type of viewing however i really like this film for its fun factor and believe it or not it's innovation br br the whole thing has a ring of john waters and is boundlessly enthusiastic but with some superb actors and considered direction making the most of the slapstick and styalised movements billy zane moves with incredible expression see the scene on the bus for a text book lesson in how to use movement and is framed by some unexpected stars br br you may not like this film you may not enjoy it but if you get the chance to watch it then spare the time because chances are you will end the film with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the sense of humour of some big stars highly reccomended
<START> there are moments in the film that are so dreadful your teeth ache but knowing that there were only weeks left before the code made movies innocuous and bland paramount rushed this into production before innuendo and leering went out of style vanities is so horrifically anti female that it's delicious as kitty carlisle sings women are displayed with price tags that would insult a bronx hooker they emerge from clams nudge nudge wink wink in postures of absolute submission minions of the law so stupid they cannot find the door get to look up their skirts and snicker bare breasted chorus girls sit uncomfortably in giant cacti could they be a source of hallucinogens perhaps while we listen to sweet marijuana and watch as blood falls on a chorines's breast br br sure carl brisson learned his lines phonetically and doesn't seem to have a clue what he is saying but it's all worth it as norma steals the show while no one is looking br br taking one moment of this fragile fluff seriously is missing the point of the whole exercise watch this with a charter member of now and prepare to justify the whole hollywood machismo sch tick between body blows br br toby wing by the way is the icing on the cake and duke ellington doesn't hurt either br br a must stroll down memory lane
<START> the only saving grace of this movie is that it serves as the 0 end of the movie rating scale now if i see a movie that really stinks i say this movie was a real pecker i believe this movie is a perfect example of christina ricci's one dimensional acting horrible
<START> i had high expectations for this indie having perused the many thumbs up reviews then br br here's my additional 'two cents' to the already posted excellent 'lost in translation' review premise morgan is 'stuck' in a dusty small town where he meets lovely scarlet who is working in the local supermarket can morgan help elevate the lovely scarlet from her trailer trash life br br realistic dialog not how about that shopping in target first freeman looks at the target interior as if he's walked into harrods then he's bowled over at a t shirt rack confirming he has never been in any store visited by lovely scarlet morgan is detached from any and all aspects of scarlet's reality and is portrayed as gleeful in his ignorance of everyone and everything in scarlet's life br br one reviewer enjoyed the scarlet and ex hubby fight scene where her survival a car in this instance requires she physically attack her ex hubbie does freeman run to her defense naw he's cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of her very real sorry lot in life br br freeman's character believes a car wash and new very revealing tight fitting blouse is the key to scarlet's job interview another sign that freeman is clueless freeman's endless 'stage talk' where all aspects of scarlet's reality are reduced to one or another stage related freeman experience was irritating br br freeman is right to emphasize that scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces vis a vis uneducated no white collar skills or experience very poor no family support and a lifetime of low self esteem scarlet learns such life lessons from freeman as some people pay 100 for a t shirt and a revealing blouse may open doors in lieu of her lack of education and white collar job skills in the end freeman offers scarlet little more than strange diversion with a 'star' not even paying for gas for scarlet's dead of night return to her unchanged life in a town the name of which freeman cares not to know
<START> do not waste your time with this movie this is a total thrash in terms of acting directing sound editing soundtrack there was such a waste of performance by some of the very good actors the movie does not do justice to paresh rawal who is perhaps one of the most talented actors in bollywood akshay kumar who is also an emerging star did quite a poor job john abraham what is wrong with him is that what you call acting i mean he should thank god that he has a pretty face otherwise he'd be winning razzie awards in india if there were any such awards in bollywood asrani a great talent but overdoes his bit as before br br screenplay which was not to mention a rip off from the 1965's boeing boeing was quite badly framed first of all people in bollywood just can't make something original on top of that they don't even know how to copy well the jokes in the movie were so overdone it was getting painful to sit through them priyadarshan may be a star in the south but he's just not fit to make a decent hindi movie the sound editing is amazingly crappy i can go on and on this matter but the bottom line is that bollywood should be shameful of making such a film br br the worst part is that some people seemed to love this movie what is wrong with you guys this is the reason why bollywood is where it is did you know that bollywood makes more movies than hollywood every year however most of the movies are unheard of abroad because of movies like this one i am an indian and i am utterly shameful of bollywood for producing this piece of thrash movies like dil chahta hai and lagaan were just terrific they are world class films which are timeless among the best of this decade garam masala however is perhaps one of the worst of this century period br br i give it a 1 out of 10
<START> almost 30 years later i recall this original pbs film as almost unbearably tender periodically i check here at imdb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a dvd it's september of 2004 and i keep hoping deep sigh br br one of the two lead actors went on to a small career primarily in a prime time evening soap the other frances lee mccain was seen in small roles here and there for a few years but nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced as i recall it on a short lived pbs series which showcased original screenplays by new and up and coming playwrights br br i watched it every time it was shown on pbs maybe 2 or 3 times that was before the era of vcrs so i have no record of it except in my mind's eye br br 12 31 2006 addition to above happy new year ladies this wonderful film is finally available on dvd at ladyslipper org my understanding is that the dvds are burned from the writer's own personal copy
<START> i'm no horror movie buff but my wife's nieces and nephews are so i saw the first movie it was gruesome and tense but not my taste still good though for similar reasons at this very moment i am being exposed to a sequel br br the premise itself is beyond absurd i can buy that disasters occur in the desert i can buy that mutants exists i can even buy that the events might be so weird and strange that the military may decide to get involved it is unlikely yes but i'm willing to suspend my belief br br however under no circumstances am i willing to believe that the military squad assigned to recon such an area would be unable to fend off the mutants being a member of the united states army i can assure that while fresh recruits may lack the seasoned eyes and experience of combat soldiers any such recruits would be integrated into a capable squad br br a squad of armed soldiers is not about to be taken out by a few mutants with knives that's just the way it works squad movements vastly superior firepower and of course radio support would ensure nothing less than total victory i'm not saying you wouldn't have casualties but as soon as the area was verified as hostile military training would take precedence no one would go off on their own even to use the bathroom br br and if it were discovered that the area was so infested with hostiles that the squad was unable to handle the danger they would radio in for backup and believe me their radios would not be jammed if there was a chance that normal radios would not do the squad would have a military issue satellite phone chances are if they were unable to check in every hour a search would be called br br in order to accept this movie you must accept that our soldiers are incompetent fools with incompetent leaders and an incompetent chain of command while it may still be true that the most dangerous thing in the world is a lieutenant with a map and compass our military forces are filled with intelligent well trained competent soldiers mutants with knives are far below our ability to deal with br br with the whole execution of the movie depending solidly on the impossible to imagine the film fails to deliver instead we are expected to believe that our soldiers sailors and airmen are incapable of dealing with even the most mediocre threats br br as a combat veteran i find the movie insulting
<START> happy go lovely has only two things going for it and those two things are vera ellen's legs this is a british excelsior films version of an m g m musical complete with second tier stars i would imagine that vera ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star but i'm sorry to say ms ellen's chance did not pay off br br opening with a horrible scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy the predictable mistaken identity plot is very thin and with the exception of david niven cesar romero who is way over the top in his role of a producer and bobby howes who is totally wasted in a nothing role the rest of the cast is totally forgettable br br the choreography is boring but ms ellen gives it her all she was never as famous as most of the other musical stars and she shouldn't be since she couldn't sing and even had a dancing stand in in several of her pictures but when she did dance it was just entrancing br br it's too bad that this film that could have made her a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine br br 4 out of 10
<START> this is exactly the type of film that frustrates me the most great cast great director great story potential then they ruin it all with a screenplay that goes nowhere and says nothing while going there there is no depth here whatsoever no depth of characters no depth of plot no depth of surprise suspense or common sense we know what's happening we are told how they plan to fix the problem they fix the problem throw a surprise at us near the end that fails to generate any suspense then they end the film abruptly wasted opportunity br br on the plus side glenn ford leads a cast of uk and one french actors who are all fantastic doing an incredibly impressive job with the one dimensional writing they were given one of the absolute favorites is herbert walton as old charlie who provides some wonderful bits of humor and warmth to a dark and serious film i also thought the film had a great look to it all shadows and fog very film noir in feel br br even though the actors do the best they can and the directing is enjoyable it still just isn't enough for me to recommend spending the time to view the film there are far better glenn ford movies out there the big heat gilda affair in trinidad etc
<START> is just as good as the original very nearly achieves greatness because of cundieff's remarkable ear for music and dialogue skewers the self important swagger of the hip hop poseurs the group niggaz with hats nwh are every rap group you ever heard and utterly self parodic wardrobe is unbelievable buy the oop soundtrack if you can
<START> mr perlman gives a standout performance as usual sadly he has to struggle with an underwritten script and some nonsensical set pieces br br larsen is in die hard mode complete with singlet and bulging muscles i'm sure he could do better but seems satisfied to grimace and snarl through his part br br the lovely erika is very decorative even though fully clothed and shows some signs of getting acting at last br br sfx are mainly poor cgi and steals from other movies br br the shootouts are pitiful worthy of the a team br br not even worth seeing for perlman avoid
