<START> the radar men from the moon is a pretty typical fare of 1950's serials the special effects are pretty cheap the lunar rovers are obviously world war ii surplus jeeps with painted plywood over them and the like the acting is only so so it does inspire the imagination of children to whom i believe this was directed to by today's standards it's boring cheap and bad there's also a hefty amount of stock footage in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters
<START> of course flatley is already not exactly the ideal name for a dancer but i think michael is really pushing the irony envelope with this new title feet of flames br br one really can't resist recommending desenex foot spray to the retiring and clearly ailing flatley br br i might add that much like that cheering london crowd per review below i too am enthusiastic about this being his last live performance br br hinting that it may be his last live performance flatley is cheered on by an enthusiastic london crowd perry seibert all movie guide
<START> this is probably one of the worst films i have ever seen the events in it are completely random and make little or no sense the fact that there is a sequel is so sickening i may come down with a case of cabin fever i'm so sorry i describe it as bug being smooshed to a newspaper because it seems to be different parts of things mixed together e g kevin the pancake loving karate kid is just freakishly weird on its own then there's the cop who is slightly weird and perverted then the drug addict then there's the fact that they attack some random guy who clearly needs help then all of a sudden the main character is having sex with his friends girlfriend just because she says something stupid about a plane going down then at the end some good old family racism followed by a rabbit operating on kevin the karate kid its actually pretty despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this film there is no reason for anyone to enjoy this film unless you love eli roth even that did not make me like this film hate is a strong word but seeing as it is the only word i am permitted to use it will have to do boycott cabin fever 2
<START> wow i hated this movie the subject matter should have resulted in a really fine film and the lead actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to handle the topic but the script if there even was a script is a mess this is less a movie than a random slide show that goes nowhere i'd say it goes nowhere fast except that it's actually the longest 81 minutes you'll ever sit through as i've mentioned the lead actor is good so is faruza baulk sp as his sometimes harsh but ultimately loving and accepting mother the film makers have a lot to answer for here because this is a mess a real shame because i really wanted to like this movie but it's basically out takes from a movie that never got made skip this one it wasn't even worth the 6 i shelled out for pay per view
<START> i was thinking that the main character the astronaut with the bad case of the runs in his case his skin hair muscles etc could always get more movie work after he'd been reduced to a puddle all he has to do is get a job as the blob the premise of this flick is pretty lame an astronaut gets exposed to sunspot radiation i think and so begins to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day not only is this a puzzler but apparently he has to kill humans and consume their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity huh have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment happens the person instantly turns into a killing machine why is that br br the astronaut lumbers off into the night from the 'secret facility' which has no security whatsoever shedding parts of himself as he goes apparently he retains just enough memory to make him head for the launch pad maybe because he wanted to return to space br br thus begins the part of the movie that's pretty much filler with a doctor wandering around with a geiger counter trying to find the melting man by the buzz he gives off he kills a stupid bill gates look alike fisherman scares a little girl a la the frankenstein monster movie and finishes off a wacky older couple punishing them karmically for stealing some lemons then there's a short scene where he whacks his former general and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around you'd think that after she cuts his arm off and he run away the scene would shift but no we're treated to about ten minutes of the woman huddled into a corner panting and screaming in terror even though the monster is gone all i could think was director's girlfriend anyone br br the end of the movie is even lamer than the rest of it the melting man finishes turning into a pile of goo and then nothing that's it that's the end of the movie well at least that meant that there was no room for a sequel
<START> well i hate hollywood but love cinema so i have to watch these cruddy movies in theaters and i was hoping vanilla sky would be good i was hoping that they would either keep the original open your eyes exactly the same or they would make it their own well it happened to be a little bit of both and it sucked br br it started out good i love radiohead i wish there was more of that but by the end we are listening to good vibrations by the beach boys talk about a wide range of suck between they had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple others but why oh why did they have to blare gv during the climax it was more annoying than confusing or blatant especially when it has nothing to do with the plot at least put some meaning behind the songs kid a primary whatever br br he also did a bang up job with the club scene that was cool otherwise the movie was one big ball of arrogance as if audiences would get the movie the ones that would get it read subtitles and the rest won't its as simple as that the motivations got all screwed up i didn't comprehend the diaz motivations hadn't they done the chicken soup night before and some of the others and i hate kurt russell stay overboard tom cruise can't act especially in these types of movie i e eyes wide shut and the elevator i get it anyways they tried improving the original with a crappy american rock soundtrack and crappy angles and good film print and glossy processing and it would have helped if crowe hadn't screwed it up br br 2 10 major disappointment
<START> am i the only one who saw the connection between the discussion of camus 'the myth of sisyphus' and mary's life in camus version a man is condemned to spend his eternity with a giant boulder that he must roll up a hill unfortunately every time he reaches the top the boulder slips and ends up back at the bottom for him to start there may have been a buzzard pecking at his eyes i'm not sure right now in the movie mary spends her life struggling to get her life together unfortunately every time she gains any footing she falls and loses everything case in point would be the party she throws where she gets intoxicated offends her falafel lover and is practically attacked by liev schrieber in case you question this theory note how this scene ends with her attempting to climb a flight of stars while books fall from nowhere impeding her progress until ultimately she passes out the next morning when she awakens she is still on the stairs never having reached the top

<START> i really enjoyed this movie the script is fresh and unpredictable and the acting is outstanding it is a down to earth movie with characters one cares about it brought tears into my eyes a few times but left me with a great feeling afterwards
<START> this movie was a littttle confusing at first i usually like gina phillips but this one i have to say was a bad choice just like her doing the movie ring around the rosie that one also not one her good movies jeepers creepers was way better anyway faye dunaway was good she totally creeped me out and at the end that was crazy it was about jennifer cassi phillips who comes to her twin sisters funeral she stays at a house that her sister owns and her grandmother dunaway lives at with an aunt named emma mary ellen dunaway is kinda sacrificing her relations to stay alive and as long as she wants to live she can't die even if jennifer tries to kill her which she tries ravens have a weird part in it when the relations go to sleep the ravens eat there organs so they can't go to sleep but they do basically it all crazy and mary ellen will never die and her relations will be buried but not dead b c they have to suffer forever so mary ellen can stay alive yeah i hope this helps if it doesn't sorry love ya
<START> grieving couple move to a cabin on a mountain after the loss of their daughter discovering that there may be ghosts haunting the place restless spirits of past occupants who committed suicide julie pyke cheri christian blames husband allen greg thompson for the horrible death of their daughter due to leaving the door unlocked and the marriage has deteriorated because of it julie remains in a zombie state eliciting next to no emotion remote and numb only photographing a nearby abandoned prison finding a startling image of a ghoul girl clinging to the bars of a cell though allen doesn't see anything out of the ordinary julie continues to take pictures and we can recognize that something isn't quite right a local handyman jim payne scott hodges a rather distant fellow who harbors a secret becomes a dangerous threat when it is revealed that his dead mother might have something to do with the haunts occurring to the pykes meanwhile the neighbors who sold the pykes the cabin find themselves victims as well alcoholic mr booth's abuse to his wife coming back to haunt him allen will conduct an investigation into the history of his cabin attempting to unravel the mystery about the place br br plenty of ghosts moving about in the background in this somber supernatural tale with practically every character miserable cheri christian remains so vacuous and lost it's incredibly hard to connect with her despite the fact that you understand her plight the acting as is often mentioned remains frustrating because none of the characters exactly are easy to latch on to i guess it's supposed to be this way under their circumstances but the trouble i had was never being able to properly embrace the pykes due to their constant state of aloofness cheri comes off as cold and detached as i figure a mother would tend to be when you lose a child in such a way but the icy nature left me pleading inside to embrace her which i just never could i think the right performers even if the characters are going through an emotional turmoil can grab the hearts of their viewers if a humanity reaches out to us in this movie's case the leads are unable to do so for whatever reason it could've been me i don't know i wanted to care for them but nothing in the characters tugged on my heart strings anyway as the film continues allen slowly uncovers certain truths and must defend himself against his wife who has convinced herself that their daughter is among them and she won't lose her little girl again jim the unstable neighbor who believes that to stop the hauntings plaguing the area he must kill the pykes becomes a vital threat the ghosts remain a central part of the movie their presence particularly jim's mother established throughout off in the distance the finale reveals all of them as allen must find help for his wife while trying to thwart jim's mission i had a hard time getting into this one due to my unease with the leads and their characters
<START> may 2004 wonderland is fairly new in the uk brilliant film of a brutal true story if you know la from the early 80's you will appreciate how well it is captured the use of the elements which make up its gritty cinematic style is original amplifying the experience and bringing the viewer very close to actually being there the use of a disjointed 'pulp fiction' style time line allows exploration of the uncertainty concerning what really happened while the direction and performances of the cast command attention especially val kilmer as john holmes an oscar for sure if i were handing them out
<START> no cinematic achievements here however that's not even the important question how does it fare in its endeavour to be a competent date movie and star vehicle br br the formula requires the cute female lead a la ryan or aniston check there's a built in tv audience br br add thick headed compliant men usually including the problem ex boyfriend fiancÃ©e check br br assemble a plot that maximizes the bankability of the stars so far so good br br what is the male lead to consist of he has to make all the women in the movie and in the audience and the gay flight stewards instantly swoon but he cannot be so hunky as to threaten to the male audience and he can't outshine the star roll cameras br br the problem is messing thinks she's still in a sitcom she has only one presentation as the wide eyed doormat that she's made a career out of a capable actress might have pulled it off after the love scene where things promptly nosedive into the soap suds br br you can't help feeling good for mulroney you can read it in his face that he sees through all of this he's gotten all the respect of a lifetime 260 hitter this time he smacks one out to the warning track and no one can figure out what to do as he amusedly takes home plate
<START> there's no shortage of bad dialogue in david and bathsheba Â i was quite a hand with a slingshot the king of all israel out there in the darkness exposing himself to the enemy full marks to dennis hooey for delivering that one with a straight face go and sit with the concubines and somehow i doubt a bored david ever told the prophet nathan whatever you say he even tries the old my kingdom doesn't understand me routine on desperate housewife bathsheba at one point so it's probably a tribute to henry king's direction that the film isn't at all bad despite the pitfalls much of the first third provide maybe it's the censor baiting nature of the plot Â a married man kills a femme fatale's husband and gets away with it Â but king brings out the growing moral and theological complexities in phillip dunne's script rather than upping the sin and sandals hokum this is the conflicted david on the downhill slope abandoned by a vengeful god he no longer understands and the film doesn't back away from the awkward unanswerable questions about why a loving deity would choose to wreak vengeance on the innocent rather than the guilty it even offers a genuinely surprising criticism of the sexual inequality of the law where the failings of husbands result in the punishment of their wives br br unlike king david which sidelined the king in favour of the admittedly more interesting saul david is firmly at the centre of the drama and despite an interesting display of shoulder twitching and a frankly gormless overlong close up when visiting the site of saul and jonathan's death gregory peck's performance grows in stature as david shrinks susan hayward is pure hollywood pro raymond massey is an appropriately theatrical prophet why be naturalistic when you've got a voice that makes the very heavens quake and kieron moore's uriah such an intransigent unreconstructed chauvinist that you can't exactly blame david for putting him in harm's way but despite threatening to soft peddle the film doesn't allow david a moral get out of jail free card over his death with surprisingly strong but subdued design and technicolor photography this is definitely a cut above most 40s 50s biblical epics br br fox's new dvd is a good transfer including an incredibly hokey 'candid' behind the scenes short and a trailer with brief shots deleted from the film's sole battle scene
<START> i searched for this movie for years apparently it ain't available here in the states so bought me a copy off ebay br br four young hunters and three of their girlfriends venture into the woods searching for a bear that apparently has killed several campers what they find is an ex vietnam vet gone crazy he kills some of his victims using a glove with long metal finger nails a la freddy krueger as soon as the night falls one of the girls goes for a walk after a brief argument with her boyfriend she gets killed after one of the group finds her body they all hide in their tents waiting for daylight once the sun comes up all of them try and make it out but fall victim one by one br br seven bodies not a lot of gore but a couple of good murders especially the girls'deaths the guys get killed in somewhat bloodless ways blown up in car shot to death knife through head br br overall infernal trap is a nice slasher film from the late 80's nothing new just well acted fast paced and some pretty ladies 10 out of 10
<START> hello this is my first review for any movie i have seen i went through the trouble of doing this to tell everyone that this is quite literally the most disgusting movie i have ever seen i feel like the movie was porely made which i will give some understanding due to budget constraints on making it i felt like i was watching a very bad remake of the movie saw which i can agree saw as well is also very graphic but i did like the movie saw br br the scene where he takes the hammer to the head of the tied up victim in the chair is the most disturbing scene i have seen the scene lasted almost forever well actually it was probably around 5 min but still i want to note that i like some horror movies and i do give credit if they are good this director uwe boll and his group of people used to make this movie should think it over before making another one similar to this one one final note haha for all the people who enjoy watching animals beatin to death letting rot with women and children as well and a five minute scene of someone getting there head smashed in with a hammer then you will enjoy this movie if not and you like horror go with a higher budget film like saw for example i cant believe people actually make movies like this anyway sorry to anyone who loves uwe boll and took it to heart this is just my opinion on the movie
<START> this film stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies it is virtually flawless the writing acting production design humor and pathos are all wonderful even the music from dean martin to la boheme is captivating and delightful br br every character is peculiarly delightful and memorable from the leads played by cher and nicolas cage to the many supporting roles olympia dukakis vincent gardenia john mahoney danny aiello even grandpa with his dog pack each of these performers plus norman jewison as director performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work for several of the actors this was an early major exposure in film so the casting is also exceptional and we have many current acting powerhouses whose careers were altered by their effectiveness in this film br br i've seen this film several times all the way through which can sometimes deflate the impact of a film substantially more tellingly i realized some years ago that whenever i channel surfed my way into a scene from this film any scene the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted there are so many stunning and memorable scenes the original meeting between the cher and nicolas cage characters where cage tells his tale of woe vincent gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera amidst the splendor generated by his gold mine plumbing business olympia dukakis scolding john mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaisons with co workers don't sh t where you eat danny aiello at his dying mother's bedside nicolas cage taking cher as the rapture of an aria soars in the background br br there are of course many great romantic comedies among them sabrina both versions but especially the audrey hepburn humphrey bogart william holden original when harry met sally the apartment br br none quite equals moonstruck
<START> really no reason to examine this much further because of a few very glaring and bias misleading statements br br a perfect example is when the filmmaker claims saul or paul of tarus the writer of the book of hebrews he asserts has no idea jesus is or was a human being this assertion is either purposely false as he accuses others of presenting or he is ignorant of what the bible says br br first we can examine his misleading claim about hebrews 8 4 which he shows a quote if jesus was on earth he would not be a priest hence right here he sets up the ignorant and unlearned viewer to accept his false premise why he does what most so called bible believing people he accuses of doing the same that is taking things out of context br br verse one of hebrews 8 is 1 now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens the context above is clearly speaking of a jesus who was on earth and ascended into heaven after his alleged resurrection br br it has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to take his out of context scripture here he offers a foundation that paul was not aware of a human jesus but only one in heaven br br follow br br lets see if the filmmaker is being honest hebrews 7 14 for it is evident that our lord sprang out of judah of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood br br heh didn't the filmmaker just quote from the writer of hebrews trying to show the writer of that book has no knowledge of a human jesus it's likely anyways paul didn't write hebrews but i will not go into that here but the film maker asserts paul did and that is the premise of the point given here br br it is not like this film maker does not make decent points in certain areas he does but he is engaging in the same blind bias of the religion he is bashing on once he engages in these tactics in my strong opinion he loses credibility as the religion he picks out and the film is no longer a documentary but a personal opinion and a bias of the film maker nothing more nothing less
<START> streisand fans only familiar with her work from the funny girl film onwards need to see this show to see what a brilliant performer streisand was before she achieved her goal of becoming a movie star there had never been a female singer quite like her ever before and there never would be again sorry celine only in your dreams but never again would streisand sing with the vibrancy energy and above all the enthusiasm and vulnerability with which she performs here by the time she gets to that central park concert only 2 or 3 years later she'd been filming funny girl in hollywood and her performing style has become less spontaneous and more reserved more rehearsed and let's face it more angry there's a wall between her and the audience live performing was never what she really enjoyed she did it because she knew it was her ticket to hollywood and once she no longer had to do it she's done it as little as possible and oh that legendary stage fright provides such a good excuse br br her vocals here and on her earlier judy garland show appearance are incredible streisand could truly make an old song sound new again and composers such as richard rodgers and harold arlen loved her for it but by the 1970s streisand was trying to be a rock singer her albums pandering to the younger audiences with over wrought shrieking of songs that were unworthy of her effort or her voice br br in the '80s she came back with that brilliant broadway album but went on and on about what a struggle it was to get it done how they told her not to do it etc oh please when has anyone told streisand what to do she could have been doing good stuff like that all along bringing audiences up to her level instead of stooping to what she thought the young public wanted the back to broadway sequel wasn't nearly as good as streisand seems to feel it necessary to improve on other composers' work if he were alive at the time would richard rodgers have even recognized his own some enchanted evening rodgers notorious for taking singers to task for playing around with his melodies would undoubtedly have been after streisand to sing what he'd written she also blows michael crawford off the cd in their duet of music of the night apparently reminding him just whose cd this is why does she insist on taking songs that are duets and singing them by herself and songs that aren't duets and singing them as duets with someone else who she then goes on to diminish br br supposedly judy garland took streisand aside and advised her don't let them do to you what they did to me advice streisand wasted no time in heeding despite her protestations to the contrary surely it looks like it's always been her way or the highway just imagine she told the cbs brass how her first tv special would be done no guests just her br br but nobody can argue with the results that are so evident here treat yourself to this brilliant musical phenomenon before she was a legend you'll be absolutely amazed at the difference br br ps i watched this again last night 12 01 after not having seen it for many years it was even better than i remembered the 1st act begins with i'm late and includes make believe and how does the wine taste and barbra's homage to childhood i'm five it climaxes as streisand appears with full and i mean full orchestra to sing people she wasn't bored with the song yet and although it's a somewhat shorter rendition it really soars compare it to some of her later auto pilot versions the 2nd act after streisand's kooky schtick patter which hasn't changed much over the years is the famous series of depression songs set amidst the extravagance of bergdorf goodman's br br the 3rd act is the stunner call it streisand the orchestra and the audience although we never see the audience that supposedly witness this historic event with her fear of audiences and dislike of such performing this may have been the toughest part for her but if so to her credit it doesn't show she tears through lover come back to me and the torchy when the sun comes out though i can't remember in which order the poignant why did i choose you one of my all time favorite streisand performances and offers a medley of funny girl songs including of course don't rain on my parade and my favorite song from the score the music that makes me dance explaining that fanny brice sang a song like that in 1922 and it made her the toast of broadway streisand then sings my man and it's almost a dress rehearsal template for her later screen rendition in the funny girl film the main difference being that the black gown here is sleeveless her film gown had long sleeves and against the black background all we saw were her hands and face but the vocal here is more urgent and charged than her later film vocal her performance of the song has everything to do with streisand and nothing to do with fanny brice who of course never sang the song in such an all out manner as streisand does here or in the film see the great ziegfield for a glimpse of brice's more understated version the show ends with streisand singing happy days are here again over the credits br br when it was over i said to the friend i was watching it with she has never ever done anything better br br and she was twenty three years old
<START> monika mitchell's showbiz satire has some laughs and some premeditated violence i wouldn't say blood soaked but there is insult and injury max matteo john cassini is a character actor that has a quirky adaptable presence on screen but he has a terrible track record of being chosen for the parts he goes after there is always a producer's nephew or seemingly trivial reason for his not being awarded the role he seeks well the best thing to do is get rid of the competition max becomes obsessed with such thoughts the rewarding career is just a swing push and shot away other cast members rene rivera molly parker jennifer beals frank cassini and cameos by eric roberts and sandra oh well that's show business or is it
