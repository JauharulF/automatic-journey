<START> the lack of content in this movie amazed me the most first i though that people was going to compare this to rock on but i'm really surprised myself to say that this was worst than rock on so so story horrible cast ajay devgan jamming with salman khan and asin you gotta be kidding me the music was okay khanabadosh was the track of the movie the rest was bad vipul shah hasn't still learn from singh is king's critically bashed comedy now asin where do she come from sorry for asin's fan out there but she suck d big time in this movie seriously bad acting she didn't look good at all overdose of make up my final verdict go watch aladin with your family instead wasting your time here
<START> this film was just absolutly brilliant it actually made me think during the whole movie i was confused as hell i loved everything about it it was just so confusing and so twisted and weird it was hard not to love it all of the actors were phenominal and no one could have done a better job this is one of my favorites of the year it deserves an ocar
<START> of course the original is better but this isn't as bad as everyone says yes it is made up into 3 stories but hey so what i thought it was quite good to be honest i actually liked how anastasia changed a little when she fell in love it shows what love can do the stories were not so bad either br br i liked cinderella's voice better in this too i have nothing against her voice in the original but i just think it sounds better here more nicer i liked her personality in this too she had more of a backbone yet she was still kind br br so i'll give cinderella ii dreams come true a 7 10
<START> if you would like to see a film of different kind if you feel the love in your heart even if you miss the lord this film makes you think although georges is mentally handicapped you can see the ultimate intelligence at the end when love gives you directions not the brain i am not emotional but this film makes you feel the human being the film is as good as forrest gump in my belief the foreign movies are sometimes more interesting yet there is not enough advertisement to make them popular rang e khoda the color of the god by majid majidi is another example of such foreign movies almost with similar taste
<START> this is a haunting powerful italian adaptation of james m cain's novel the postman always rings twice directed by the great luchino visconti what is so interesting about the film is that in every way it transcends it's source material to become something bolder and more original interestingly camus also credits cain's novel as the key inspiration for his landmark novel the stranger the film has a greater power and intensity than the novel because visconti is able to create the filmic equivalent of cain's narrative structure but offer a more complex exploration of gender cain's very american novel is also uncritically fascinated with the construction of whiteness the lead character cora is obsessively afraid she will be identified as a mexican and embarrassed that she married a greek immigrant which is not relevant to the italian rural context that visconti is working in this allows the class antagonisms to take center stage and dance among the embers of the passionate doomed love affair of the two main characters this film is a complex suspenseful rewarding experience
<START> wow watching this film today you can't help but be appalled by the writing of this film spencer tracy and loretta young play a couple who in modern times might be featured on the jerry springer show as they have a sick and abusive relationship and inexplicably the writers appear to be endorsing it br br the film begins with a hungry and homeless loretta being shown the ropes by the poor but very resourceful spencer tracy he shows her how by conniving you can do very well with little money and takes her home to his shack to stay it's never clear whether or not they marry and considering it's a pre code film you can assume they aren't even though they are cohabiting their relationship is very strange and rather sick while you can see that tracy cares about her by his actions he is verbally abusive and a total jerk and young comes running back for more like some sort of dog he calls her skinny or ugly and these are in a sick way his way of using endearments later when he starts fooling around with another woman glenda farrell she tells her friend that if that's what he wants it's okay with her it sure smacks of a sado masochistic relationship and you can't help but feel a bit horrified sure he doesn't hit her but the relationship is very abusive to show how sick it is when young gets pregnant she tells him it's your baby and it's mine but you don't need to worry i'll take all the blame for it yikes doesn't this all seem a bit like looking through a peephole into a sick and dysfunctional home later in a case of art imitating life tracy proves what sort of man he is and disappears after all he can't be burdened with a baby even if it's his but he changes his mind and decides to return home wow that's bit of him and when he returns he's nasty and acts like if he stays he isn't obligated to care for the kid and she tells him he's a free man free as a bird wow i was almost in tears at this tender moment not soon this crazy pair are married and naturally young is depressed because he seems to be staying as long as it suits him not because of any love or sense of responsibility so how can you salvage anything with this sort of sick characters what would you do well as for the writers they have tracy soon commit a robbery to help pay for the brat the romantic aspects of the film are underwhelming to say the least during the robbery tracy behaves like a chump doing almost nothing to take precautions not to get caught like he was secretly hoping to get sent to prison and to show what sort of nice guy he is the guy he tries to rob is one of his best friends br br while there's more to the film the bottom line is that tracy is a jerk and young is an idiot in the film despite both being very good actors there's absolutely no way they could make anything of this crap the writers produced nice music nice sets good acting and a script that is 100 poo how the film is currently rated 7 4 is beyond me and i wonder how anyone can ignore the pure awfulness of the characters a horrible misfire that somehow didn't destroy the careers of those involved br br oh and if you wonder if loretta ever gets a backbone in this film or plays a person who is the least bit strong the answer is no by the end she's learned nothing and hasn't changed one whit for the better br br they sure don't make films like they used to and in this case thank god
<START> speaking solely as a movie i didn't really liked it not because there were no fx or because we had a single cabin as the scenario for the whole film actually that was what kept me watching it br br i didn't like it because the acting was shady his friends are all happy and then they're mad but you have no idea why then they take distinct roles one is the believer other is the antagonist but they never really make the point also the lighting was terrible and i'm just mentioning technical issues br br in a few words i thing the movie could have just had a ok i'm outta here from some characters like the lady who doesn't want to hear his version of the bible br br about the story itself everyone is free to write about what they want and the story is proof of some good writing and imagination i credit the book author for that hence my 4 10 br br so in the end hear the man's story believe it or not just don't spend the whole time acting like you believe him and being shocked at what he says and at the same time moving around and making jokes like you don't believe him br br coherence br br thanks for reading
<START> letters with no destination end up in another world found in the back rooms of the post office here alice manages to land a job in hope of finding her lost father what she does discover is the tormented soul of her boss frank a quiet little aussie flic that came and went at the cinema now you find it in the deep dark corner of the video shop overshadowed by fifty copies of that dreaded godzilla film it's a shame because this turned out to be a satisfying film telling a brave tale with strong simple images and effective performances from the two leads this film succeeds where garry marshall's other dead letter office flic dear god 1996 usa failed and comes close to the brilliance of not the kevin costner turkey but he jianjun's postman 1995 china
<START> if you're watching this without an inkling of an idea what the story is about then you're in for quite the surprise even then the synopsis has painted a picture of a rather sane storyline but the actual film is anything but br br as the synopsis went it tells of an obsessed mountain climber which you'll see as the prologue before the opening credits and text crawl which tells you of the presence of chronopolis an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind note to self Â this spells trouble with flashing lights where its inhabitants are immortals yearning for a change in their omnipresence they can see our world and notice of all persons this mountain climber and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy creating an intelligent sphere to meet the man br br what that translated to is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5 year old kid could produce have shapes created though credit goes to the stop motion style and put it through a mind numbing loop and repeat until your eyes start to close then move on to the next scene if anything the chonopolisians if this term exists really love their sticks and balls constantly playing at conjuring up that magical sphere and having a field day playing with it before releasing it to the other world it gets no better as well when the man interacts with the sphere in yet another hypnotically boring and sleep inducing sequence br br thank goodness of course that the run time is shorter than what's advertised which is 57 minutes or less against the 70 stated while firmly dated its dull colours non existent story scratchy soundtrack and repetitive pictures will win over no fans don't waste time
<START> homeward bound the incredible journey is one of those wonderful old movies about house pets deserves a place among the great movies of its genre and even the cinema world in general together with other animal movies like old yeller napoleon fluke and air bud this means it is more than just a movie about pets br br can this possibly be just a remake it is too good to be a remake i know this one by heart since my early teen years when i was 12 br br it's a family movie to treasure it's emotional thrilling adventurous exciting entertaining humorous charming sweet nostalgic beautiful heartwarming and sometimes dramatic it's one of those movies to put a smile on the faces of those who appreciate this kind of films br br this movie does not lack qualities it has a well thought story enjoyable characters excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack dazzling sceneries landscapes of the magnificent sierra mountains in oregon speaking of the vistas it's not all mountains forests trees rivers waterfalls sunsets in conclusion all of pure nature's wonders truly a full panorama br br the main human characters are nice well developed and well portrayed by respective actors robert hays is awesome as the kind hearted dad bob seaver kim greist is good as laura burnford veronica lauren is equally good as hope kevin chevalia is conventional as the youngest and cute brother jamie his appearance actually reminds me very much of kevin corcoran in old yeller benj thall is great as peter burnford br br when it comes to our quadruped pals shadow is my favorite shadow is the loyal wise mature beautiful caring and loving old golden retriever brilliantly voiced by don ameche chance the american bulldog is the opposite of shadow he is carefree silly impatient anxious clumsy hilarious and loves to play voiced by the talented michael j fox chance just can't stand still sassy is the epitome of cats's image elegant independent very confident and self proud with a typical cat attitude but with a certain feline charm sassy is a seal point himalayan cat one of the most beautiful cat breeds sassy is voiced by sally field who also does a good job br br our four legged friends are themselves great actors by nature ben as shadow rattler as chance and tiki as sassy br br it's an underrated movie but a classic by its own right its sequel is clearly inferior br br this should definitely be on top 250
<START> as a child the first installment the little mermaid was my favorite movie it was filled with great characters songs and a fun family film a week or so again i watched this movie for the first time i believe that this movie was like most sequels and didn't surpass their original i think that i feel this way possibly because i had high expectations and i have grown up however it is not a bad film br br it starts when ariel has just given birth to a beautiful child melody eric and ariel feel threatened by morgana eurselas' sister so they build a large wall around their house which lies on the sea as melody grows up she begins to wonder outside of the walls where she is forbidden to go trouble stirs up as morgana tries to take control of the seven seas br br i don't want to give away any of the movie so you have to see it to find out i did like that the voices are the same and again wonderful singing i think this is a good family film though overall
<START> chris rock deserves better than he gives himself in down to earth as directed by brothers chris paul weitz of american pie fame this uninspired remake of warren beatty's 1978 fantasy heaven can wait itself a rehash of 1941's here comes mr jordan lacks the abrasively profane humor that won chris rock an emmy for his first hbo special predictably he spouts swear words from a to z but he consciously avoids the f word anybody who saw this gifted african american comic in lethal weapon 4 dogma or nurse betty knows he can elicit more laughter with the f word than martin lawrence and eddie murphy put together sadly despite a few witty one liners down to earth hits rock bottom both as a contrived comedy and an improbable interracial romance br br down to earth utterly destroys any good will that the weitz brothers generated with their landmark gross out face american pie this disposable drivel qualifies as a contrived as well as confusing comedy with a thoroughly improbable color blind interracial romance unfortunately a more than competent castÂamong them the full monty's mark addy chazz palminteri of analyze this sctv's eugene levy and newcomer brian rhodes as charles wellington jr Âare wasted in flat footed sketchy roles hardcore rock fans will undoubtedly accuse their favorite comedian with trying to fix something that was never broken abysmally written by lance crouther ali le roi louis ck and rock down to earth casts chris as a messenger who rides a bike by day in the big apple and gets booed off the stage at night in harlem's celebrated apollo theatre poor lance barton chris rock suffers from severe stage fright nevertheless his charitable manager whitney daniels frankie faison of hannibal sticks with him through thick and thin after lance learns the apollo theatre will hold one final amateur night extravaganza he implores whitney to get him in the line up excuse me but if lance is such a deadbeat stand up comic why does the apollo keep inviting him back meanwhile fate has something else in store for lance while pedaling home on his bike our protagonist spots a pretty lady sontee regina king of jerry maguire crossing the street but he doesn't see the bus that collides with him and kills him wham lance barton levitates skyward with a halo wreathed around his head in heaven which resembles a cruise ship nightclub lance learns that an overzealous angel mr keyes eugene levy of stay tuned timed his death 40 years ahead of schedule br br heavenly honcho mr king chazz palminteri of analyze this god's right hand guy apologizes and escorts lance back to earth the snag is lance cannot reclaim his corpse so he must inhabit another body the best that mr keyes can come up with is ruthless white 60 year old tycoon charles wellington wellington's adulterous wife amber jennifer coolidge of american pie and his unscrupulous personal aide winston greg germann of sweet november have just tried to poison him reluctantly before wellington's body vanishes lance accepts it conditionally as a loaner until keyes can locate a more appropriate body meanwhile lance as wellington encounters sontee again she is a nurse activist protesting his decision to privatize a brooklyn community hospital that serves the poor while regina king brings a surfeit of charisma to her role as a crusading health care worker she plays a character who bypasses credible motivation in her affairs with wellington although he is no longer black lance not only tries to woo sontee but also win a gig at the apollo br br down to earth features rock in his most unfunny role the comedian's reason for making this movie seems questionable reportedly he ate lunch with warren beatty and told beatty that he loved the original script that scenarist elaine may had penned for beatty initially beatty tried the race reversal gimmick himself in his own version by trying to cast muhammad ali in the title role of heaven can wait the deal fell through and beatty headlined the movie himself according to rock his longtime co writers and he thought that they could 'annihilate' this classic moreover he justified his choice of heaven can wait based on his philosophy to do something you can only do when you're hot earlier rock rejected a script about a busload of touring rappers because he saw little opportunity to stretch his image in such an outing as a lifeless comedian in down to earth rock doesn't so much stretch his image as he inverts it for the worst this half baked concert film with an annoying plot does as much to cremate his comic reputation as it does the weitz brothers you know a film about a comedian is in dire straits when a scene at the nightclub is played so you cannot hear the jokes only the laughter similarly the casting of mark addy as wellington's butler who speaks the queen's english but is in reality a commoner from michigan defies logic too addy is an actual englishman and he doesn't have to fake an accent his accent is genuine the major overriding quandary with down to earth is the on again off again look a like switcheroo that the characters make so chris rock doesn't disappear completely from the sight for more than a few seconds although chris spends half the movie as white guy wellington audiences see him largely as lance undercutting the comic irony of watching his stocky bald headed caucasian white alter ego perform ghetto humor and chant derogatory hip hop lyrics incredibly rock served double duty as the film's executive producer and one of its four scribes the mystery is how such a wealth of talent could grind out such an awkward misguided muddle of a comedy about the only redeeming feature of down to earth is jamshied sharifi's superb orchestral film score
<START> unfortunately for sarah silverman this show doesn't compliment her at all the character isn't even remotely likable and it's not a situation where you think oh she's such i b tch i love her just she's such a b tch this character is just a plain old self righteous mean b tch sarah seems to struggle to have to carry this show because she's the only semi funny one in it the mood the dialogue it's all so damn boring and dry it's like listening to your grandpa go on and on about the marbles he collected as a kid br br the sarah silverman program is so unbelievably boring that i was thinking of changing the channel to watch old repeats of married with children something that is funny because the characters are so immoral and rude i'm sorry but i don't find a show packed with dry humour and corny off the wall story lines about some angry bitter loser's angry bitter life with her annoying as hell sister and gay friends who sound like keanu reeves with a cold anywhere close to funny i can't stand this show even though generally i find sarah silverman to be that i love her cause she's such a b tch character like in school of rock and most of her stand up i think this show is boring with characters who think being mean and saying and doing things for shock value eg the constant pube diarrhea and hit in general for laughs the sarah silverman program attempts to be funny and fails it either needs a laugh track or better writers someone compared it to south park but it's not even close i've expressed my opinions on the sarah silverman program and won't become an annoying troll meaning you won't see me being a b tch and constantly posting stuff like this show sucks and why isn't this cancelled yet i don't like the sarah silverman program if you do enjoy
<START> considering the original film version of 'the haunting is in my top ten films of all time' i approached this adaption with trepidation i was right to be cautious as this film is a poorly written and badly executed load of old tosh all those involved should be ashamed the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason you see nothing robert wise used innovative camera work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it work's the shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from a to b sadder still is that the ingredients were there actors such as liam neeson catherine zeta jones to do something different this film should only watched as an example of studio butchery
<START> although recognized as the best film treatment of the difficulties of having a house in the country built or bought to your specifications it is not the first nor the last in 1940 jack benny and ann sheridan were the leads in the film version of the comedy george washington slept here by george s kaufman and moss hart and about fifteen years ago shelly long and tom hanks had the lead in the money pit the former was about moving into an 18th century country house that err needs work the latter was about building your dream house in the late 1980s although the two films have their moments both are not as good as blandings which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name br br jim blandings and his wife muriel cary grant and myrna loy are noticing the tight corners of their apartment which they share with their two daughters joan and betsy sharyn moffett and connie marshall although blandings has a good income as an advertising executive in 1948 he is making 15 000 00 a year which was like making 90 000 00 today and lives in a luxury apartment which in the new york city of that day he rents he feels they should seek something better he and muriel take a drive into the country connecticut and soon find an old ruin that both imagine can be fixed up as that dream house they want br br and they both fall into the financial worm hole that buying land and construction can lead to for one thing they are so gung ho about the idea of building a home like this they fail to heed warning after warning by their wise if cynical friend and lawyer bill cole melvin douglas in a nicely sardonic role for example jim buys land from a connecticut dealer ian wolfe sucking his chops quietly with a check before double checking the correct cost for the land in that part of connecticut bill points out he's paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it is worth there are problems about water supply that both blandings just never think about such as hard and soft water which leads to the zis zis water softening machine they find that the designs they have in mind and have worked out with their architect reginald denny can't be dropped cheaply at a spur of the moment decision by muriel to build a little rookery that nobody planned for br br the escalating costs of the project are one matter that bedevils jim he has been appointed to handle the wham account spam had become a popular result of world war ii in that the public started using it as a meat substitute in the light of it's success with the armed forces jim can't get a grip on this he's not alone one or two other executives fumbled it before him he comes up with the following bit of poetry br br this little piggy went to market br br he was pink and as pretty as ham br br he smiled in his tracks br br as they gave him the ax br br he knew he would end up as wham br br his secretary looks at him as though he needs a straight jacket when he reads that one br br jim also is increasingly suspicious of the attentions of bill to muriel although in this case bill is blameless but he's always around jim keeps forgetting that bill is the clearheaded one and that he's keeping jim and muriel from making so many mistakes all three have mishaps the best being when they get locked in a room in the half constructed house just as the men have left for the day they can't open the door and jim in a panic tries breaking the door down by a make shift battering ram he breaks a window and the door opens by itself br br the film works quite satisfactorily with all of the actors apparently enjoying themselves it is one film which despite changing price levels and salary levels really does not age at all after all most americans dream of owning their own home and always have br br a number of years ago a paint company made use of a delightful scene with myrna loy and emory parnell regarding the paint job parnell's company has to do on the various rooms she carefully shows the distinct shades of red blue etc she wants even giving a polite parnell a single thread for the right shade of blue the commercials hinted that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from for your paint job they proudly called loy mrs blandings in the commercials' introduction you can imagine though how the no nonsense parnell handles the situation afterward when loy leaves him with his paint crew
<START> i read several mixed reviews and several of them downright trashed the movie i originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by tony scott and i have become very interested in his work after man on fire had such a profound impact on me before i start my review let me first say this it's wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner yet the writers and scott chose a different approach br br plot br br simply stated it's not boring most hollywood movies give 'tried and true' plots that they know will connect with people often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while just for reference i recently watched 'the weather man' and 'lord of war' and while i will say that these movies are excellent and i enjoyed them both tremendously both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told they don't take any chances whatsoever and they are extremely predictable after you've watched a fair amount of american films domino's plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking oh man they're screwed now and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films it has a lot of depth to it in my opinion and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it overall this is what kept me so interested in the movie br br characters br br i felt that the characters were accurate knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that br br choco was also very believable his use of spanish in inappropriate situations his reactions to domino's lack of affection as well as his jealousy issues within the team they all rang true to me which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic br br rourke's character was the least interesting to me but it still rang true to me he seemed like an ordinary guy trying to make ends meet i hope that's what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that's what i got out of it he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes yet is still trying to live br br claremont ladies i believe that they provided much needed 'heart' to the story they weren't just people who are out getting money to buy a bentley these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal you could empathize with them because to them this child's illness was a problem with no other solution these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help br br the mobsters they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can and i really liked that part they also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting br br christopher walken 90210 guys br br they provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie from walken's awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the 90210 guys being has beens their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable br br cinematography yes the cinematography this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans but in my opinion i thought it was genius the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement just like anything else i both applaud and congratulate scott the editor the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie not only did they go far and above with its presentation they went that much further the use of colors both extremely light and extremely dark provided the 'look' of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isn't as peachy or 'clean' as everyone else if you notice in times of less stress or conflict there were very few camera tricks if any at all this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren't just doing it for the heck of it i realize that most people who watched this movie weren't expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach hollywood films have grown predictable and bland most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns and i'm glad that scott tried to make something different br br granted this movie isn't for everyone but to say it's trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point i thoroughly enjoyed this film and i'm glad that i spent the money for it i would recommend this to all but i'm sure it will only hit a chord with few i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the 'sphere of mtv' won't appreciate this movie but i think many people will we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique and with that in mind i think he succeeded tremendously
<START> these type of movies about young teenagers struggling with their own sexuality were something unique and daring and daring a couple of years ago but more and more movies like this got made over the past few years making it hard for the movies to still stand out really br br also this movie received little publicity aside from the usual little film festivals that featured this little french movie as well as the big festivals that are always fond of these type of little movies about everyday subjects that aren't being handled too often in movies the film premiered at cannes in 2007 and actually won some awards there as well br br the movie doesn't really stand out from others since it actually features little new once you've already seen some similar movies such as this one but this however really doesn't mean that naissance des pieuvres is a bad one to watch the movie is certainly a good watch that handles its subject well and tells its story steadily and therefore also effectively in a typical somewhat slow french cinematic pace br br it's a coming of age movie that focus on the life of mainly 3 totally different mid teenagers sexuality is a big theme within the movie which gets handled delicately and subtle it makes the movie and its story overall a pretty realistic one though perhaps a bit predictable since the movie doesn't quite offer anything original enough within its genre br br this type of french movie will probably scare off a lot of people because of the reason that they probably expect it to be very arty with deep layers and meanings to it naissance des pieuvres however is a very accessible movie for everyone and you really don't have to be into euro teen movies to appreciate this movie it's a sweet and somewhat sensual kind of movie due to its subject and visual approach br br the movie is also being made realistic by its actors who don't had and have a lot of experience within the movie business but are authentic looking and feeling within their roles the strong individual characters provide the movie with some nice themes and good moments br br a good movie on its subject br br 7 10
<START> this may be one of the worst movies to ever make it to production ever br br 1 the most exciting part is the beginning where the guy is walking and walking and walking spoiler there is about 15 minutes of just walking how br br 2 not to mention there's a lot of issues with the lighting and it's almost like they even shot the night scenes during the day br br 3 the acting was terrible it looks like they found a community theater in mexico and then took the people who were turned away br br please for the love of everything holy don't rent this movie if you know someone who owns it apologize to them the director should be subject to punishment through the war crimes tribunal for foisting this on the public
<START> i am not saying that night of the twisters was horrible but it was far from great mediocre at absolute best i seems though that every time one type of movie is released a second must be around the same time think about armageddon and deep impact volcano and dante's peak night of the twisters is really just twister except worse and with mundane special effects br br i have nothing against the actors who starred in it even if they weren't great it was the movie itself the directing the special effects the whole storyline was just too strange to interpret a series of tornadoes strike a town and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage br br i really don't know why it seems as though duplicates of disaster movies are released almost in sync with each other but this one would have been better with bill paxton and helen hunt
<START> i disagree strongly with anyone who might dismiss this film as just entertainment set right after the carefree roaring 20s during the early days of the great depression dance fools dance is at its heart an earnest cautionary tale with a clear message about how best to endure these hard times yet this fast paced and tightly plotted film is far from being a dreary morality tale br br in the 30s hollywood had a knack for churning out one entertaining and enlightening audience pleaser after another all without wasting a frame of film dance fools dance one of four films that harry beaumont directed in 1931 is barely 80 minutes long yet its characters are well developed its story never seems rushed and despite its many twists in plot the audience is never left behind br br with the lone exception of lester vail as flaccid love interest bob townsend the supporting cast is uniformly strong worthy of note are william bakewell as crawford's brother cliff edwards best known as the voice of jiminy cricket as reporter bert scranton and clark gable in an early supporting role as gangster jake luva br br but this is joan crawford's film and she absolutely shines in it made when she was just 27 this lesser known version of crawford will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with her later work however here is proof that long before she took home an oscar for mildred pierce crawford was a star in the true sense of the word a terrific actress with the charisma to carry a picture all by herself br br score eight out of ten
