<START> after reading the other reviews for this film i am of the opinion that the high markers are probably paid studio lackeys as the film i saw was absolutely dire with wooden acting lacklustre scripting and plodding predictable directing one of the few plus points has to be the stunning scenery as this film features some stunning backdrops with great sweeping vistas and dramatic skies and wide open prairies sadly when the most memorable thing in a film is the part featured behind the actors this has to be a warning sign as to the quality of the movie all in all a thoroughly uninspiring addition to the western genre which even at the very reasonable price it can be obtained on dvd is best to avoid
<START> ok first of all i am a huge zombie movie fan i loved all of romero's flicks and thoroughly enjoyed the re make of dawn of the dead so when i had heard every single critic railing this movie i was still optimistic i mean critics hated resident evil and while it may not be a particularly great film i enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shoot em up with a half decent plot this however is pure crap terrible dialogue half assed plot and video game scenes inserted into the film who in their right mind thought that was a good idea the only thing about this movie i use the term loosely that i enjoyed was jurgen prochnow as captain kirk ugh while his name throws originality out the window you can see in his performance that he knows he's in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it everyone else acts as if they're doing shakespeare and very badly i might add basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a are a huge zombie buff and must see every zombie flick made or b like to play mst3k the home game see it with friends and be prepared for tons of unintentional laughs br br
<START> i stopped short of giving mr blandings builds his dream house 10 10 due to an aspect that makes us in the 21st century cringe a little bit the fact that a black person is the faithful servant somewhat reminiscent of stepin fetchit but other than that the movie's a hoot portraying middle class new york couple jim cary grant and muriel blandings myrna loy trying to build a house in connecticut this flick has something for everyone br br grant is his usual flippant self while loy does quite well as merely a wife but melvyn douglas adds some real laughs as jim's and muriel's lawyer bill cole who seems to have more plans than he's making clear as for the house itself throughout most of the movie you'll probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there the builders contractors and others also provide their fair share of laughs br br all in all a comedy classic also starring louise beavers reginald denny sharyn moffett connie marshall and jason robards sr
<START> only seen season 1 so far but this is just great a wide variety of people stuck on a island nobody are who they seem to be and everybody seems to have loads of skeletons in their closets it sounds like melrose place meets the crusoe family and why is that so great it probably is not but then ad a spoon full of x files a dose of what and a big hey and a island that is everything you ever dreamed of in your freakiest nightmares and you'll be lost to the story got so many twists and turns it is unbelievable great set up solid acting with a liberating acceptance that at the end of the everybody is human well almost everybody i think with good and bad sides but weird oh so weird
<START> as big as a texas prairie and equally as boring even liz taylor james dean chill wills and dennis hopper can't float this overbloated boat taylor actually looks bad wrong wardrobe wrong hair and wrong makeup a unique accomplishment in her remarkable career hopper gives the only believable performance and dean in the climactic scene displays remarkable talent as something we usually don't remember him for a comic actor rock hudson is his usual prototype of barbie doll ken and makes one wonder what a say redford could have done with the male lead there is no discernible plot that provides any tension until the final twenty minutes just a pastiche of milestones that have little relationship to each other except for hopper there is no character development only a collection of cardboard cutouts that pop up periodically for no discernible reason like random targets in a shooting gallery to its credit the film does tackle racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects and it does have size making it an excellent choice for ridding yourself of unwelcome house guests those with the dvd version can spare themselves some of the tedium by starting with the second disk you won't be missing anything of interest
<START> stumbling upon this hbo special late one night i was absolutely taken by this attractive british executive transvestite i have never laughed so hard over european history or any of the other completely worthwhile point eddie izzard made i laughed so much that i woke up my mother sleeping at the other end of the house
<START> this is a complete hoax br br the movie clearly has been shot in north western indian state of rajasthan look at the chase scene the vehicles are indian the writing all over is hindi language used in india the drive through is on typical jaipur streets also the palace is in amer about 10 miles from jaipur rajasthan the film makers in their about the film in dvd bonus seem to make it sound that they risked their lives shooting in kabul and around almost all of their action scenes are shot in india the scene where they see a group singing around fire is so fake that they did not even think about changing it to afgani folk song they just recorded the rajasthani folk song how do i know it because i have traveled that area extensively they are just on the band wagon to make big on the issue i do challenge the film makers to deny it
<START> david and bathsheba is a lavish hollywood biblical picture produced out of 20th century fox by darryl f zanuck directed by henry king and starring gregory peck king david susan hayward bathsheba raymond massey nathan kieron moore uriah and jayne meadows michal br br the film is based around the second old testament book of samuel from the holy bible it follows king david who as a child had slain the giant goliath and now we find him in adulthood as the second king of israel a tough and assured king david however has affairs of the heart causing great problems for once he spies bathsheba taking a shower re bath it 's the start of a journey encompassing adultery and betrayal a journey that will end in the judgement of god being called upon br br typically for the genre david bathsheba is a large grandiose production from its excellent set designs to it's positively gorgeous technicolor photography leon shamroy it has enough quality to warrant sitting along side the best the genre has to offer as regards production values untypically tho the film is sedately paced and relies on 99 of its worth being driven purely by dialogue this is not one for action fans or anyone who needs some swash to go with their buckle this is a very humanist picture in fact lets not beat around the burning bush here it's a biblical love story flecked with sins of the heart but that is no bad thing at all because breaking it down we find it's very well acted peck has a stoic yet vulnerable thing going on real well hayward is pushing it to the max and it be a fine story directed with knowing skill by the often forgotten henry king and although some of the dialogue is admittedly cringe inducing the character flow is never interrupted as phillip dunne's the ghost and mrs muir oscar nominated screenplay holds the attention throughout br br sometimes a forgotten picture in terms of the biblical swords sandals genres most likely because it is a talky piece that has heart as its main selling point but really it's well worth the time of anyone interested in the most lavish of genres 7 10
<START> jim mckay has made one of the best films you will see all year the quiet simplicity of this film draws you in from the opening shot and never lets go there is not one false note in the entire film not one everything works the hand held camera is never distracting and always where it should be the three young ladies whose lives we follow are always real there isn't a single beat where the audience is reminded we are looking at actresses performing a role these are just real girls trying to find themselves there is no political agenda hidden or otherwise this is cinema at its most basic and although it will probably only be seen by a handful of movie goers it deserves a much wider release a special hats off to hugh hefner for providing the film makers with the grant money needed to get this important film made i can't wait to see what mr mckay does next
<START> if there is one film which is the worst of this year it's tashan the first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring dhoom 2 style film and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe because of it being a yashraj film or maybe seeing the cheesy promo but this film gave me a shock it was even worst then dhoom 2 and what i expected first saif's introduction which is boring then saif kareena meet kareena is so artificial and then anil kapoor oh god what he is doing in such a weird film what kinda role it is what acting is he doing his first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts then came akshay who provided some nice scenes but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff childhood romance overdose of childish rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes the ending is another joke br br vijay krishna acharya would have got 3 films more to direct if this film had worked thats the strategy of yashraj only money nothing else so vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers music vishal shekhar is ordinary br br performances akshay kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air he actually provides some engaging moments saif ali khan is irritating kareena is equally bad anil kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more rest are okay
<START> for me this is ealing studio's most perfect film as fresh and relevant half a century later as it was the day it was released br br as a satire on economic notions of 'growth' and the commercial need for in built obsolescence it could scarcely be more up to the minute and of what other film can it be said that the hero literally wears the plot br br oddly there are parallels with jurassic park in which messing with the environment will literally turn round and bite you but spielberg shied away from the book's brilliant central conceit to tack on some nonsense about 'children' hmmm br br in the man in the white suit alec guiness plays an idealistic young scientist who comes up with a cloth that never gets dirty and never wears out suddenly workers and capital at the northern english mill where he is working are united as never before in protection of their livelihoods br br of course being ealing it's a comedy but it needn't have been the complex interplay of vested should that be suited interests plays out beautifully as one by one all parties realize that 'progress' is a threat and that disposability and waste are what keep the looms turning br br but yes this is a comedy albeit a pointed one and amid the political ironies are delicious performances and some good old fashioned knock about laughs br br nonetheless it's the biting satire that endures dazzling and white
<START> i have seen just about all of miyazaki's films and they are all beautiful and captivating but this one rises above the rest this movie totally impressed me br br i fell in love with pazu and sheeta and their sweet caring friendship they were what made the movie for me of course the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings in the film perfectly but the characters are the shining point in this movie they are so well developed and full of personality br br now let me clarify i'm really talking about the japanese version of the movie with english subs while the english dub is good mostly it simply pales in comparison to the original language version the voices are better the dialogue everything so i suggest seeing and hearing the movie the way it originally was
<START> the only thing that kept me from vomiting after seeing this movie was the fact that these are just actors and not the freak show that usually appears on the tv show this is also the main reason that fans of the tv show won't like the movie but not the only reason this movie has about as much entertainment value as getting a root canal it approaches the abyssmal depths of bad movie making and then gets even worse i won't waste your time describing this movie in further detail suffice it to say that i pity the poor camera people who had to suffer through watching this c p the first time
<START> if you went to this movie to see some huge academy award presentation oh well but if you wanted to see a funny delightful adaptation of an old classic you will love it jim carey was incredible as usual the story line was great a few parts added like the history of the grinch made it even better ron howard never misses a beat but although there were a few adult comments and cleavage added this is supped to be a kids or family show try not to lose sight of that if you do you really wont enjoy the movie and as for the comments about ron howard try to direct a major motion picture and see how you do its not easy as it looks
<START> this low budget b horror's plot comes with all the amenities mad scientist complete with sidekick malicious corporate greed of pharmaceutical industry eccentric and extreme genetic engineering and information technology can't leave that out br br start with strange sequence of hot looking nameless boaters that foolishly decide to take a dip in the waters near an uncharted island and end up chum for swarming hammerhead sharks br br cut to weak back story implying the stock decline of a generic pharma corporation which motivates its wicked shakespeare quoting ceo to entertain an un solicited offer made by a former employee scientist that was jilted out of his job as head of research and who also happens to be a nut of course total herbert west wannabe he is offering up a new stem cell technology that could make tons o' cash or so it seems this lures in several employees to his moreau ish island must have been quite an impressive exit package from the company when he was let go for him to afford an island to validate his scientific findings including the ceo and co incidentally the ex fiancÃ© of the mad scientist's son now morphed sharkuman how convenient br br the plan sort of is to rekindle lost love between the former nuptials while exacting revenge on the former colleagues for his termination sheez how can this guy be bitter he has his own friggen' island after all br br soon everyone is on the run from endless supply of security guards toting heavy weaponry from mutant plants Â can there be an uncharted island without man eating plants from sharky son's appetite for carnage from quack daddy's breeding plans and from lack of a cell phone signal and they all must learn to work together to get off the island alive br br will anyone escape will a new species be created watch it and find out br br there is some entertainment value in this movie but don't expect much for the true combs fan this is not to be missed br br don't say i didn't warn you
<START> the stranger jack matthew lillard arrives in the studio of the crook collector of antiques max vincent d'onofrio and tells his ambitious companion and specialist in poisons jamie valeria golino that he is jack's brother jamie does not buy his story dominates jack and ties him up to a chair when max arrives jack proposes us 100 000 00 for each one to protect him in a negotiation of the antiques spanish judges with a wealthy and dangerous collector max invites his stupid acquaintance piece mark boone junior who comes with his retarded girlfriend that believes she is from mars to compose the backup team however jack double crosses the collector and then he intrigues jack jamie and piece br br the low budget spanish judges is a movie with a reasonable screenplay with an awful conclusion that wastes a good cast valeria golino is astonishingly beautiful but together with the good actor vincent d'onofrio they are not able to save the stupid story further the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not work and actually they are silly and not funny my vote is three br br title brazil tudo por dinheiro all for money
<START> this is one of those films that's more interesting to watch from an academic perspective than from an entertainment perspective i do my ratings based on how much i enjoyed or was entertained by the movie so i'm giving it a 4 if i were to rate it as an academic film though it would get a 10 br br it is shot in a very interesting manner like a pseudo silent film with elements of sound effect and reality it's meant to convey disjointed memory and fragmentation of the mind and it is interesting in these respects br br however the film has a lot of disgusting elements to it that i didn't find all that entertaining they're mainly just disturbing it has some very interesting imagery too and some interesting concepts but some of the character relationships especially between the mother and son are pretty disturbing br br in all this film will either appeal to you or it won't for me it was interesting from an academic perspective but it wasn't a good watch and i'll probably not go back to it a second time br br 4 10 if you're looking for entertainment 10 10 from an academic standpoint
<START> this really is one of the worst movies ever made i consider myself a huge zombie film fan and usually tolerate bad acting lame special effects a dumb story and whatever you may encounter in second rate movies as long as the film has a good atmosphere story suspension or whatever to offer this one has basically no positive aspect to it and is third or fourth rate maybe worse some friends of mine and myself made a small movie during a weekÂ´s holiday and definitely did a better job no zombie film though br br this flick is not even funny not speaking of anything else really bad and redundant special effects zombies that look like normal people except for a white additional skin pulled over their faces way to much fake blood i like realism a lot the combination of realism and zombie films being debatable but the presented gore is just plain silly the camera stays quite long with feedings scenes it gets boring and you cannot help but wonder why the zombies use weapons to kill their prey i will not go into the details of the dubbing others have done so although i am from germany myself and am at least a bit curious about the original version i will not waste more of my time with this movie br br keep away from it as far as you can
<START> this film is an absolute classic for camp that is why it was an elvira and mst3000 classic everyone knows the story scientist keeps his girlfriend's head alive in a lasagna pan in his basement while he cruises town and tries to find her a body by checking out the local chicks finally he finds a real hourglass body with a scar faced chick's head on top the severed head makes friends with the failed experiment in the closet and the conehead comes out of the closet and rips off the assistant's remaining good arm his other is not right from a scientist's earlier failure and the whole place burns down br br the movie scared us so much as kids that my friend wouldn't go into his basement for a year after seeing it as kids we ranked the scariest movies of all time and this one was number four only one of those scary movies was really any good the original the haunting br br i had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle when the scientist looks for the bodies complete with porno sound track scares the hell out of innocent children while the ridiculous aspects make it prime material for watching talking and laughing i could watch this film tonight and enjoy it while i'd rather go to the dentist than watch chicago again br br seven is the most i can give it because its entertainment value is mere luck the film as cinema is a disaster
<START> tremendous black and white nighttime cinematography and plenty of it highlights this supposedly true life account of a 1950s murder in kansas in which an entire family was wiped out by two men br br the story was written by truman capote so you get the very liberal anti death penalty message at the end of the film which is ludicrous knowing the facts of this case robert blake and scott wilson play the two atheist losers who have twisted outlooks on life and who unnecessarily murder this nice family br br despite the annoying slant at the end this is a riveting story from the start and the cinematography makes this even more fascinating famed photographer conrad hall did a fantastic job on this it makes me wish more modern day films were made in black and white see it on dvd br br blake wilson john forsythe jeff corey and the entire supporting cast are excellent in here my third viewing of this film came in early april of 2005 shortly after blake in real life was pronounced innocent in the murder trial of his wife one can't help but look at blake and this film differently after that
