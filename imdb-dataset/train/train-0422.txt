<START> of course there's spoilers i'm sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichÃ©s in horror movies female protagonist check bad things happen to drug takers check heorine knocks out villain check heroine doesn't notice villain recovering unconsciousness check frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine check unfortunately it seems someone has sent this clichÃ© list to a film studio instead of using it for class dear oh dear if only london transport was as regular as the clichÃ©s turning up here in fact there's so many clichÃ©s and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long he's been killing people on the underground i'm led to believe it's the result of some human experiment and perhaps it's not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so vague as to be meaningless not to be totally negative i doubt very much if the producers thought they'd be making a film that was going to sweep the oscars that year and there's always a market for horror movies likewise i doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the dvd market rather than cinema distribution and i will state that it's slightly better than 1972's death line which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the london underground it's just that when you think all the clichÃ©s have been used up in this film another clichÃ© comes along to raise its ugly head
<START> it was everything this isn't it had pace pop and actors who weren't afraid to chew the scenery it also had a decent script this one had me scratching my head if farrah isn't really serious about a career why does she have a manager and why is he wasting his time if kate and barney are artists why do they sign up for the mother of all jiggle shows like the brady bunch movie where robert reed wants to do shakespeare only to find himself on bb they weren't industry names but they weren't exactly starving either and while they got the history right the poster was released before farrah got the show silverman rejecting pitches for funniest home videos and american idol and spelling promising his baby girl tori someday he'll create a show for her obviously did not happen br br what bothered me was how spelling's role is distorted he's shown as the show runner and creator when he was neither and how he comes up with the idea for ca was is laughable br br how were spelling and goldberg allowed to enforce farrah's oral contract when the others were signed and why didn't farrah or bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her inner diva but because majors wanted her to this is why when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting farrah up as the bad girl like suzanne somers it fails because the groundwork was never laid that was where the three's company pic delivered
<START> it's like what other dracula movies always do the minions of dracula always on dracula's side which is what disappointed me at the ending regardless the person wants to stay a vampire or not i would like to see something like in the first movie that the minion fights against her master it is much interesting since you can almost predict how the story goes than just either the priest or d win the game we need some surprising plots
<START> it sounds a bit awkward to call a film about war and holocaust shocking since many of us will know only too well of the horrors that war and violence brings by using the adjective 'shocking' i do not intend to imply that i am surprised about the things told about in this film or that i was formerly unaware of them it is just that i am very much impressed by the way in which this film shows how crazy and incomprehensibly horrific it is to kill each other off either with or without a 'reason' br br the first part of the film focuses on hanna's successful participation in the hungarian resistance maruschka detmers would never have won an oscar for this performance due to inconsistent directing but still her acting is solid enough and she has enormous charisma she is cast very well as hanna and immediately has our sympathy her very beautiful looks help of course but that has nothing to do with her being simply a good actress playing a good part br br certain inconsistencies keep occurring in hanna's war i sometimes get the idea director menahem golan often despised for the gianni versace murder was in a rush and should actually have allowed a few more takes per scene on the other hand i am very thankful he made this impressive and thought provoking film and as i am very positive about it i think he did a good job br br the second half of the film is the most interesting and tragic one it focuses on hanna's suffering beware of donald pleasence's scary portrayal of the cruel and sardonic captain rosza and intensely shows the injustice and horror that comes with hate and violence and war i receive hanna's war especially the second half as a strong anti war film and for that alone golan deserves credit it is also this second half in which maruschka detmer's talent comes out creating a character which goes into film history as one of the most speaking strong and tragic ever portrayed it is also great to see ellen burstyn whose appearance and acting style always remind me of romy schneider who had she been alive and cast would have made a similar effective contribution to hanna's war br br the tragic impact of the second half and the desperate tension which is sometimes replaced by hopeful prospects and good news lead to a number of final scenes which show something so unexpected so moving and poetic in its tragedy that it hit me like a bomb and left me in tears and when i realized once more it wasn't even fiction it all actually happened i found myself in even more tears the image of hanna portrayed by maruschka detmers will be in my mind forever
<START> i bought this dvd set sight unseen and wish i hadn't the script needed some serious rewriting as it seems to be completely devoid of any feeling and pales in comparison to the book the lighting is horrid very unpolished but if it was just that i could overlook it the script doesn't focus enough on the characters there is hardly an introduction to various characters making it a tad difficult to distinguish who is who especially in the planes no idea who dies when br br i have long felt that the key to a good film is in getting the audience to care about the characters if you don't have that you don't have anything there was no focus on the characters at all you never got to know them who they were what they liked what made them do the things that they do the series is 5 hours long and split up into 6 parts i bet you are wondering what they did with all this time if they didn't detail the characters they put a lot of filler in it i will say at least an entire hour is spent watching them land and take off in their planes lol i mean do we really need to see that over and over again i would have given this a much higher rating had they just improved our knowledge of the characters
<START> i chose dead creatures because i thought it was a zombies movie just like 28 days or so but not at all it isn't even a horror movie nothing happens except for a group of women that seem to have been infected by a strange virus that make her to eat human flesh in order to survive br br that plot gives rise to a series of disgusting scenes of cannibalism br br very very bad movie br br my rate 2 10 br br br br
<START> this is the best series of its type i've seen all year i can't help thinking it's just my luck a series i love gets 6 episodes and more next year and the constant stream of cookie cutter cop shows get never ending episodes br br i think the reasons new tricks succeeds are many the scripts are good and the mix of characters superb the acting is top flight and the blend of comedy and drama works a treat the stories aren't all that memorable but that's not the reason i watch shows like this one br br the theme song is a favourite and we were disappointed to find it isn't available in any published edition great stuff bbc a triumph of sense over sex appeal aside from the young constable nobody's there as eye lolly and even if he is he can still act
<START> there is no greater disservice to do to history than to misrepresent it this takes the easiest and most shallow route simply portraying him as a monster only showing his negative sides and exaggerating them those who are ignorant of the past doom us to repeat it he was a human being that may prove tough to some people to accept but an important part of life is facing that which we don't want to rather than demonizing the man we ought to try to understand him otherwise we stand little chance of preventing anyone similar in the future or possibly even the present from succeeding at anything of remotely comparable scope as far as damage and misery goes hate him and what he did don't make him into something mythical intentionally or otherwise frankly far too much of this mini series could play dumb dumb duuum after or during scenes the whole thing nods nudges and winks at the audience with a clear message of was this guy evil or what incorporating every single bad trait as well as making up several that go directly against who and what he was letting them appear more or less out of nowhere and having them be constant throughout his life not something he came to believe or claimed to this should never be used to educate use der untergang downfall in english and maybe point out the few inaccuracies of that instead this this is disrespectful to the actual events that took place and to any and all survivors not to mention those who died the cinematic quality top notch it's well done through and through excellent production values a solid arc to the well told plot what characterization does occur is strong and credible dialog and script are great all acting performances are masterful carlyle looks and behaves the role as it was written perfectly the music is well composed cinematography and editing are flawless and creative and this is definitely dramatic entertaining and riveting they get dates and many occurrences and do them justice if i had been offered to work on this and did not feel i could be objective enough to have hitler appear as a fully fleshed out person i would have declined citing that as the reason i don't blame anyone for loathing him how can you forgive what he did and are we sure that we should that is not what i am suggesting finally let me point out that as i write this we are in a world wide economic crisis that has lasted for about two years and that is not terribly dissimilar to the stock market crash of 1929 the two reasons it hasn't led to a depression of the new millennium are as follows governments are giving money to the banks to keep the market going and the majority of the countries is now friendly towards one another apart from that the lesson hadn't been learned hopefully it has now back to this my suggestion read a book non fiction dealing with the subject there are plenty of informative smart ones the dvd holds a trailer i recommend this only to those who know better and vehemently urge anyone who has watched it to seek out the truth 8 10
<START> this movie is lame and not funny at all the plot doesn't even make sense some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension maybe hell and his daughter gets sucked through it or something then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she's more interested in her new girlfriend and they stumble upon this witch spell book they want to be witches or something and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie i'm sure the topless girls doesn't hurt there either the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing who are these people and what are they doing basically this is a go camping to make out then fight a monster movie but there are a bunch of things like the other dimension and book seller than make it confusing i didn't like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal i don't recommend watching it though it was just too stupid i can't think of any part of the movie that was good
<START> tv version of twister springs a few leaks but manages to remain watchable my sister bought this at a wal mart a few years back when it was released i saw it back then and thought it was okay later twister with bill pullman and helen hunt comes out or was it before i think it was '97 and did a better job overall but twister was more silly fun this is realistic with a message it all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters twisters or a low budget character study br br john schneider and devon sawa he's the reason my sister bought it star and devon sawa who went on to wild america final destination and slackers got his big break here so in a way i was one of the first people to see him really take off i don't know if it's an honor or a shame i haven't seen how he acts in recent films br br night of the twisters all depends on personal taste like i said it all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters twisters or a low budget character study night of the twister has the latter so you decide br br i give it a 2 5 5 br br john ulmer
<START> i only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what i saw was a total piece of crap the scenes i saw were as bad as an ed wood movie no it was a hundred times worse ed wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that's not true the idiot who directed this junk is the worst director ever br br the american cop has a german accent the police station was a desk in a warehouse with a sign police station hanging on the wall there is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about ten feet br br this cop pulls women over cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse he tells his cop partner to wait in the car then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag the cop partner thinks maybe something is not right that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women but he isn't sure if that is what's happening because he's a moron the dialog is totally stupid the acting is awful and the characters act in the stupidest manner i have ever seen on screen it is totally obvious to the cop's partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it and yet the partner who is there all along doesn't know what is happening br br the director of this film is a total hack i stopped the movie at 30 minutes because i couldn't take it anymore it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever started to watch and i won't waste anymore time on it writing this review br br absolutely worthless
<START> this tale set in wellington new zealand suburbia tawa home of the renowned tawa college is mccarten's first feature br br with a contemporary new zealand flavour via satellite abounds with absolutely hilarious situations which develop in the adult family context at the same time it manages to invoke intense emotions of sadness and despair br br one of the most moving and humourous movies of the year not to be missed
<START> had placed this on my tivo for a rainy day due to the cast some really hard working people in the industry and when i finally watched i was not disappointed br br this movie has some altman like flavor he's mentioned in the end credits as a thanks person utilizing seemingly independent unrelated plot lines that intertwine as the film draws to its climax macy is pure clean and honest as a man who can't seem to escape his destiny sutherland plays and portrays as few can neve adds splash to a deliberately toned down environment add tracy ullman barbara bain remember mission impossible on tv not to mention the steady john ritter and you have all the ingredients for a good film the script is uncluttered the dialog is free from clichÃ© and thoughtful especially between macy and david dorfman suspend belief and enjoy this is truly time well spent
<START> this is the kind of movie that wants to be good but sucks first thing what the hell are those punk trying to do with the school i think the kids doesn't seem to realize the gravity of the situation deker guy say to the girl that they under his responsibility when she ask why he wants to go back for them but right after this he gives a gun to the wheel chair dude and wants him to go alone repair the phone line where is the responsibility there i understand poor actors must pay their food but why not just give them the money that takes to make a stupid movie like that or give that money to a charity oh yea and none of them knows how to aim the stupid punk guy shoots in the cafeteria nowhere like a crazy they all want to look professional but they all suck one more thing i don't believe that there's no emergency exit in the school the kids are trying several doors but they all locked what happens if there's a fire and the dumass security guard is dead it is illegal to not have an emergency exit in school anyway there's a lot more to say but it would be too long i spent some time of my life to watch a crap
<START> i liked it the plot was weird drew barrymore and dc making out was awkward for both of them drews acting was dodgy in places but this could be down to her life at the time dennis christopher as the shrink was pretty cool and as always he does his best i'm a major dennis fan anyway that's why i bought the dvd br br i didn't get the ending that weird animatronic red skeleton thing looked just like it was out of filmschool which is ok i guess but it could have been more br br and the whole thing with the knife if it was that uncomfortable why didn't they just get rid of it br br it was very confusing as to when it was the doppelganger weird thing or when it was dc or was it dennis all the time because the doppelganger made out with dennis and patrick in the scenes with patrick if it was dennis as the doppelganger then i think patrick would notice br br the music was ok but obtrusive in places the whole orchestral score seemed to be revolving around a theme but this theme was overdone br br a big mix of lots of blood and gratuitus shots of drew nude br br all in all a bit of a gpm guilty pleasure movie don't read too much into it don't look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you wont find it there are some diamond moments and goofs galore watch it and just have a bit of fun with it
<START> the alarmist is so abysmally scripted that you have think to yourself why on earth did an up and coming actor like david arquette agree to be in it it has to be one of the weakest plots i have ever seen and without any humour at all it borders on the brink of tedious it staggers along to a dreadful conclusion which appears to only happen because the director got bored and just wanted to wrap up quickly in order to get home for his dinner stay away
<START> i am normally skeptical about watching films or mini series based on novels because the screenplay is always different from the novel fortunately i was wrong the screenplay was very close to the novel i guess it helps that the author was an executive producer and writer huh br br the cast is outstanding i can't describe how much i enjoyed seeing such a wide range of actors from ossie davis and ruby dee to robert ri'chard and bianca lawson br br the location setting i was expecting to see the homes and cottages i imagined in my mind what i saw on screen was slightly different however it wasn't enough to make me dislike the mini series br br i recommend this for anyone who has read the novel you will not be disappointed if you have 8 out of 10 stars br br
<START> noll's comfortable way of rolling out blunt comments often with expletives to describe things that he is more knowledgeable about than most is quite refreshing there is one other character in the film that constantly tries to verbalize complicated issues using more language than necessary this guy should never have been given a thesaurus cut to noll and you know you're in for a treat br br the way the pioneers of big wave surfing are portrayed is very evocative of a lost era nevermind the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living much less took care of issues like medical care the use of old film clips throughout was masterfully done
<START> well what's to say the golden child falls in the category so bad it's good eddie murphy is having some funny and sometimes quite annoying lines but you are still entertained chales dance has never been worse than his role as the villain sardo numspa what a f ed up name is this br br who should watch the golden child hm difficult to say but my best guess would be people who likes embarrassing movies and can be entertained by bad acting bad plot and an even more embarrassing dialog br br 4 out of 10
<START> i kind of feel like a genius i feel like i'm the only one who saw through this fake film i watched it three times once with commentary and i found myself getting annoyed at all the close ups all the times the screen just blacks out and worst of all i feel the film never really resolves anything yes the priest dies but he didn't really seem at peace with the town that gave him so much grief or with himself that and he was an idiot if it weren't for the commentary by peter cowie which explained not only the movie but the book it came from i wouldn't have been able to stomach it at all i enjoy french movies but this is one that was completely absurd br br diary of a country priest is filmed in beautiful black and white photography but that alone cannot save this deadly dull tripe scene after scene of extreme close ups where characters don't say anything until the camera cuts away and goes to a black out do not make an interesting or relevant story how this film ever became a classic is mind boggling it reminds me more of the emperor's new clothes br br yes claude laydu's performance is heartfelt and thought provoking if you are a sadist but this film left me feeling empty because overall it is a weak impression of the catholic priesthood which is an ignoble and inglorious institution of corruption the young priest's triumph over the countess's pride is a weak scene but 90 of the film will drag you down with its dreary introspection and window into the young priest's melancholy thoughts this priest doesn't come across so much as being humble as he does just plain pitiful br br being that i don't speak or understand french i was looking forward to doing the english subtitle thing to help understand the film well the english subtitle is at times impossible to view read and the text rolls by so quickly that there was much i could not read and i am not a particularly slow reader i just finished dostoyevsky in 3 days br br i really wanted to like this film i try out everything chosen by the criterion collection and yet can not see why in many ways this one merits some sort of critical nod however i sat through this entire two hour film yearning to feel some sort of empathy for the main character and it never materialized he just seemed like a victim rather than a fighter and for that i say it stunk
