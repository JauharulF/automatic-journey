<START> perhaps i'm not a sophisticate this and closer are two of the more supposedly cerebral films i've seen recently and both suffer from exactly the same problem to an excruciating extent the dialogue is false false false nothing that comes out of anyone's mouth seems remotely believable perhaps the way this film is set up that's the way it's supposed to feel but it was unwatchable and boring i walked out after 20 minutes of tedium br br i'll stick with sleeper and bananas for my woody allen fix if i ever come across this on the teevee i'll turn over and try to find an episode of quincy instead
<START> my one line summary should explain it all but i'll have a go at it br br from the get go this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera and that's about all i can comment on there were a few interesting scenes such as the big one that hit during the middle of the movie but wait what's that the earthquake gasp wait a minute that's dante's peak well parts of it butchered and slapped in i can't believe how poorly this movie was done borrowing scenes from other much better films one wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountain esque backdrops exist in downtown la ala dante's peak br br my advise forget the bond wanna be nash in this film and go for the real thing again someone from dante's peak coincidentally br br
<START> not only does this film have one of the great movie titles it sports the third teaming of 70s child actors ike eissenman and kim richards i seem to remember this film being broadcast halloween week back in '78 going against linda blair in stranger in our house i missed it on the first run choosing to see the other film later on repeat i saw i made the right choice the movie is not really bad but really lacks any chills or surprises although i did like the scene where richard crenna shoots the family dog to no avail
<START> i can't say whether the post wwii british comedies produced at the ealing studios are an acquired taste or not but i am completely addicted and the man in the white suit is one of the best no need to go into the well known plot about the threat posed to both the textile industry and the textile unions by an indestructible dirt resistant fiber suffice it to say that the slings and arrows suffered by the naively idealistic sidney stratton in pursuing his polymer vision make for a comedic delight many of the well known faces from the world of british character actors the nervous cecil parker the suavely devious michael gough and the bluntly ruthless ernest thesinger put in wonderful performances guinness as always and forever is superb and joan greenwood is delectable as daphne just the way she enunciates the word daddy makes the entire movie worth seeing br br knudsen
<START> doctor feinstone is a dentist he has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a pool suddenly he discovers that his wife is making out with the pool attendant he realises that behind everything clean there is decay he starts to torture his patients corbin bernsen is brilliant as the deranged dentist he is completely believable there is surprisingly little gore but the scenes of dental torture are quite nasty and grotesque highly recommended the dentist 2 is also worth checking out
<START> the fifth black emanuelle i've watched has potentially the most intriguing plot line dealing as it does with the intrepid female reporter investigating the white slavery prostitution racket which takes her from san francisco to rome to macao and back to her own hometown new york the film is peopled with past veterans of the series which inexplicably play completely different roles namely ivan rassimov appearing here as a head of a united nations committee for third world countries karin shubert as a feminist rival reporter and don powell as rassimov's chauffeur br br unfortunately as usual with this type of film despite their being shown in the dead of night it is heavily edited and a particularly graphic scene described in stracultr in which an asian slave trader gets his comeuppance by being sodomized by a dog is nowhere to be seen here still a harrowing sequence late in the film when a sleazy politician tricks a couple of girls including naturally gemser and shubert into a midnight rendezvous under a new york bridge with a group of bums this is the way he gets their votes get it with his high society pals giddily looking on seems pretty much intact br br the most ridiculous element of this entry apart from gemser's penchant to disrobe completely every time she enters a house even in front of perfect strangers is her excursion to india to interview a charlatan guru george eastman made up to look considerably christ like who has found a way to prolong coitus indefinitely of course when emanuelle calls him up on it he ends up having premature ejaculation
<START> although this film is somewhat filled with eighties cheese i have a place for it in my dvd rack and i don't know why i think i like it because the moral of the story is 'television is garbage so turn it off and go and get a life' for those of you who do decide to heed the message then you should try reading the book its nothing like the film at all to ruin it for you at the end of the story a fatally wounded richards ends up crashing a plane into the network building killing himself everyone inside and shutting down the network at the same time i read it many years ago but today it would hard not to compare it to 9 11
<START> misfits at a military school hmmmm sounds funny maybe offensive to some you have the characters there the arab thief the sex crazy teen the smart mouth the pot smoker and not to forget the guy who burns things throw in a strict no nonsense sergent a homosexual sergent and one sexy ammunition teacher and it makes one crazy film adventure br br i have seen this film and it is funny because the comedy is revolved around the fact that if you try to work together things get done br br these band of misfit students at weinberg military school have been placed in here because as sgt liceman quotes because you are outcasts embarrassments to your families and communities disgraces one of ralph macchio's earlier performances before the karate kid and my cousin vinny with appearances from barbara bach as well this film appeals to teens and young adults br br great soundtrack keeps the film moving
<START> i gave this movie a very fair chance and it betrayed me this is very little more than a black and white excuse to bore the hell out of the audience even as the egotist bogdanavich who did way better with targets gets great performances out of a ton of hams in their debuts lots of teenage sex clichÃ©s come out of this movie such as doing the teacher's wife impotence doing the ugly prostitute which is very awkwardly shot and grinds things to a complete halt not that things were really going anywhere anyway and skinny dipping br br i suppose this movie is supposed to be funny because of all the sex nonsense to me it was just annoying i was seriously much more entertained by cleaning my finger nails than watching this mess
<START> cecil b demille really knew how to create a classic and after 7 decades his western comes across as the real mccoy engrossing entertaining spectacular in no way outdated br br as a real fan of tv's deadwood i'll tell you the performances of gary cooper as wild bill hickock and jean arthor as calamity jane are far more on target br br we don't have any giants in hollywood anymore plainsman is just one of dozens of classics from the 1936 1945 decade that have seen enduring commercial life decade after decade released re issued re issued all over again filmmakers like today's spielberg jackson bruckheimer are like kids playing in a sandbox none of today's movies will be sought out in 7 months let alone 70 years
<START> jack frost no kids it's not the warm hearted family movie about a dad who comes back from the dead in the form of a snow man it's about a sadistic killer named jack frost who is sprayed with some acid fluid and is morphed into a killer snow man i happened to catch a copy of this movie so i could have a nice sit back and laugh at it a killer snow man ha sounds like the perfect comedy horror movie well i was wrong very wrong br br jack frost is about a killer who is being transported via truck to jail so he could fry in the chair at midnight but it's a snowy night and it collides with a government tanker carrying a new dna fluid jack escapes only to be burnt to death by the acid and morphs into a killer snowman he returns to the small town of snowmonton where he was caught by a small time sheriff here he is ready to kill again now as a snow man with cooler powers he can condense into water shoot out ice cycles as spears and grow killer fangs the only question is who can stop frost this movie is below the typical b movie line the movies begins cheesy but as soon as jack is burned by the acid it quickly drops below the cheese line and goes flat the acting for one is appalling here we have a whole cast of unheard of actors who either can't act can act but has a pointless character or is just here for a few extra bucks the only good actor is scott macdonald who plays jack he looks like a young richard kiel combined with frankenstein sadly his appearance is only reduced to three minutes and all we ever see of him is his new snow man form and his wise cracking voice plus his wisecracks are anything but funny groaning stupid and bad br br the plot is horrible throughout history there have been numerous murderers a killer in a hockey mask a killer with a razer glove a chainsaw wielding moron a rapid st bernard but now we stoop to a tacky killer snow man oh come on and the way the characters are introduced are terrible for one i really wanted jack to kill the sheriffs son i mean giving his dad oats with antifreeze in them so they won't freeze all the characters are dumb and pointless and the deaths are to cartoony one woman in strangled with christmas lights and has her head smashed into a decoration box and a girl is humped to death in the shower where is the carrot in that scene eh br br and to top of this horrible movie is the special effects the first big special effect we have is jack's dna mixing in with snow and boy is it terrible i mean it looks like a 60's fashion of art design pu jack looks fake as well he looks like a person covered with rubber snow man skin all the blood and gore is cheesy and the film never takes off with greatness but instead stoops to low levels br br jack frost is one of the worst slasher movies ever made i thought it would be a riot but no it doesn't try to be funny and it actually tries to be scary jack frost gets 4 out of 10 it at least made me laugh from it's awfulness don't even bother with this piece of trash jack frost d
<START> this is certainly the worst movie i ever saw the beginning is somewhat good but the end i still don't even get it magical power 300 years later goddess dancing what the f is that about the acting is somewhat not so bad but some place i could do better for sure
<START> i watched this hoping to find out something i didn t know about modern history s most infamous man and couldn t help thinking that history has been rewritten in hitler the rise of evil hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to have one of her admirer s shot hitler turned up with a gun in his hand to arrest ernst rohm forgive me for asking but haven t the writers confused adolph hitler with tony montana from scarface that s bad enough but what really offended me was that there s entire chunks of historical context missing in this mini series germany lost the first world war and the allied powers made germany pay a heavy price for doing so it was this economic environment that led the german people to have someone anyone to restore their pride and that s why they turned to nazism the german humiliation of the 1920s caused by the allied powers seems to be entirely missing therefore there is no way that hitler the rise of evil can be taken seriously as a historical document and i haven t even mentioned that himmler and goering are conspicous by their absence br br there is one positive point about the mini series and that s robert carlyle in the title role okay some of his mannerisms are wrong and his voice is a little too loud archive recordings show that hitler had a soft seductive voice but carlyle is a charismatic actor and he does manage to communicate hitler s own charisma on screen comments in the british press that carlyle resembles the synth player from sparks more than adolph hitler are unfounded and he gives one of the better interpretations of hitler br br i liked the performance by robert carlyle but i hated everything else about this mini series and wondered why on earth it was made in the first place there s nothing to recommend it to serious history fans
<START> this was one of those films i probably never would have picked off the shelf but it came on ifc one day and i said eric stolz william forsythe why not if i'd changed the channel i would have really missed a treasure br br the subject is depressing young author paralyzed in climbing accident convalesces in lower class rehabilitation center it would have been so easy and tempting to make this a manipulative tear jerker but that doesn't happen because it was written by neal jimenez after he himself was accidently paralyzed no hollywood happiness here all of the patients in the ward come from wildly different backgrounds but they share a feeling of helplessness of being at the mercy of others stolz is very good as a lone wolf type forced into embarrassing dependence on his girlfriend helen hunt wesley snipes is fine as a former ladies' man whose family is falling apart but william forsythe takes the cake as a tough guy determined to make someone pay for taking away his independence br br see this film
<START> this is almost the worst film you will ever see 2012 doomsday currently pulls the rug from under this one for me the props are a perfect example of what frank zappa once referred to as 'cheepnis ' it looks as if the space scenes were made in a 1950s power station just prior to demolition the music really sucks the acting is wooden and ham the characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing the plot is predictable it is immediately and brazenly obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other films the quality of direction beggars belief br br but you have to see it if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest wastes of a tiny budget ever this is a priceless example of a stupid movie
<START> my main comment on this movie is how zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie impressive cast Â even for the supporting characters none of which helps this movie really i have to admit though tom hank's cameo almost made it worth it Â what was that about tom did you lose a bet the best cameo of the movie was joe isuzu though by far a classic the premise is good basinger's character struggling with existence as a pink lady is making her way toward vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales this happens as corbett's character is on his way to vegas to deliver an elvis suit to his soon to be ex wife motivated byÂ what elseÂ extortion as they both make their way they have numerous run ins with elvis impersonators who on their way to an elvis impersonating convention in vegas soon the fbi gets involved and begins to track what they think is an elvis impersonator serial killer unfortunately premise doesn't mean the movie was good br br when watching this movie imagine you are back in the first grade Â when story lines and continuity aren't really important it is much more enjoyable to just watch basinger look beautiful in her pink lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn't really make sense the movie tries hard but ultimately falls way way way short ultimately it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funny br br it isn't the worst but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the building when watching this oneÂÂ don't say i didn't warn you
<START> make up your own mind personally i found it as much fun as receiving a spinal tap from stevie wonder no offense mr wonder maybe it is comedy but i just found it stupid not exactly the first two choices to babysit your kids wheeler seann william scott and danny paul rudd two energy drink salesmen to avert jail time are court ordered to mentor two kids from a development center run by gayle sweeny jane lynch one of the misfits is ronnie bobb'e j thompson a foul mouthed fifth grader and the other is augie christopher mintz plasse a bashful young man that roll plays in a fantasy medieval world wheeler and danny desperately try to give their charges an invaluable inside view of life love and heavy metal lynch is hilarious with her dry wit analogies supporting are elizabeth banks ken jeongg kerri kenney silver amanda righetti and david wain
<START> reading some of the comments on the message boards here i was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown but when i watched it i could not stop laughing it has officially become my new favourite movie br br i don't know what all the hate here is about maybe it's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before i am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead but there will be a lot of supporting male characters this one was almost all women with the exception of seth meyers justin hartley and the brief appearance of will arnett and it worked all of the actresses delivered very funny performances especially missi pyle from a quirky and lovable script br br the charm of this film to me seems to be in its subtle feminist message accepting who you are female success in the public sphere the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles light hearted though it is each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more 'fun' conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be br br missi pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all female cast and lack of a big name actor to get the studios behind it and i have to agree everyone i've recommended this film to has loved it and i think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness hasn't been widely accepted and successful br br i highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind or a love of female centred comedy
<START> i really looked forward to see planet of the apes but it was a huge dissapointment br br the settings and masks are great but that is the only good aspect of the film all other things are really annoying mark wahlberg is not acting he is just in the movie looking stupid the other actors are also not very good br br but the worst point of all is the story it is absolutely ridiculous for example the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground but the humans don t attack them no they wait until they are up again this is just one example for the stupid story but it would take too long to tell them all
<START> no this hilariously horrible 70's made for tv horror clinker isn't about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake still this exceptionally awful yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute unremitting silliness and atrociousness that's quite tasty in a so execrable it's downright awesome sort of way richard crenna looking haggard and possibly inebriated and yvette mimieux who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in jackson county jail sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint dull sleepy small town existence gets ripped asunder when the cute german shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit pretty soon mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kids kim richards and ike eisenmann the psychic alien moppets from the disney witch mountain pictures are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty ugly canine entity in the den boy now doesn't that sound really scary and disturbing well scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ain't but it sure is funny thanks to curtis night tide harrington's hopelessly weak direction cartoonish not so special effects an almost painfully risible'n'ridiculous plot and a game cast that struggles valiantly with the absurd story besides the leads both martine beswicke and r g armstrong briefly pop up as members of a satanic cult and victor jory has a nice cameo as a helpful native american shaman favorite scene the malicious mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on crenna practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade while stuck up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock devout tv trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to alpo
