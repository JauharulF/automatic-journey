<START> i can't believe we don't have that 70's show anymore i have all 8 seasons of that 70's show i absolutely love it i lay in the bed every night and watch several episodes before i go to sleep at the end of a long busy day it's nice to kick back and have a great laugh before you go to sleep i was so sad they took the show off air at least we still have the re runs i am hoping and praying they will come back with at least a reunion like maybe when donna finishes college and we finally get to see her and eric get married wouldn't that be awesome it would be even better if they would continue it for several years
<START> back when i was a kid and i lived with my sister she bought every horror movie she could find and this was one of them vcr's had just became a household item and we didn't have but about 150 movies and we watched the hell out of all of them br br i was at a yard sale the other day and i saw this vhs copy of blood legacy and i buy any horror movie i don't have and i knew this movie looked familiar i thought for a second and realized it was one that my sister had bought she had sold it years ago in a yard sale i am guessing who knows br br i didn't recall anything at all about it and i watched it the night i bought it and it refreshed my memory because of a few scenes i am not sure how i felt about it as a kid but i am sure i enjoyed it because it was new to me and i'd watch and enjoy anything back then br br i am a horror freak but there are certain requirements in order for me to consider it good and this one fell very short it was one of those talk talk talk and bore me to death types what death scenes you see are done using the shadow on the wall followed by blood splatter and thats if you're lucky you get that much br br the story is good and i have seen a few with similar plots so i think this one should be buried and forgotten don't watch this people unless you're hard up
<START> i think my summary sums it up i found it inane and stupid i also saw the ending a mile a way everyone is copying that ending anymore when doing a tv theater crossover anymore sometimes it's better to let the movie stand alone br br others its better to forget the movie altogether this is one of the others
<START> a handful of critics have awarded this film with positive comments i don't wish to argue with their opinion but i strongly disagree when i first watched this film i was mildly impressed but after comparing it with other films particularly with the late master bruce lee i quickly changed my mind in fact if it wasn't for the title of the film i would never have bought it game of death 2 doesn't relate to the original game of death except it shares one character billy lo br br i was stunned to see how similar game of death 2 was compared to enter the dragon the plots have striking similarities both bruce lee and bobby lo are on a mission to avenge a relative the two locations are similar in which they both are very isolated and are surrounded by thousands of blackbelts there is an element of prostitution in both films women are sent two the guests rooms in both films both han enter the dragon and lewis's henchman have a hand missing their is an underground drug operation in enter the dragon believe it or not there is one in game of death 2 han has a pet cat in enter the dragon the director has used his imagination and awarded lewis with a pet monkey the list continues br br regarding other aspects of the film such as the script and the acting i felt it was very poor it seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists to star in the film and prayed they could act br br on a positive scale i cannot deny that the choreography is impressive although the fighting sequences have strong elements of acrobatics in them they are none the less skillfully performed however as the plot is insufficient i couldn't relate to the characters therefore the fighting sequences were more exhibitions rather than having a meaning to the film br br in conclusion i would say this film is recommendable to any martial arts fans but for those who enjoy a solid action film with a good storyline and strong characters i seriously wouldn't recommend this film my opinions towards this film may seem very bias and one sided but when bruce lee set a new standard in the martial arts cinema particularly after his masterpiece enter the dragon this film failed to rise to these standards if anything they imitated a truly brilliant martial arts film in hope of achieving the same level of fame br br in reference to my evaluation awarding this film a very harsh 1 out of 10 the film is barley watchable and must be thankful that it had the fighting sequences it did
<START> my friend bought the movie for 5Â its is not even 1 cent worth because they wrote it was like american pie but we would soon find out that there is a long way from american pie to that piece of crap it is not even a comedy its more like a really really really bad documentary not only the story is bad the picture and sound also sucks to they put in some alcohol chicks dwarfs and drunken teens and the result is a disaster if you see this movie don't buy it rather spend your money on something else and better if you are gonna torture yourself then don't invite your friend s unless you hate really much and you want to get rid of them
<START> when i look back on my college days at ohio university there will always be one event in which i will remember with fond memories channel 23 is ou's local access channel and until the last few years pretty much played anything they were sent this included many diy movies ranging from a guy microwaving marshmallow peeps and then scanning pictures of them online to a version of macbeth starring 8th graders who had apparently just learned how to make squibs br br however the king in my opinion of the channel 23 lineup was midnight skater the first time i watched it was around 2am i should have been studying or sleeping or watching regular tv but no all that is for pussies my roommate and i watched midnight skater and when it was complete i don't think either of us believed that any of the movie had just happened but sure enough it was on a few nights later and we had to come to grips that this movie did in fact exist br br i could go on and on about how awful it is but its the sort of awful that makes life worth living the plot is disjointed the acting terrible the everything soul scarring but by god if there are others watching with you its impossible not to have a good time watching it its sort of like the first time you hear guts by chuck pahalniuk you hear it you're disgusted and shaken but five minutes later all you want and desire is to make someone else experience the abject horror you just endured br br long story short midnight skater for all of its epic flaws makes for some very late night fun plus i desperately want the theme to midnight skater kudos to whoever wrote it and sang it sweet god i love that song
<START> if you enjoy romantic comedies then you will find this tale of two 30 year old singles who fall in love during the american league pennant race satisfying on the other hand if you are hanging around waiting for kill bill volume 3 or sin city 2 then you probably should stay away the plot contains the obligatory guy meets girl's friends girl meets guy's friends and guy meets girl's parents scenes there is even a guy meets girl's pet dog scene that's all par for the course in a movie like this however what i liked about it was that the plot delved into the decision making process people make as they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is in fact a bit quirky the plot centers around answering the questions how much quirkiness is too much and how much love does it take to trump those quirks it is interesting to see the characters work that out because deep down if we admit it we all have quirks barrymore does a very good job in her role and fallon sorta surprised me he's good as well i rate it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy add one point if you are a baseball fan or romantically involved with one add another point if you are a red sox fan and subtract two points if you are a yankees fan
<START> damn was that a lot to take in i was pretty much mesmerised throughout it was pretty perfect though i would say the editing had a lot to do with that i can't believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them anton especially to get all of this footage without any serious beef the dandy's did come off well together middle class kids who took advantage of their situation and rightly so i felt bad for jonestown and especially for anton which maybe wasn't what a lot of other people felt great piece of film making and great choice of subject s i recommend this to any music film fan you'll probably learn something about film making
<START> for someone who remembers jane in the daily mirror strip cartoon viewing this film is an exercise in nostalgia in that context it is wonderful but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy limp and would miss the point that the actors are cartoon characters the plotline is also a bit limp for today's audience but reflects the naivety of the 40s and 50s very well jane you must remember was part of the escapist fantasy of the wartime years created to boost the morale of the troops she gave a double meaning to the strip in strip cartoon br br the story has something in common with the tales of edgar rice burroughs and rider haggard the theme would have been a familiar one to readers in that era a bunch of bumbling nazis thwarted by a few equally bumbling englanders and set in the african jungle of course br br for jane fans a must see for the rest of you a damp squib br br
<START> the hysterical thing about this movie is that according to the director it has difficulty finding a distributor in the u s because most of them that viewed it couldn't reconcile the seemingly conflicting messages of christianity and american angst the thought of anyone seeing this as a religious film in anyway is laughable br br because a minister at a mission prays with the homeless or wishes someone godspeed this makes it a christian movie one could interpret that it is actually mocking religion for in the land of plenty with all of its material excess the best an organized mission can do is hand out a bowl of soup and a bible verse plenty of unfortunate or downtrodden maybe plenty of useless homeless missions how about plenty of psycho vietnam vets as a pill popping delusional survivor of agent pink are we to think america is a land of plenty of paranoid patriots maybe we have plenty of psychiatric patients certainly we don't have plenty of people concerned about palestine politics based on the main characters phone conversation in the film of course if you worked in a german homeless shelter the unfortunate there would be much more concerned about peace in a distant land than their own personal survival as the world knows how europe is the continent of plenty when it comes to sophistication br br indeed i agreed with the title in the end as the united states is the land of plenty and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of poor scripts amateur acting and dispassionately directed films life is too short and one even an american doesn't have plenty of time to waste watching this piece
<START> winchester '73 was the film that moved mann from the b movies to the big league rescuing james stewart's floundering post war career in the process by casting him as a conflicted hero although since he inherited the project from fritz lang maybe lang deserves the credit for that both men would go to much darker places mann with the remarkably bleak devil's doorway which remained shelved by mgm until the success of broken arrow convinced them to release it Â but a movie about a man hunting down his own brother as the rifle of the title is handed from person to person along the trail before it ends up in one of the director's beloved mountainside shootouts is still stronger meat than you'd expect from the studio system great dialogue an impressive supporting cast Â dan duryea will geer millard mitchell stephen mcnally shelley winters charles drake tim mcintire jay c flippen tony curtis rock hudson among them Â and mann's outstanding visual sense raise the bar with this one
<START> i saw this movie on the bifff festival in brussel spring 2004 what a surprise this german production a stylish and imaginative shocker is one of the scariest flic i have seen be warned this is not a joke this terrorizer has a big cast of good actors as an example peter martell as a european guru has a strong presence excellent direction nice production design a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy gore sfx like italian horror movies in the eighties flesh ripped clean to the bone and the blood runs red this savage heart stopper will grip you and give you some dark dreams a must see
<START> first off i'd like to make a correction on another review of this film which said that the last musical to win the best picture academy award was 'gigi' in 1958 that is misinformation as 'west side story' won in 1962 'my fair lady' won in 1965 and 'sound of music' won the year after that that said this film is absolutely fantastic the story from the novel has been somewhat altered but that's more because of the limitations that they had on a stage that they just didn't change back for a filmed version however i don't mind in fact i rather think the whole production flows better than the novel does i like nancy bringing oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead of later in the apartment the subtle things in this film are the ones that make me laugh i love the moment mr bumble and mrs bumble start coming out at the beginning from the governors office the underscore for that moment is brilliant my three favorite actors for this film were jack wild who plays the best dodger in any film version of the story ron moody a playful and humorous fagin this character is worked out much better than he is in the book and shani wallis who is the strongest most distressed version of nancy the only reason i'm giving this film a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the two big production numbers which are 'concider yourself' and 'who will buy ' i always hate when the choreography in musicals in meant to look like people doing everyday chores and jobs it looks awful and cheesy especially when they're dancing at the london meat co they should've just done regular choreography for these scenes however this film is a rare treasure that will stay with us hopefully forever
<START> stanley kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things action and thrills the domino principle features gene hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task richard widmark edward albert and eli wallach are his operatives they presumably work for the government but that like most of the movie's plot line is never made clear hackman asks a lot of questions that never get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere while it strives to be like night moves and the parallax view the domino principle mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom the film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it kramer's direction is devoid of any style it's a very sunny movie br br the acting is fine with hackman proving he's pretty much incapable of being bad widmark and wallach are suitably nasty and albert is well cast as widmark's cruel lackey even the usually obnoxious mickey rooney is pretty good as hackman's sidekick one oddity however is the casting of candice bergen as hackman's wife we're told she's done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern twang kramer's idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig it's a role better suited for the likes of valerie perrine or susan tyrell
<START> let's begin with that theme song sung by christopher cross the song is if you get caught between the moon and new york city it's a great theme and song even after all these years it never gets tiring it really is a great song about new york city as well anyway the great dudley moore cbe stars as a spoiled drunken millionaire who is engaged to jill eikenberry's character in the film jill would later star on la law anyway he is served by his wonderful british butler sir john gielgud om who won an academy award for his performance in the film as best supporting actor arthur falls in love with liza minnelli's character who is perfect in this film besides her performance in her oscar winning role in cabaret no liza doesn't get to sing she plays a diner waitress anyway i love geraldine fitzgerald as the bach matriarch of the family who decides the family's fortune anyway she is fabulous and should have gotten an academy award nomination herself for best supporting actress barney martin best known as jerry's dad on seinfeld plays liza's dad he's great too the movie was well written acted and delivered to the audience who wanted more of it
<START> looking back over the past 28 years since my first exposure to the show all i can say is once you get it it will stay with you forever i remember my initial reaction being 1 annoyingly overacted 2 under produced 3 unlikeable characters br br well two years later i watched some episodes again and didn't find it nearly as annoying a year later i was able to catch the entire series from the beginning and quickly became engrossed in it's bittersweet tale of human fault and perspectives on happiness yes the show has a style that is not for everybody and i'm sure the dated production value would be hard to deal with now but i still think about the show at least once a month with a vague teary eyed longing for what seemed like simpler times br br btw i am a married man for all who think this is a show for females
<START> the characters are unlikeable and the script is awful it's a waste of the talents of deneuve and auteuil
<START> very disappointing version of lorna doone too many missing characters no romantic scenes changes in story line too short appeared low budget hardly enough dialogue to understand the story if you're not familiar with the novel in some scenes it looks like lorna has a cold sore on her upper lip i'm sure make up did it's best to hide it i guess they didn't want to halt filming until it healed up pity most likely why this movie lacked kissing scenes only one disappointing kissing scene at the very end lorna doone is a great epic tale and should be told true the 2000 version of lorna doone is twice as long more romantic much more enjoyable and more true to the book
<START> and forget this completely if you really need to see madonna act rent body of evidence at least willem defoe is in that one br br in this film while the sets are beautiful you may want to mute the dialog you won't miss anything bruce greenwood is wasted jeanne tripplehorn is a prop and madonna is so awful it becomes amusing why they had to butcher the original film into this mess i will never know guess they thought it was bankable madonna as an actress certainly is not br br if you rent the original film from 1979 though you will enjoy it and the actors in it can actually act 1 10
<START> if you didn't know better you would believe the christian moral majority in their preachy testimonial of the sins of the young their questing for satan and that hell was just brimming with advanced dungeons and dragons fans br br none of these items bears one grain of truth folks this work does nothing but give the southern baptists a chance to take a breath while the movie continues to spout their erroneous and alarmist views concerning a creative and original gaming system br br tom hanks contributes a stellar performance for this work but even that wasn't enough to save it it's crap it's beneath crap it is ignorance breeding ignorance and as such it rates nothing from br br the fiend
