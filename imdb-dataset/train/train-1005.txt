<START> a wonderful film to watch with astonishing scenes and talented actors such as misa shimizu and nagiko tono after 15 minutes of watching your eyes get locked on the screen and you do nothing but breathing in the atmosphere of the film waiting what the destiny will bring to the characters this film makes you leave your position as a standard audience it takes you in it makes you a part of the story costumes and settings are brilliant especially the district of the okiyas is skillfully built it is definitely not very akira kurosawa however it still gets a lot from the master especially the stylistic story telling tells us we're in a distinguished land of cinema which is quite far from hollywoodish flamboyance
<START> a pale shadow of a great musical this movie suffers from the fact that the director richard attenborough completely misses the point of the musical needlessly opens it up and muddies the thrust of the play the show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a job in a b'way musical and examines their drive desire to work in this demanding and not always rewarding line of work attenborough gives us a fresh faced cast of hopefuls assuming that they are trying to get their big break in show business rather than presenting the grittier mix of characters created on stage as a group of working gypsies living show to show along with a couple of newcomers the film has one advantage over the play and that is the opening scene showing the size of the original audition and the true scale of shrinkage down to the 16 17 on the line depending on how you count cassie who is stupidly kept out of the line in the movie anyone who can catch a local civic light opera production of the play will have a much richer experience than seeing this poorly conceived film
<START> barbara stanwyck as a real tough cookie a waitress to the working classes and prostitute at the hands of her father who escapes to new york city and uses her feminine wiles to get a filing job moving on to mortgage and escrow and later as assistant secretary to the second in command at the bank dramatic study of a female character unafraid to be unseemly has lost none of its power over the years with barbara acting up a storm portraying a woman who learns to be a first rate actress herself parlaying a little nietzschean philosophy into her messed up life this lady crushes out sentiment all right but she never loses our fascination our awe she's a plain spoken hard boiled broad but she's not a bitch nor is she a man eater or woman hater this gal is all out for herself and as we wait for her to eventually learn about real values in life her journey up and down the ladder of success provides heated sexy entertainment john wayne with thick black hair and too much eye make up does well in an early role as the assistant in the file office though all the supporting players are quite good from
<START> although bette davis did a wonderful job as mildred i felt that the film wasn't the best i had seen at the end of the movie i was left feeling like there was something missing in it br br bette davis did a perfect job though and she made me hate her and pity her all the while leslie howard did very good as the lovelorn philip carey and i so pitied him throughout the movie for being in love with such a horrible dame it's such a sad thing when one finds him herself in love with a bad seed and especially if it's someone like philp carey who is a sensitive person though pathetic br br in the end the acting was what came through and not the plot the ending scene was particularly good but i am not one to give it away although others may find this movie good i was one who found it so so i should recommend this movie to those who like a bad seed so they can see what may happen to them if they find themselves in love with that horrible person
<START> this movie was charming an accountant wants more from life than the approved conventional success what makes it work so well and makes it so different from the standard dance movie is that it really isn't about becoming great it is simply about finding a way to express one's self the big triumph at the end is not the winning of a contest not the discovery of a whole new life style but the simple joy of doing what you want to fulfill the other parts of your life no one is discovering their passion they are finding their quiet soul br br the japanese background makes the subtle oppression and secret life of ballroom dancing both understandable and personal we can all see ourselves in the everyman
<START> the thief of bagdad is a treasure first and foremost it is a good story though my four children's primary exposure to this tale the most famous of the stories of the arabian nights comes from the disney corporation the thief of bagdad held their interest to the end the story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability sabu who plays the young thief abu also measures up to any of today's teen actors in appeal judging from the number of times i heard my oldest daughter say he's c u t e br br in 1940 the film won oscars for cinematography and special effects today of course those effects seem very dated look it's barbie flying through the air declared my daughter at the sight of the genie flying yet they fit into the story well the film is after all over 60 years old the effects fit with the script furthermore what ones sees in the thief of bagdad remained pretty much state of the art for the next twenty five years one need only compare the opening montage from a 1967 star trek episode to see this in that it was quite an achievement br br this qualifies as a family film though there are a few stabbings near the end the acting is so obvious and the wounds so bloodless as to those scenes nearly as artificial as animation br br all in all a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment or for the historical value of the effects i recommend it
<START> the '60s is an occasionally entertaining film most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film it is extremely uneven and includes many annoying elements take for instance the switch between black white and color if done right this could of been fairly effective but because it was done poorly it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience much of the film had an odd feel to it the acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for tv flick but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times many of the events were not coherent and ending up being confusing how did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's the ending was much too sappy for my tastes because it was hollywoodized everything had to turn out right in the end i would advise you to not waste your time on the '60s and do something else with your time i'm glad i watched this in class and not on my own time i think i can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob dylan's music those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick i hope you take my advice and stay away from this
<START> i admit that i am a vampire addict i have seen so many vampire movies i have lost count and this one is definitely in the top ten i was very impressed by the original john carpenter's vampires and when i descovered there was a sequel i went straight out and bought it this movie does not obey quite the same rules as the first and it is not quite so dark but it is close enough and i felt that it built nicely on the original br br jon bon jovi was very good as derek bliss his performance was likeable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he might actually be able to survive in the world in which he lives one of my favourite parts was just after he meets zoey and wanders into the bathroom of the diner to check to see if she is more than she seems his comments are beautifully irreverant and yet emminently practical which contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds br br the other cast members were also well chosen and they knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original film it is not simply a rehash of the first movie and it has grown in a similar way to the way fright night ii grew out of fright night there are different elements which make it a fresh movie with a similar theme br br if you like vampire movies i would recommend this one if you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else
<START> i am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on stephen king's books this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorable br br i have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and i still find it heart wrenching as well as scary br br the scene where gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out and the no fair uttered by little miko hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance br br
<START> the best thing about camp films in general is that you know what to expect it's like watching a professional wrestling match or a day time soap opera or a jerry springer show you immediately can follow the skimpy plot identify the cardboard characters and watch in satisfaction while all the cliches are being fulfilled however at times the director does something real unexpected it may be something extraordinarily stupid or something weird or something insightful the director makinen is up there with the best camp directors and this is his best movie br br in yon saalistajat everything seems to come together there's nothing good about it but still manages to be a coherent whole not once does the movie slow down the action flows on and punches keep on coming br br the weirdest thing is that there's no sense of time some characters seem to take months doing something while other characters have only spent one hour at a bar this is partially due to finnish summer where the sun never sets so you don't experience the day turning into a night at all br br finally there is a plot there somewhere you may have to watch the movie three times before you realize it though
<START> i've been going through the afi's list of the top 100 comedies and i must say that this is truly one of the worst not just of the 90 movies on the list i've seen but of any movie i've ever seen drunks are funny sometimes dudley isn't liza almost made it worthwhile but alas just go watch arrested development if you want to see her in something good seriously dudley laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny i would highly recommend almost any other movie on the afi's top 100 comedies for more laughs than this if you want to see a funnier drunk try the thin man funnier movie in general any marx brothers movie will kill especially if you're as drunk as arthur
<START> the film picks up after last years remake with the military setting up electronic surveillance equipment in the desert where the attacks in the first film happened the crew is killed not long before a group of soldiers on a training exercise show up to find no one around you can fill in the rest br br this is a paycheck picture all around there seems to be no passion in anyone's performances nor in anyone behind the camera this is a movie that was made for the money and nothing else on some level this should have worked it could have been a more horrific southern comfort where national guardsmen run afoul of some people in the swamps but instead its not much of anything in large part you can blame the script written unbelievably in part by wes craven which hits the same old targets again and again add to the mess the fact that the direction is dull and the set up of sequences is so lack luster as to remove any inherent tension in any scene br br its not bad as such but badly made and dull let me put my feelings into context the reason i saw this film was because a local multiplex screwed up and ran this film instead of the kids flick the last mimzy and i wanted to see what caused the out cry i mean the films have so much in common he says sarcastically i'm convinced that this film will only scare those who like the last mimzy
<START> my interest was raised as i was flipping through and saw the name iphigenia my name is eugenia so i thought ok lets see what this is i am so glad i stayed on the channel what a wonderful wonderful story drama sadness some over the top acting but a wonderful time to be had i watch this and it makes me sad for all the drivel the movie industry puts out and these beautiful little gems get passed over give iphigenia a try and i hope you will enjoy it as much as i did i have even gotten my children 27 25 20 and 17 to enjoy it it starts slow however the drama builds and you will be drawn in to the story watching this lovely film made me want to shroud myself in more greek tragedy and pathos
<START> bette davis' electrifying performance is such that it is hard to remember the other female players they were as perfect in their parts as davis was in hers they just didn't have as much to do some of the reviewers felt that the book was so much better it was but to give the film it's due to condense a 600 page book down to 83 minutes is no mean feat the first part of the book didn't even make it to the screen it told of phillip's childhood then moved to germany and paris where phillip had gone to try to make good as an artist it also chronicles his first romance with fanny price who kills herself when she realises phillip cannot return her feelings of love it is a wonderful book but rambling and i think that anyone who does not think too highly of the film should read the book and will realise how good the film is br br after realising that he will only ever be a mediocre painter phillip carey leslie howard comes back to england hoping to take up medicine when out at a tearoom he meets a sullen waitress mildred bette davis even though she has no interest in him and basically treats him like dirt phillip is obsessed it is so hard to watch his efforts at trying to find any civility in this vicious shrew in one scene she promises to meet him in a second class railway waiting room when they almost miss each other she berates him with why would i wait in a second class waiting room when there is a first class one available you just want to shake him the only time she is pleasant to him is when she tells him she is going to marry another man a coarse sales man emile miller alan hale with mildred out of the picture he meets nora kay johnson a lovely woman who writes romantic novels under a male pseudonym she jokes about the popularity the books enjoy among servants in the novel he had seen mildred reading them nora gives phillip all the love and confidence he needs but he is incapable of returning her love when mildred returns miller didn't marry her and she is having a baby of course he takes care of her and helps her with the baby in the film it is treated as an object always called baby never given a name or gender she repays him by running off with his best friend br br at the hospital he meets sally athelny frances dee who is visiting her sick father he begins to visit her home and for the first time in his life gets a sense of family then surprise surprise mildred returns like a bad penny and surprise philip takes her in but he has changed and feels only disgust when she tries to show gratitude the only way she knows how then follows one of the most vicious verbal fights on film with phrases such as you cad you dirty swine i only kissed you because you begged me and when you went i wiped my mouth i wiped my mouth in the book a lot of mildred's stock phrases such as you're a gentleman in every sense of the word i don't mind and mr high and mighty were associated with prostitutes and when phillip meets her for the first time he is struck by that br br the end of the film shows phillip being truly free of mildred in the only way possible now free to love sally again in the book sally tells phillip that she thinks she is having a baby but that just makes him more sure of his love that ending like mildred's sickness could not be in the film even a pre code one br br kay johnson was always called on to play sensible believable women which she played to perfection as she was obviously sensible herself her nora was the woman philip should have stayed with frances dee was one of the most beautiful of screen ingenues she was obviously being groomed for stardom with some roles that proved she was not just a pretty face the silver cord and blood money but when she married joel mccrea her career started to peter out her sally did not push her talent to the limits apparently leslie howard was not very helpful to bette davis on the set he was annoyed that an english actress was not given the part he used to throw her her lines whilst reading a book off camera he did start to take an interest when a newspaper reported the kid was running away with the picture br br highly highly recommended
<START> such a long awaited movie but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day from the trailers it looked like a action movie but it turned out to be a out out comedy a bad comedy but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors they've done their part of the movie very well good acting but i don't think that can save the movie india has been shot beautifully kerala rajasthan ladakh were all saturated with color alright nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when i could go there br br action sequences were shot very shabbily no one could make out head tail of the stunts they've used akki akshay kumar very well but could've been done much much better br br animation is the worst i've seen in recent movies 90's movies had better animation scenes i guess initial scene where the car is falling off 'flying should be better word' the road into lake br br and the movies name has been mentioned nearly every 20 to 30 mins just to make sure audiences don't forget the movie name i guess
<START> viewing de vierde man aka the fourth man is a slightly unsettling and rather fascinating experience it's a very tight and intense psychological mystery thriller from netherlands's paul verhoeven he directed this film just before he got big with his free ticket to hollywood movie flesh blood in a lot of user comments on this site i noticed the mentioning of alfred hitchcock indeed this movie might very well be hitchcockian but i also noticed touches of early cronenberg the visceral flavors of david lynch surreal story linked visuals and even roman polanski plot wise set up funny thing is that the movies by those directors i was thinking of while watching de vierde man weren't made until after 1983 the year of release of the fourth man so go figure br br very much credit indeed must be given to the story of the original novel by gerard reve this movie is based on gerard reve is also the fictional name of the main character a tormented writer played by jeroen krabbÃ© balancing on the dangerous line of a severe psychosis now has anybody stopped and thought about the fact that the word rÃªve is french for dream and the film does feature a lot of dream like nightmarish sequences often to that extend that you don't always know for sure if gerard is awake or dreaming himself could this be coincidence maybe it's just me but i don't think so renÃ©e soutendijk is pretty amazing as the leading lady in a rather demanding role she sometimes seems to be guilty of over acting in a subtle way but that aspect was clearly intentional to portray the character she plays since as this movie progresses you become unsure about what to actually think of this lady and her intentions proves again what an excellent actress she is i might add that the movie contains also several scenes portraying full frontal male female nudity as well as some rather explicit sex scenes and you will even notice that some scenes and aspects clearly were the blueprints of scenes later to be shot for verhoeven's basic instinct br br another aspect this movie has is a lot of symbolism and biblical references images which supposedly made the film thoroughly hated by some conservative catholic movements at the time of its european release either way it makes the movie worthy of a second viewing now someone recently told me he had grave misgivings about de vierde man one of them being that the film supposedly manoeuvers itself into a position where it needs the divine intervention of the virgin mary to resolve itself i myself have big issues with the way catholicism has been and still is sometimes portrayed in many movies in any genre so not only when it comes to religiously themed horror movies but surprisingly i had no misgivings whatsoever when it comes to the fourth man although the virgin mary aspect in the plot did make me scratch my head at one point i also had fun with it in a way i think the keyword as to why it didn't bother me at all is 'duality' because this movie works on two levels although 'divine intervention' might have resolved the plot line from the protagonist's point of view on the other hand the movie implies that all this might have been the delirious ramblings of a raving madman and that's the fun part you never know for sure and then there's the question could it be that gerard reve was somehow receiving distorted visions of things to come like receiving omens at one point in the movie gerard even tries to fool christine into believing he is clairvoyant the way he is playing christine in that particular scene is exquisite to behold br br so with its compelling story convincing acting performances and adequate direction de vierde man is a very much recommended viewing indeed especially if you enjoy a solid european psychological horror film but make sure you see the original dutch version not the dubbed one
<START> alain chabat is a fine actor writer and director but maybe a trifle misguided to take an 'idea' credit for a story that probably had them rolling in the aisles when aristophanes was still learning that it's 'i' before 'e' except after 'c' but like i said chabat is a fine actor and he can do charm when he needs to i'm also gradually overcoming an aversion to charlotte gainsbourg who also turns in an accomplished performance if you absolutely insist on knowing the 'plot' is the one about the guy well into his forties and more than content to be single this doesn't sit well with his mother and five sisters and to get them off his back he makes an 'arrangement' with the sister of a colleague to pose for fifteen thousand euros as his new girlfriend allow the romance to come to fruition with a wedding and then jilt him thus getting him off the hook naturally they wind up together but along the way there's some sub benedek and beatrice duelling and all things considered it's a pretty painless ninety minutes and performing so well at the french box office that a sequel may not be out of the question
<START> i went to see this movie expecting a nice relaxing time in the theater with my younger sister instead i had to really control myself in order to convince her that i was not scared in many ways still a childrenÂ´s story but with a screenplay that has a lot of potential could have been one of the scariest movies if planned for another audience
<START> greetings again from the darkness insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist how strange for most of us to see someone who must work no matter the conditions else his reason for living ceases to see goldsworthy's sculptures come alive and to see his reaction to each is extremely voyeuristic this artist creates because he must not for money or fame it is his lifeforce when you see his failures energy seems to expel from his body like a burst hot air balloon it is not the dread of beginning again it is that he takes his energy from his work watching him create just to have nature takeover and recall his work is somewhat painful but nonetheless breathtaking he discusses flow and time in the minimal dialog and there appears to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one in the same when he says he needs the earth but it does not need him i beg to differ only complaint is the musical score seems to slow down further a pace that is relaxing at best
<START> now either you like mr carrey's humour or you don't me myself and irene had audiences both walking out in droves and on the other hand cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth bruce almighty is a bit more mainstream but you have been warned br br if you're not sure watch the trailer i saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when i saw the film if you don't find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny don't bother with the movie br br carrey a reporter stuck in a rut covering 'lighter news' berates god when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot god takes up the challenge and asks carrey if he can do better carrey gets into the swing of having all of god's powers by making his girlfriend jennifer aniston 's breasts bigger getting himself promoted and answering everyone's prayers by single stroke computer commands br br this is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable but it is very well made within it's very limited intent provides almost continuous laughs to carrey fans and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow minded god squadders and anti god squadders br br on the more thoughtful level the film tempts us to speculate about carrey's own career stuck in his 'comedy' typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two golden globes his most accomplished 'straight' role the man on the moon is less well known that his comedy romps or the truman show on which the academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing carrey
