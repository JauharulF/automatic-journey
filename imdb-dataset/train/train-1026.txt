<START> if the myth regarding broken mirrors would be accurate everybody involved in this production would now face approximately 170 years of bad luck because there are a lot of mirrors falling to little pieces here if only the script was as shattering as the glass then the broken would have been a brilliant film now it's sadly just an overlong derivative and dull movie with only just a handful of remarkable ideas and memorable sequences sean ellis made a very stylish and elegantly photographed movie but the story is lackluster and the total absence of logic and explanation is really frustrating i got into a discussion with a friend regarding the basic concept and meaning of the film he thinks ellis found inspiration in an old legend claiming that spotting your doppelganger is a foreboding of how you're going to die interesting theory but i'm not familiar with this legend and couldn't find anything on the internet about this neither personally i just think the broken is yet another umpteenth variation on the theme of invasion of the body snatchers but without the alien interference the broken centers on the american mcvey family living in london and particularly gina when a mirror spontaneously breaks during a birthday celebration this triggers a whole series of mysterious and seemingly supernatural events gina spots herself driving by in a car and follows her mirror image to an apartment building whilst driving home in a state of mental confusion she causes a terrible car accident and ends up in the hospital when dismissed gina feels like her whole surrounding is changing she doesn't recognize her own boyfriend anymore and uncanny fragments of the accident keep flashing before her eyes does she suffer from mental traumas invoked by the accident or is there really a supernatural conspiracy happening all around her writer director sean ellis definitely invokes feelings of curiosity and suspense in his script but unfortunately he fails to properly elaborate them the broken is a truly atmospheric and stylish effort but only after just half an hour of film you come to the painful conclusion it shall just remain a beautiful but empty package there's a frustratingly high amount of fake suspense in this film this means building up tension through ominous music and eerie camera angels when absolutely nothing has even happened so far by the time the actually mysteriousness kicks in these tricks don't have any scary effect on you anymore some of my fellow reviewers around here compare the film and particularly sean ellis' style with the repertoires of david lynch stanley kubrick and even alfred hitchcock but that is way way Â way too much honor ps what is up with that alternate spelling the one with the scandinavian Ã¸
<START> i don't know what they were thinking by they i mean anybody even remotely connected to this disaster i've seen so bad movies i've seen so really bad movies and then there's this but i will say one thing whoever wrote the script has manged to put what could possibly the most inane dialogue over written onto the screen there is nothing good about this movie either from a technical standpoint or any other standpoint whoever allowed it to be made and then released should have been fired immediately there are a few fairly well known names in this movie actually i hesitate to use the word movie it's more like a collection of random scenes that have no relation to another and make less than 0 sense anyway i fail to see why anyone with any dignity would appear in this i got it really cheap and i still got ripped of even if i had gotten this movie for free i would still have been ripped off this is an absoluter 0 10
<START> two sorcerers battle in the fourth dimension one brian thompson as a kabal trying to destroy the earth the other jeffrey combs as a anton mordrid trying to save it doctor mordrid is an enjoyable fantasy fare which offers plenty of cheese the plot is pretty silly and the gore is completely absent but the film is very short and entertaining so if you have enough time to kill give this one a look my rating 7 out of 10
<START> after ''empire strikes back'' ''return of the jedi'' is my second favorite movie from the star wars series br br luke went to tattoine to save han solo from jabba at the same time the galactic empire is doing in secret the construction of a new space station like the previous death star if this station stays totally constructed it will be the end of the rebel alliance both vader and the emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new death star and they need to kill many of their commanders to have the project made in schedule br br r2 and c3po are inside jabba's palace to send a message from luke to jabba where lukes pretends to negotiate han's life he gives r2 and c3po as a gift to jabba as part of his plan jabba does not accept the negotiation since he is using han solo as a piece of his palace's decoration han still is frozen in carbonite lando is hidden as jabba's guard and chewbacca is also gave to jabba by a reward hunter when the same hunter tries to save han solo and makes him stay in human form again we see that is actually princess leia in a disguise the problem is that jabba discovers leia's plan and takes her as his slave while han is thrown away in chewbacca's cell br br luke comes as a jedi knight to rescue his friends at his first try to kill jabba he falls into jabba's monster cell bantha but easily kills it jabba stays angry and decides to thrown han chewbacca and luke to sarlacc a big creature from the desert who stays 1 000 years digesting it's 'food' luke han and chewie has success in scape again and even boba fett dies when han accidentally throws him in to sarlacc's mouth leia kills jabba and goes after han luke and chewie as well c3po and r2 br br everybody's safe again luke decides to go to dagoba to complete his training as a jedi as well his promise to yoda the problem is that yoda is too old and sick since he already has 900 years old and before he dies yoda says to luke that he does not need more training but to really be a jedi he must fight with vader again he confirms to luke that vader is luke's dad and that there is another skywalker besides luke in his last moments yoda asks to luke to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side and to luke transmit his jedi knowledge to other people when yoda dies obi wan's spirit shows up to luke and tells him that luke's father killed his good side anakin to become darth vader and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a sith luke stays worried about killing his own dad and says that he feels that his father still has kindness obi wan tells luke that his twin sister is leia and says the reasons why luke and leia were separated since babies he gives his last advice to luke saying that if he refuses to kill vader the emperor will win the war br br at the same time the emperor says to vader that he must give luke to him when he shows up since luke is stronger than before and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring luke to the dark side br br now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war series when the rebel alliance plans to attack the new space station the '' death star 2'' luke will confront vader and the emperor and leia han and chewie needs to turn off the 'death star 2' power field with the help of the ewoks little creatures who looks little bears br br this is for sure one of the most exciting star wars of all
<START> this movie does have some great noirish neorealist visuals and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of hollywood's sugar coating which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film but some of the scenes go on for much too long the wedding especially and i found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialog to be more fit for the stage than for the silver screen br br the dialog was particularly distracting and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on most of the characters were either italian americans or italian immigrants living in new york in the twenties and thirties but their dialog sounded like they were practicing lines for a shakespeare play while they mixed cement and laid bricks toward the end i was laughing and not because the filmmakers wanted me to i guess the stilted poetry could be defended by saying that the characters would have been speaking italian and the dialog is a literal translation of how they would really talk but it absolutely did not work for me br br another line of dialog made me laugh for a different reason the main character's son born and raised in new york in the 1920's suddenly picks up a lovely lilting british accent i'm only guessing this had something to do with the fact that the movie was made in england br br i give this movie an 'a' for effort and intention but a considerably lower grade for execution
<START> come on the new twist is nearly ok but from avenging the elm street children freddy is just killing people now more of the same special effects with no actual character development or anything simply bad and insulting scary nope not at all just bad
<START> the animation was good the imagery was good although not totally original however the story was too long way too confusing and over the top dramatic after about an hour i couldn't wait to get it over with with so many characters that have nothing to contribute and plot elements that either come from nowhere or go nowhere this movie really wasn't one movie at all and would have been better of as a short series or possibly two movies if you like this kind of typical story maybe you will like it but frankly i've been spoiled by much more creative stories that actually have some sort message to tell go rent a miyazaki film and watch it twice you'll get way more out of it
<START> this movie which was released directly on video should carry a warning label that it is dangerous to human health and may subject the viewer to terminal boredom it is yet another thinly veiled evangalizing rapture religious movie with the good guys the believers suddenly vanishing and the bad guys the non believers left behind it's an interesting concept especially since we see it happen on a flight captained by a non believer who is having a sinful affair with a stewardess aboard needless to say that sinner doesn't disappear either unhappily with all the pilots being non believers the plane did not crash or the movie would have been mercifully over though this could have be interesting without the heavy religious browbeating as a whole the plodding movie makes one gag the acting is horrible and the obviously computer generated simulations are very fake looking plus it's yet another movie shot in canada that purports to be new york city spare me i'll just read the bible
<START> this film is quite simply brilliant the cinematography is good the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking this is the story of donald woods a white south african who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid kevin kline is completely convincing so much so that when donald woods himself appeared on tv some years later i recognised him from kline's portrayal denzel washington also turns in a masterful performance as ever br br i urge you to watch this it is long but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story remember folks this really happened
<START> squeamish 11 year old luke benward as billy worm boy forrester moves to a new town at his new school young benward is picked on by the other boys they put worms in his thermos getting his gag reflex under control benward tosses a worm on freckle faced bully adam hicks as joe guire benward bets he can eat 10 worms in one day without regurgitation br br tall teased hallie kate eisenberg as erika erk tansy uses her archery skills to help benward director and former sctv writer bob dolman promises no worms were harmed in the making of this movie in a related note sctv star andrea martin has one funny scene how to eat fried worms is loosely based on thomas rockwell's popular novel pre teen kids into gross outs should enjoy the film br br how to eat fried worms 8 25 06 bob dolman luke benward adam hicks hallie kate eisenberg alexander gould
<START> i saw this movie on mystery science theater 300 it sucked so much if i hadn't been watching it on mst3k i probably would've thrown it out the window the characters were incredibly lame and it didn't provide much of a plot in my opinion
<START> claire denis' debut is both a brave and self assured one in this depiction of life towards the end of french colonialist cameroon she explores the relationships between men and women black and white br br with the black servant 'protÃ©e' as the film's primary object of desire and oppression the film enters taboo territory from the beginning denis builds a picture of life through a series of character relationships that keep the informed viewer fixed to the screen the mood of the film is captured perfectly by the camera work and lack of lighting br br a great discourse
<START> dear readers br br the final battle between the rebellion and empire the second death star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the rebel alliance luke skywalker now a jedi knight returns from tatooine with han solo and princess leia now revealed as luke's twin sister they agree to lead the attack on the shield generator on the forest moon of endor while lando calrissian leads the attack on the death star little do they know that a most ingenious trap has been laid for them and the emperor palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the second death star br br return of the jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy it's got action drama romance great battles fantastic acting amazing fight scenes and awesome music by john williams mark hamill is fully matured now into a jedi knight gone is the naive farm boy and in his place is a calm relaxed jedi determined to save the galaxy leia is still cool in this film as well as han and lando 3p0 r2 and chewie do their roles to a t while james earl jones still is cinema's greatest villain darth vader ian mcdiarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless emperor palpatine the action sequences of this movie are breathtakingly amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty john williams's score is still cool and enhances the film by several levels br br signed the constant dvd collector
<START> i was blown away by the re imagined battlestar galactica a show that always kept me guessing and brought me to tears on more than one occasion a hardened sci fi fan i like to think i can pick out the good stuff from the bs and this was good stuff br br as such when i first heard about the prospect of a prequel series some months ago i got a sick feeling in my gut i was afraid that the formula that made battlestar so successful would be reused in caprica which wouldn't work at all bsg's story of a mournful ragged band of survivors trapped aboard decaying star ships and guided by prophetic vision and a sequence of pseudo miracles was perfectly complimented by extraordinary music and a better cast of actors br br caprica feels different where bsg takes place after the fall of a great civilization caprica portrays that civilization in it's cold and decadent heyday the overall vibe i got from caprica was similar to that of minority report minus excessive and counterproductive theatricality in true bsg form caprica has in it's first few hours of programming already tackled the issues of religious freedom racism the morality of playing god and the nature of the human soul br br the casting for caprica is also excellent each character is unique and deep from the obsessive and distant scientist turned entrepreneur to his troubled and willful daughter each actor and actress throws themselves into their respective roles br br music which was used so powerfully in bsg also plays a significant role in caprica battlestar's powerful rolling drums and mournful duduks served it's themes very well caprica uses a more orchestral sound which gives the show it's own feeling quite distinct from either of it's predecessors br br the new caprica is definitely it's own show pulling from the battlestar franchise only as much as it needs i look forward to the full series
<START> normally the best way to annoy me in a film is to include some reference to orson welles but here is a sci fi comedy quoting the war of the worlds broadcast and it is gold the very concept of a small bunch of diminutive aggressive and stupid aliens being mistaken as kids in halloween dress is magnificent don't be fooled by the notion that because it seems like a kids' movie it is unsophisticated it isn't there's a lot of hidden treasure a gem
<START> bear in mind any film let alone documentary which asserts any kind of truth will generate an adverse and proportional amount of cynicism from those to whom any suggestion of and or search for truths is already meaningless those of you who are already masters of psychology film and captains of the soul will no doubt find this movie redundant after all you already know everything there is to know congrats br br for those of us in the minority like myself i found the perverts guide to cinmea mostly brilliant and worth watching for those interested in movies psychology and modern philosophy br br a little like scott mclouds' understanding comics director sophie fiennes inter grates slovene philosopher psychologist and social critic slavoj zizek right into many of the films and specif scenes he discusses the cover is an image from the birds zizek takes a boat out to re create the shot br br lacanian psycho analysis does not necessarily scream an evening of great fun but it is if you like movies that is having some knowledge of lacanian psycho analysis helps symbolic real and imaginary are terms which get thrown around a little loosely at first but the scenes which zizek selects and analyze make remarkably clear what was always for me a very abstract subject in fact it's probably better to have a familiarity with the films he's discussing than with the terminology he uses which becomes clearer as the film goes on br br why i love this film isn't because it picks great films to analyze or reveals great truths about lacan but shows in a very practical and clever manner where film and psychology and by default philosophy meet br br why is the sound of music kinda fascistic why is short cuts about more than just class and alienation why do the birds attack in the birds what is there to learn about the mind from alien resurrection what does the planet of solaris want what does psycho and the marx brothers have to do with each other and what the hell is david lynch getting across in movie after movie well zizek has some ideas br br the role of the voice in both the excorcist and star wars revenge of the sith is maybe the movies strongest and most lucid moment when he gets into feminine sexual subjectivity i begin to wonder at one point zizek admits his feeling that flowers are a kind of decorative vagina dentatta that they are disgusting and should be hidden from children jokingly it seems but br br anyway it's a fascinating documentary which anyone who has ever seen a movie and thought it meant something more than was literally stated should make an attempt to see br br and anyone interested in slavoj zizek this is a must as well much less dry than reality of the virtual and more direct than zizek two other pseudo docs about the elvis of contemporary cultural criticism as he is being dubbed in the english speaking world br br the perverts guide to cinema is not about the role of sex in cinema zizek claims cinema is the ultimate pervert art because it teaches how to desire and not what to desire and that it is the only contemporary art form that can allow for these desires to be articulated this is not a film about finding the reality in cinema it's about finding the cinema in reality and how important and exciting that can be hard to find and a bit long but well worth the trouble one of the most stimulating movie watching experiences i've ever had
<START> im not usually a lover of musicals but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be oliver this film is so well made the characters are well depicted the costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are great my favourite being 'reviewing the situation'sung by ron moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of fagin i wasn't old enough to see oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs usually it was 'who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film its a timeless musical you definitely couldn't remake it it stands on its own its not accurate to the book and i don't think it would have worked so well if it had been i don't think charles dickens would be disappointed as he wrote oliver to depict the poverty in london the orphanages the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive and the film portrays this very well also another great reason to watch this film is bullseye the old type english bull terrier notice his long thin legs this was bred out of the breed many years ago they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him and he is exactly how an english bull terrier would have looked in victorian times notice he has scars which is probably makeup on his face bill sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit a victorian bull terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit his a beautiful dog any way and notice he disobeys bill sykes after he has killed nancy he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head bill sykes thought he was this is a great musical to watch if you like musicals and if you don't like musicals give it a try any way there's something for everyone in this film
<START> all dogs go to heaven plays on the canine criminal underworld the film is a delight for children with a comical and dark but satisfying and happy ending storyline with plenty of song and dance it features outcast charlie a fellow canine criminal who is murdered but returns from the dead he meets a homeless human girl who looks up to him and through this relationship he realizes the meaning of life and self sacrifice this is a cute animation loved very much through my eyes as a child i would highly recommend this film to children i'm unsure about how adults would react to it i tried to watch it a few years ago on vhs but those recordings don't last long do they
<START> for his first ever debut this film has some riveting and chilling moments in the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach tightens every moment during this film the ending is superb the makers of blaire witch obviously watched this film it's ending wasn't an end but a beginning of the end a great movie and only a piece of japan's great as far as scare factor a perfect score it makes you think and scared out of your mind
<START> i sit through movies like tiempo de valientes and i want to talk about cinema for hours the admiration this movie caused me is beyond my own limits of explanation because i'm watching the scenes of the film and i search inside my thoughts for film making ideas and dialogue innovations that could emerge from something bigger than damian szifron's mind br br looking the environment so uncompromised so simple i'm thinking this man is a genius no wonder he created what is probably the best television show argentina ever witnessed and then a first movie full of elements some contemporary directors haven't still achieved el fondo del mar is the name and it awakened a few years ago my enthusiasm for our everyday cinema br br starting his journey from people's daily real lives szifron goes where pablo trapero never could in el bonaerense the federal police department's life trapero's film was a journey into a man's mind and experiences not into the places he saw yes there was a detailed training and lots of crime situations but szifron in in there his is more of a detective story like the ones we know and love with the mysteries and the thrilling music br br but there's a lot of humanity in his writing and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of his main characters alfredo dÃ­az and mariano silverstein there are a lot of actors of great caliber in the film but these two actors are the ones the film can't do without the first character luis luque is a detective that has just found out his wife cheats on him and has to work on a case br br the second one is a psychiatrist that is assigned the treatment of the detective he wants to deal with him in regular sessions but the sheriff takes advantage of the time disposition and suggests he joins dÃ­az in his routines it's nothing the usual stuff no problem but it is bigger than that and it will unfold a part of the doctor's personality he didn't know br br the relationship developed between the two leads can't be explained unless it is observed because it regards such a complexity that demonstrates how talented are some men like szifron that are trying today to leave a signature in our history reaching points of unbelievable spontaneity during a high pressure situation dÃ­az tells silverstein how do we continue our treatment and silverstein answers no i'm not your doctor you call me to have dinner i'm your friend we laugh because we can't help it br br and we can't help laughing when dÃ­az crashes a car in the street and doesn't gives importance to it or when he trespasses all the red lights in the street or when he smokes pot in his police patrol and silverstein can't believe it but then smokes it too because he's screwed up or when silverstein tries to be friendly with dÃ­az's robber friends magic from diego peretti is what we receive there he a psychiatrist himself gives a performance in plan locas de amor but impresses with all his range luis luque on the other hand is back on track with a top notch portrayal that reminds us the great actor he is br br there's a passion i have for this and as i said i could write about it for hours but unfortunately that's not the way it works and i have to be precise and summarize although i have to watch a lot of the old movies and study them i could assure that tiempo de valientes is the comedy argentina had been waiting for and never gotÂuntil now
