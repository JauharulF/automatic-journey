<START> before i start i love eddie izzard i think he's one of the funniest stand ups around today possibly that means i'm going into this with too high expectations but i just didn't find eddie funny in this outing br br i think the main problem is eddie is trying too hard to be eddie everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic and we all love him for it but in circle he appears to be going more for irrelevant than funny and completely lost me in places many of the topics he covers he has covered before i even think i recognised a few recycled jokes in there br br if you buy the dvd you'll find a behind the scenes look at eddie's tour interesting in places but not very funny and a french language version of one of his shows die hards will enjoy seeing eddie in a different language but subtitled comedy isn't very funny br br if you're a fan of eddie you've either got this already or you're going to buy it whatever i say if you're just passing through buy glorious or dressed to kill you won't be disappointed with circle you probably will
<START> i finally caught up to starlight last night on television and all i can say is wow it's hard to know where to begin the incredibly hokey special effects check out the laser beams shooting out of willie's eyes the atrocious acting the ponderous dialogue the mismatched use of stock footage or the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production this truly is a one of a kind experience and we should all be thankful for that i nominate jonathon kay as the true heir to ed wood
<START> girlfight is using a well known formula as someone pointed out however i have seen plenty of movies that don't do it this well or that are not this credible i believe it is in the end easier for a woman to empathize the character and that way feel more touched by the movie br br the movie is encouraging both mentally and physically even if your life and environment were completely different and i think the viewer can still gain a lot by seeing this although it took me 5 years to start boxing and sports in general this is the movie that gave me the spark br br so the plot is familiar common actors are good but the thoughts that it can spark are what make it above average in my opinion it made a big impression on me and i know i'm not the only one
<START> four great stories from master robert bloch adapted to the screen by the best actors in the field in the early seventies are the base of this excellent amicus' production this was a kind of movie very popular in the sixties till the mid seventies and it's one of my favorite type of horror movies this one in particular shines for the episode sweets to the sweet where christopher lee is stalked by his evil little girl child heiress to her mother tradition great fun from start to finish and good to very good are also the other three episodes with the last one a bit on the comic side but with the great addition of ingrid pitt the most famous vampress of the english cinema
<START> the kids i took to this movie loved it four children ages 9 to 12 years they would have given it 10 stars emma roberts was adorable in the title role expect to see more of this next generation roberts in the future after being over exposed to the likes of britney spears lindsay lohan and paris hilton it was refreshing to see a girl who didn't look like she worked the streets also enjoyed seeing a supporting cast that included tate donovan rachel leigh cook barry bostwick and monica parker with a cameo by bruce willis final takeaway cute film br br note i did not read the book series so my comments are based on the merits of the film alone
<START> yeah pretty sure i saw this movie years ago when it was about the supremes br br another recycled storyline glitzed up hollywood style borrowing scripts from better making it in the music industry films br br nothing original here br br more make up glammier costumes and choreography more money for the questionably talented beyonce draw br br if you like the throwback style you should appreciate actual groups who struggled without having digitized voices and a hollywood empire br br beyonce's involvement makes this hypocritical garbage
<START> a really great movie and true story dan jansen the greatest skater ever a touching and beautiful movie the whole family can enjoy the story of jane jansens battle with cancer and dan jansen love for his sister of a important promise made by jansen to win a gold medal to prove his sister jane was right to believe in his talent in speed skating was justified this picture is well worth the time i wish they would make more films of this quality thank you for a great film with excellent actors and an excellent story it is a very touching story about a beautiful family support and faith for their children and a special dream for their youngest son and his sister
<START> this is a re imagining of tarzan in the era of the soloflex and apocalypse now there's nothing inherently wrong with using films eased moral constraints to portray an erotic side to the tarzan legend there's nothing inherently wrong with the premise that tarzan doesn't speak there's plenty wrong with suggesting a woman who could get herself to an african jungle in 1910 could be this offensively stupid and plastic bo has as few lines as possible when bodies are explored because this movie is merely a video centerfold as neutral as possible so that you can project yourself and your lecherous fantasies into the project if it succeeds anywhere it's in the implication that national geographic has influenced the way the imagery of a tarzan movie might be constructed br br it would be ridiculous to argue that movies shouldn't employ the sexual tease as one of many tools to draw in viewers some really great film moments incorporate it but this move is at the opposite end of the spectrum the tease is the only thing going on here at the time of its release and now you sit through awful dumb scenes that offer no interest and miles of footage of bad acting to drool over the next peek at either of two bodies yes bo derek and miles o'keeffe are beautiful um congratulations on having a working libido but if that's your excuse for giving this schlock a good rating you really should visit a porn store and stock up there's only a hairs breadth difference between the two formats and i'm just guessing here a horny viewer would probably really enjoy the latter the question is whether a mainstream movie is the best venue in the marketplace for viewers to seek out products that satisfy lust alone br br as a showman john derek successfully capitalized on the sexual mystique developed over wife bo in the movie 10 and created a media event out of a shallow project whose only merit was the hotness of the two leads the movie itself was beside the point he was about 20 years ahead of his time in thinking audiences would applaud him for making an insipid shallow movie that was only about showcasing superficiality br br as a director john derek appears to require only that mrs derek look pleasant empty and hump able in every scene it's hideously shot the camera placement is annoying in terms of editing the entire 'wipe' catalog is exhausted the credit sequence is garish and it's a toss up as to who commits the worse screen offense bo derek who's such a bimbo that she can't even figure out how to play a bimbo or richard harris who shouts every line as he likes to do until you want to shoot him at least with bo you can imagine her blaming some horny writer for shortchanging her
<START> awlright damn it the moocow will grudgingly admit the truth i kinda' like this cheap cheesy 70's parody the idea that vast hordes of killer tomatoes are destroying the us is a great idea and in spite of itself the moovie does provide some decent chuckles moostly the sight of terrified extras running away from large obviously fake tomatoes this film along with the kentucky fried moovie is one of the earlier attempts at spoofs which became so popular in the 80's 90's thanks largely to airplane this one like moost spoofs is pretty poor many attempts at humor are dismal failures and will induce much groaning but thanks to the ravenous tomatoes hordes the obnoxious puberty love song and the awesome helicopter crash scene attack of the killer tomatoes does provide some goods though largely for the wrong reasons there are sooooo many things wrong with this film and so right it's hard to explain enough people must also have enjoyed it as the tomatoes made a comeback in 2 moore films and a cartoon series large chunks of time spent away from the tomatoes are pretty dull and dig those 70's clothes dude 8 this tomato is seedy and cheesy but worth a chuckle or two the moocow says grab a pizza and pop in the tomatoes Â
<START> tarzan and his mate 1934 was the only tarzan movie i didn't see when i was a kid it sounded boring now i have seen it i have seen the ape man 1932 about a hundred times and i keep a copy on my drive it's a remarkable movie it's almost flawless tarzan and his mate 1934 however falters it's not harmonic and it's parts tend to live a life of there own the parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great big budget expensive tarzan himself is co starring jane dominates she have developed and have become a jungle girl so sexy i tend to forget about criticism and sing her praise instead well she let her be duped by a crock who steels a kiss from her and later murder an elephant she insists tarzan to carry a bracelet who belonged to her father forever the thing would split to pieces the moment he went about his businesses in the jungle stupid later someone founds it in the river well it's supposed to proof tarzan is dead some cheap drama the crocks who has an obvious interest in a dead tarzan convince jane that he is gone she takes their words for granted and want to be taken away to england stupid jane seems to have forgot how tough tarzan is how hard he is to kill the caravan is leaving and jane go along again a pothole she could easily make the caravan rest for a few hours or more to pick up a few things and say goodbye to the jungle and her dead husband she could be smart she could dive where they found the floating bracelet check the banks for traces she can make fire in 15 seconds and swing in liana's picking up traces shouldn't be too hard for jungle jane she could talk to the apes and so on if she get home to england without have done this she would become miserable jane is smart but cheap drama brings her down and why on earth is she letting the kiss rapist get away with i blame myself as much as you a punishment for being vane perhaps nonsense struggle a hard slap and telling tarzan would be appropriate still this movie is far from bad even if the potholes are many and sometimes deep just lean back and enjoy it's tarzan and jane for god sake
<START> i rented this one on dvd without any prior knowledge i was suspicious seeing michael madsen appearing in a movie i have never heard of but it was a freebie so why not check it out br br well my guess is that mr blonde would very much like to forget he's ever taken part in such a shame of a film br br apparently if your script and dialogs are terrible even good actors cannot save the day not to mention the amateur actors that flood this film too many non native english speakers play parts of native english speakers reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not having been made into a movie it's unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound the music is awful and totally out of place and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play br br i recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other better movies this is why i gave it a 3 instead of the 1 it deserves
<START> full house is a great show i am still today growing up on it i started watching it when i was 8 and now i am 12 and still watching it i fell in love with all of the characters especially stephanie she is my favorite she had such a sense of humor in case there are people on this sight that hardly watch the show you should because you will get hooked on it i became hooked on it after the first show i saw which just happened to be the first episode in 2002 it really is a good show i really think that this show should go down to many generations in families and it's great too because it is an appropriate show for all ages and for all parents it teaches kids lessons on how to go on with their life nothing terrible happens like violence or swearing it is just a really great sit com i give it 5 out of 5 stars what do you think oh and the best time to watch it is when you are home sick from school or even the old office it will make you feel a lot better trust me i am hardly home sick but i still know that it will make you feel better and to everybody that thinks the show is stupid well that's too bad for you because you won't get as far in life even if you are happy with your life you really should watch it and you will get hooked on it i am just telling you what happened to me and everybody else that started watching this awesome show well i need must go to have some lunch remember you must start watching full house and soon
<START> william powell is a doctor dealing with a murder and an ex wife in the ex mrs bradford also starring jean arthur eric blore and james gleason it seems that powell had chemistry going with just about any woman with whom he was teamed though he and myrna loy were the perfect screen couple the actor made a couple of other thin man type movies one with ginger rogers and this one with arthur both to very good effect br br somehow one never gets tired of seeing powell as a witty debonair professional and the ex mrs bradford is no exception the ex mrs b has mr b served with a subpoena for back alimony and then moves back in to help him solve a mystery that she's dragged him into and this isn't the first time she's done that it almost seems as though there was a bradford film before this one or that this was intended to be the first of a series of films mr b complains that his mystery writer ex is constantly bringing him into cases this time a jockey riding the favorite horse in a raise mysteriously falls off the horse and dies right before the finish line br br the solution of the case is kind of outlandish but it's beside the point the point is the banter between the couple and the interference of the ex mrs b jean arthur is quite glamorous in her role and very funny however with an actress who comes off as brainy as arthur does the humor seems intentional rather than featherbrained i suspect the writer had something else in mind say the wacky side of carole lombard when arthur hears that the police have arrived she says ah it's probably about my alimony i've been waiting for the police to take a hand in it it's more of a rib to powell rather than a serious statement it still works well and it shows how a good actress can make a part her own br br definitely worth watching as william powell and jean arthur always were
<START> as you probably already know jess franco is one prolific guy hes made hundreds upon hundreds of films many of which are crap however he managed to sneak in an occasionally quality work amongst all the assembly line exploitation succubus isn't his best work thats either the diabolical dr z or vampyros lesbos but it has many of his trademarks that make it a must for anyone interested in diving into his large catalog he combines the erotic alternating between showing full frontal nudity and leaving somethings left to the imagination and the surreal seamlessly this is a very dreamlike film full of great atmosphere i particularly liked the constant namedropping despite coming off as being incredibly pretentious its amusing to hear all of franco's influences br br still there are many users who don't like succubus and i can see where they're coming from its leisurely paced but i can deal with that more problematic is the incoherency the script here was obviously rushed and within five minutes into the film i had absolutely no idea what was going on and it never really came together from that point on those who want some substance with their style look elsewhere also if its a horror film it never really becomes scary or even suspenseful still i was entertained by all the psychedelic silliness that i didn't really mind these major flaws all too much 7 10
<START> intense actors like bruce dern jason patrick and rachel ward combine to make this modern day film noir a winner of the three i don't know who was most interesting as all offer good performances and intriguing characters br br patric does the narration in this noir playing an ex boxer and mental patient wow that alone makes for an interesting guy he looks dumb but he isn't ward is the slinky attractive cynical intelligent and compassionate co conspirator of a kidnapping plan that goes bad bruce dern also is in the mix and dern never fails to fascinate in about any film br br the movie could be considered kind of downer to the average viewer but i found it fascinating and i don't like depressing movies normally what i found was a kind of quirky crime film take a look and see if you agree this is pretty unknown film that shouldn't have that status because it's simply a good story and well done
<START> a stage company cast finds themselves terrified when a bizarre killer known as 'the fiend' targets them for death a pair of reporters and their clumsy photographer set out to work the story of 'the fiend' and find themselves targets as well just as you think our trio of heroes has the case solved you're thrown another twist that has you wondering who the killer really is according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br taking the hunchback of notre dame to hollywood producer sam katzman's lack of studio settings probably helps a face in the fog look interesting especially toward the end 1930s traffic the direction could be improved upon for example the camera angle on the fight scene is not helpful the budget appears slight under the circumstances most of the silent talkie crossover cast perform it amiably br br a face in the fog 2 1 36 robert f hill lloyd hughes june collyer al st john
<START> the plot line of no one sleeps is not a bad idea and the subject matter is of quite a bit of interest but throughout watching this film we were saying aloud these filmmakers go to the trouble of finding good locations the lighting is good makeup and hair are good why is the sound so bad throughout the film the sound was echoy garbled and much of the dialog was unintelligible br br there is some good acting in this film and i think jim thalman is really a good actor this story with some of the same actors would have been worth doing as a high budget film br br i just can't reiterate enough if you have a limited budget dedicate more to good sound sound is as much a part of a film as the image and it's worth doing right could've earned a 6
<START> i enjoyed this movie so much that i watched it twice and that is something to say about a documentary the musical score cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an imax production even though it is shot for those huge imax theaters it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system in fact this would make a perfect dvd to demo your system br br the subject is also so fascinating it is about mario andretti and his son michael i was already a fan of mario because he is the best racecar drive in history since he is the only person to win the cart championship f1 championship the daytona 500 and the indianapolis 500 the script follows the path of two cars very important to the father and son the first car is found in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster that mario ever drove and we follow restoration to gleaming perfection the other car is michael's new racecar and we follow it from cutting the mold through the race season imax lends just the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating br br paul newman who was michael amoretti's team owner at the time this movie was made narrates the film his anecdotes and witticism drawn from many years as an owner and driver lends much to the production br br the main feature is the race scenes turn up the volume here there is something about riding along at over 200 mph and the musical score that totally draws you into the screen for an experience you will not forget wow br br the final magical element is the humanity of the andretti family this god of the racing world mario andretti is loving father who proudly watches over his son's career they work together so well that every father and son should see this you can tell that they are a close family i wish we could all have that experience
<START> crazed shotgun toting incest driven revenge seeking truck drivers obsessive control disorder daddy raped me when i was 12 handcuff carrying all latex wearing prostitutes is just a few of the character you will be introduced to in this complete disgrace of a movie that can easily be viewed on any cable tv station ie skinemax at 4am on sunday nights Âand yes i know that was an entire sentence but bare with me people this is a long winded review for a short pointless film br br filmed in somewhere canada with almost no budget the plot to this freak show is trite the police in it obviously never heard of state jurisdiction because they end up chasing both miya hookers and trent idiotic anal retentive generic insecure college student all across the u s and i thought only the fbi could do that the camera is shaky the sex scenes are mediocre and the acting is so bad it might actually cause unintentional acid flashbacks to movies like ishtar and leonard part 6 br br as far as the skin scenes go which is the only reason to even rent this movie don't even think of buying it there are two of them the first one is the only one worth watching though which is the dominatrix sex scene with kari salin and insert unknown actor here he's obviously done nothing else worth noting in a seedy disgusting motel room the kind with the busted sink that drips and the soda machine outside that only has blue tonic water left in it it's all s m riding crops handcuffs hot wax and underwear licking folks and in the end he gets left in a motel room with no money and cops waiting at his door that's goes to show you guys don't let a hooker tie you up in a middle of nowhere motel room sadly though kari shows no skin worth remembering and that alone can cause deep seeded traumatic experiences for some gentlemen so that is definitely a downer towards this flick br br as for the ending snicker snicker i know you probably wouldn't mind if i revealed it to you but i won't you should spend your hard earned money for that one all in all i give it a 1 5 for action a 3 5 for skin see last paragraph and a 0 0 for acting character development or intricate plot twists br br laughing man
<START> pretty good picture about a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time if the murderer wanted to whack the dame why not just off her and let the cops try to figure out whodunnit involving all these characters in the plot is dangerous not to mention all the mouths you'd have to worry about staying shut why did the depressed lady go out to the bar when she could barely sit up in a chair or say a word are there really cops out there who are wise cracking gum popping grinning apes who approach a suspect in such a glib manner this probably played well back before the wheel was invented but it is so corny and unbelievable today catch the manic drum break by elisha cook his frenetic hammering never once matched the recording his mad facial expressions made up for the off kilter stick sync
