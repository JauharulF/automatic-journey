<START> i have anticipated the various sci fi and thriller type movies this summer but was so disappointed about this particular film while some people walked out of the film i decided to stay only to laugh along with the other moviegoers at the acting lack of suspense ridiculous ending and difficult to follow story line i found myself almost as confused as the main character in the film the only redeeming quality of the film was the soundtrack this is one of those budding star films which they later regret doing in retrospect i wouldn't even rent this one let alone pay more than 5 to see
<START> i admire 'kissing on the mouth' for its frankness Â pubic hair cutting and masturbation especially from the lead director joe swanberg they weren't afraid to show trueness to everyday private occurrences unfortunately the film falls under the 'the brown bunny' realm though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy yes it mirrors 'bunny' with a whole lot of nothing going on or too many cinematography shots focused or sincerely unfocused on absolutely nothing Â feet hands or genitals again unfortunately i can see why this film was released and why people are renting true life sex scenes and full frontal equally both male and female nudity other than that it was a complete waste of time we quickly learn of a post college male female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex boyfriend other than that we are subjected to the every day events of their boring lives she works for her parents he works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer for this all to work the dialogue has to be interesting and the acting real neither work and it's as boring as watching someone drive for an hour i e 'the brown bunny ' the only actor that stands out is kate winterich and even she does some questionable acting the dvd extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watching listening to again i admire the filmmakers especially swanberg for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower habits but overall the film falls flat it has narrations that doesn't fit the scenes too many boring everyday events and unconvincing acting that you wonder other than the soft porn factor why you rented this
<START> mean spirited and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever mike myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what jim carrey did but he should give up acting all together he is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film the sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor i have seen a lot of bad film this year but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever made
<START> i recently watched belle epoque thinking it might be wonderful as it did win an oscar for best foreign language film i was a bit underwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the film maybe the conflict i had was that from the time the movie was filmed to now the plot of a man falling for beautiful women and eventually falling for the good girl has been done so many times aside from predictability of the plot some scenes in the film felt really out of place with the storyline ex a certain event at the wedding at times the film was a bit preachy in it's ideas and in relation to the franco era the film was set in and the church the only thing the film had going for it was the cutesy moments the scenery and the character of violeta being a strong independent woman during times when women were not really associated with those characteristics
<START> panahi whose previous films such as the circle and crimson gold have seemed to range from dour to grim has produced in his new offside a funny obstreperous joyously chaotic ensemble piece that ends on a note of liberation and heartfelt fun Â yet the movie deals with material quite as challenging and relevant as anything else he's done by focusing on a group of ardent girl soccer fans caught sneaking into the pre world cup bahrain iran match in tehran stadium panahi brings up issues of national spirit and independent mindedness and the contradictions Â and sheer absurdity Â of the regime's religious gender apartheid in a world of modern competition with a majority youth population and urban girls who increasingly think for themselves br br as the film opens we breathlessly join one of the girls in a bus with a father pursing a lost daughter this one has a disguise and has national colors as warpaint but we cringe with her in the knowledge of what's going to happen she's still easily spotted the thing is most of the men around don't really care still rules are rules and once they try to make it through the various checkpoints on the way into the big stadium the would be soccer girls or some of them anyway get rounded up and held in a little compound upstairs in the stadium by some mostly young green and rustic soldier cops who have no idea how to deal with these big city girls' independent ideas and would rather be watching the game Â whose roar we constantly hear in the background Â themselves each girl is different Â represents a different set of reasons for wanting to break the rules and different ways of doing it one wore a soldier's uniform and got into the officers' section one is tough and masculine and mocking and provocative she could pass for a pretty boy and teasingly hints at that are you a girl or a boy which would you like me to be one doesn't care very much about soccer but went to honor a dead comrade one aida sadeghi is an ardent soccer player herself Â and so on these tehrani girls are stubborn and smart and they walk all over the uptight rural lieutenant in charge of them safar samandar one of the rural cops mohamad kheirabadi takes the girl soccer player to the men's restroom of course there's no ladies' forcing her to wear a poster of an italian football star as a mask a comedy of errors and chaos follows in which the girl escapes br br later a spiffy looking van comes with an officer who directs the cops to take the girls to the vice department Â violating sexual segregation rules qualifies as vice a male gets mixed in with them Â a kid who's chronically guilty of smuggling fireworks into the games the van turns out not to be so spiffy the radio aerial is broken but one cop holds it in place so they can listen to the increasingly heart stopping reportage cops and prisoners are all joined in a common excitement now there's no score the game goes to penalty kicks and the winner will go to germany br br in the background through all this is a real game a real stadium and real masses of young men crazy about the outcome of this event the excitement is tremendous and the streets are jammed with cars and flags and a milling mob of supporters praying for an iranian win and united in their excitement br br what makes this film so good as may be clear by now is that it's shot during the evening of an actual game with a real finale that turns everything around this in contrast to panahi's previous highly calculated narrative trajectories is spontaneous vÃ©ritÃ© film making that improvises in rhythm with a captured background of actual events and sweeps you into its excitement in ways that are quite thrilling br br the essence of offside is the disconnect between modern world soccer madness and retro islamic social prohibitions repressing women Â the latter existing at a time when young iranian women are becoming part of a global world in which females participate in sport and share in the ardor of national team spirit how exactly do you reconcile the country's ambition to become a modern global power with social attitudes that are medieval a lot of offisde is astonishingly real including the way everybody tries to talk their way out of everything the director's decision to inject young actors into an actual sports mega event leads to a stunningly effective blend of documentary polemic and fiction that is too energetic to seem to have a bone to pick and that ends in a way that's brilliant and moving br br i've had reservations about panahi's films before but this one kicks ass panahi does something remarkable here he critiques his society presents an unusual drama and touches our hearts with a sense of a nation's aspirations
<START> most of the bad reviews on this website blame hood of the living dead for one or more of the following reasons 1 it is a low budget movie with virtually no acting 2 it was so bad it made me laugh 3 it is something i could do myself i won't even discuss the first point because it is a very subjective matter whether you like low budget and independent stuff or not i must say however that i still fail to understand people renting such a movie as hood of the living dead and then looking surprised when they realize it is not as polished and cute as a romantic comedy with lindsay lohan or matthew mc conaughey as for the second point i really don't see what's so wrong with laughing i personally like to laugh and love movies that make me to be they comedies or horror flicks when in hammerhead i saw this girl stepping into a puddle and the shark man came out of it to eat her i just cracked up and i was grateful that the director made such a stupid scene and gave me ten seconds of pure fun honestly laughing just makes me feel good while it seems that many people writing reviews see it as a bad bad thing if you only want to feel sad and scared while watching a movie hood of the living dead and low budget flicks are definitely not for you but please don't come and tell us that you find them laughable we already know it this is most probably why we decided to watch the movie in first place however it is the third point that leaves totally baffled just several years ago people were lining up out of theaters to see blair witch project which is a way more rudimentary boring plot less and bad acted movie than hood of the living dead and takes itself way too seriously too moreover half a million people go on youtube every day to see the short films of lonelygirl15 which is certainly something everyone with a cute girlfriend a room and a webcam could do not to talk about all of the even more amateurish videos you can find there why don't people blame those clips for bad acting and non existing plot i think it is one of the best things of our times that everyone with affordable technology and a bunch of friends can make their own movies and share them with people that have similar interests and i feel a certain admiration for people who spend their weekends with their friends making a honestly bad yet refreshing piece of trash like this rather than shopping at the mall or playing video games alone leave aside your biases and your desire to sound like a smart film critic by attacking b movies and you'll see that hood of the living dead can bring you almost as much fun as it did to its makers if you have a taste for refreshing and enjoyable home made horror movies i recommend zombiez the ghosts of edendale the killer eye monster man don't look in the basement the worst horror movie ever made redneck zombies jesus christ vampyre slayer and habit
<START> the ramones whom i consider the founders of modern punk rock lend their then unique sounds to a terrifically twisted movie about a rowdy rock fan p j soles who faces off against a merciless joyless principal mary woronov for the right to rock br br featuring a soundtrack brimming with incredible music rrhs is fascinating in concept and execution it's chock full of riotous sight gags like the mouse experiment teenage spirit probably my all time favorite film opening and bizarre off the wall moments the straitjacket scenes if you're looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun on a molecular level look no further but if you're looking for a nice dignified dramatic epic maybe you should look a wee bit further br br hi everybody i'm riff randell and this is rock roll high school
<START> well i can once and for all put an end to the question 'what is the worst movie ever made ever ' it is flight of fury starring and co written by steven seagal sure there are lots of famously bad movies but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously br br it is a romanian made film that speaks to just how far romania has to go to catch up with bollywood it also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent steven seagal has become this movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again br br it was released only on video i can't imagine why and i suspect the workers that had to make the dvd's had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling
<START> the combination of the superb black and white photography and the 'eugene onegin with a twist' plot made this a real knock out for me the atmosphere created by the mostly very dark shots contrasted with occasional very bright overexposed white was gripping there was a superb moment where where transparencies apparently conventional holiday snaps but where the faces of the actors revealed character and situation subtly but instantly were shown accompanied by lensky's heart wrenching aria from the tschaikowsky opera eugene onegin br br for me the mark of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by that medium which means that often the story is less important than imagery and atmosphere last year in marienbad is a good example of such a film krisana is in the same mould
<START> a fun concept but poorly executed except for the fairly good makeup effects there's really not much to it there are obvious problems for example after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in days and once he's deathly thin he stays pretty much equally deathly thin for what seems to be a long time br br in any case the movie has far worse problems than that the cinematography is decidedly low budget tv show quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around robert john burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling charlton heston impersonation and is literally painful to watch the only scary thing is that lucinda jenney and kari wuhrer are both even worse br br the only reason why i'm giving this movie as high as i am is that once the movie enters its last 1 3 or so and joe mantegna's character takes over the movie develops a fun campy 'cheesefest slaughterhouse' feel and the gangster's crazy schemes for tormenting the totally obnoxious gypsies are somewhat fun to watch the ending if predictable is also nicely mean avoid unless you're a king o phile or are really psyched up at the idea of the voice of fat tony from the simpsons terrorizing a gypsy camp
<START> holes originally a novel by louis sachar was successfully transformed into an entertaining and well made film starring sigourney weaver as the warden shia labeouf as stanley and khleo thomas as zero the roles were very well casted and the actors portrayed their roles well br br the film had inter weaving storylines that all led up to the end the main storyline is about stanley yelnats and his punishment of spending a year and a half at camp greenlake the second storyline is about sam and kate barlow this plot deals with racism and it is the more deep storyline to the movie the third is about elya yelnats and madame zeroni which explains the 100 year curse on the yelnats family in my opinion these storylines were weaved together very well br br contrary to many people's beliefs i think that you do not have to have read the book to understand the movie the film is reasonably easy to understand br br the acting in the film was well done especially shia labeouf stanley khleo thomas zero sigourney weaver the warden and jon voight mr sir the other members of d tent jake smith squid max kasch zig zag miguel castro magnet byron cotton armpit and brenden jefferson x ray enhanced the comic relief of the movie however the best parts were with zero and stanley who made a great team together br br although holes is a disney movie it deals with some serious issues such as racism shootings and violence the film's dramatization at some points is very well done br br i would suggest this movie to people of all ages whether they have read the book or not you shouldn't miss it
<START> back in the 70's when i had first seen this i was in high school it was cool then now as an adult i look back at it and i say to myself yeah right what was so funny it has it's moments but they are few and far between it is so dated that the jokes no longer stand up show this to a younger crowd and they will be totally lost if you like this type of humor you may want to stick with kentucky fried movie or amazon women from the moon tunnel vision as well as groove tube are too dated for today's viewing
<START> it was a painful experience the whole story is actually there so i won't go into that but the acting was horrible there is this part in the very beginning when the scientist brother goes to work he actually wears a white coat at home before leaving to work i thought working with biohazard material meant that you should wear sterilized clothes in a controlled environment and the lab itself looks like a school lab there is this monitor on top a file cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene its just there to make the place look technical and a scientist is actually having breakfast in the lab and next to him is a biohazard labeled jar and his boss walks in on him and doesn't even tell him anything about it not to mentioned bad acting very bad can't get any worst than that my advice don't watch and i thought nothing could be worse than house of the dead apparently uwi boll's movies look like classical shakespeare compared to this
<START> this movie is good for tv i like it because i'm a huge fan of disaster films even though this is a family film accuracy on the film from the book is half and half they got the characters names right but in the book there was no storm chaser the the car scene involving the hatch family running away from the tornado wasn't in the book instead it involved dan hatch and his friend riding with a police officer on their way to the police station for safety and in the book dan and his friend are both 12 years old thats all i can think of overall this was a good movie even though it could of have been a little more accurate to the book did you know the book was based on a true story of a series of tornadoes devastating a small nebraska town in 1980
<START> yes i know talkies had just been invented for the cinema 2 years earlier when this was produced in 1929 but this film showed that much had to learnt about the art of producing films it comes over as a filmed hammy stage play with the actors melodramatically enunciating their lines rolling their eyes using too many pregnant pauses and using gestures more appropriate to silent cinema which i suppose was normal during the process of educating them to appear more naturalistic on screen the gaps between lines spoken should have been tightened up during editing as it considerably slows the film it is now only of interest for titanic buffs who want to see an early example of this marine accident on film in next chronological order they could see titanic 1953 a night to remember 1958 titanic 1997 to see how the cinema's depiction of this tragedy as evolved over the years there have been many documentaries and tv films made including the atrocious sos titanic 1979 on my version which is a dvd david mccallum gives the introduction it was he who played harold bride marconi's junior wireless operator in a night to remember still the best feature film please read my tribute to walter comments on imdb under howard morley demon co uk and gave the commentary on the series of 4 videos entitled end of a dream so he was well qualified to give the narration of more interest i found was a recording accompanied by actual photos of the 1912 us senate hearing which is also on the dvd actors speak the actual words spoken by lightoller 2nd officer j bruce ismay managing director of white star harold bride and others including gloria stewart the old rose in titanic 1997 whose voice is used for one of the first class women survivors
<START> a film like amazing grace and chuck is a perfect example of how the left in this country just doesn't get it they never did and liberalism continues to slip further and further into political oblivion br br this film deals with a little league baseball star who decides to stop playing ball as a protest to the existence of nuclear weapons the boy is understandably ridiculed until a bevy of professional athletes led by former nba star alex english join his cause not just a few of them join the cause by the time his movement reaches its zenith entire leagues of professional and college sports have to cancel their seasons since nobody will play any more just to move this review along i'm prepared to grant them this premise even though it would never happen in a million years i'll just imagine it could then go from there br br i don't quite remember how but some type of agreement is reached and the boy decides to go back to the game he loves in an incredibly sappy and ridiculous scene br br before criticizing the message of this film let me just say that this film is poorly written acted and directed even if one does agree with the boy's stance it would be impossible to overcome how badly the film was constructed and that's a shame since there are plenty of good actors that go to waste peck curtis petersen alex english does as well as he could have with his character however and i wish he would try to act in more films alas it's likely much easier to find work in the coaching world of the nba one wishes mr english would teach more of these thuggish nba types of today how to shoot the rock a little better alex certainly knew how to put the ball through the hoop br br as far as the film's message in concerned it's just wrong headed plain and simple all of those nuclear warheads tucked away in those missile silos out west prevented war it would be one thing for this boy and his flock to protest an actual war or the use of nuclear weapons these weapons were in fact never used and that was the genius behind their existence neither side during the cold war was crazy enough to fire a single missile without these weapons who knows what might have happened between the usa and ussr br br the makers of this film obviously intended for kids in america to take up their cause and follow in chuck's footsteps kids in america however are more intelligent than the left wing kooks who created this dreck br br the film is worth only 2 of 10 stars br br if you want to see a great film about the dangers of nuclear war stick with dr strangelove instead br br mr newell you are no frank capra
<START> forget that this is a b movie forget that it is in many ways outdated instead give writer director ida lupino much deserved credit for addressing a subject which at the time 1950 was taboo in hollywood to my knowledge this was the first film to address the subject of rape and the emotional and mental effects that that crime has upon its victims br br although much of the cast's acting is pedestrian at best mala powers who at the time was eighteen or nineteen gives an excellent performance throughout as the traumatized young woman ann who tries to run away from her shame based on her work in this film i'm surprised that she did not have a more successful acting career tod andrews too has some fine moments as the minister who reaches out to help her br br ms lupino obviously working on a limited budget was still able to create some memorable scenes such as the pursuit through the streets and alleys leading to the rape and the police lineup following it and she created a bittersweet ending which left me wondering if ann really could ever have a normal life again
<START> michelle rodriguez is the defining actress who could be the charging force for other actresses to look out for she has the audacity to place herself in a rarely seen tough girl role very early in her career and pull it off which is a feat that should be recognized although her later films pigeonhole her to that same role this film was made for her ruggedness br br her character is a romanticized student fighter lover struggling to overcome her disenchanted existence in the projects which is a little overdone in film but not by a girl that aspect of this film isn't very original but the story goes in depth when the heated relationships that this girl has to deal with come to a boil and her primal rage takes over br br i haven't seen an actress take such an aggressive stance in movie making yet and i'm glad that she's getting that original twist out there in hollywood this film got a 7 from me because of the average story of ghetto youth but it has such a great actress portraying a rarely seen role in a minimal budget movie great work
<START> this is the kind of movie that my enemies content i watch all the time but it's not bloody true i only watch it once in a while to make sure that it's as bad as i first thought it was br br some kind of mobsters hijack a boeing 747 that at least is an improvement over having boeing hijack a good part of the pentagon the airplane goes down in the bermuda triangle and sinks pressurized to the bottoms a kind of post facto submarine br br it has one of those all star casts the stars either falling or barely above the horizon br br we're on our own says pilot jack lemon he is so right except for george kennedy he's in all these disaster movies br br watch another movie instead oh not airport the original that's no good either instead watch a decent flick about stuck airplanes like flight of the phoenix
<START> this movie wasn't just bad it was terrible after i watched it i actually felt the need to take a shower to get the filth off of me there is running 'gag' with an elderly couple making out it is not funny but it is disgusting the monster make up was cool but that is all the continuity errors alone will have you angry at least i was the editing is really poor br br almost anything else you could possibly do would be better than spending time watching this movie even if your group of friends are into 'bad movies' this one is exceptional in its ineptitude i couldn't even bring myself to laugh at it you have been warned
