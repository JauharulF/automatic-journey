<START> this is an old fashioned wonderfully fun children's movie with surely the most appealing novice witch ever unlike many modern stories which seem to revel in dark witchcraft this is simply a magical tale of hocus pocus that is cute light hearted and charming br br the tale is set back in 1940 in the english village of peppering eye where three cockney children charlie carrie paul rollins are being evacuated out of danger from world war ii city air raids they are mistakingly sent to live with eglantine price who is studying by correspondence course to become an apprentice witch eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to london on their flying bed here they encounter emilius browne the fraudulent headmaster of miss price's witchcraft training correspondence school miss price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life meanwhile they must also deal with a shady character called the bookman and his associate swinburne br br angela lansbury is of course marvelously endearing as the eccentric witch in training miss price david tomlinson plays mr browne headmaster of the defunct witchcraft school who has now turned street magician this actor was previously cast as the children's father in the movie mary poppins in fact this film is a tale quite reminiscent of the earlier mary poppins both wonderful fantasy stories for children perhaps this movie doesn't have quite such memorable music as chim chim cheree but it does boast some appealing little tunes some have been critical but the movie features excellent special effects all in all the story is enchanting family entertainment it's a pity if modern children are too sophisticated for this lovely bewitching tale which should appeal to the child in all of us
<START> a kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia extremely well done and polanski performs well as the diffident introvert trying hard to adapt to his dingy paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers horrifying early on because of the seeming mean and self obsessed fellow tenants and horrifying later on as he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing personally i could have done without the cross dressing element but i accept the nod to psycho and the fact that it had some logic bearing in mind the storyline nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end i can't help feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings of not being a 'real' frenchman and jewish to boot still there is plenty to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking isabelle adjani and good old shelly winters is as reliable as ever
<START> richard linklater's beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and paris travelogue is one of the 90's best thinking person's romantic movies julie delpy turns in one of the decade's most engaging performances as the parisian lass who spends a day with stranger on a train ethan hawke the dialogue and there is oodles of it is sometimes meandering and overly precious but this portrait of two young wannabe lovers making a romantic intellectual and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing touching and insightful moments
<START> i understand the jokes quite well they just aren't good the show is horrible i understand it and that's another horrible thing about it the only cool character there ever was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode but then i see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible it's not funny not funny i don't want people to say only smart people get it because if they're so smart why do they judge people they don't even know and say that they're not smart or intellectual enough to understand it it's like saying the sky is red but never looking outside but anyways this is absolutely the worst show i have ever seen in my life the jokes are terrible i mean you can understand them they're just horrible her controversy is very lame her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really dumb and usually consist of really bad acting i'm not sure what these smart people see in this show but judging others when they don't even know anything about any of us isn't exactly a smart comment
<START> johnny weissmuller's final film as 'king of the jungle' after 16 years in the role tarzan and the mermaids is bound to disappoint all but the most ardent of his fans at 44 the ex olympian one of hollywood's most active 'party animals' was long past the slim athleticism of his youth and looked tired although he was in marginally better condition than in his previous entry tarzan and the huntress br br not only had weissmuller gotten too old for his role johnny sheffield the quintessential 'boy' had grown to manhood he was a strapping 17 year old so he was written out of the script under the pretext of being 'away at school' brenda joyce at 35 was appearing in her fourth of five films as 'jane' she would provide the transition when lex barker became the new tarzan in 1949's tarzan's magic fountain and was still as wholesomely sexy as ever br br produced by sol lesser at rko on a minuscule budget the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor by filming in mexico while the location gave a decidedly hispanic air to what was supposedly darkest africa veteran director robert florey utilized the country extensively incorporating cliff diving and an aztec temple into the story br br when a young island girl tyrone power's future bride linda christian is rescued in a jungle river by tarzan he learns that a local high priest george zucco one of filmdom's most enduring villains had virtually enslaved the local population threatening retribution from a living 'god' if they don't do his bidding the girl had been chosen to become the 'god's' bride so she fled faster than you can say 'is this a dumb plot or what ' the girl is kidnapped by the priest's henchmen and returned to the island and tarzan followed by jane colorful spanish character 'benjy' charmingly played by john laurenz who sings several tunes and a government commissioner are off to take on the deity and his priest poor cheeta is left behind after a series of discoveries the 'god' is simply a con man in an aztec mask working with the priest in milking the island's rich pearl beds a bit of brawling action and comic relief and songs by benjy everything reaches the expected happy conclusion br br remarkably tarzan and the mermaids features a musical score by the brilliant film composer dimitri tiomkin and is far better than what you'd expect from this 'b' movie br br while the film would provide a less than auspicious end to weissmuller's time in tarzan's loincloth he would immediately go on to play jungle jim a more eloquent variation of the ape man in khakis the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess it could have been br br tarzan was about to get a make over and become much sexier
<START> despite the mysteriously positive reviews and high rating this is an awful movie awful enough that l feel obligated to warn you how bad it is br br the movie is set in the final period of the raj during the time of india's fight for independence what follows in the ridiculous plot just fills me with disbelief what the characters do and how they behave just does not persuade me that the characters exist in that era br br for instance would the young married hindu housemaid from the local village have an affair with her married englishman master knowing full well that discovery of the affair would likely mean utter social ostracization and shame if not mortal punishment unlikely but still maybe however would the same young hindu housemaid in the conservative society of india of that era carry on like a half naked britney spears in heat partake in hot outdoor sex during daylight in open view where they might be discovered at any moment that is not only bloody unlikely that is a retarded plot line br br such idiocies combined with the poor acting drove me to leave the cinema an hour into the movie so i did not watch the second half of the movie one could only hope the ending is of more intelligence than what i saw in the first half
<START> this movie is not only a very bad movie with awful actors or presumed actors a bored direction and a story unattractive it also copies exactly an scene from the excellent giallio torso directed by sergio martino in 1973 two years before one of the most celebrated psycho thrillers of italian cinema and a cult movie around the world in la sanguinusa conduce la danza the director replays the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl with an peeping tom watching from a window of the bedroom naturally the scene in rizzo's movie is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charming in martino's film to put another black girl another white girl and another peeping tom replaying the scene is simply the most appropriate way of prove that rizzo's movie has no ideas no originality no taste and nothing at all i think that such things are an offense to spectator
<START> the cult movie for every true russian intellectual everything is brilliant especially acting it's beyond any praise the movie as the book is full of symbols my favorite one is the brightest symbol of razrukha colloquial russian word for devastation often signifies the period of lifestyle chaos after the 1918 20 civil war the wide opened dirty door in the bricky wall squeaking in the snowy wind and the pitch black hole of the doorway behind it br br now the film is released on dvd with fully restored image and the 5 1 sound there are well translated english subtitles too though some obscene words of sharikov were replaced by the more mild versions in the translation i don't know is that dvd available abroad but if you'll find it grab it immediately it's really worthy of watching br br and in conclusion a fact about the 50 of russians today mostly youth can be identified as sharikovs in a considerable degree it's the post soviet effect soviet people appeared to be wholly unprepared for the informational attack of the western civilization tv producers and movie makers have made the entertainment industry and the mass media amazingly aggressive soulless and thoughtless so that it abetted the darkest instincts of every russian even among the internet users every third one uses the obscene language in forums and chats because it's amazingly common in colloquial speech
<START> don't waste your time on this dreck as portrayed the characters have no redeeming values and watching them interact is sheer torture gothic was entertainment at least this is crap if you like watching pretentious and spoiled poets straining to outwit each other this may be right up your alley lord byron is portrayed as a complete jerk and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly bewildering mary shelly appears to be the only character with any spine whatsoever but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without an ounce of respect what a waste of time see gothic instead i also remember seeing another superior movie based on the same subject matter but didn't catch the title i was hoping this was it but no such luck not recommended
<START> what a great british movie a screaming good laugh and sexy gary stretch too and oh lots of bikes and lovely welsh countryside br br members of our club the arrowhead bike and trike social club appear in it as extras hooray br br there are some genuinely hilarious bits good acting a good idea br br met the director jon ivay at a showing in wareham dorset a great man down to earth and a good laugh this film must be supported as all great brit movies should br br so please go and see it if you can they have a website with cinemas that are showing it so find one near you br br i can't wait to get the dvd some of our biker friends have seen the film two or three times already and can't get enough of it br br amanda
<START> i really wanted to like this film but the story is ridicules i don't want to spoil this film don't worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen but here's an example of how sloppy this film was put together the cowboy and twig ride up the ridge the cowboy has a handle bar mustache the cowboy and twig get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge the cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave in dark on the back of a horse br br to be fair the acting by the four main characters is solid
<START> this movie is good for what it is and unpretentious i wouldn't watch it twice however i am a peter cushing completist and that's why i watched it the best asset of this movie is brevity and effectiveness compared to other similar movies it does not drag its feet forever as each of the four plus one segments lasts under 30 minutes with the last under 10 good uncanny vibes in the first segment horror writer suffering from 'writer's block' relocates to secluded old house seeking inspiration he finds even too much of it when he starts to visualize one of his fictional madmen plot contrivance similar to premature burial good use of the point of view twist is the writer getting mentally ill or as the ending shows his trophy wife wants her lover to play along with the husband's phobias to drive him mad secure his estates yet will the scheming bimbo survive to enjoy the fruit of her ingenious plan br br in the second segment two long time lost friends get together in the same secluded old house but cannot seem to help visiting a bizarre horror museum featuring the wax statue of the long lost love of their youth which had once separated them from the gothic museum keeper they learn the woman portrayed is a deceased ax wielding murderer or was she br br the third segment was the less interesting to me br br the fourth shows a horror movies actor who thinks he's the best of all sunken to the depths of low budget c movies seeking a costume to lend more credibility to his fictional vampire he gets the real deal this segment also lacks the solidity of the first two br br acting is fair with the 2 initial segments contributing the bulk of it good movie taken with a grain of salt not the best cushing nor lee but worth watching
<START> i loved this film because in my mind it seemed to so perfectly capture what i imagined life in french colonial africa must have been like in the 50's my generation anyway but i was truly enraptured by its quiet pacing and by the glorious ending within the last 5 minutes of this film you must focus intently on what's happening never have i been more impressed with the wrap up of a film i remember yelling wow when i realized it was over on the other hand my two daughters fell asleep on the couch
<START> i kind of consider myself as the 1 fan of hidden frontier seeing as i am among a somewhat small group of fans who have actually met most of these guys well not counting conventions of course i have been watching hidden frontier since 2001 and i must say i continue to be impressed by what these guys have come up with br br hidden frontier is the brainchild of rob caves and his self made studio areakt pictures which operates out of the back room of his house while not as fancy as say the tos based series new voyages which sometimes gets some of the actors writers from the original series like walter koenig aka mr chekov rob and the cast and crew of hf manage to create a series worthy of replacing that ghastly experiment we called enterprise the most controversial and successful story arc has been the introduction of star trek's first openly gay character corey aster who was introduced in the second season and his search to find a soul mate somewhere later in the series he meets jorian zen the excelsior's trill helm officer in the recent story lines with these two characters warning major spoiler do not read if you have not watched the series up to this point zen is joined to an exiled symbiont causing a great deal of change and some conflict in his relationship with aster though the future is uncertain seeing as the most recent episode beachhead was just shown to hf fans in the chat room last night i think that this relationship will endure but only time will tell br br gene roddenberry created star trek with the intention that the story be more about his characters rather than flashy space battles rob caves created hidden frontier for that same reason and this is what has made this series as popular as it is as the previous comment stated i wish i could give it a rating higher than 10 but it will have to suffice although next season will be the last keeping in the tradition of seven season shows started by star trek the next generation i am willing to bet that we will hear much about hidden frontier after that final episode
<START> this movie is horrible it rivals ishtar in the number of embarrassingly bad moments i would have rated it lower than a 3 save for a couple of funny lines but overall this film was crap it looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere joe roth should join elaine may on the directing sidelines forever
<START> i loved this show when it aired on television and was crushed when i found out that someone somewhere decided that it wasn't worthy of being continued for years i hung onto my copies of this show ones that i had taped or had someone tape for me that is until now the powers that be finally decided to release this beautiful series on dvd and i finally was able to get my eager little hands on the complete set which brings me to this part the part about that this show is all about br br american gothic is about good verses evil basically a struggle between lucas buck that is buck with a b he is an evil sheriff of a south carolina small town that runs things the way he wants things to be ran and stops at nothing to get his way br br i felt the show was wonderfully written and directed and had lots of life left yet to be lived i really hated when it was canceled but that is the way it seems to go for me when i finally find something worth watching on television br br gary cole did a great job as the role of sheriff lucas buck he has just the right amount of charm verses evil to pull it off the other actors did a super job as well so i guess you could say even the casting was a hit with me
<START> some might say something like baby geniuses with its giant robot infants or dumbo with its psychedelic drug addled nightmare sequence would win the award for the most disturbing movie ever made for children you might say that too but you'd be wrong lo and behold for i bring to you santa claus the most helplessly messed up family film since well ever br br from the opening scenes showing children from different parts of the world singing their insipid theme songs seriously this segment is nearly 20 freakin' minutes long and has nothing to do with the plot to the thrilling conclusion in which merlin pops up from outta nowhere and saves the day don't mind him he's from barcelona this is childhood trauma at its finest and no matter how hard i try no matter how many different therapists i visit i just can't get those reindeer's laughter out of my head br br avoid this mind bending piece of trash like you'd avoid a sex starved whale during mating season still if flaming gay demons with a serious case of the overacting flu are something for you i guess you should give it a try but really this movie isn't worth your time and mental health
<START> hallam foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of oedepus complex afterward br br it is something like 95 minutes long but would be better in ten there's like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops and habits in a church tower like quasimodo only he is much less sympathetic br br there's a strange love story involved which doesn't have anything to do with anything she happens to look like his mother yes so what we know he misses his mother that's what the first ten minutes were about they should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a o k short film now it's a portrait of a character who doesn't change he is a guy that stuff happens to the only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job br br there's this whole oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character he paints his face dresses in women's clothing and wears a dead badger on his head a badger you've got to see the ending he returns to his home with the badger on his head and it is shot like a tacky horror film to kill his dad's new wife which he had sex with in the beginning and somehow they thought this wouldn't be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background i've got to admit though i'm kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose it feels like this mackenzie director guy whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school you are so smart thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories you really dug what a wallraff okay so now i realized this film is based on some random book but anyway br br photowise it is boring a lot of talking heads plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene you know cold and warm etc why maybe hallam foe is both a feature and a test film for color blind people or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldn't be enough to tell us that he feels lonely so they increased blue so that we really get it br br i'm not even gonna comment on the clichÃ© indie oh how how how cute drawings they have made in the presentation and all the cute sex stuff going on this whole film is an independent clichÃ© but i do recommend it i laughed more than a few times though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine
<START> it's obvious that all of the good reviews posted for this movie so far are from insiders who were either involved with the film or who know somebody who knows somebody and have thus seen multiple cuts well i don't know anyone involved and i've seen the final cut and it is pure garbage the only thing it has going for it is ambition and multiple cameos from horror legends none on screen for terribly long it's as if the filmmakers made this movie on a weekend during a horror convention and got actors like tony todd tom savini david hess and michael berryman to film scenes during their coffee breaks this is an ultra cheap shot on video wannabe x files with terrible acting from a cast of non actors with more mullets than is acceptable in the 21st century there is little or no action it's all overly explanatory dialogue that attempts to explain a pointlessly convoluted plot ther computer fx are a joke but there aren't enough of them nor enough action to make this film enjoyable in a mst3k way after about 8 straight scenes of nothing but talking you'll find yourself reaching for the fast forward button and not letting go absolutely worthless
<START> this movie is more like a music video kusturica said in an interview from 2004 that when he is making movies he feels like making music and when he is making music he feels like making movies the best thing in promise me this is the music written by stribor kusturica br br kusturica said in the same interview that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise promise me this has very little noise br br i liked life is a miracle it was also like music video for the first 30 minutes and at some points later but it had a beautiful plot promise me this has no plot i was awaiting this movie with big expectations because i've read that the script has been written by ranko bozic one of my favourite scriptwriters who participated also in life is a miracle ranko bozic writes great dialogues but for kusturica they are noise and much to my regret i saw only two dialogues which i could identify as written by ranko bozic the other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son stribor br br gordan mihic the man who wrote the scripts for time of the gypsies and black cat white cat said in an interview that kusturica never follows the script black cat white cat was the only script for which kusturica said that he will not touch it according to gordan mihic after all kusturica comes back to the script and if he doesn't he doesn't make a good movie and i think this is the case with promise me this he should have followed the script of ranko bozic br br promise me this is billed as a comedy but there are very few moments which made me laugh the comedic moments are in the same style as black cat white cat but are not that funny at all i think the difference comes from the fact that black cat white cat was written by gordan mihic br br however i know some people who liked promise me this they find it very positive movie
