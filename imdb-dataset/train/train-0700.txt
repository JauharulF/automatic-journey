<START> angels who got a little icky were banned from heaven and now reside in a british forest where they seduce and chop up teens talk about high concept on the plus side this little mother gives us tom savini but since his acting range is limited to two minutes screen time his five minute presence seems a tad long the angels run around the forest naked for the most part of the movie but though they might have the body of an angel their faces sure look like joan rivers on a bad day mediocre acting and amateurish gore effects don't help and the night scenes fatally recall paris hilton's most famous movie so bad that it is really bad
<START> i had high expectations following my beautiful laundrette bend it like beckham and less so east is east the histories of british asians fitting into their adopted home has had many good runs on the big screen as well as a number of excellent tv and radio series goodness gracious me etc this one falls flat inspite of a good start it rapidly went down hill br br ultimately this was a horribly typical bbc effort complete with strong regional accents whacky over acting characters a those were the days soundtrack and lots of issues in an attempt to be worthy br br i found myself cringing at many points during this film the writing is predictable every possible cliche was dragged out and aired in fact i have trouble thinking of any cross cultural cross generational devices that could have been used that weren't the characters were thin and cliched the eccentric non conformist minister the well meaning but ultimately racist old woman the over weight overbearing aunt the pushy indian parents the working class neighbour the 'wise' profound grandmother the motorbike riding thug the script was weak with every chance to shock the audience with overt racist dialogue from the two dimentional racist white characters taken and why it had to be set in the 70's apart from needing an excuse for a 70's soundtrack is a mystery possibly it make unbelievable characters slightly more believable to people born after 1979 i don't know br br even these things aside good acting could have carried this into respectable obscurity instead the usual bbc comedy suspects were wheeled out to ham it up bend it like beckham had far better comic acting and serious acting in fact than this with a virtually unknown cast br br in summary a lazy cliched script over acted in a dull predictable story give it a miss br br
<START> sure the history in this movie was hollywoodized but it's far from being the only bit of history rewritten for the masses lafitte sided with the americans because he considered himself a frenchman and therefore hated the british not because of any sense of patriotism for a nation that had taken over new orleans only a short time ago he broke his agreement and returned to smuggling which caused his sailing to galveston he was more of a petty criminal and scoundrel than a hero or a swashbuckler but who cares this is one movie that's sheer entertainment and face it we all wanted jean to go for the feisty wench rather than the prudish daughter of the governor brynner once again rises over mediocre writing to give a fascinating performance
<START> i think that elisabeth rohm though she may try hard is not very good at all i guess it was because of budget that she may have been the only one they could get for that price i mainly watched it for the performance of myron natwick whose work i know very well br br he was the most believable and without doubt the most compelling to watch when he wasn't on the screen the thing went dead this was filmed in vancouver he gave me the creeps but be assured that in real life he is a kind funny compassionate man he even said playing that role gave him the creeps br br i'll watch anything with him in it but elisabeth rohm never again she was as exciting as lint on law and order maybe a very nice person but no actress
<START> alan anthony steffen an english multi millionaire with a few screws loose thanks to his first wife's infidelity and untimely death during childbirth entices sexy red headed women to his castle offering them bundles of cash to stay the weekend once back at his ancestral pile he gets them nekkid proceeds to flog them with a bull whip and then kills them br br but when he meets blonde hottie gladys marina malfatti and falls for her ample charms he decides to give up his murderous ways and get married their wedded bliss is short lived however thanks to alan's iffy mental state which becomes increasingly fragile when his dead wife evelyn starts to appear outside his window and a spate of gruesome murders occur within the castle grounds br br so let's recap a groovy 70s euro horror with loads of tasty women in various states of undress spooky gothic retreats and misty graveyards a sadistic rich psycho with a penchant for drop dead gorgeous babes with cracking bods several vicious murders including a great bit where one victim has her head bashed in with a rock and her entrails eaten by foxes normally a checklist like that would guarantee me a good timeÂso why did i find 'the night evelyn came out of her grave' so dull well for starters the plot is way too convoluted there are red herrings crazy plot developments and suspects galore and it all becomes a bit too much by the ridiculous endingÂin which we discover that all along several people have been plotting to get their greedy paws on alan's wealth and that our red head killing nut job is actually supposed to be the hero of the movieÂmy head was hurting too much to care secondly emilio maraglia's direction is pretty torpid stylish yes but as slow as molasses at times br br and then there's the bits that are just too damn silly possibly even for a giallo the death by poisonous snake bite surely one of the most bizarre choices of weapon ever alan's aunt agatha an old crippled relative who is played by a pretty young woman the hiring of a group of identical curly headed blondes as maids the poor attempt at convincing the audience that the film is set in england mentioning 'pounds' and hiring a crap police uniform for one of the extras is not enough and then of course there is the unlikelihood of finding a bag of sulphuric acid laying next to a swimming pool br br 'the night evelyn came out of her grave' isn't a total waste of time how could it be with so much female flesh on show but there are much better giallo's out there watch this one if you're a fan of the genre and you've already seen the bestÂbut don't expect too much
<START> the actual crime story at the core of in cold blood might seem a little 'tame' for those who are weened on the classic serial killer stories gein bundy dahmer or just the more notorious cases out in hollywood oj manson the essential facts in the case don't amount to anything terribly convoluted perry smith and dick hickock here played by robert blake and scott wilson respectively met by some luck conspired to rob a man's farmhouse safe out in kansas and after killing a family of four with a shotgun and dagger came away with 43 dollars aside from their returning to the us after fleeing briefly to mexico there isn't a whole lot of mystery to the resolution either they were caught by some stroke of ironic chance a cop followed them and stopped them for having a stolen car after smith and hickcock helped out a boy and his old man collecting bottles for change and sentenced to hang by the neck until dead the story ended in 1965 br br but it's the handling of the story moments of moot the performances a pure cinematic touch that brooks and his absolutely marvelous the late great dp conrad hall provides in crisp widescreen black and white and a storytelling style that feels realistic without going into too much naturalism or too much melodrama save perhaps for near the end which is pitch perfect the air of tragedy hangs over the story and not so much because of the killings themselves no matter how brutal they are as the third man that is conjured up as the narrator observes by smith and hickcock teaming up but because of the inevitability of the story you feel somehow for these criminals who in any other hands would be just be conventional figures or something out of a b movie these aren't good people but they aren't necessarily monsters either at least all the way through br br it's also an excellent 'road movie' as we see smith and hickcock on the road down to the clutter residence the actual night time scene of the crime taking place late in the film then on to mexico then back to america towards las vegas we get to soak in the personalities of these two probably even more than that of the police detectives who at first have no leads and then finally get a break with an inmate it's actually kind of disturbing to get this close to these two sort of akin to the aimless quality of malick's badlands characters and it's also a sign of daring for the period there's no sermonizing like he did this because of that and this or the other we see how smith had an abusive psychotic father but that smith loved and hated him the complexity there is too much for the movie maybe even too much for capote's book which i should confess i've still yet to read though i plan to and we see hickcock is this creature of slick confidence i e getting the suit and other things with bad checks but without any deep rooted explanation to it all br br the streak of fatalism in in cold blood is some of the starkest of the 60s and it's the luck of brooks to have its stars as blake in his top of the pops performance this and lost highway oddly enough considering his real life saga in recent years his quintessential pieces of work and wilson's breakthrough before becoming a character actor while they're surrounded by fine supporting work they themselves are eerily absorbing driven more or less by greed and fantasies of escapism with treasure and staying pretty much grounded in their situation through the death row and on through their ends is this a morale of the story if there could be one that it's more horrifying to confront the possibility that those who kill can't be classified of good vs evil getting smudged smith apologized for his crime before being hung and he points out but to who this is a story bound to give the most hardened fans of true crime the bonafide chills and it's quite possibly the best american film of 1967
<START> yes i call this a perfect movie not one boring second a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives i could sympathize with perfect lighting crisp black and white photography a fitting soundtrack an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works it's one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of hollywood should rest the mark everyone should endeavor to reach br br barbara stanwyck is simply stunning there was nothing this actress couldn't do and she always went easy on the melodramatic side no hysterical outbursts with this lady i always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like bette davis or joan crawford and this movie confirmed my opinion always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments it is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career and this one is by far the least interesting br br the title fits this movie very well it is about desires human desires i think everyone can understand actually no one seems to be scheming in this movie all characters act on impulse everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else the sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which i will not go here br br i liked what this movie has to say about youth about maturing and about the necessity to compromise the movie i associate most with this one is alfred hitchcock's shadow of a doubt it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured small town america the story has a certain similarity with fritz lang's considerably harsher movie clash by night made one year earlier where stanywck stars in a similar part i can also recommend it
<START> i found this to be the most enjoyable muppets movie because i felt it was the most light hearted and had the best comic delivery on most of its lines the muppets try to go on broadway to sell an original musical they've written but along the way they run into the usual problems including kermit's memory loss here while there aren't as many great cameos here as in the original muppets movie there are some including joan rivers and dabney coleman simply the timing and delivery of so many of the lines is great and the situations the muppets find themselves in are hilarious the original songs are also good here and the ending is satisfying there is not much else to say about the film but muppet fans should see it for sure it is the funniest muppet movie and is sure to be enjoyed by all br br 1 2 out of
<START> i ran across this movie on the tv and could not turn it off peter sellers plays an unlikable fellow who falls for an extremely warm and cute goldie hawn who wouldn't the way that goldie's character holds herself from the beginning of the movie to the end is untraditional even today this movie gave me a different angle into human relations and also i found it very funny peter sellers role was a difficult sell but i think he pulls it off well
<START> i saw this recently on a faded old vhs tape and remembered it dimly looking at it now it seems charming br br when it was first released it was recognized by pretty much everyone as a spoof of coming out as a gay teenager to hammer the point home the mother is seen reading a paperback copy of 1 teenager in 10 the most popular coming out book of the time david warner hams it up as the persecuting vampire hunter gay hating evangelist who is of course a self loathing closet case the list of sight gags and in jokes that were included to make sure nobody missed the point would be too long to go into the producers were having some good natured fun and hoping no doubt to lighten up as well as to enlighten br br but i have no clue how a teenage audience would look at this film nowadays in some places where there is education and culture the terrifying ordeals that gay teens had to go through are a thing of the past but i'm sure there are plenty of dark nasty corners of our continent where it's just as bad as it always was
<START> i was pleased with the cast of reputable players the story is one of standing up for a cause even if you are at personal risk in doing so in a time where violence and pain are often in the movie forefront this movie focuses on the old fashioned good cop although similar plots have been done repeatedly these guys pull it off well kick back and enjoy dennehy is a master of taking over a movie
<START> this film is a joke and quinton should be ashamed of himself trying to pass this off as a modesty blaise film if you are having trouble sleeping then all means rent this film the stick figure they call a actress who is suppose to be modesty blaise has got to be the most boring person on this planet maybe she could be used as a hat stand in the back ground of a real film seventy five minutes of nothing thank you who ever invented the fast forward button if you see this film if you can call it that coming your way run i can't help but think what 3rd world country could of used the money wasted of this crap this film is boring the actors are boring waste of colour a waste air they breath if you would like to see mostey blaise film then watch the one they made in the 60's maybe that what the director should of done
<START> what was the point of this movie what was the plot i do not know shaq can't act people don't know how to direct and i am kazaam a genie who raps come on maybe eminem or linkin park will be in a movie like this i remember i watched this just to kill time it didn't really interest me i just remember thinking who put shaq in this movie the whole story seemed stupid too it made no sense whatsoever i guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen i can't comment much more because this movie is so terrible there's nothing worth commenting about i wish this movie would go away
<START> somehow they summed up the 60's ten years that radically changed our country in four hours and what a painful four hours it was they trivilized the major events and happenings and they claimed it was about two families yet you barely saw the african american family if i were nbc i would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash what was amusing was this happy go lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways but managed to attend every major 60's event through the country and the second family was such a non factor they devoted maybe five or six scenes total to this family that poor son please nbc do not make any movies about any other eras leave that to pbs and the history channel
<START> this film although not totally bad should have been filmed where the actual events took place grand island nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornados on the night of june 3 1980 grand island is situated in the nearly treeless flat platte river valley in hall county the makers of this movie filmed in the tree covered hills of ontario and moved the whole event to a non existant town called blainsworth the people of grand island bravely survived this awful night only to be forgotten because of a poorly made movie
<START> this is an anti serb propaganda film made for tv br br the muslims are good the orthodox christian serbs are bad br br that's the message br br using entertainment to get across a propaganda message is nothing new br br this movie lays it on thick br br and apparently many viewers and reviewer lap it up br br i know better br br the serbs under general draza milhalovitch and his chetniks saved over 500 shot down us fliers from the germans in world war ii br br churchill decided to betray milhalovitch and put british backing behind communist tito roosevelt followed suit and as a result after the war ended yugoslavia was delivered over to communist tito br br and us ally milhalovitch has been smeared by the media ever since br br this movie is part of the anti serb propaganda campaign engineered by george soros and his international crisis group icg which culminated in the kosovo war in which serbia was bombed by nato because of totally false claims by the icg of mass graves in kosovo filled with victims of the nasty serbs the fact that there were no such mass graves and the albanians muslims had no business being in serbia's kosovo are facts that most of the media won't print br br i chose this movie to watch because the one sentence description on the video cover looked interesting br br imagine my disgust when i discovered i had been fooled into renting another branch of the propaganda machine aimed at serbia br br instead of this propaganda someone should make a movie about the unwillingness of the clinton administration to come clean with the congress and with the american people about its complicity in the delivery of weapons from iran to the muslim government in sarajevo br br i won't hold my breath waiting for such a movie
<START> first of all don't go into revolver expecting another snatch or lock stock this is a different sort of gangster film br br i saw the gala the other night and this movie definitely split the audience it's the kind of movie where half the audience will leave thinking what was that that was awful and the other half will leave thinking what was that that was cool personally i like films that i don't understand i e mullholland drive and usual suspects so i enjoyed revolver br br it definitely wasn't perfect though i saw the big twist coming a mile away at least part of it and though sometimes some loose ends left unexplained is good revolver leaves a lot of questions unexplained for no reason it seemed also some scenes like the animation and the scene where sorter goes on a killing spree actually one of my favourites although awesome scenes to watch seemed to just be there because they were awesome to watch not because they fit in with the movie br br however there were many good things too i thought the acting was superb from all the main actors jason stratham ray liotta vincent pastore and even andre benjamin who was a pleasant surprise this movie definitely kept my interest with one great suspenseful action packed scene after another when ray liotta was being held under the table wow well you have to see it the script was extremely well done and the soundtrack as with most guy ritchie films was great br br though a step below such movies as fight club mullholland drive and usual suspects it was still an awesome fast paced psychological action movie with many twists and turns and tons of scenes you will remember long after the movie is over
<START> this film is great as often heard it is indeed very realistic and sometimes brutal but unlike some other people i am clearly not of the opinion that it is depressing negativistic or dismantling austria as a proto fascist society quite the contrary while there are indeed some very heavy scenes in hundstage and some characters are to be called very bad persons at the same time you watch love beauty and humor in ulrich seidls film and that's exactly what distinguishes hundstage for me from other films that try to show the lives of the 'ordinary people' in an intense realistic way their hustle their wishes their dark sides seidl clearly never tries to prove that the lives of the working class people are trash in my opinion viewers who come to this conclusion seem to be very afraid of admitting that nearly nobody's live is as 'clean' and 'normal' as we would like other people to believe and that every live has its dark and often depressing sides the most beautiful scene the old viennese man watching his old girl dancing 'the oriental way' as he is calling it i think everybody who finds this scene ugly lacks a sense of beauty and should ask themselves what it is that's proto fascist the characters in hundstage or viewers who are turned off by the body of a 70 year old woman dancing with all her charms for her lover
<START> the us appear to run the uk police who all run around armed to the teeth and did you know that cid officers change into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub this has got to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of real uk police that has ever been foisted on the unsuspecting public i can see that mr snipes might have needed the money to pay his back tax bill but what the heck a good actor like charles dance was doing in it is a mystery br br worse than the worse low budget b film of the 50's an hour and a half of suicide and time i will never get back br br avoid it like the veritable plague
<START> as has been noted this formula has been filmed several times most recently as you've got mail with tom hanks and meg trout pout ryan of the several versions this is my least favorite the problem i think is that the studio coasted on the stars charisma which doesn't quite cut it here br br the chemistry betwixt the two leads never comes to a boil in this movie there are no real sparks van johnson and judy garland remind me of day old donuts pleasant but bland and when the leads are boring the rest of the movie can only follow judy in particular is disappointing she looks like she has no neck i don't know if she was having trouble with pain or something but she looks like a turtle trying to pull it's head into it's shell all hunched up and everything i couldn't figure out what van johnson was getting so hot about i would have made a bee line for that cute violin player and van wasn't great either i've always thought of him as a rather generic hollywood leading man and he doesn't do anything to dispel that image here br br if you're a fan of the stars or the early 1900's then you might like this movie but there are a lot more entertaining romantic comedies out there and they offer you much more than a mouthful of stale confection
