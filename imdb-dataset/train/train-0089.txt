<START> i am a big fan of the spaghetti western genre and i usually also like most of the cheaply made ones infamous director demofilo fidani however is rightly known for some of the cheapest trashiest and well worst contributions to the genre the plots of fidani's movies were usually very weak and since his talent was quite limited he usually tried to sell the movies by adding famous spaghetti western names like django of sartana to the titles i the particular case of giÃ¹ la testa hombre of 1971 he just took the title of sergio leone's giÃ¹ la testa aka duck you sucker and added 'hombre' the movie can be found under various titles fistful of death western story i personally bought it under the name adios companeros which this movie shares with another fidani film with almost the same cast per una bara piena di dollari which is also entitled adios companeros in the german language version br br the plot is rather weak it basically follows a guy named macho callaghan jeff cameron and his involvement with two rivaling outlaw gangs lead by butch cassidy jack betts and ironhead gordon mitchell br br the leading performance by jeff cameron is kindly stated not very convincing neither did i find jack betts very good as 'butch cassidy' b movie legend gordon mitchell however is always worth a try and although he probably wasn't a very good actor i always found his performances in the spaghetti westerns quite funny and original and he actually saved some of fidani's movies such as the rather crappy django and sartana showdown in the west br br there is one very funny and original thing about giÃ¹ la testa hombre the great klaus kinski is playing a priest i could have imagined kinski in any role but before seeing this movie i would never have guessed that anybody would cast him as a priest kinski is once again great although he has only little screen time and one scene where he breaks up a fight is probably the only good scene in this one more interesting thing about this film is that the legendary director and king of sleaze joe d'amato did the cinematography br br giÃ¹ la testa hombre is a cheap crappy film but nevertheless it has some funny moments being a spaghetti western enthusiast i found it fun to watch but if you're not never mind this movie or watch it only for the purpose of seeing kinski play a priest 3 10
<START> i saw this movie a couple years back i could'nt sleep and there was nothing on so i peeped it what really gets me is it makes no sense and thats why its disturbing richard gets tied up in chicken wire and jarvis starts making out with richard's girl while she's unconscious then jarvis's buddy troubador is playing some stupid song on his guitar by the next morning it shows richard's girl talking to jarvis and trouby and then she walks back to richard and looks at him while he's still tied up then they play some happy music and the movie is finished i mean what happened did they brake up and what was she saying to those 2 guys trouby and jarvis its to puzzling and to poor to i can't stand movies that are disturbing and don't make sense this was the worst film i've ever seen since the 90's version of lord of the flies
<START> if you want to watch a film that is oddly shot oddly lit weird stories of these men and one woman who enjoy beating the crap out of each other if you want to enjoy a story that goes nowhere of these two guys one a boxer and the other a gay man then you should watch this film br br after watching this film i almost felt as badly bruised up and cut up like the director of the film himself beat the hell out of me br br this is a movie where one is not meant to watch for plot or for great acting this is a film to gawk at in horror and wonder a lot like watching an airplane crash or a train wreck br br if you want to watch a great movie a good movie a b movie or even a mediocre movie this movie is not it br br a warning to all who watch this film please don't eat beforehand you might want to puke by the end of the film
<START> this is a great movie that everyone should see it plays like a dean koontz book br br bill paxton's performance was great in that it really seems like he believes in what he is saying and doing br br i don't know why viewers have to read in some kind of advocacy for religious murder in to the film it is fiction the ending is surprising but fictional so what i think that is what makes this movie so good spoiler do not read further if you havent seen the movie throughout the movie the viewer is continually shocked at the sickness of paxton's character the impact on the children and the way the children handle this outrageous conduct and then at the end it turns out to be true god has put him on a mission to rid the world of demons paxton is not clairvoyant as other viewers suggest sure he is given info that he couldn't have known otherwise but the movie goes further to show how god is protecting adam through the convenient video quality problem and the complete lack of memory of the second fbi agent the film isn't advocating christian murder it is merely taking the viewer on a very unexpected ride
<START> i love this film it's one of those i can watch again and again it is acted well by a good cast that doesn't try too hard to be star studded br br the premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller either would have killed the film completely br br the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feel good factor throughout br br it is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes no that's not a spoiler
<START> certainly nomad has some of the best horse riding scenes swordplay and scrumptious landscape cinematography you'll likely see but this isn't what makes a film good it helps but the story has to shine through on top of these things and that's where nomad wanders br br the story is stilted giving it a sense that it was thrown together simply to make a cool movie that looks great not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the region in which this story takes place and it's blatantly obvious with names like lee and hernandez if movie makers want to engross us in a culture like the jugars and the kazaks they damn well better use actors actresses that look the part br br warring tribes a prophecy brotherly love and respect a love interest that separates our heroes are all touched on but with so little impact and screen time that most viewers will brush them aside in favor of the next battle sequence the next action horse scene or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape br br it is worth mentioning that there were some significant changes made to nomad during its filming specifically the director and cinematographer ivan passer director was replaced by sergei bodrov and ueli steiger cinematographer was replaced by dan laustsen in one respect laustsen seems to have the better eye since his visions of the lands made the final cut that we see here definitely a good thing however the changing over to bodrov as director may not have been the wisest choice from what i'm seeing here the focus is on the battles and not the people which i sense comes from bodrov's eyes and not passer's a true travesty br br the most shameful aspect is that this could've been a really fantastic film with both character and action focuses unfortunately the higher ups apparently decided that action was what was needed and took the cheap intellectually speaking way out br br even though i can't give this film a positive rating it is worth watching simply for the amazing cinematography work but that's all
<START> i bought bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago i watched parts and deemed it just too dumb to review again the excessive amount of watery 'blood' at the beginning is just plain obsolete not to mention the whip around wind sounds my friends and i made a super low budget movie and the effects still exceeded this crap fest br br as for the amount of mistakes in this movie there are way too many to count i knew one of the actors believe it or not he was my theatre teacher ha br br final verdict don't bother with this horror flick br br 3 stars out of a possible 73
<START> this is something new br br there's a coup d'etat and a couple of irish documentary filmmakers are right inside of it br br a democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to read the constitution is being slandered by the private media openly as dictator mentally unstable new hitler etc without repercussion from the governments side like say silencing them via bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods oh and they still claim that they are being suppressed of course br br see how the media gloats about their own role in the coup d'etat on tv after they toppled the government with the help of rouge generals how much more stupid can you get br br and see how the people of venezuela march to the palace holding the constitution in their hands and reinstall their elected government br br this sounds like a hollywood fairytale but it happened for real against the explicit wishes of the usa the documentary is a historical masterpiece shot from the center of the action acute and totally embarrassing for the prime supporters of the coup the good democratic freedom loving benevolent usa who still channel large amounts of money to chavez' political opponents br br also highly entertaining and exciting 10 points
<START> memoirs of a geisha is a beautifully filmed movie there is no doubt about that and the acting is generally excellent at least in terms of how it portrays the characters as they are scripted br br however so many details small and large are just wrong that it just bothers me too much to be able to enjoy it fully a small detail that typifies the kind of lack of sensitivity of sorts is one scene no this does not spoil anything where mameha rings a bell that hangs at the door of the house where sayuri lives on a snowy winter day the bell she's ringing is a fuurin or wind chime that is only left hanging outside of houses in japan in the summer people in traditional japanese homes didn't have doorbells they just opened the door and announced themselves you may think this is such a trivial detail but i would equate this to a movie made about america where a christmas wreath is hanging on the door in july and no one thinks anything of it and don't even get me started on the totally wrong hairstyles given to the maiko and geisha which is vaguely pan asian chinese kung fu ish and nothing like real thing i think this rather cavalier attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray really comes out in the attitudes and the portrayals of people and situations too br br so i suppose that the less you know about japanese culture and the world of the geisha and maiko in kyoto which is what miyako is then i suppose the more you will enjoy this i honestly think this movie could have been so much better as it is it's just another hollywood version of exotic japan
<START> after high school graduation best friends alice and darlene decide to take a trip to thailand whilst they are there they meet a charming australian guy named nick after spending some time with nick he asks them if they want to take a weekend trip to hong kong with him they agree at the airport though they are get busted for smuggling drugs and then get convicted for 33 years in a thai prison for something they say they haven't done not really knowing what to do they end contacting yankee hank an american lawyer who lives in thailand with his wife word has it that if you have the money he can help you things start of well but they still can't get out br br the movie is really good because it doesn't let on what's going to happen and it's interesting all the time i couldn't believe the ending though it was one of those endings where you don't know the 100 truth but you still kind of know what really happened with nick and the drug smuggling because of the 'owning up' etc br br claire danes and kate beckinsale both give quite good performances here beckinsales performance was a little weak though both danes and beckinsales characters friendship is good but could of seemed stronger paul walker even has a small uncredited role here br br anyway i thought brokedown palace was a good movie and i give it a 7 10
<START> most who go to this movie will have an idea what it is about a man loses his entire family and even his dog in a flight from boston that fateful morning of september 11 2001 what you probably won't know before seeing this film is this how that would feel what do you do with that and how would that affect you and the way you relate to every waking day the story unfolds painfully slow from the gate and then warms up nicely as it gains a little speed while the recently renewed relationship between dentist alan johnson don cheadle and ex college roommate charlie fineman adam sandler solidifies and begins to take shape characters appear in this film whose presence initially seem obligatory and not well developed but in fact stay with this story and you find that the simplicity of each character is what makes this story believable and accurate real people inhabit a real situation whereby they can do little but stand aside while one amongst them disintegrates the pain inside charlie's soul is subtly evident from first introduction and grows as we learn more about his character Âbrilliantly revealed by sandler as layers of an onion Â one layer at a time with lightness and weight combined it's so subtle a performance that he sneaks up on you and gets inside your head while you are watching him on screen cheadle's alan johnson is equally subtle and very don cheadle always watchable the ease that's apparent when cheadle's on screen speaks to his consummate acting skills alan's relationship with charlie fineman is delicate in texture just as the situation would demand fineman doesn't want friendship nor anybody intruding into his cloistered life and yet the likable quality that alan owns is simple and honest enough to intrigue even a recluse like charlie it is alan who has the task of gingerly opening up charlie's carefully sealed life there is inherent danger in the process the more alan nudges charlie to open up going so far as engaging the services of friend and psychologist angela oakhurst liv tyler the nearer the danger of pushing charlie over the edge it's an abyss that charlie teeters on each and every waking moment and one he has learned to navigate through sheer dint of denial he has denied everything that priorly existed for him in order to exist with his loss unfortunately his grief is one thing he cannot deny sandler withdraws so deeply into his character's pain during the story's unfolding that by the time he meets his demons head on the viewer shares his pain almost equally alan stands beside charlie throughout this exacting process at the risk of lousing up his own perfect home life run with admirable grace and efficiency by wife janeane jada pinkett smith while tending to charlie's recovery alan looks inward and recognizes his own silent screams at the death of the independence he once owned and the boy he has lost becoming a man his reward for helping charlie is helping himself reconnect with what he has lost the theme is much like the fisher king another story of a man who isolates himself to the point of madness from sorrow and loss like the fisher king the story concludes with the traditional there is someone for everyone theme reign over me's lidia sinclair played by the wonderful amanda plummer in the fisher king is donna remar saffron burrows a woman on the verge of breakdown and sketchy patient of johnson's who turns out to be the just unstable enough to complement charlie's borderline insanity it's a good ending to the story but the one element probably least likely to ring true then again maybe there really is someone for everyone devorah macdonald vancouver bc
<START> question what do you call 100 film critics buried up to their necks in sand answer a good start well i don't know peter mattei from adam but if he is the budding auteur his filmography suggests love in the time of money is a good start a classy shoot with whimsical music box style music this flick looks at a chain of tenuous relationships as it moves from person a to person b to person c etc and back again ending with persons a b in carousel fashion the film gently probes the unhappy circumstances of nine people with finely rendered shadings beginning and ending with a street whore and her client the downside of this film is the lack of a story which may have something to do with the many critical slams it received i watched the behemoth angels in america last night and was bored at the end while this little concatenation of character studies kept me spell bound use caution i may be the only person who really liked this flick b
<START> i am only 11 years old but i discovered full house when i was about five and watched it constantly until i was seven then i grew older and figured full house could wait and that i had more important things to do plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it faithfully with me for those two years started to dislike it thinking it too girly br br then i realized every afternoon at five it was on 23 and i once again became addicted to it full house has made me laugh and cry it's made me realize how nice it would be if our world was like the world of full house plus a mom i have heard people say full house is cheesy and unbelievable but look at the big picture three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver the sisters fight and get their feelings hurt the three men who live with the girls can get into bickers at times what's any more real than that br br if anything the show has lifted me up when i'm down and brought me up even higher when i thought i was at the point of complete happiness i have howled like a hyena at the show and gained a massive obsessiveness over mary kate and ashley olsen of course hilary duff has now taken that spot but they were literally the cutest babies i have ever seen they are great actresses and seem to be very nice people
<START> this movie was two and a quarter excruciating hours someone please tell me what the point was br br i mean i understand the historical setting it's supposed to be about a ragtag group of confederate bushwhackers terrorists on the missouri kansas frontier taking revenge against all northern sympathizers and abolitionists during the u s civil war but aside from gratuitous violence there wasn't really much of a point to this movie perhaps it was a political statement that war is really nothing much more than gratuitous violence if that was the point it was done quite well but i don't think that was the point i think the producers really thought they were making a worthwhile movie here but as far as i was concerned there was a complete lack of any plot it seemed like i was watching a paperback novel come to life with the characters looking like what you would see on the covers of such novels br br this movie should be burned along with some of the towns this gang torched
<START> i remember watching this late at night on black and white tv long before a live action version was so much as a twinkle in peter jackson's eye and being very impressed finally getting my hands this week on a vhs copy that was being thrown away and isn't that just par for the course i had the chance to revisit this film and found that it still stands up quite well although it's not quite the success that memory had painted br br i have to confess to a certain bias here some reviewers announce themselves as confirmed jackson lovers others as jackson haters i'm not exactly either i was a devotee of the bbc radio adaptation by brian sibley originally broadcast in 1981 and instantly recognised the voice of gollum here peter woodthorpe would reprise this performance almost note perfect for the radio three years later br br i must say however that where i found jackson's films an increasingly indulgent disappointment the bakshi version for all that it has been cut to the bone is actually more accurate yes there are the usual understandable changes here it is legolas rather than arwen who is substituted for glorfindel as the elf sent from rivendell to meet the party and there is a great deal of telescoping of the action the only exception to the latter as others have remarked is the oddly extended sequence at the ford of rivendell where the ringwraiths having demonstrated a chilling ability to freeze and draw back frodo in mid flight which they deploy again when he defies them after crossing the river then for some unexplained reason simply chase after him in a prolonged straight gallop which is initially nightmarish but pointless plot wise and definitely goes on too long i would also agree that the balrog is unsatisfactory due partly to bad animation and that gandalf windmills his arms too much br br but having watched both approaches to the film i feel more than ever that the animated route is the one to take in a tale that is half myth oddly enough one thing that is included is a snippet of aragorn's story of beren and luthien the extreme literalism required by live action filming where everything from monsters to mail shirts has to be created in detail to appear on camera is counter productive latex faced or cgi monsters are less monstrous than sketchily drawn shapes heroic costumes tend to look rather silly worn on real bodies and hobbits or dwarfs with non human body proportions are easy to animate but hard to film convincingly many reviewers have cited the sniffing ringwraith in the woods with its crippled half human movements as one of the scariest moments in the film it certainly frightened me silly when i saw it for the first time alone in the dark br br the extreme stylisation of the introduction plus a voice over done with great skill and economy to sum up the back story in a few sentences works very well to depict an almost mythical era and the change to the comic book rusticism of the shire i particularly like the proudfeet corresponds effectively to the similar change in tone of tolkien's prose i did feel that there were some missed opportunities where the potential of animation could have been used to great effect gandalf threatening bilbo with his true power in the opening scenes bilbo seeming to become a gollum like creature under the influence of ring lust at rivendell and galadriel's famous temptation speech all were drawn more or less straight where it would have been trivial to distort the scene to reflect the hobbits' changed perceptions but generally speaking the changes in detail and palette firelight hues at bree bright colours re emerging at rivendell and in the fangorn clearing dirty greys and browns for moria and the desolate lands work well to reflect the mood of the various episodes where a live action approach simply doesn't allow you to blur the background or sketch in a stylised setting br br as a fan i didn't care for either jackson's or bakshi's depiction of lothlorien again i feel that the radio soundscape was the best evocation i've come across of a beautiful slightly uncanny woodland paradise caught out of time and i feel that bakshi got the elven singing at this point pretty badly wrong but i do like the little montage at this point showing the various members of the company relaxing together after their travails in moria aragorn giving a hobbit fencing lesson here is as charming and equally uncanonical a spectacle as boromir engaging with the hobbits in hollin in the jackson version br br the depiction of aragorn as convincingly weatherworn ranger is good throughout this film viggo mortensen's scruffy jesus look really didn't work for me although it would have been interesting to see how they planned to 'clean up' the character in the second half for gondor's benefit john hurt unsurprisingly gives a sterling vocal performance as does a resonant william squire in the part of gandalf the hobbits are i suspect intended to reflect contemporary youth as audience identification figures i find the animated style their proportions are much more 'cartoonish' than those of the human characters works well to differentiate them and the whole 'hairy feet' thing as drawn here comes across as much more plausible than in more literal depictions including much fan art br br personally i have less objection to boromir as viking he was always a fairly bludgeoning type than to beardy aragorn illogical they were both numenorians after all although i am clearly in a minority here br br the big flaw in this picture is always going to be the fact that it was an unfinished project with a bizarre tacked on voice over ending attempting to resolve matters a pity it would have been interesting not to mention less frustrating to see what bakshi planned to make of shelob and minas tirith never mind the dead
<START> i got to see an early preview of this movie and i hope they have time to edit it in what ever way they can to improve on it before it comes out aug 3rd it stars andy samberg from saturday night live as 'hot' rod kimble he's plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stunt man like his late father when we meet him he's jumping a mail truck on his mo ped yes a mo ped and almost makes it this would be worthy of a 'jackass' movie if he wasn't honestly trying to do this isla fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girl next door denise she seems to like rod enough to join his 'crew' jorma taccone also snl plays his half brother kevin who documents the stunts with a camcorder sissy spacek plays rod's mom marie she remarried frank powell played by ian mcshane frank's a real tough guy who enjoys beating rod in some real drag out brawls it's clear that rod's not going to earn frank's respect till he can beat him we find out frank needs a 50 000 heart transplant and rod is determined to raise the money just so he 'can beat his ass' once he's healed and prove himself a man a long fall down a mountain side convinces rod to 'go big' on one stunt rod sets out to get seed money by charging for doing stunts that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life like the human torch at a children's birthday party there were those at the showing who managed to laugh at most of the stunts just when all hope and money is lost along comes a sponsor who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses rod wants to jump he gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get donations rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle the whole town turns out and the world tunes in does he make the jump does he get the girl do they raise the 50k does frank get his ass beat by rod wait till this 90 minute movie comes out on video to find out
<START> although critically maligned johnny dangerously is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen it's a movie that should be watched closely some of the funny bits are done in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention drawn to them for instance keep an eye on michael keaton's use of the pricing gun at the pet store and also on the documentary style years that appear at the beginning of scenes it's one of those rare movies where the humor hits you unexpectedly even though you know it's a comedy amy heckerling the director is really sharp here if you enjoyed her better known films fast times at ridgemont high clueless european vacation etc you should give this one a look br br michael keaton is extremely likable in the title role and the supporting cast griffin dunne maureen stapleton joe piscopo peter boyle is excellent highly recommended
<START> the legend of bloody jack is set in the alaskan wilderness starts as a relative of some murderous deceased occultist lumberjack reads incantations the evil dead 1982 style from an ancient spell book in an attempt to resurrect him he succeeds not being a big believer in family unity the lumberjack dude kills his relative two days later ray travis quentin young along with his sister dawn erica hoag her boyfriend nick craig bonacorsi four of their friends pull up outside a cosy log cabin the evil dead style with a view to a relaxing weekend in the wilderness unfortuntaely the killer lumberjack dude show's up with his axe starts to slaughter the friends one by one br br edited written executive produced directed by todd portugal this is a pretty rotten modern slasher flick the likes of which are killing the horror genre for me i'm just not a big fan of ultra low budget horror films with the production values of a holiday video the script is absolutely terrible in every way for 80 minutes it has every bad slasher clichÃ© the character's are awful the dialogue is terrible it's hard to care about anyone or anything in this pretty worthless excuse for a teen slasher film the teens are even more annoying stupid than usual the script is more moronic predictable flawed than usual the killer lumberjack dude is just lame then there's the final 10 minutes or so which if you make it that far believe it's tough going produces one of the worst twist ending in slasher film history which as far as i'm concerned pokes fun at us the paying audience who has just had to sit through 90 minutes worth of crap i will now spoil the ending so anyone who doesn't want to know it stop reading now basically just before the end of the film it cuts back to ray telling a story it turns out he was telling the story of what we had just seen nick dawn everyone else berates him for telling such a bad story i felt their pain then proceed to pick holes in it laugh at it from saying why did they stand around argue why didn't they pick the axe up such things i felt like this was poking fun at the audience as those were the sorts of things i was asking myself while watching this crap to have it shoved down my throat made perfectly clear that the makers knew the script was crap could see all the holes in it went for a twist ending which unashamedly rubbishes the preceding 80 minutes which we have just had to sit through remember is just a little grating then to add insult to injury the lumberjack dude turns up kills everyone within two minutes why didn't he do that to start with it would have saved everyone a lot of time br br director portugal turns in a real mess this has the worst continuity between night day in a film i have ever seen the whole film is meant to set at night i suspect the makers tried to use the day for night process but it didn't work most of it looks like it is set during the day for example look at when lisa is trapped in the bathroom she climbs out of the window it is clearly pitch black outside when we are looking out from inside the bathroom but when she falls to the ground the films cuts to an exterior shot it's bright daylight then there's the fact ranger vince says we can't get a search party out here until 'the morning' indicating it was supposed to be night then several minutes later when he walks outside it looks like it's the middle of the day he is actually carrying around a torch which is clearly on he is clearly pointing it in the directions where he is looking like it's night anytime there is a scene set in the cabin look at the windows it's pitch black outside when the ranger walks in through the door to start with is also another clear example the continuity in this film is simply the worst i have ever seen there isn't much gore there are a few scenes of an axe going into people bodies but nothing memorable it's not scary there's no tension or atmosphere the appalling day night continuity is just so distracting because it's so obvious br br technically the film is rock bottom again the continuity between night day has to been seen to be believed how bad it is the special effects are poor they couldn't even afford to show a car blowing up even though it's pretty vital to the plot this has amateur hour written all over it from start to finish the acting is absolutely brilliant everyone involved should get an oscar nah only joking not really they were utterly awful even the girls who got their breasts out weren't very good looking br br the legend of bloody jack is just an awful teen slasher flick it looks like it was shot on a camcorder without the use of a tripod or steadycam it has awful effects is boring has a twist ending which is either the most insulting in horror film history or i've got it totally wrong it's the most clever not recommended watch a decent slasher from the 70's or 80's to remind you how they should be done
<START> i like david hamilton's artistic photographs of nude women at the border of womanhood sometimes erotic though never pornographic someone else liked them too because my david hamilton books were stolen in one book were seen a few pictures of a young boy obviously nude intimate with a young woman older than he also nude though discrete there was strong sexual connotation new territory for david hamilton which proved to be either stills from the movie tendres cousines or perhaps photos taken on set br br the art of still photography unfortunately does not automatically translate to cinematography soft focus becomes out of focus and discrete angles become confusing perhaps because in motion they cannot be considered you either see it or miss it and there's no time to observe to comprehend the movie is supposed to be a farce and funny things do happen but it doesn't hang together perhaps because the story develops so slowly and one may wonder just what's going on eventually the 14 year old julien has intercourse with his cousin but it's soft core with no genital contact shown on camera since it's a farce we have a disappointing virgin and an embarrassing caught in the act gag and having caught them julien's father even gives him a cigarette to complete the experience in fairness the film is in french and conforms to french cinematic forms which may just be too subtle for most americans even with english subtitles to help us phillistines along br br it's been suggested that this film is child pornography and that certainly results from today's climate where sexual exploitation of children is clearly a serious problem nobody in their right mind wants to endorse or appear to endorse the sexual abuse of children so there's practically no room left for children to be seen in even the mildest erotic context without immediately activating alarms over sexual violence and exploitation guys will think lucky julien even as they agree that sex and children in the movies is a bad thing all the while still wishing they could have been a julien at that age women too may have similar thoughts but all such considerations must be pushed out of one's conscious mind hysterically the worst assumptions have become automatic and matters of children and sex are rigorously avoided too bad since sexual awakening is a real human experience afer all children do grow up and become sexual beings as julien does it's a fit literary subject cinema included but taboo under the threat of sexual violence against children david hamilton i think was taking a risk to make a movie on this topic even in 1980 he was somewhat successful at exploring this sensitive topic and unfortunately we're unlikely to see better in the near future for fear of the child pornography label
<START> i'm going to write about this movie and about irreversible the in famous scene in it so you are warned if you haven't seen the movie yet this are just my thoughts why i think the movie fails in the end pun intended br br acting wise rosario dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger a teenager in other words the villain guy is good but loses his evil touch right before the end if he really never changes then why would he let a woman tie him up he wouldn't period then we also have the bartender 2nd rape dude actually i don't think you would need him at least not for the 2nd rape but more about that later on br br let's reprise the story rosarios character is sexually insecure might even have lesbian tendencies see her scene with a female friend this wasn't intentional as rosario states herself but there is sexual tension between them rosario's character meets a guy who is a sexual predator in all the bad senses but he makes an impression on her br br rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before i beg to differ because she acts as if it is her first boyfriend which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother talking about her mother here's another problem after the first rape takes place rosarios character doesn't tell anyone what happened seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one nothing of that gets explored after that if rosarios character wouldn't call her mother anymore or would behave strangely the mother would be worried like crazy there was so much potential here also her female friend we see her at the party it's obvious there is something going on and boom she is gone br br the first rape is almost unbearable to watch but feels like a pinch when you compare it to the ending rape which feels like you're getting hit with a sledge hammer after rape no 1 we get too stretched out scenes threads are opened such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian as one guy states who tried to hit on her but left in the open no real social contact is established if you leave the bartender guy out who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene it's apparent that he isn't a nice guy and his character get's fleshed out a bit but when rosarios character meets her rapist in class again his being in the movie seems pointless we get the point that rosarios character isn't the same anymore that she went bad and is able to hurt people too many scenes show exactly that her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff back to rapist 1 who cheats on a test gets caught by rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again really as absurd as that sounds the guy meets up with her not without us having seen him beforehand with another girl very likely that he raped her too although we never see anything of that fortunately and his football career well career is a stretch and he is bullied this is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works but then again is too clichÃ© to stay with you so rapist 1 submits to rosarios character why exactly because he promised her it was her day again really a guy like that never loses control especially with a woman he raped before i guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is the bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something but letting him submit like that just feels wrong another possibility would have a drug in his drink br br so rapist 1 undresses and get's blindfolded and let's rosarios character tie him on a bed seriously that's just crazy but what comes next is even crazier first she talks to him then she shuts him up and forces an object into him this is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one this isn't about what this guy deserves or not it's just intense and of course that was what they were aiming for now after she is done the bartender guy comes in and rapes rapist 1 if this really should work as a revenge movie it would have been better if rosarios character herself would have been doing all the revenge having a henchman doing the job takes away everything that was built up br br this isn't supposed to be entertaining enjoyable it's a hard watch it is art house but the 10 minute i didn't count rape scene at the end just smashes everything rosarios character is more or less only watching what happens which brings me to the biggest disappointment br br irreversible comparison irreversible had the rape scene but the movie went on even if it was back into time rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this first that comes a bit too late that should see her say that after the initial rape and secondly and most importantly this is where the art house movie should've come in it is more interesting seeing were rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope with what she had done but then again she didn't actually physically do that much see above a broken character that the movie cuts off br br good intentions talia and rosario had worked before but failing to convey most of the things they set out to do even if you can see what they meant it has to be convincing otherwise it doesn't work not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are
