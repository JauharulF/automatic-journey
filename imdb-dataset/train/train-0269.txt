<START> i just viewed this great good natured parody of night of the living dead and i have to say it was so awful and so corny it was excellent this movie incorporated all the antics and scenery shots that the original had including the cemetery the supposable abandoned house the basement and the front lawn what i especially love about this movie is the comical use of bread and all the common household enemies bread has a grudge against c'mon we know that toasters toaster ovens and zip locks have done bread in a dozen times and now we must call for their help in order to defeat the reanimated bread aside from the cheap acting and voice overs this short horror film is my personal favorite parody of night of the living dead even better than night of the living dead of 1990 br br i think what makes this movie worth watching is how the writers and directors utilized all the dialogue from the original movie and revolved it around bread including how the bread became reanimated and to avoid leftovers because they are especially dangerous another great reason why i love this movie is that there is no exception as to what bread is evil bagels are evil and even communions are evil which is demonstrated by a hilarious scene involving a newscaster and a rather monotone priest i think that the actors are especially humorous performing the deed of being viscously attacked by slices of bread i e the car scene i think the end is very worth sticking around br br even though this is a short and that night of the day of the dawn of the son of the bride of the return of the revenge of the terror of the attack of the evil mutant alien flesh eating hellbound zombified living dead part 2 in shocking 2 d is debatably another great parody it's still recommend as a great horror parody done by what seems to be college filmmakers i highly recommend this movie to anybody who is able to make fun of night of the living dead and still have respect for the filmmakers i would also like to recommend this movie to anybody who loves d movies and horror parody's it's just a wonderful little short horror film that's fun to watch and learn
<START> i have just recently read the novel mother night i've owned the dvd for some time now and watch it every so often few movies i own and have seen have made me think and question as much as mother night has i am amazed at the brilliance not only of vonnegut but of the translation of his text to screen br br do not rent or watch this movie on vhs it must be done on dvd and it must be accompanied by the director's commentary on the film to see how they took a fairly simple story yet complex in its substance and dialogue and made it work so well i think any viewer will be amazed br br the omissions in the movie are few from the text and do not detract from it much the movie might as well be the book and is the best adaptation i have ever seen i so highly recommend both the book and movie together that it does a disservice to merely say go watch it br br it will change you if you do
<START> there may be spoilers br br charlie fineman adam sandler who lost his family in a tragedy the terrorist attacks of sept 11 still grieves over their deaths he runs into his former college roommate alan johnson don cheadle and the two rekindle their friendship alan vows to help his old friend come to terms with the terrible loss this is a simplification of the basic story of reign over me br br this movie is however a story of how fate intercedes in our lives when we ourselves may be powerless do any thing about our own states of being alan is stuck in a life that he knows is no longer fulfilling he feels friendless and out of touch with his own reality he is unable to communicate with his wife and his associates at work he can't express his feelings and as a result feels lost and distant from his own world he chances upon charlie on the streets of manhattan while driving from his job eventually he meets and discovers that charlie who originally does not remember alan is living in a false reality of his own charlie has gone back to a time in his life when he had no family he lives as if he were still a student playing in a rock band collecting vinyl records of the 60s and 70s bands and playing video games he has escaped to a better and safer time in his life where there are no bad guys and he has a lot less to lose everyone in this movie is affected in some way by the tragedy that has affected charlie and his remission to a formerly different and better place his landlady is his protector and great enabler his in laws are subtracted from his life because they would take him back to the reality that his family is now gone from his life and alan is most affected by him because alan wants to in at first a selfish desire to escape from his own reality to be with charlie as a means to subtract himself from his own stifled reality and then he wants to find a way to help charlie begin to recover from his self induced guilt and denial of loss it is through this relationship that not only is charlie able to begin to heal himself but that alan in fact learns to communicate and sate his true desires with his associates at work and eventually is able to admit to his wife he has not been able to communicate his real feelings to her but that he strongly wants to because he does love her it is in fact a poignant moment in the film when the stuff has hit the fan and charlie is being confronted with the reality of being put away that he and alan are talking about the situation together over chinese that charlie states that he is in fact worried about alan and not himself br br this movie will if you let it take you through a river of emotions and leave you thinking it will have you laughing at how charlie uses his words like people really do in everyday life to make a comical statement of fact about a real situation it will leave you on the verge of tears in my case actual tears when charlie confronts his grief and begins to come to grips with his tremendous loss and that in fact the tragic reality is his guilt and loss has really never left him and he dealt with it in the only way he knew denial it will make you curse at the cold unthinking actions of a young prosecutor trying to win his case as i actually did at charlie's hearing and it will make you smile at the commonsense of a old and wise stern judge donald sutherland who is great at his short distinct role and gives the best performance of a wise stern person in the legal profession since wilford brimley played an assistant attorney general in absence of malice br br this movie was also amazing to me for a few other reasons 1 i never looked at my watch once during the showing of the film which means it had me from the beginning to the end 2 although the cast was interracial this fact was not important to the playing out of the roles of the characters in the film race was a non factor to the performance of the roles in this movie amazing people can actually interact with out this fact being brought out and 3 the only real reference to 9 11 is when charlie's financial attorney refers to the tragedy of charlie's loss as Âwhat charlie had become on 9 12 time will be the true test of how this movie will stand out in the future but if the purpose of a movie is not to just entertain but to make one think and have that movie stay with you long after you leave the theatre then reign over me succeeded phenomenally as far as i am concerned i have not yet forgotten this wonderful thought provoking film and i will wait impatiently for the day i can purchase it as a dvd
<START> only once in a while do we get an r rated comedy that gets everyone's time and attention it's an even rarer case when the critics will like it i just came back from the 40 year old virgin and i can honestly say it was one of the biggest laughs of my life i went to a 10 35 showing and every row was filled not only that everyone laughed their ass off the whole time through it's two hours of non stop laughing i dare you to see this film and to not laugh br br the plot is simple a man is forty years old and he is a virgin yet behind this simple five second joke we are given a deep complex story that is not only one of the funniest you'll ever witness but has genuine lessons behind it steve carell stars as andy stitzer the 40 year old virgin we have known steve carell as in my opinion one of the best scene thieves of all time stealing hilarious scenes from bruce almighty and especially anchorman steve carell has come a long way as finally and proudly is given his moment to shine as the star no one will forget his name once they witness this pervasively funny gut busting roll in the aisle hilarious comedy br br the beauty about the film is it isn't 100 stupid the brilliant writing of judd apatow and steve carell genuinely has purpose and it's not just one hell of a story to tell behind the crudeness and vulgar non stop ride of the film comes an important lesson to be learned although not presented in the best way possible the film gives us more than a purely enjoyable time its gut busting attitude will have you laughing the whole time through while we simultaneously see the real life struggles of people like andy and his fellow co workers the end couldn't have been better not only does it deliver what we are promised but it gives one of the most memorable finishing numbers a comedy has ever seen it would have been perfect if there was vince vaughn and owen wilson in there cameoing somehow but you can't win 'em all now can you br br finally i think as roger ebert put it catherine keener gives an unexplainable perfect performance as trish the one woman andy has his heart truly for not only does she also give us laughs but it is crazy to see how brightly she fuels the story she was cast perfected in the role and her and carell have terrific not to mention hilarious chemistry on screen br br canadian ratings wise once again ontario slips away with a 14a while british columbia alberta and manitoba all slapped the 40 year old virgin with an 18a the same thing happened with four brothers in my opinion the second best film of the year and i can honestly say that i love ontario more and more so for that to all you fellow teenagers out there in the states good luck sneaking in br br overall steve carell gives one of the funniest performances i've ever seen and just about everyone in the cast distributes to the non stop laughter everyone will love the 40 year old virgin this summer and i encourage everyone to see it as fast as humanly possible it is the best comedy of the year hands down it beats all over the longest yard the wedding crashers and of course apatow and carell's last memorable comedy anchorman br br it is a comic masterpiece and deserves the remarkable amount of praise from the critics who have been loving it every single one of my favourite critics loved it and it deserves a spot on the imdb top 250 right away steve carell is a huge star watch one of the brightest ones of the summer right now br br my rating 9 10 br br objectively Â 9 10 br br subjectively Â 10 10 br br eliason a
<START> this movie had to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen the acting was terrible horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot i will never watch this movie again nor will i recommend this movie to anyone what a waste of time first as soon as the movie began i realized what i got myself into all they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie the prank phone calls halloween night a psycho and one knife its absolutely ridiculous i was not scared at all during the movie which i thought horror movies were supposed to do as for the making of the movie its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary i mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of scary movie for example at least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie
<START> spoilers br br wow end of the world is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experience br br here is the full story a scientist is getting messages from space a la independence day the messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in china he starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so he's trying to figure out who's receiving the messages and who's also sending out messages in space he and his wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent they visit it everything looks normal including the priest played by a bored christopher lee but the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent so he and his wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens disguised as priests and nuns they are held against their will and the alien played by lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet once the alien get the special element the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform lee being the last alien left tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens lee walks in the transporter and he's gone the couple looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world decide to follow the aliens because earth is doomed the couple doesn't see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear the last shot of the movie is a papier mache planet earth exploding the end br br that's it br br i've never seen such a dull movie in my life it's the most underwhelming movie i've ever experienced the scientist and his wife are two of worst heroes or protagonists ever put on screen they don't care about anything they see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide what the heck who needs earth anyway they don't even try to stop them or do something to make things better this kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent the actors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their paces so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work i wasn't expecting much with this movie because it is a charles band production but i didn't expect it to be this bad br br christopher lee was once asked what was his worst film he ever made and he mentioned starship invasions well i'm sorry chris but starship invasions was actually goofy fun starship invasions is terrible but terribly entertaining end of the world is much much much worst it's beyond dull and inert with no entertainment value whatsoever
<START> this is pretty funny saturday the 12th a great work i laughed every minute of the movie this is like scary movie for the 1980's great student bodies styled gags br br too bad this isn't on video but you can still watch it on flix
<START> non existent plot tons of poorly directed super cheesy scenes snipers world famous sharpshooters who can't even hit their targets a few feet away plus what's up with the ending a bunch of law enforcers vandalizing a carnival's shooting gallery wth technical mistakes how many bullets can you fit into a magazine of a glock 100 these people fire their guns without the need of reloading the movie is so bad that even senior hollywood actor like michael biehn aliens terminator can't save this junk br br do not watch this movie i realized that i wasted some good 100 minutes of my precious life on this one hopefully the director would either stop making movies or learn more for his next movie
<START> this may very well be the worst movie i'll see if i live to be 100 i think a group of first graders could have come up with better plot lines as a class project than this i'm dumber for having watched it and god have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this film br br and after i finally turned it off i actually had the urge to vomit br br no one had a clue about photography when made this no one had a clue about acting no one had a clue about just about anything br br i can't believe f x shows this crap on occasion the only time i had seen it was on one of the starz channels not even the main one and it was on at about 3 a m at that
<START> wow is all i can say if your reading this is either watched it or are thinking about it trust me watch it br br i laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie the worst acting ever made is very funny i cant believe they superimposed the school sign i must have played that scene over and over again just to laugh more and more every time if a movie like this can be made it gives us all hope in making our own movies even the costume was bad it looked like my 7 year old cousin could have done a better job on making it heck i bet he could have written and acted better as well all i know is that i have to watch the second part just so i can see if it was as bad as the first its a cool idea about a killer scarecrow but a much better job could have been done hopefully another killer scarecrow movie comes out just not like this one
<START> i've seen this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time i still felt it br br the story itself was incredible but came alive by spielberg's expertise and the fabulous cast including whoopi goldberg oprah winfrey danny glover and margaret avery akosua busia deserved an oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of nettie br br you'll experience every human emotion while watching this film i laughed cried and got angry like most great movies it was looked over by the academy with a host of nominations but no wins but this movie without a doubt is definitely one of the best films of all time
<START> although i can understand the bad things someone has to say about this movie i still found it to be absolutely amazing it will touch you and unless your a critic searching deep into the flaws and mishaps of every movie or you just simply aren't touched by anything it is worth seeing don't come into the movie expecting anything just have a box of tissues and an open mind it is beautiful and the acting is brilliant i think will smith despite that he's yet again playing another lonely depressed individual is amazing i believe a good actor is someone who can truly portray feelings and emotions we all have at our worst best experiences in such a way that it reaches out to you and makes you feel something and that's exactly what this movie does give it a chance
<START> i've seen about four other japanese horror films and they weren't too impressive however i could sense that there was a sensible script guiding the way br br not here no way this is about a detective who is trying to tie together similar murders that have been happening when he finds a suspect to question the suspect freaks out because they keep seeing a ghost then the ghost starts to follow the detective around for a reason that is never explained and takes up more than half of the movie br br bad enough oh no the film keeps switching perspectives to different characters who don't have much to do with the story i've seen this before in other movies where it shows a different perspective not the case here br br also whatever is happening on screen that is actually tolerable quickly ends for example there a few scenes with a slight instrumental score that builds up and then it just cuts to another scene i'm aware that this can be a dramatic effect that's definitely not the intention here it's just bad editing br br finally there's the ghost who just screams in a way that's not scary or unintentionally funny it's annoying and it happens a lot throughout the movie br br all of the scares have been done before in better ways so you can see them all coming then after one of them the movie is over at that point a wave of confusion swept over the audience as i could sense we all felt that we had wasted our time someone did a mock clap and laughter ensued it was better than the whole film simply put avoid
<START> the first matrix movie was lush with incredible character development witty dialog and action scenes that kept with the flow of the story these elements coupled by incredible special effects of the day presented a magical ride that kept you in suspense the entire time enter matrix reloaded and its sequel revolutions the problem here isn't the special effects or the fight sequences as some may argue the brothers have taken well developed characters from the first film and hollowed them out like rotten tree logs Â the connection that was first established between viewers and on screen characters in the first film is lost when you realize these are not the same characters from the first matrix movie br br to wit morpheus was developed as a charismatic philosophical character with insight far exceeding anyone else in the movie but here in reloaded we're presented by a different morpheus who stands hard and hollow reduced to corny one liners that contradict the character we saw develop in the first film this character just didn't feel the same and this could also be said about the supporting characters in the movie br br the removal of 'tank' was also a disappointment tank's involvement in the first film was minimal at best but he played the role extremely well in reloaded we discover that tank dies after the events in the first film and he is replaced by a jar jar binks stunt double that couldn't act to save his live think stale box of kellogg's corn flakes his performance left me chuckling throughout and most of his spoken dialog lacked timing there was an overwhelming sense that he was either trying too hard to convey his emotions on screen or the delivery in the script was off in either case the experience was humorous at times i felt embarrassed for the actor br br even neo's godly persona was suspect during most of the fighting sequences the alleyway battle with the 200 agent smith clones was certainly exaggerated one must wonder for a man so gifted as neo that he would even waste his time engaging in such a fruitless frivolous battle when more pressing matters attend especially when you consider his ability to fly or his ungodly ability to bend the matrix certainly neo could have dispatched the clones much quicker and more efficiently again such acts lend themselves to a script hindered by consistency and scenes created as filler to keep us from feeling gypped in jest our expectations of the characters created in the first film are discarded promptly sadly for those expecting more of the same you will certainly walk away feeling gravely disappointed br br however if you take reloaded as your standard run of the mill action movie and forget the incredible story inconsistencies and the untwining of already established character development from the first film you should walk away feeling quite pleased
<START> i was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea i think the dark heart character is a little on the rough side and i don't like the way he shape shifts into a mean frog fox boyÂ i was wrong this movie was made for my kid not for me she gets it when it went over under my head of course i don't get it this isn't one of the new kids movies that adults will also enjoy this is straight for the young ones and the crew knew what they were doing there isn't any political junk ether there's no magic key that will save the world from ourselves nobody has the right to access excess and everyone isn't happy all the time and as a side benefit nobody dies Ârusswill
<START> i thought this movie did a down right good job it wasn't as creative or original as the first but who was expecting it to be it was a whole lotta fun the more i think about it the more i like it and when it comes out on dvd i'm going to pay the money for it very proudly every last cent sharon stone is great she always is even if her movie is horrible catwoman but this movie isn't this is one of those movies that will be underrated for its lifetime and it will probably become a classic in like 20 yrs don't wait for it to be a classic watch it now and enjoy it don't expect a masterpiece or something thats gripping and soul touching just allow yourself to get out of your life and get yourself involved in theirs br br all in all this movie is entertaining and i recommend people who haven't seen it see it because what the critics and box office say doesn't always count see it for yourself you never know you might just enjoy it i tip my hat to this movie br br 8 10
<START> a tragically wonderful movie brings us to a japan that does not exist anymore despite hollywood's technical expertise i have yet to see a hollywood movie that can match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town by the river near the sea tom cruise's the last samurai looked liked the last installment of the lord of the rings in trying to capture rural old japan br br if you like serene but intense story lines this is a must see film it will be a respite from hollow flashy films much like the last 1000 blockbusters you saw i think this is one of kurosawa's better stories br br even if it's a movie about geishas and brothels and the complicated rules that govern life in such settings it did not turn into a skin flick the characters are full of depth and act with much intensity
<START> it was a sunday night and i was waiting for the advertised movie on tv they said it was a comedy the movie started 10 minutes passed after that 30 minutes and i didn't laugh not even once the fact is that the movie ended and i didn't get even on echance to laugh please someone tickle me i lost 90 minutes for nothing
<START> this is a really dumb movie it could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting but it just isn't br br some aliens hear the broadcast of war of the worlds when a small country radio station plays it on halloween they come to earth to kill humans but instead of killing they make people their slaves and act goofy the front cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in space not really what they do these aren't party aliens they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched modulated voices the alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the jack nicholson rip off alien who always wears his sunglasses other than the aliens the acting is terrible the writing is obviously meant for children because every character is written like a kid br br this is a dumb movie that only children will appreciate maybe br br my rating 1 2 out of 100 mins pg for mild language
<START> home room like zero day and elephant was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings but unlike the other two films home room focuses on two survivors not the shooters or those killed in the aftermath of a shooting making it less exploitive and more useful because little effort is wasted in asking questions for which there are no answers br br don't give up on this little film during the first 20 minutes it is supposed to set up the real story but plays like a rejected hill street blues episode it is lame but bear with it at least it pads the running length enough to get the film classified as a feature i recommend skipping this entirely and just jumping ahead to the hospital scenes there is nothing here that you can't pick up from the remainder of the film br br like a lot of good little films this was creatively a one man show as paul f ryan was both the writer and the director while this arrangement does not guarantee a good film it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution that is often lacking in big budget dramatic features because the script of home room is its real strength it is fortunate that the writer also executed the production and insured that his vision made it onto the screen br br ryan takes a huge chance with the ending which tests the limits of the average viewer's sentimentality tolerance he runs it right up to the edge but against all logic leaves you crying instead of cringing why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey the song sarah mclaughlin's sweet surrender he goes out on and the amazing editing of the final minute br br the other strength of the film is the casting of busy phillips alicia and erika christensen deanna as the main protagonists although phillips plays her standard alienated surly teen and christensen her intelligent daughter of a good family they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before the family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to ryan what is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie alicia to the lone shooter if they ever re cut and trim the film this side story should be condensed br br a story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and ryan could have easily steered this film into clichÃ© and predictability but instead his script has them engaging in a fascinating and convincing sparring match slowly chipping away at each other and sharing moments of vulnerability only to retreat back inside themselves deanna's i'm dying inside line just tears you apart i can't think of a moment in any other film that i felt as intensely as that one she desperately needs a connection that alicia just as desperately resists deanna only makes progress when she retreats the viewer keeps expecting the group hug that never seems to happen br br ultimately this not only generates a lot of suspense but leaves you admiring both characters and the two actresses who brought them to life br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
