<START> despite having known people who are either great fans of noam chomsky or think he's a tired relic from the 1960s i really had no opinion of the man save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist although i could not elucidate any of his theories and that he was a liberal socialist with marxist leanings so stumbling across the dvd of the 2003 documentary noam chomsky rebel without a pause in a used video store a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9 11 i decided to get it just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person pro or con spoke of him while glad i got the film my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was so what's all the fuss about br br for a man with so many degrees lauded as 'the most important intellectual alive' by the new york times according to the dvd's case there sure was not a lot there intellectually speaking i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate and i wouldn't even want to watch what a william f buckley could do to him granted the whole film was seemingly about chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he'd say rather than being on linguistics so maybe that's the reason he came off so badly but again if he is a linguist and tops in his field why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise Â even worse are his acolytes who seem to further insulate the man from reality by fostering delusions that chomsky is a target for zionist assassins what little i knew of chomsky before watching this film this much i knew he was generally considered a has been and pretty much irrelevant intellectually since the fall of the soviet empire the film is so poorly structured and without a narrative thread that it's difficult to separate all of the jumble his wife carol as example apparently gave one interview which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film she seems a nice enough woman but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life the lone interesting thing she says is that 9 11 was a great thing for the chomskys for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then br br not surprisingly this sort of film gives almost no biographical background it's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this 'great man' bears chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one stylistically there are no camera movements no interesting edits nor any signature touches and most of the film is disjunct rambles by chomsky videotaped huzzahs of chomsky declaiming on this or that and slack jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him this is really poor film making by director and editor will pascoe who in the dvd's filmmaker statement shows he's yet another uncritical acolyte of chomsky's other than that one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary but mere agitprop and a vanity piece of agitprop at that is that not a single time is chomsky shown struggling with an answer he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds br br given that much of this dreck was filmed during chomsky's lectures at mcmaster university in ontario canada prior to the american invasion of iraq in 2003 much of what chomsky says seems as remote as things from the vietnam war era yes he makes some good points here and there on american media complicity before the war but he follows them up with sheer lunacy for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc and not fully plotted out cabals as example he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled similarly he claims trilateralists run the world and that people's fear of crime is yet another cabal's result of course that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers and all that wasted time and money district attorneys' offices consume he also makes the absurd claim that cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades when castro and company were great sponsors of it in latin america asia and africa until the soviet union fell i can only guess that the ufo conspiracists are just waiting for chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species mixing impregnation centers up in idaho br br in his simpleminded world without grays chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of bushco whom he reviles are even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals in short chomsky is a man living in the past in over his head on most issues and out of his depth intellectually near this film's end he warns 'be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice ' yet one can only laugh as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didn't like no matter how barbarous their crimes and anti intellectual their posit please pause before you waste your time and money on this silly and already irrelevant dvd
<START> i think that this film adds to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historic reconstruction the way it shows the various communities leaving together in thailand is very interesting the portuguese the japanese and the various communities being managed by the king the plots around the court are as usual a struggle for power with a lot of treason the wardrobe is fine the film is also done locally in thailand in a reasonable production the scene with the elefant as executors is very interesting it is fun and i think that is also usable in schools for its historic accuracy because it shows that the european in asia were subjects of the local kings in way very different from the traditional hollywood perspective
<START> i just rented creep and was not at all impressed i didn't feel anything in this film i felt sick because the gore alone was shocking br br i walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film haven't we seen this all before i didn't like any of the characters barr the guy in the sewer cage i felt bad for him but then again i couldn't think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the creep so many questions need to be answered br br someone mentioned references to the ps2 game silent hill and i can see similarities vaguely br br not a bad film not a good one judge for yourself

<START> holes is a fable about the past and the way it affects the present lives of at least three people one of them i will name the other two are mysteries and will remain so holes is a story about stanley yelnats iv he is unlucky in life unlucky in fact characterizes the fates of most of the yelnats men and has been since exploits of stanley iv's no good dirty rotten pig stealing great great grandfather ' those particular exploits cursed the family's men to many an ill fated turn it is during just such a turn that we meet stanley iv he has been accused falsely of stealing a pair of baseball shoes freshly donated to a homeless shelter auction by a famous baseball player he is given the option of jail or he can go to a character building camp i've never been to camp before ' says stanley with that the judge enthusiastically sends him off to camp green lake br br camp green lake is an odd place with an odd philosophy if you take a bad boy make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun it will turn him into a good boy ' we learn this little pearl of wisdom from mr sir john voight one of the camp's counselors ' we get the impression right away that he is a dangerous man he at least wears his attitude honestly he doesn't think he is nice the camp's guidance councilor mr pendanski tim blake nelson is a different matter entirely he acts the part of the caring sensitive counselor but he quick quicker than anyone else in authority to unleash the most cruel verbal barbs at his charges the warden has a decided capacity for meanness but other than that she is a mystery these three rule camp green lake a place that has no lake it is just a dry dusty desert filled with holes five feet deep and five feet wide its local fauna seem only to be the vultures and dangerous poisonous yellow spotted lizards green lake seems is in many ways a haunted place br br holes works in spite of the strange setting and the strange story because it understands people specifically because it is honest in the way it deals with the inmates of camp green lake the movie captures the way boys interact with one another perfectly it captures the way boys can bully each other they way they can win admiration the way they fight with one another and the way boys ally themselves along the age line it is this well nuanced core that makes everything else in the film believable what is also refreshing about this film the good nature of its main character he does not believe in a family curse he is not bitter about the infamous exploits of his no good dirty rotten pig stealing great great grandfather ' in fact he loves hearing the story stanley iv is not bitter about the past and determined not let it affect him in the way it has affected his father and grandfather there is at times a lot of sadness in the film but not a lot wallowing angsty silliness and that is refreshing br br holes is an intelligent insightful and witty family movie it entertains and not in any cheap way it is not a comedy though it has its laughs it dares to be compelling where many family movies tend to play it safe and conventional as such it transcends the family movie genera and simply becomes a good film that everyone can enjoy i give it a 10
<START> apparently hollywood is just handing out money to anyone with a camera and the ability to speak this movie was mind numbingly bad the casting was terrible the acting unspeakable and the story filled with holes script who needs script i was surprised that the movie wasn't as verbally vulgar as i thought it would be however i got enough shots of t a to last me a lifetime the movie was like listening to a 19 year old street racer with add who decided to buy a car instead of go to college tell a story being so poorly scripted i thought the two brothers in the film were lovers at first the scenes at the racetrack along with the main female actor in the film kept making me think of herbie fully loaded this is the kind of film is what grindhouse modeled itself after only the writers thought they were being serious
<START> love the characters and the story line very funny with plenty of action thomas ian griffith and tia carrer give great performances i enjoyed the dynamic and comical interaction of griffith and career donald southerland plays a very likable and surprisingly sympathetic burnt out hit man all three actors are among my favorites and having them in this movie made for a special treat a nice addition to my extensive dvd collection i highly recommend this movie if you like mr and mrs smith the replacement killers l a confidential the long kiss goodnight the abyss and the whole nine yards you will love this movie
<START> i happened across bait on cable one night just as it started and thought eh why not i'm glad i gave it a chance br br bait ain't perfect it suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness but overall this movie worked all the elements aligned just right and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film br br most of that i think is due to jamie foxx i don't know who tagged foxx for the lead but whoever it was did this movie a big favor believable and amazingly likeable foxx glides through the movie smooth as butter and funnier than hell you can tell he's working on instinct and instinct doesn't fail him br br the plot while unimportant actually ties together pretty well and there's even a character arc through which foxx's character grows as a person again they could've slipped by without any of this but it just makes things that much better br br i'm surprised at the low rating for this maybe i just caught this move on the right night or vice versa but i'd give it a 7 10 bravo mssr foxx
<START> my name is modesty is a low budget film that tells the story of the origins of modesty blaise it's not that the movie is terrible it's just not what i was expecting or hoping for while i've been aware of the modesty blaise character for years i'm not overly familiar with the comic strips or the graphic novels so i'm coming into this movie as something as an outsider that may be part of the reason for my disappointment i was expecting more action and more comedy the film is dialogue driven i suppose i was looking for something with a little more camp value as it is my name is modesty is a deathly serious film there are very few if any light moments the acting at least from alexandra staden is acceptable but nothing outstanding as others have commented she does appear a little too frail to be completely believable in the title role what action scenes there are in my name is modesty are one of the films weakest points i never bought into the notion that this woman could handle a band of trained killers br br i really hope quentin tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumored a big budget film based on the modesty blaise character i'm convinced the concept has a lot of potential and i would very much look forward to it
<START> when anti bush jokes get really easy to do a show like this had better make sure it has something extra when that something extra is kid versions of political figures making jokes about the future they don't have yet it's just plain nonsense dick cheney and george bush are done well but dick cheney mutters mostly there's also condoleeza rice who has a crush on bush for some reason and donald rumsfeld who isn't really that similar to donald rumsfeld at all the democratic characters rarely give their names so it's a mystery as to who could be who aside from barack obama and hilary clinton br br the episodes have coherent stories but that's not nearly enough to keep this from sinking
<START> ho ho homicidal maniac this spirited tour de force adaptation of a great ec comics horror tale is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable tv series ever made director robert back to the future zemeckis makes the most out of a witty script by fred night of the creeps the monster squad dekker which centers on a ruthless two timing housewife well played by mary ellen trainor who was married to zemeckis when she starred in this episode who kills her jilted jerk of a husband a nice cameo by marshall bell on christmas eve by whacking him upside the head with a fire poker complications ensue when a deranged murderous madman dressed up as jolly kris kringle escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay trainor a decidedly unfriendly visit alan silvestri's spooky stirring score and dean cundey's typically polished cinematography further enhance the macabre fun and larry drake the sweet gentle giant benny on l a law with his creepy hiccuping guffaw a demented twinkle in his bright green eyes and a leering truly wicked grin makes for a sensational sanguinary saint nick
<START> full house is a wonderful sitcom that is about a dad danny tanner whose wife had just died in a car crash so danny asks his brother in law jesse katsopolis and best friend joey gladstone to help raise his three girls donna jo 'dj' tanner stephanie tanner and michelle tanner this is my favorite show ever and i can watch it all day long and something on full house is always making me laugh and there are sad parts also there is never a dull moment in full house the main characters are played by bob saget danny tanner john stamos jesse katsopolis dave coulier joey gladstone candace cameron dj tanner jodie sweetin stephanie tanner and mary kate ashley olsen michelle tanner
<START> highly implausible unbelievable and incoherent spanish production about well let me see just how close i can get to it the film opens with a woman having one of her cat's killed by a young girl she then begs her lover to take her somewhere on his vacation he calls work and demands that he loses his vacation time and she says he will pay for this what relevance this plays out to is anybody's guess at the film's end because the guy a swarthy photographer spies a beautiful patty shepard queen of spanish horror films it seems taking her bikini top off momentarily so he can snap a picture ask her out to lunch and then to his assignment to witches mountain for reasons again we are never privy to before they go patty must stop by the house and loud eerie chanting echoes in our hero's ears again this is never explained the film goes on with these two stopping at an inn going on to the mountain and finally realizing why the mountain is called witches mountain you know there are several aspects to this film which make it better than a bad film it has some atmosphere some of the character actors are really quite good especially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman the leads are at least adequate and the climax though it makes absolutely no sense at all is well choreographed literally with the witches in white brassieres and long black hair it just doesn't make any sense though and that is a huge detractor to me i could watch the film another ten times and still not know more now than i did after the first viewing that is a major problem the witches mountain is a curious film from the long line of cheap atmospheric european horror films that blanketed that decade if you can get more out of it than me better power to you
<START> i caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel and was reminded of how terrible i thought it was in 1980 when first released many reviewers out there aren't old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between stanley kubrick and steven king the enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed master director put this multi layered supernatural story on the screen salem's lot had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a tv mini series directed by tobe hooper he of texas chainsaw massacre fame and was badly handled turning the major villain of the book into a chiller theatre vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise fans hoped that a director of kubrick's stature would succeed where hooper had failed it didn't happen br br sure this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments it's all downhill jack nicholson cannot be anything but jack nicholson he's always crazy and didn't bring anything to his role here i don't care that many reviewers here think he's all that in this clinker the here's johnny bit notwithstanding he's just awful in this movie so is everyone else for that matter scatman crothers' character dick halloran was essential to the plot of the book yet kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest shock sequences ever put on film i remember the audience in the theater i saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick those that stayed that is many left king's books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters and often metaphysically kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately don't really care what happens to whom br br this movie still stinks and why so many think it's a horror masterpiece is beyond me
<START> this film contains the one ingredient that all revenge movies should have and that is true emotion sorrow love laughter anger there are so many emotions thrown into this film from start to finish this film is immensely captivating the plot on paper sounds like the usually rubbish that is mostly thrown in the faces of the audiences but don't be mistaken this film is powerful washington as always puts on a great performance br br the plot in a nutshell man suffers from depression a young girl brings life into him kids gets kidnap man wants revenge doesn't sound like anything special but it far superior than any other similar film out there for instant taken is a similar film but when you compare them both man on fire wins hands down the characters are engaging and everyone puts in a great performance and the directing is great mexico city feels alive it looks like mexico city it smells like mexico city everything is portrayed brilliantly the style of direction was something i enjoyed and brought the best out of mexico city br br this is one of those films you'll bring out once a year to watch again or a film that you'll beg your family and friends to watch from start to finish you are rooting for the main protagonist making it a roller coaster journey there enough action to keep you happy there enough character development to please you and then there's washington to bring a smile to your face watch this film you won't be disappointed
<START> this movie does contradict the first one as far as the origins of the care bears and the care bear cousins goes i won't deny that however if you look at part ii as a separate film then it's a very good movie i remember watching this in the early 80's and fitting into its targeted demographic audience then and absolutely loving it much more than the first movie not that i didn't enjoy that one too it's just that this one seemed to have a little something extra to it sure it's darker than the first one too but perhaps maybe that's why it's so good and it's dark in deeper kind of subtle way too that kids may not fully understand but could still be a bit scared of because of the atmosphere it gives off and adults watching will surely get quicker as i have now watching this film again now in my mid twenties where you basically have a young girl making a deal with an evil spirit demon in exchange for something else get the picture but simply watching that as a child sure as i said it may have been a little scary but nothing traumatizing in fact if anything it gave me another fantasy game i could play when i was that age i can't tell you the number of times i used to pretend dark heart wanted to imprison me have me help him capture the care bears tried to make me turn over to his dark side and other things like that etc so this movie was also good for my imagination and it's also got great emotional depth to it too i used to watch it at least once a week br br also hadley kay was the perfect choice for the voice of dark heart i always thought so and i always will br br now it's just too bad that they never made a soundtrack available sometimes i just want to hear growing up without watching the movie as good as it is br br what good is love and caring if it can't save her
<START> with the releasing of farligt fÃ¶rflutet swedish film industry has truly hit rock bottom stefan jens hultÃ©n has for the past years lived a calm life with his wife marie regina lund one day an old friend of stefanÂ´s arrives with a favor to ask him stefan is to do a small courier job he is supposed to bring a suitcase filled with heroine through the sweden germany customs unfortunately things in germany donÂ´t work out as planned and stefan is now in big trouble it is always nice to see a swedish film that breaks the traditional family drama pattern unfortunately if the people involved in the production have no clue of how a movie is supposed to be written filmed or cut the result can only be catastrophic the content can be concluded with bad acting an incoherent plot and idiotic dialogs the only highlight in the movie is the unprovoked sex scene wit the incredibly beautiful regina lund this lasts for only a few seconds leaving approxamitly 90 minutes of pure letÂ´s say what it truly is crap
<START> okay when i came on the board for this movie i was really expecting people to be making fun of it i was surprised to see that people over the age of 7 liked it i enjoyed the movie but only b c me and my little sister who is in fact only 10 made fun of the whole thing br br i am sorry jordan but that acting was awful you know a movie is headed for the toilet when the lead cannot act and it didn't even have a good script or plot to redeem it i also thought that the character of pamela was very very lame border lining pathetic br br even with that being said i thought there were a few good actors such as gorgeous spencer hollywood and ronnie still not enough to redeem the movie br br two things about this movie that i just can't get over br br 1 that that spencer guy would fall for her okay eww i looked up the dates and while in reality he is only about four years older than her the difference in go figure seemed much larger jordan is a very pretty girl but in gf she seemed like 10 or 12 she seemed like a little kid jake abel spencer seemed like a college student br br 2 that there is any way that kristi yamaguchi would come just to skate for one girl i mean i know that katelin is good and everything but it still just seemed kinda unlikely that kristi would go to a boarding school that didn't even have scholarships for skating or that a school would have employed a skating coach with such connections br br that all being said it wasn't the worst movie ever known but it wasn't very good even by dcom standards which i consider quite low
<START> kurosawa weaves a tale that has a cast of characters as diverse as any shakespearean drama and the acting is true to the story with each star playing their role as a part of the larger tale it is touching funny and intriguing in all parts the character development is near perfect the cinematography is vivid and engaging and the story draws you in br br i would like to say that the samurai freaks and those obsessed with late 18th and 19th century dynastic tales of japan may snub this film as not kurosawa's best work perhaps not his best but even at his worst kurosawa is better than many of the best this story is so based in elevating the mundane lives of ordinary people in a time of great change that it is timeless despite being set in the not so distant past br br i would heartily recommend this to any movie buff and especially to those who are likely to continue on to read the novel on which the film is based
<START> while i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem i don't know what it was about it but i just had a gut instic about it and wow was i ever right br br the story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting one of the girls is alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle thrown together by fate they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving on br br i just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks because wow what a performance by busy phillips and erkia christensen not to mention the rest of the cast my only complaint is that the dvd was sorely lacking in special features oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring but all in all a excellent movie
