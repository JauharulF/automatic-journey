<START> too bad a couple of comments before me don't know the facts of this case it is based on actual events a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the wilmington de philadelphia pa region from '96 through 2000 i have to admit i was highly skeptical of how hollywood would dramatize the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local newscasts and philadelphia inquirer news stories throughout the time period of course i immediately pointed out that the actress who i really like in cold case who played fahey looked nothing like her anne marie was actually prettier i have to admit though that mark harmon really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as capano's and the behavior that capano exhibited throughout this period details of the case were right on no deviations of dramatic effect even down to the carpet gun furniture and cooler in conclusion i also wanted to add that i have met tom carper many times at various functions a good man despite being a politician and i am so glad that he pulled the strings in the federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime guys like capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars
<START> they played this on the july 4th twilight zone marathon and this is hands down the worst twilight zone episode i've ever seen it's completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone even though twilight zone is a pretty uneven series and many episodes end up being groaningly predictable this one was completely out of place compare this to legendary episodes like a stop at willoughby or midnight sun and you realize there is no comparison br br buster keaton did what he could with such terrible material and frankly it surprises me that someone of his historic comedy stature would stoop to the level of this episode even though he seemed to be giving it some effort he must have needed the money there's no other explanation
<START> this is one of the most overlooked gems hollywood has ever produced a young wwii british fighter ace whose plane is about to crash has radio contact with a young american woman who comforts the brave pilot knowing that within minutes he will be dead for some reason the man who should certainly be dead walks away from the wreckage and eventually learns that he was meant to report to heaven when a messanger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven the man refuses and demands to have his day in court to argue his case the man argues that his situation had changed during the final moments of his earthly life that he had fallen in love and therefor had become a different person one who deserved a chance to live on br br the heavenly court is a cinematic delight the announcement of the jury of peers is a definite highlight the story as fantastic as it seems is an engaging one and will keep you spellbound for the nearly 2 hours play time the final scene is simply beautiful and will require a kleenex treatment for most viewers this film is in my personal all time favorite top 10 it has my highest recommendation
<START> a scientist on an island is in deep sorrow about the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer so he thinks why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark well who wouldn't it's a little hard to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark that's killing everybody is constantly being called paul also william forsythe's cast as a macgyver kick ass savingtheday kinda hero lacks credibility on the other hand there are a few hot chicks who make you actually look at the screen while shark paul bites another one to death as a matter of fact i find bad b movies quite amusing but for my taste it would have been a much better movie if it was made for say 1000000 bucks less then it might have been fun
<START> this film is an entertaining fun and quality film the film very cleverly follows the guidelines if the book and tries to stick to the exact lines the actors are all suitable and you would expect them to be the part they use some famous actors which give a great effect on the film the graphics is a bit dodgy in some parts and there are quite a few mistakes throughout the film there is no such thing as a yellow spotted lizard for example the camp is not as gruesome as explained in the book and they tend not to show the goings on in the camp as much as the book all of his group are mentioned a lot in the book but are not in the film overall a great film for a rainy afternoon
<START> when i am watching a film i am aware that it is just a movie ' but nonetheless i do like to allow myself to become engrossed as much as possible under the circumstances i think this is what makes us cry scream laugh or otherwise react emotionally as audience members even though deep down we know it is just a movie ' what i don't want is for the movie to remind me it is just a movie so that i am unable to slip into the aforementioned engrossment regardless of the quality of the film this film's director chose to frequently use multi angle camera shots simultaneously on the screen maybe it is just me but i find this to be terribly distracting and downright irritating they might as well run a continuous banner across the bottom of the screen reading attention this is just a movie do not allow yourself to become too interested or engrossed' if i want picture in picture' i'll activate it from my tv remote but never during a movie i want to enjoy
<START> for most younger viewers out there they probably have no idea who buster keaton was so because of this they probably won't feel nearly as sad when watching this film as i did i happen to be a silent comedy freak having see just about every keaton film still in existence my being a huge fan made this film very painful from start to finish this is because during his silent days keaton was a very vibrant and creative comedian he was amazing in his physicality and his films were almost never dull however in a move that movie historians still are baffled by at the end of the silent era keaton gave up his independence and became a stock mgm actor instead of being a great creative force mgm now saw keaton solely as an actor and they wrote scripts for him that had no respect for what made him great at first these films with mgm were not that bad such as the cameraman but with talkies the studio really blew it putting him in several films with jimmy durante durante's humor was based on his gift for gab and was abrasive keaton in contrast was quiet and based on action two more unlike and incompatible actors would have been hard to find as a result of this deadly combination keaton made some truly dreadful films br br now this isn't to say that speak easily is a terrible film no instead it's just more of a time passer and an amazingly unfunny one at that in fact if you go into the movie assuming it's a comedy it will probably make the film harder to enjoy instead it's sort of like a drama with a few comedic elements it is not a film that will produce belly laughs especially for keaton fans br br the film begins in an odd setting keaton is cast as a college professor whose entire life is teaching he knows nothing of the world and has his nose stuck in his books in a bizarre move keaton's servant tricks him into believing keaton has received 750 000 from a dead relative hoping that this would spur keaton to get out and enjoy life this is amazingly contrived but somehow it manages to work not terribly well but it works br br keaton immediately leaves school and goes on a journey to new york to have some fun on the way there he meets up with an incredibly untalented theater troop because he knows nothing of the world he doesn't seem to realize they stink and because he thinks he's rich keaton decides to take them all to new york to perform on broadway however just before the show opens his friends find out that keaton is not rich so they decide not to tell keaton and try to keep him away from process servers that want to close the show they assume that if the show is a hit then they can pay off the debts and everyone will be happy however they forget that the show itself stinks what are they to do and will keaton get the nice girl get roped by a gold digger thelma todd or be flat broke and alone if you care see the film br br as for keaton he has few stunts in the film though there are some dandy ones near the end instead keaton just kind of walks through the part in a very subdued manner there's really little to love about this film or hate it's just blah when it should have been a heck of a lot better
<START> really it's a dreadful cheat of a film its 70 minute running time is very well padded with stock footage the rest are non descript exteriors and drab interiors scenes the plot exposition is very poorly rendered they are all just perfunctory scenes sort of strung together there is no attempt at drama in scene selection but rather drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors please don't ask br br the plot concerns a rocket radiating a million degree heat orbiting earth five miles up threatening to destroy the earth it's a real time menace that must be diverted if a custom built h bomb can be fashioned and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour nothing very much here to report except for a mad speech by a scientist against the project because there might be some sort of life aboard and think of the scientific possibilities but this speech made by the obligatory idiot liberal was pretty much passÃ© by then br br what saves this film somewhat uniquely is the stock footage i've never seen a larger selection of fifties jet fighter aircraft in any other film this is by no means a complete list but just some of the aircraft i managed to see there's a brief interception by a pilot flying in alternate shots an f 89 scorpion and an f 86 first to scramble interceptors is the royal canadian air force in hawker hunters and f 86 sabre jets or canadian built cf 13s and even a pair of cf 100 clunks br br then for some reason there are b 52s b 47s and even b36s are seen taking off more padding br br these canadian jets are moving at 1200 miles an hour i don't think so since one of them appears to be a ww2 era gloster meteor the rest f 80s the meteors press the attack and one turns into a late f 84f with a flight of early straight wing f 84s attacking in formation br br there's a strange tandem cockpit version of the f 80 that doesn't seem to be the t 33 training type but some sort of interim all weather interceptor variant with radar in the nose these are scrambled in a snowstorm br br an angled deck aircraft carrier is seen from about 500 meters it launches f 8u crusaders f 11f tigers a 5 vigilantes and a 3 skywarriors the air force scrambles f 86s and f 84s and more f 89s then you've ever seen in your life as well as f 100 super sabres and f 102 delta daggers br br the f 100s press their attack with sooooo much padding the f 89's unload their rockets in their wingtip pods in slo mo the f 86s fire an f 102 lets loose a falcon even some f 80s f 94s with mid wing rocket pods let loose there is a very strange shot of a late model f 84 prototype with a straight wing early model f 85 above it in a turn obviously a manufacturer's republic aviation advertising film showing the differences between the old and the new improved models of the f 84 thunderjet how it strayed into here is anybodies guess br br there is other great stock footage of ottawa in the old days when the capital of canada was a wide spot in the road and especially wonderful footage of new york city's times square during one of the civil defense drills in the early 50s br br i think we also have to deal with the notion that this was filmed in canada with the possible exception of the auto chase seen late in the picture as the pacific seems to be in the background the use of a jowett jupiter is somewhat mind boggling and there is a nice tr 3 to be seen also canada must have been cheap and it is rather gratuitously used a lot in the background br br as far as the actual narrative of the film there is little to recommend it other than the mystery of just who ellen parker is giving the finger to at the end of the picture and she most definitely is flipping someone off could it be r as in robert loggia the director who dies before this film was released her career as this was her last credit br br its like the newspaper the gift came wrapped in was more valuable than the gift
<START> i personally thought the movie was pretty good very good acting by tadanobu asano of ichi the killer fame i really can't say much about the story but there were parts that confused me a little too much and overall i thought the movie was just too lengthy other than that however the movie contained superb acting great fighting and a lot of the locations were beautifully shot great effects and a lot of sword play another solid effort by tadanobu asano in my opinion well i really can't say anymore about the movie but if you're only outlook on asian cinema is crouching tiger hidden dragon or house of flying daggers i would suggest you trying to rent it but if you're a die hard asian cinema fan i would say this has to be in your collection very good japanese film
<START> it occurs to me that some of the films that have been banned during the course of cinema history were actually very important and very good films i'd like to argue that instead of banning challenging controversial movies the censors should consider banning films that are so bad that they pose a threat to your iq and your sanity if they were to do so one of the first films to be quickly hidden away would undoubtedly be stroker ace this film is awful with a capital 'a' it is the worst film burt reynolds ever starred in quite a feat for for a man with cannonball run ii cop and a half and rent a cop on his cv br br the wafer thin story introduces us to successful stock car racer stroker ace reynolds a man who loves fast cars and fast women he gets stuck in a demeaning contract with crooked promoter clyde torkle ned beatty the contract requires him to do some humiliating promotional work for a new chain of fast food restaurants such as dressing up as a giant chicken thrown into the mix are lugs jim nabors ace's dim witted pal and pembrook feeney loni anderson a bimbo with a brain fractionally smaller than a pea who is wooed by ace br br hal needham the director of this low grade garbage was formerly a stuntman and he made numerous films that relied on his expertise in staging spectacular stunts and car chases races some of these films were ok like hooper and stunts unlimited but with stroker ace he reaches a career nadir the characters are so stupid that you actually feel pity for the actors playing them anderson especially is saddled with such a dumb role that it makes you grind your teeth with despair the humour is weak and infantile throughout and the stunts and race sequences are unremarkable even the out takes during the closing credits which can be found in all the reynolds needham collaborations are generally unfunny which gives the impression that maybe the film wasn't much fun to make stroker ace is a stinker of considerable magnitude
<START> this film has got several key flaws the first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot this sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of hopelessness as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life this means that the film cannot captivate it's audience instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film and everything associated with it in short it really is very very very very very very very bad do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching terminator woman
<START> nikolai gogol's story viy has been filmed again and released to home video in the us via faith films br br the original story concerns a priest who has to watch over the body of a witch with only his faith to protect him greatly expanded and set in america though clearly filmed in russia the houses clothing and furnishing are all wrong despite the english signs this is an odd film that doesn't really work part of it is the weird setting that tries very hard to be backwoods america but clearly isn't there are also some weird intentionally oblique moments as the main character being a reporter at the start and a priest a short time later i'm not sure why they did that even after watching the making of piece on the dvd the other problem is the dubbing which is beyond awful its done in such away that everyone speaks when their lips are not on camera or if they are the voices don't even remotely match the lip flaps i don't know if its faith films fault or that of the producers who made the film hoping to dump into the west revealed in the making of piece br br the film isn't very good as i've said it has all sorts of technical issues that just make this an odd ball curio despite some really good looking horror images the film never works as a horror film as film to engender faith its much too confused in this retelling to amount to make anyone feel anyone closer to god br br given the choice i'd give it a pass even at a bargain bin price my advice would be to find the 1960's version of the tale called viy which will bring both some shivers and some understanding about a belief in god
<START> this movie is very important because suggested me this consideration sometimes you can wish to be sick sometimes you can wish to have a syndrome sometimes for example you can wish have goldfield syndrome that way you'd not remember this boring movie and above all you'd not remember adam superfluos sandler sometimes simply you can wish have rented another movie br br my vote 3 out of 10 my suggestion if you are neither a fan of boring romantic comedies or adam sandler it's a joke don't exist adam sandler's fan i want to hope it save yourself someone to save drew barrymore perhaps
<START> there is only one use for a film such as bulletproof it reminds you just how bad bad can be we often see films which we describe as pretty awful or not much good but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films aren't good they are no way as stinkingly bad as bulletproof this was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru' the dvd bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation i e to give me a present it could have been a serendipitous find but it wasn't this is so utterly clichÃ©d so badly written so poorly directed so badly acted that i'm surprised everyone involved hasn't been arrested and sent down for 10 years god it's awful i suspected as much from about 30 seconds in but carried on because sometimes sometimes bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable this isn't one of them it is simply bad i stopped watching after 45 minutes and tomorrow i shall throw it in the bin
<START> this has the logical consistency of marshmallows filled with ketchup and the overall aftertaste is just as disgusting br br will be used in the 9th circle of hell at recreation time just plain torture br br i would rather choose to watch 90 minutes of my computer going through 5400 blue screens of death than watch this appalling drivel again ever horrible horrible horrible br br you know the good thing about swiss cheese is that along with the holes you get some cheese here it's only holes and the excitement factor well that turns watching paint dry into an adrenalin rush and an olympic speed sport br br my brain hurts from trying to work out who ok'd this drivel did they think about the premise i sincerely hope not otherwise there is no redemption the only consolation is they had the pleasure of sitting through the rushes made for tv should not be a synonym for sure let the horses bowels run loose across the living rooms our audience are idiots br br i was hooked just to know how it could get any worse this is not a good sign folks br br hallmark should be ashamed for releasing it br br i should be ashamed for watching it br br i am ashamed i'm off for a long shower
<START> i am a major fan of the horror genre i love horror slasher gore flicks of all kinds some of my favorites are the really good bad horror flicks but this movies has nothing to warrant it's viewing i'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about everything that's wrong with it br br the script is horrid the acting is horrid the fx are not even worth discussing the set is an absolute joke the sad thing is i think there may be some real potential in a couple of the actors but this vehicle left them nothing to work with br br suffice it to say i saw it for free feel i was robbed the time you'd waste watching this would be better spent flossing your cat
<START> i read one other review that expressed the view that platoon was a never ending cycle of marines killing people being killed taking drugs and talking trash br br i don't agree with that because the film actually had more to it but it a way i can see what this person is trying to say this had no real plot which is a point i agree with br br it is self indulgent stone at his best he really wanted to show not only how war leads to death but also how it is extremely traumatic on those who survive unfortunately the film seems to over glorify this aspect and the grand finale is just way too champagne grand standing oscar hunting let's create an enduring image for my liking br br the problem i have with stone and other film makers of his ilk is that they fail to understand this simply concept depicting the terribly bloody deadly waste that war is does not prove or even reflect on whether it was an unjust or immoral war we have seen the same thing emerge at the moment with iraq in case you're missing the point let me put it to you bluntly if you saw how truly bloody the second world war was and how destructive it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers would you think it was an unjust war if that fact alone doesn't convince you that it was an unjust war then why should depictions of the horrors of vietnam convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that instance br br personally i do not support america's decision to go to war in vietnam but i certainly don't subscribe to the this war is wrong because people died and suffered theory i don't think that motivations are always wrong by default just because war in itself is terrible br br this says nothing of the fact that the ending or the final big twist was a bit stupid however this is not stones first oddball departure wall street was a magnificent film up until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a dreadful wrong turn jfk is probably one of the few films stone did that actually ended very well br br but it hardly matters in this one because there was very little plot up until that point of the film to twist around and this is why i gave it such a low mark it was virtually story less and ultimately boring unless you fell for the manufactured poignancy
<START> for this review a list of good points and bad points i'll start with the bad br br bad points the casting choices especially burt reynolds as boss hogg the acting of said badly chosen cast the storyline the idea of setting the film in the modern day the direction the editing the soundtrack and above all the whole idea of making a feature film out of a television series that wasn't that great to start with despite it's popularity br br good points jessica simpson in a red bikini that's it br br one might make an analogy here in the scene where jessica simpson as daisy duke struts her way up to michael weston as enos and asks the question enos where's boss hogg and roscoe in his clouded judgment tells her where they are she might just as well have asked enos is this a good movie the red bikini would have clouded his judgment into saying yes even though in his right mind he would have said no not really as good as she looked in the bikini she could have been stark naked and even that would not have saved this horrible piece of film making stay out of hazzard
<START> descent yeah boy i haven't seen anything this powerful and scintillating since bruno dumont's twentynine palms 2003 by the way this film is not to be confused with another fairly recent pic about the topic of female empowerment the descent 2005 directed by our splat pack friend neil marshall who also happens to be a major talent his own right but getting back to this descent the nc 17 rated uh oh effort on which the lovely ms dawson takes a producer's credit congratulations and directed by talia lugacy strong chance that's not a real name as good as it is in moments it will not be appreciated by most lay people out there because the script is pretty flawed as a producer you really have to tighten up that script of course in the premise alone you have the promise of rising conflict but there still lies the task therein of accomplishing rising conflict br br at times this thing plays like an interesting piece of experimental theater and well i guess i'll let the others who've already commented here speak to the boringness of it namely that which occurs in the second act but find me a second act that isn't boring there's also this catch 22 that goes along with these quasi independent films like descent in which rosario happens to be attaching herself to and leveraging her fame identity to get a script into production that would under usual circumstances not get made at all while at the same time she is basically a miscast in the film's leading role rosario dawson is gorgeous and apparently you can shoot this girl from just about any angle all day long but oh wow wee how fast the time just slips away rosy ain't no undergraduate no more that's part of the confusion about the screenplay is she a graduate student a ta no graduate students don't really have these type of qualms with football players do they again if you are rosario dawson executive producer that's the one of many many aspects to the professional film process you'll have to think about as you embark on this wonderful new role in your film career and if you don't have the answer to why you're movie isn't convincing let me tell you there is a boatload and a bevy of vivacious well qualified undergraduate aged talents pining to get involved in the business who might have nailed that lead character down all the while looking just as darn good as you know who but unfortunately without ms dawson no honey no money i have to say the camera department did an outstanding job however because this film is really well shot i e lit in all its dreary dreamy darkness the nightclub scenes look wonderful one can tell all those music videos are starting to pay off and the play with time the shooting framing is all quite excellent which makes the picture a rewarding watch br br descent is good not great however i have a feeling thanks to netflix this movie will find a life of its own i hope this group continues making films if you're into experimental american film making cinematographic imagery of implausibly well formed college studs or male model drop outs in their early twenties or if you're an undergraduate just plain angry at the hormonally aggressive young men that comprise less than half of your american university rosario dawson's descent might be your flavor of rockaroll
<START> in ten words or less to describe this film barbara stanwyck is too appealing and it is great the film is wonderful except for the perhaps tacked on ending but i love happy endings anyway barbara stanwyck however as the platinum blonde gold digger is amazing she knows what she wants and goes after it this film is sexy and excellent
