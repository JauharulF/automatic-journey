<START> methinks the best screen version of quo vadis ever made well yeah the plot is not so strong and evident as in the book sometimes meandering and loosing its suspense among aesthetic subtleties but the film is really and beautifully strange has an enigma and style that other versions with r taylor and the new one from poland definitely lack it has the air of roman decadence the beauty of declining paganism and infant christianity at least i believe it has brandauer forrest and syudov did excellent job in portraying their characters forrest's petronius seems to be the biggest success of the cast let alone brandauer who is the one of the greatest actors ever and accumulates the very essence of this dying world imho that's it that is the way it happened guys imho
<START> when i think of the cheesiest guilty pleasure type movies the first thing i think of are '80s slasher flicks really bad slasher flicks the formulaic type of film where all a script needed was 2 parts blood and several parts nudity to get made br br flash forward to the late '90s early '00s the slasher flick has been revitalized with the success of 1996's scream like in the '80s these films were formulaic masking a lack of inspiration by labelling themselves as hip tongue in cheek parodies of the original slasher flicks of this recent blend of hip parody neo slasher flicks the only one worth seeing is the low budget direct to video cut br br like most of the other new slasher flicks cut relies on the production of a slasher flick in this case a fictional 1985 film hot blooded to make its commentary on the genre hot blooded never finished production because of killings by someone wearing the mask of the film's killer scarman a bald figure with its mouth stitched close and dark pupil less eyes now 12 years later a group of film students whose professor was involved in the production have decided to go into the vaults tap the original surviving actress and finish the film but every time the film is screened or a scene is shot scarman returns and someone dies to quote the tagline will they finish the film before it finishes them br br this all sounds really bad and to a degree it is really is there such a thing as a good slasher flick there is no character development the new director is revealed to be the daughter of hot blooded 's original director whose life was apparently ruined after the production was cancelled this would've been a perfect detail to be worked into the plot yet it's never mentioned again and like in all other slasher flicks there are just too many bodies to care about the actors aren't great even by direct to video standards but most are having fun with their characters and for those who aren't it's inadvertent character acting since none of their characters in the film wanted to work on hot blooded particularly whoever was lucky enough to play scarman cut 's climax has no big who dunnit unmasking of the killer like in the scream films it doesn't have the gimmick killings of the urban legend films what it does have is an original and interesting concept that is diluted by a this way we can write a sequel if it sells well ending but that's par for the course br br by any sensible viewing standards this is a horrible movie that should be avoided but this quality is what makes it true to its roots in the slasher genre and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neo slasher flicks
<START> br br i just bought this movie on dvd and watched it for the first time the other night i've been a fan of tolkien's work for about 4 years now ever since i got out of high school i didn't grow up on this movie perhaps my mother kept me away from it it's definitely not for children not that it's bad in a graphic sense but that the themes would go right over most 10 year olds heads overall the animation was excellent considering this was made in 1978 1979 i thought the story followed the book fairly well in a loose sense but i am bothered that bashki didn't just add another 40 minutes or so and tack on the return of the king parts that would've made it the ultimate movie i was bothered by it's abrupt end and then when i heard return of the king sucked i was bothered even more too bad it wasn't one great animation film it might have garnered a higher vote from me i give it a 7 i can only hope peter jackson will do the books justice with the new live action lotr
<START> once again proving his amazing versatility john turturro plays the introspective russian chess genius preparing for a comeback tournament and forging an unlikely relationship with a gadabout fellow resident emily watson at a 1920's italian hotel they fall in love to the horror of her social mountaineering mother geraldine james a wonderful love story whose gloss of chess might make it appear cerebral but in spite of its origins in a nabakov story it certainly is not the romantic elements and the sense of time and place beat the psychological analysis hands down john turturro having appeared in barton fink o brother where art thou the big lebowski proves that he is not dependant on coen bros films to assert his stature
<START> i really don't get how people made this film and thought it was worth all the work they put into it even more puzzling are those who watched this film without feeling cheated out of 88 minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading leviticus br br first of all surely they could have 2 found real irish people and some good looking women who could deliver their lines better than the washed up haggard porn stars sprinkled throughout this film granted the gore works but strangely it's not as troubling as you might think to see organs yanked out of the porn stars' hot formerly tight bodies left and right probably has something to do with the fact that after their horrific inhuman acting you just want them to die in pain br br so if you don't care at all about the following br br acting seriously everyone sucked i've never witnessed this before everyone sucked br br plot some crappy horror movies are remotely linear or at the very least surprising this movie doesn't make sense unless you're as trashed as the writers obviously were br br theme nothing to learn from this film nothing to be scared about in bed at night nothing to contemplate or grasp or explain to others br br soundtrack crap crap crap music as ordinary and dull as the script br br scenery could have been this film's saving grace but no nothing pleasing here even the rocks are fake br br so yeah if you don't care about that and you're just a horny teen with bad taste in music and women this movie is for you positive comments interesting cinematography at times wasted on the other elements very realistic gore again wasted but the intestines scene is classic i agree with the mutant disembowelment solves the fake accent problem
<START> i disliked this film intensely and left during the scene where the loyalist gang are shot up by the british the film effectively blames the people of ni as being the cause of their own troubles it suggests that the 25 year war was a question of intransigence and nothing to do with britain's partition of ireland and domination of its history i e ni was created by britain in 1921 irrespective of the wishes of the rest of ireland br br the characters are portrayed as hapless fools even though i despise loyalist paramilitaries they were fighting for a cause maintaining their artificial privileges over the catholic community it is a known fact that british intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war no doubt to keep the catholics at bay and demoralise republicanism br br nineties' values about 'machismo' masculinity etc are transposed on to 1970s belfast and are portrayed as part of the supposedly unique irish 'psyche' which leads to violence the stupid song from the woman in the club old ireland of green fields blah blah is given a symbolic stature i e poor young fools fighting for an impossible cause tedious ahistorical cheap and nasty trash o'sullivan has made a personal statement on a conflict which requires serious political analysis
<START> i first saw this film during and international film studies course i am a 'non traditional' student and perhaps for reasons of years lived or wisdom accrued appreciated the slow reflective pacing of the film's narrative languorous with the heat and dust of an arid clime the story is deeply psychological replete with multi layered symbolism and an articulate inversion of the theme of being the 'other' in a land that one does not understand the understanding that does come is fraught with the unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider made nearly 20 years ago it is also a forerunner in a genre of numerous other international films that explore the themes of colonials in colonized spaces clueless to the nuances of the cultures into which they have entered much more lavishly filmed and heavily financed works that have been made since reflect the same themes indochine nowhere in africa are two that in comparison perhaps make chocolat seem pale and boring it has no adrenaline pumping action or extreme violence the struggles are mental emotional and subtle but that being said it is a fine film worth a viewing
<START> one of the most timely and engrossing documentaries you'll ever watch while the story takes place in the venezuelan capital of caracas it provides an intimate look into political dynamics that prevail throughout the western hemisphere while essentially another chapter in the story of the u s backed latin american coup this film chronicles in real time what can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity political savvy and courage br br the political insights offered by this film are invaluable one gets clear examples of the private media as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda we see the poor people of caracas grappling with the brutal realities of american politics one gets a clear sense of impending doom if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny which has been abruptly and illegally thrust upon them by the conspirators we also see the arrogance and fascism of the cia backed private media plutocrats and generals who've conspired to bring venezuela back under washington's domination though ably led by president hugo chavez the people of caracas are forced to act without him after chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals their response is the highpoint of the film if one seeks an excellent portrait of what the u s government hugo chavez and revolutionary venezuela are all about this movie is it
<START> there's nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert wasteland and robot wars does deliver sure the acting is lousy the dialogue is sub par and the characters are one dimensional but it has giant robots the special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period they are certainly not as polished as today's standards but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures so it has aged fairly well its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime and it does have a certain tongue in cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable i would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci fi who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction
<START> i first saw this movie on television some years ago and frankly loved it charles dance makes one of the most terrifying villains anyone can imagine his sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the crudely good hero i have never been much of an eddie murphy fan but find his irritating portrayal here a winner a bit of axel foley through the looking glass charlotte lewis is to utilize a hackneyed phrase but the only one applicable luminously gorgeous some scenes are wonderfully created the dream sequence the bird the silly fight scenes and the climactic confrontation through it all murphy is the modern man suddenly dropped into an oriental myth a stunned and quieter version of kurt russell in his oriental fantasy romp like that movie we have james hong the incomparable actor whose scenes however short raise the quality even of derek since 1955 hong has defined the fine supporting actor the class act of his profession the golden child is silly it is not perfect but it has so many redeeming features that it is an enjoyable and amusing fantasy well worth watching after four years i have seen the golden child again i enjoyed it even more it truly is great fun
<START> the movie had a cute opening i truly believed i was in for one of the best romantic comedies i've seen in a while there was something particular foreign about the way the movie was set up realistic yet somewhat abstract and mystical but then the story line started becoming more and more unrealistic to say that the ending was corny and predictable would almost be an understatement the most typical romantic ending where everything goes great for every 'likable' character a scene where the main character realises that he has made a mistake and chases the woman of his dreams only to confess his love for her in front of a sympathetic crowd of on lookers come on in the end the 'good guys' win 'bad guys' loose you get the picture a waste of a potentially interesting movie
<START> spoilers let's start with the good of this film the serviceable acting of cynthia rothrock and richard norton the rest of the acting is awful this isn't aided by the atrocious script the worst culprit is the villain buntao the head of an asian crime syndicate played by frans tumbuan i was laughing my head off as he was expressing his fury over having lost a bunch of money horrid performance patrick muldoon isn't much better and his it's a hostile takeover line that's the remainder of the title of this film was delivered about as badly as one could do it there are no other main characters but no other actor actress distinguished him herself in this film we next come to the plot this should tell you all you need to know in the original rage and honor cynthia rothrock who plays chris fairchild was a teacher in the inner city now she's a c i a agent or was it some other governmental agency sorry but this film was so bad that i don't even remember hmmm i can imagine what that c i a application process was like interviewer what past job experience do you have chris i was a teacher interviewer okay you're hired i only give it a 2 because of some decent acting and a nice plot twist at the end though we know that tommy muldoon the secret villain will be caught
<START> this is your typical cheerful and colorful mgm musical from the early '50's and it's definitely on of the better ones to watch out there br br the movie got directed by the genre expert vincente minnelli and stars gene kelly in the main lead both did quite a few movies together back in those days of which this one is probably their best known one br br the movie itself actually managed to win the best picture oscar over the year which meant it beat out movies such as a place in the sun a streetcar named desire the african queen quo vadis the blue veil death of a salesman that year a real accomplishment of course but at the same time also a bit too much credit for this delightful bright and entertaining movie br br when you watch this movie you surely will be entertained by it all which is also thanks to the movie its beautiful color look and the many nice characters within this movie the musical numbers are also all nicely done which is no big surprise when you have people such as vincente minnelli and gene kelly at work br br but really couldn't had everything that got told in this movie been done in halve an hour less or so i mean we already know where the movie is heading to but yet it manages to stretch it out all for as long as possible not that it makes the movie drag in any parts it just makes it a bit overlong the movie could had also definitely been done with a few less musical numbers in it br br one of the better mgm musicals that is not without its flaws though br br 8 10
<START> a sweet little movie which would not even offend your grandmother saving grace seems cut from the same cloth as a half dozen other british comedies over the past two years underdog is faced with adversity finds the strength to challenge and learns something about him herself in the process br br widowed and thus broke grace is a master gardener and is enlisted to help her friend employee matthew grow his pot plant he's been doing it all wrong so grace helps him out they realize that she is the perfect person to harvest pot which they can both benefit from he enjoys smoking she needs to raise funds to pay her mortgage br br highlight is grace travelling to london to deal some of her merchandise dressed in what looks like the white suit john travolta wore in saturday night fever and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb br br blethyn is always watchable and you can't say that about a lot of people well i can't anyway ferguson is very good and tcheky karyo who i liked in la femme nikita is memorable br br not profoundly moving or insightful but immensely entertaining and at a brisk 90 minutes feels like a walk with friends 8 10
<START> rated e br br i never actually owned a nintendo 64 but i have played one many times in my opinion along with conkers bad fur day super mario 64 is one of the best video games for the nintendo 64 system i have played this game plenty of times and its good every time if you have an n64 and don't have this game you should try to find it the original super mario bros games were side scrolling video games but super mario 64 has a 3d mario in a nice 3d environment the game is sort of weird but there is plenty of things you can do in the game you play as super mario and once again you must rescue princess and the 120 power stars from bowzer now you can do it in a 3d environment super mario 64 is a very fun and good n64 game and i recommend it br br 10 10
<START> i'll be honest with you i liked this movie it's a great zombie flick that is packed with action original ideas good acting but is also packed with bad zombie effects part iv entitled after death is also good i would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere br br 10 out of 10 br br fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master skinned alive slumber party massacre sleep away camp and other full moon pictures flicks for other recommendations check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section
<START> the first cube movie was an art movie it set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they couldn't understand it was on the non literal level a man vs cruel nature plot where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end triumphing to face a new indefinable world beyond man's petty squabbles a world where there were no more struggle but peace i rated cube a 10 out of 10 and it's a movie that was never meant to have any sequels br br the second movie hypercube was a massive disappointment some of the ideas were kind of cool but in the context of the original movie both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning still for being fairly entertaining i rated it a 5 out of 10 br br the third movie cube zero while ignoring the second plays like a vastly inferior commercial b movie rehash of the first sans the symbolism there is no homage or tribute here there is only ripping off the same kind of plot with some elements idiotically altered like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say br br that we see something from behind the scenes means nothing because the watchers are just part of the big bad experiment the architects of which we hear nothing of and in this movie those who get through to the exit like kazan did at the end of the first movie are just killed where the bleep is the sense in that that's just flippin' stupid i'm glad i didn't pay to see this br br the production values and acting in cube zero are not too bad but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10
<START> robert altman is my favorite american director i must admit that i have enjoyed the films that are usually scorned quintet if only for giving me the pleasure of seeing a grown up and beautiful brigitte fossey who was unforgettable as the little girl in forbidden games health for having lauren bacall carol burnett alfre woodard and glenda jackson all in the same cast popeye for that splendid and surreal world shelley duvall's olive oyl and the wonderful malta locations o c stiggs for its proposal of an anti adolescents flick beyond therapy for all its lunacy and for the presence of genÃ¨vieve page who for all her effort to look parisian chic is taken for a travestite i have even enjoyed his one act tv movies like the dumb waiter and the laundromat when there is not much plot to develop in his films you have wonderful performances from burnett john travolta kim basinger or jane curtin i perceive and enjoy the different approach and description he makes of the many different cultures of the united states it is a pity that his genius is seldom appreciated and that he is always forgotten when the time comes for giving out american prizes and awards he is not your typical mainstream purveyor of fantasies he is more of a maverick so it is not surprising for me to find so many bad comments posted here about the gingerbread man his most 'mainstream' effort to date and to my knowledge i did not know there were so many people who thought like leonard maltin who does not like altman at all in this case one may dislike the gingerbread man but for me the reason has more to do with grisham than with the director screenwriter some of altman's trademarks are here improvised dialogue great performances a funny lawyers' office with typical irreverent receptionist and secretary while some people find it boring i found the first act fascinating thanks also for the great cinematography by changwei gu the man who shot red sorghum ju dou and farewell my concubine he has a way of showing us the same things we see in other american movies but under a different light through his foreigner's gaze almost everything seems new and different in this first act things were so logical and true wait until you get older you may get in trouble if you fall under the spell of someone younger and beautiful as embeth davidtz i know for myself what i have done fascinated by someone who is younger than i am then you have robert duvall's repellent menacing and mysterious character while that geraldo storm is threatening savannah the second act gets a little phony and even funny because altman may have conducted it with a grin i remember laughing aloud in several instances with his ironic remarks i think he was applying a bit of brecht distancing us preparing us for the third act which is plain hollywood pastiche altman does it with expertise being a wise man and an intelligent director luckily he did not fall into the traps of today's action movies he was directing a tale of lust greed and death i was not disappointed a bit with the movie if i give it a nine instead of 10 it is because of grisham the american reader has turned him into a best selling author so why complain maybe we should thank altman for showing us the seams in his stories the dullness the flatness and the silliness of them all however he does it with so much gusto and humor that i cannot but disagree with the negative comments for me these persons saw another movie and vice versa
<START> diego armando maradona was and still remains as the best football player the game has offered not just an athlete but an artist this documetary if the 1986 world cup will forever live in the memories of every football fan around the world because of his tremendous and unbelievable goal which he scored against my own country england there's absolutely no point of diminishing this star although i dont undersand spanish i can appreciate the argentine narrator he actually cries of happiness and can barely express his emotion anything i wrote can be senseless and difficult to comprehend but readers you have to watch this to know what i mean
<START> i really loved this version of emma the best kate beckinsale was awesome as emma and mark strong was very good as knightly the only complaint that i had was on mr woodhouse i can't believe that a man could whine so much or be so selfish with his daughter's life she was a smart girl in the end though as always i love the places in which these jane austin movies were shot the settings are so spectular it makes me want to visit england so much 9as well as ireland and scotland i think the actors chosen for this movie were a good choice as well and all the other story lines interwhined with emma's most excellently i am glad that i got to see this one as well
