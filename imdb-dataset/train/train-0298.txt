<START> so finally i know it exists along with the other uk contributors on here i saw this on what must have been it's only uk screening in the 70's i remembered the title but got nowhere when i mentioned it to people it scarred me that's 2 'r's but when you go to bed with doom whizzing about your brain and listening all around for impending terror then isn't that what a truly classic horror movie is all about i can barely remember the intricacies of the movie but what i do recollect is my shivering flesh and heightened senses can anyone confirm my suspicions that this is black and white again if anyone has any info on how to obtain a copy of this please get in touch
<START> another in a long line of flicks made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story within 15 minutes the entire premise is laid out in just a few lines so there is absolutely no mystery which eliminates a whole facet of the suspense the only half way competent actor is killed 10 minutes into the film so we're left with stupid characters running around doing stupid things low budget films can't afford expensive special effects so the cgi portions are unsurprisingly unimpressive but were at least a valid attempt the creature suit is terrible as seen when it falls to the sidewalk and the director keeps emphasizing the eyes which aren't even the red color shown in mirror shots the dialogue is clumsy and uninspired with some lines reminiscent of aliens or terminator the last action sequence takes place in a police station also a rip off from terminator with everyone hiding in the one glass lined office that the darkwolf doesn't smash into in the end the girl calls the hero a good protector but he gets both his partners the original protector and at least three other civilians not to mention a dozen cops all killed without getting a decent shot off in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun but here's the real clincher for bad writing they could have killed the beast right after the beginning credits when it was holding the stripper while flashing its red eyes instead they took it into custody
<START> i like british humor i believe it's one of the best in the world i like almost every british sitcom okay maybe not monthy python some of the jokes were great but some of them i didn't understand but this league of gentlemen is just something good to make you sick this show was good in some way it helped me lost some weight because watching this piece of garbage make me feel i'm not hungry anymore this is really just disgusting sick and not even funny tv show and i wonder who is actually laughing at this stuff i watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off it was so disgusting watching men dressed in the woman with yellow teeth and urinating on the car i mean what's so funny about that it makes me wanna puke no humor just disturbing images and cheap toilet laughs i don't know if you like this stuff you go ahead watch it but to be honest people watching and enjoying this must have some emotional problems garbage
<START> this is a cute and sad little story of cultural difference kyoko is a beautiful japanese woman who has run to california to escape from a failed relationship in japan ken is a japanese american manual laborer with aspirations of rock and roll stardom but little concrete to offer a potential partner kyoko marries ken in order to be able to stay permanently in the u s with the understanding that although they will live together until she gets a green card the marriage will be in name only it soon develops that the parties are not on the same wavelength or perhaps in the same time zone hence the title of the movie as an immigration attorney i have seen such arrangements take on a life of their own so i was pleased to see how well the filmmaker developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation
<START> absolutely one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time it starts off badly and just deteriorates katherine heigl is woefully miscast in a lolita role and leo grillo manfully struggles with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character the only cast member with any enthusiasm is tom sizemore who hams it up as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role the script is dire the acting horrible and it has plot holes big enough to drive a double decker bus through it is also the most sexist movie i have ever seen katherine heigl's character is completely unsympathetic she's seen as an evil wanton seductress who lures the poor innocent married man to cheat on his wife it is implied throughout the movie that she's underage and the message that accompanies that plot strand just beggars belief at the end she isn't even able to redeem herself by shooting the man who's obviously ha become demented with rage and guilt but the script allows him to kill himself thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of males everywhere horrible don't waste your time
<START> there are really two sections of this film firstly there's the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the 'the simpsons' troy mcclure should be doing the narration br br then the rest of the film begins starting off with a title song which really doesn't fit in with the rest of the film which while technically ok is killed by a vague inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters but characters that make no sense br br this is especially so with mickey rooney's spiventa who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the 'organisation' the whole time yet what would have happened had hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when breaking out in that case he would've been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character which in the end he still is br br the overall problem of the film is that it's totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy it's as if the filmmakers didn't have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an organisation and instead settled on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusions br br put simply the film fails on all levels
<START> this is a great example of a good dumb movie no it is not high art by any means nor is the script anywhere close to a woody allen or mel brooks but so what the killer tomatoes series four movies and a cartoon series are basically good natured romps gleefully trampling on the kind of territory the zuckers ruled before they switched to making serious flicks br br as the title suggests this fourth installment of the killer tomatoes trilogy deals with the killer tomatoes plot against france in this case professor gangrene john astin's 3rd time in the role has a plan to rule france through an ancient prophecy about the return of the rightful king of france steve lundquist returns as igor a humanoid tomato who wants to be a sportscaster and who just happens to be a dead ringer for the long lost true king of france obviously he also plays the aforementioned l l t k of f happily skewering the french language br br opposing them is the fearless fuzzy tomato like the others ft was introduced in the second film and would be a main character in the cartoon and his human allies mark price recently unemployed as a result of the conclusion of the family ties series plays a thinly disguised version of himself passing himself as michael j fox as a way to win the girl of his dreams and angela visser is a dream as marie gleefully bouncing between unabashed virginal sexuality and borderline psychosis oh that the former miss netherlands had had more of a film career another returning member of the killer tomatoes stock company is rick rockwell now best known as the hapless title subject of who wants to marry a millionaire like co creator john de bello rockwell works both in front of and behind the camera in this series br br what can you say about jon de bello not much really except that he had a singular vision and managed to pull it off and having done that has apparently dropped into obscurity john if you ever see this thanks for giving us the killer tomatoes br br the script is heavily but not obnoxiously aware that this is just a movie like return of the killer tomatoes the action occasionally veers off the set and into the middle of the film crew and mark price has a funny forum to complain about his own lack of success compared to his former costar michael j fox this is the biggest budgeted of all the killer tomatoes flicks and is a nice send off to the series okay the show then moved to fox kids as a cartoon series which was also quite clever but cartoons just aren't the same
<START> unfortunately many consumers who write reviews for imdb equate low budget with not good whatever else this movie might need more budget really isn't part of it big sets and lots of special effects would have turned it into another lara croft movie what we have here is a step or two better than that br br the nearly unknown alexandra staden is captivating as the enigmatic modesty and this is crucial for this movie to work her wise little smiles and knowing looks are formidable and you find yourself wishing that the camera won't leaver her face it makes it workable that the bad guy nikolai played by also little known in the u s at least nikolaj coaster waldau might take an unusually cerebral interest in her something modesty can exploit she is able to divert his raping her with just a shove and spitting out stop wasting my time then storming off between his heavily armed yet suddenly diffident henchmen making a scene like that plausible doesn't happen by accident br br probably the biggest problem i have with the rail thin staden playing modesty is it just isn't very believable for her to go hand to hand with an athletic and muscled looking guy like coaster waldau and beat him she just ain't a peta wilson or a pumped up hilary swank type actress who can throw a convincing punch coaster waldau letting himself be overpowered by staden looks like he's just roughhousing with his little sister br br since this is not really an action film this isn't a big flaw i just hope they do better on that if and when they make sequels
<START> this movie is just a lot of fun i've seen it a couple of times but it always has something funny that i remember the duckies and bunnies car scene is one of my favorites and i still quote morone's versions of certain words br br there are so many running jokes that it's amazing but i love michael keaton anyhow
<START> the movie was a big car commercial br br but who cares i went to the theater to view the shelby cobra angelina cage br br so i guess it was a good movie bg br br
<START> i saw this movie when it came out when i was 17 years old and into classic rock still am br br i never liked opera before because i hate soprano voices but he changed all that he was adorable in the movie and had such an amazing voice br br i heard on cnn that he died tonight at home of pancreatic cancer he will be missed and he definitely left his mark on this world br br i hope to buy this movie if i can find it watch and enjoy smile maybe i should head over to amazon com and have a look before it's sold out
<START> five minutes after watching this i logged on to imdb to warn all of you out there not to bother with this movie genre horror it had moments of mild suspense and throughout the whole movie i was thinking to myself somethings gotta happen soon it did not when the movie ended i felt so embarrassed for the writer director i've never been the biggest fan of patrick rea this guy just does not know how to make movies and after watching this sorry excuse of a horror flick i've gone from not been the biggest fan to will not watch another of his works br br i was taken in by the plot summary please don't make the same mistake br br i gave this movie a 2 for the actors they were not bad and it wasn't there fault they got such bad direction
<START> i don't think this movie is for everyone but i saw it this weekend in seattle and i thought it was so funny i haven't laughed that hard during a movie in long time i thought the entire cast did a great job you will find yourself laughing from the first moment through the very last scene i suspect some moviegoers especially the ones who take themselves way too seriously will be turned off by this brand of humor not me the movie was a real surprise and the entire theater was rolling with laughter throughout the showing i went to which makes me think that a lot of people enjoyed themselves and were happy to have a good time at the movies for a change i cannot wait to see it again if you're in the mood to lol then this is for you funny funny funny funny
<START> there is a reason why jay leno himself will not acknowledge this film it consistently ranks as one of the worst films of all time the acting is horrible the script lacks direction and the director himself doesn't seem sure on which way to take this film a buddy film an action comedy mystery seems half way through he gives up and is just along for the ride jay leno and pat morita are talented and dedicated performers it is a shame that they wasted their time and gifts making this mess of a movie jay leno and pat morita prior to involving themselves with this had spent years pounding out their crafts on the hollywood circuit mr morita had already been a star in his own right acting steadily since the mid 1960s as the star of such cult tv and movie classics as happy days and the dismal but affable mr t and tina and won the hearts of america with his roles in the powerful film midway the karate kid and a host of others mr leno can been seen on tv shows dating back to the mid 70s and was a top performer in the comedy clubs of america he can be seen in countless tv spots and in major films it is a shame that they agreed to be seen with this nonsense
<START> this movie had no parts that were hilarious mostly just average funny units but it did not have any parts that were really bad either the worst part was the voice of sid his slothy slur was just too much for me by about 5 minutes in i was sick of hearing him talk aside from the annoying sloth voice the movie was good there were numerous side jokes which if you catch them make the movie much better this is a good movie for kids it has enough in it to keep adults content and enough in it to entertain kids this one is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them
<START> utter dreck i got to the 16 minute 27 second point and gave up i'd have given it a negative number review if that were possible although 'pissible' is a more fitting word unlike the sizzle you could see and practically feel between macmurray and stanwyck in the original the chemistry between dumb ol' dicky crenna and whats her face here is just non existent the anklet becomes an unattractive chunky bracelet there's no ciggy lighting by fingertip and i thought i'd be sick when they have a mortified looking and rightly so believe you me lee j cobb as keyes practically burping upchucking his way through the explanation of his little man to mr garloupis no offence to the non sighted but it looks as though a posse of blind men ran amuck with the set design of both the dietrichson and neff houses the same goes for those horrid plaid pants that phyllis wears and crikey how much does neff make that he lives overlooking a huge marina this folks again all takes place in the first 16 and a half minutes if you can get through more of it you have a much stronger constitution than me or you are a masochist but please take some alka seltzer first or you will develop a little man of your own that may never go away proceed with caution obviously
<START> herbie the volkswagen that thinks like a man is back now being driven by maggie peyton lindsay lohan a young woman who hopes to become a nascar champion the only thing standing in her way is the current champion trip murphy matt dillon who will do anything to stop them br br the original love bug wasn't that good even as a kid i remember not liking it very much i had some hope for the sequel though i mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie unfortunately herbie is no better now than he was before the film is defiantly weak for people over the age of 12 it will probably entertain the kids but that's all br br i realize it's a kids film and all but they could have made the film a little more interesting there were very few laughs and it got boring near the end most of the actors seemed dead in their roles too lindsay lohan was alright as maggie peyton she usually gives better performances like in freaky friday and mean girls matt dillon gave the best performance out of everyone he was very good as the bad guy even though he didn't have a lot to work with justin long breckin meyer and michael keaton are really just there and they don't do anything special br br angela robinson directs and she does an okay job she tries to keep the film interesting but she's working with a weak script thomas lennon and ben garant wrote the screenplay and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for taxi and the pacifier these two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable it's not completely their fault but hopefully next time they will try harder in the end herbie is a safe predictable family film that's worth watching if you're a kid everyone else is better off skipping it rating 4 10
<START> i've seen thousands of movies and have never written a review but the red eye i witnessed is so at odds with the glowing tributes posted here that i'm compelled to offer my two cents in protest and vote the lowest score possible just to bring the average closer to reality br br this is a dull boring stinker of a film that is memorable only for its apologist depictions of the terrorists' target a john bolton esquire bully diplomat who's really a great guy don't you know and of the oh so handsome and popular dr phil whose bestselling book one learns is read by frequent fliers worldwide the only real red eye i experienced was from rubbing my eyes in disbelief br br before you fork out 10 or so dollars for this b movie read the selected 'quotes from trailer ' above and ask yourself if you'll really enjoy a movie in which these were the cleverest lines to be found unfortunately nothing else in this film is any better the basic premise is goofy as hell the acting is bland and uninspired completely lacking in pro antagonist chemistry the potential for suspense is thwarted at every turn except during the last five minutes by poor directing and anticipatory editing the script is riddled with incongruities like early reveals of the heroine as a university lacrosse star are called into question when she later battles the antagonist with a field hockey stick and the plot holes are wider than first class while character development is strictly coach br br and then there are the moments of extreme ridiculousness like when the daughter of a high level public servant does not head straight for airport security at her first opportunity to warn them of an assassination plot against the both the head of homeland security and her father or when that same woman runs hell bent for leather along slick airport linoleum arms pistoning and veins in her neck bulging while wearing 4 inch stiletto heels or when her pursuer chases likewise with a sucking wound in his trachea or when terrorists use a fishing pole to bring up their weapon from the freaking harbor bottom i'm always willing to suspend disbelief but i'm not going to leap from 30 00 feet without a parachute br br the one good thing i can say of this movie is that it portrays women who are capable even in bimbo form of handling the most extreme emergencies the kind of gender imaging sorely lacking in american movies other than that this movie never really takes off and is no more thrilling than the red eye flight from boston to ny remember the last time you got suckered by deceptive trailers and glowing tributes in this forum or elsewhere this is one of those times wait for the red eye video and don't watch it then either
<START> wow speechless as to the making of this film i can't say much the coverbox at the local videostore should've said it all nothing but 6 actors actresses who get lost on the set of scream and decide to shoot a movie br br the acting was apparently not in the budget but they were able to afford nudity and good looking actors style over substance almost makes its mark here except most of these acting class failures keep forgetting that there is a plot that needs to go somewhere when they were reading this script after only 4 or 5 kills by the so called masked murderer and a confusing tie in plot about a murder club which the dumb lead actress thinks is a real club that she can join only if she can get over a girl bumping into her car you want to stab your hands with the nearest sharp object to remind yourself never to get overly excited by a possibly good movie such as this br br i feel bad for the people who bought this film and can't find anyone to take it off their hands another example of what's wrong with the growing number of straight to video horror releases with no thought put into the essentials throw it away if you did buy this
