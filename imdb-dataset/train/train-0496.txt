<START> very funny to watch beretta's island as kind of natural trash film it is like answer to jess franko's type of b movie bodybuilders strikes back face to face to pushers the very very very stupid strike action unbelievably bad directed firing shooting scenes look even better than hand to hand fighting chasing scenes ridiculous saving beauties scenes incredibly stupid erotic scenes are very unerotic the main luck of film is pretty landscapes and festival scenes don't miss arnold schwarzenegger's joke at start of film and list of franco columbu's kin at the end special attraction naked bosom almoust forgot franco can sing
<START> cowboys james stewart and walter brennan take their herd from seattle to alaska and on into canada to stake a claim once there they have to contend with seductive shifty businesswoman ruth roman and ice cold happy go lucky villain james mcintire br br john wayne may get talked about more but his good pal stewart made some excellent hard edged westerns too some with the great director anthony mann frankly i'd take this with it's sturdy action sequences and fine melodrama over north to alaska any day br br the far country features some breathtaking scenery and cinematography that should definitely have been shot in widescreen br br also there's some strong support by the always reliable brennan roman who's great the incredibly cute corrine calvet and james mcintire who plays one of my favorite types of bad guy the kind that doesn't take himself too seriously br br this would make a great double bill with another highly recommended mann stewart northwest set western bend of the river
<START> it's here finally a movie comes out that i can honestly say is worse than larry the cable guy health inspector yet i'm willing to bet the the wayan's brothers hilarious will make more money than i ever make in my whole life on what is sure to be one of the top five worst films of all time outside of my fifth grade outside the class re enactment of romeo and juliet i mean really why would anyone ever ever see this movie unless they were paid to the comedy is weak and all even remotely funny jokes from the flimsy plot were surely revealed in commercials final word is this movie was a terrible letdown for me and the commercials looked so promising
<START> i loved dan in real life a wonderful journey to love story like you've got mail or while you were sleeping but not ridiculously full of sight gags and crude jokes and not so romantic it makes you wanna throw up br br dan burns steven carrell is a popular advice columnist who can't seem to get things in his own life straightened out until one day on a family gathering trip he meets and instantly connects with marie the always beautiful juliette binoche a radiant specimen of a woman who seems to be framed in a hazy filter hearkening back to the starlets of classic cinema chemistry happens over a cup of tea and muffin but marie must be off for a previous engagement and they must part ways br br later we are treated to dan's tight knit fun loving relatives who not only have big breakfasts together but also enjoy using the intelligent and sweetly dorky dan as the butt of many bachelor jokes what i liked so much was that although the family's characteristics could be seen as obnoxious to some i thought it was a great portrayal of a big family that doesn't venture into parody or crude exaggeration the burns family is simply a close loving group of people who are truly interested in the best for dan there are wonderfully awkward family moments that aren't unrealistic the family is nosey but never mean spirited or gossipy quirky but never outlandish br br and then dan falls in love with his brother's girlfriend he's brought to the family gathering and thus begins a roller coaster of restrained longing and funny love budding br br i could go on but i just thought this movie was simply awesome it's not particularly hip or clever never too wordy and obsessed with dry humor or biting wit as many comedies are in modern cinema there is a nice balance of storytelling visuals and funny but real dialogue in fact early in the movie the initial spark of love begins with whimsical discussion in a classic hollywood style conversation where the characters say what they're thinking out loud br br so i've probably rambled and repeated myself but i highly recommend dan in real life it's a great date movie trust me you'll laugh and only if you're a geek like me you'll get a bit teary eyed filled with fun and magical love dan in real life won't disappoint br br 3 5 out of 4 stars grade a
<START> there is a really good movie lurking just beneath the surface of the layers upon layers of cheese that is the pagemaster br br i found this out when i watched this again this morning after neglecting it for years and years i remember hating it with a passion when it first came out but this time i found that the special effects are quite good the plot is just the neverending story with a creativity endectomy but it's an okay little flick for anyone who just wants some really awesome eye candy the animation is amazing and i especially liked how the animators let their characters look and act a bit more surrealistic than the norm i'm giving it a grade of three as i would have given it a two just for parody value if i had ever decided to watch this movie expecting it to absolutely blow my mind story wise
<START> as i saw the movie i was really shocked to see what the 60's was about i know i may be wrong about some things but it seemed like the 60's really had an effect on people of the time some people said they would want to go back to the 60's from what i saw i would say yes for the excitement and no for the outcome but that's my opinion
<START> leonard maltin must've been watching some other movie though i find his guide to be quite a valuable resource please disregard his comments on this one he states starts off well then fizzles when it's really the reverse starts off tepid then catches fire the plot is about as simple as it gets happy mom happy dad and happy son take a vacation at an isolated beach dad incapacitated in accident mom runs off to get help meets up with dangerous escaped convict mom tries to trick convict into helping while dad waits and hangs on for dear life br br good white knuckler given an electric jolt by ralph meeker appearing suddenly the director john sturges films it in a clever way that will make you gasp around halfway through as the cunning desperate criminal meeker is an unusually flippant reckless actor at least here and in the classic kiss me deadly and he happily snatches the keys to the film's narrative and speeds off with the top down his character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying pretty neat huh when he's especially pleased with his misdeeds there is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he tersely instructs his hostage barbara stanwyck don't go away she fires back where would i go they're in the middle of nowhere and he realizes sitcom ishly yeah that's right the friction between them is a hoot br br there are flaws somewhat ridiculous ones there's one scene where the police who have been chasing after meeker for some time stop stanwyck's car and to evade detection meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would and pretends to be asleep as she's being questioned a he looks conspicuously un masculine in this pose and b i think it's safe to say that any adult who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law enforcement would certainly arouse suspicion br br still a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusion br br
<START> i liked solino very much it is a very heart rending story of an italian family moving to germany and it's an story about brotherly love hope and disappointment and the film is never boring go and see solino
<START> rohmer strays from his usual portraits of french middle class to tell this costume drama about the difficulties of an aristocrat lady during the french revolution what's more attractive about la anglaise apart from the story itself is the fabulous aesthetics that rohmer has achieved the images have been digitally decorated too make them look like baroque pictures in some moments you can't really say whether your watching a movie or a series of pictures in louvre musseum every shot is like a piece of art br br my rate 7 5 10 br br br br br br br br
<START> the biggest mystery of veronica mars is not one that she had to tackle on screen br br rather the mystery is why this perennial ratings disappointment is still on the air this week marked a nadir for veronica mars it ranked 146 out of 146 shows in the big 6 soon to be big 5 yes you read right veronica mars was beaten by every show of the now defunct wb and every show on upn it was beat by all the shows on fox and of course by all the shows on abc cbs and nbc br br now the hip hypesters are going to say but this was a re run but everything on tv that week was pretty much a re run it boggles the mind why cw would choose this proved ratings disappointment as one of the few shows it saved from upn br br clearly something is going on behind the scenes favors are being exchanged and influence peddled br br sorry to be so cynical but what other explanation is there the veronica mars has potential line is clearly dead now that it's had two years to establish itself and failed to do so br br maybe it's joel silver's influence and clout but frankly i am at a loss why anyone would choose to spend their clout on a bad show that no audience is watching br br a great mystery and a very inauspicious debut for cw
<START> i last night i had the pleasure of seeing the movie bug at the florida film festival and let me say it was a real treat the directors were there and they did a q a afterwards the movie begins with a young boy smashing a roach beneath his foot a man who is nearby parking his car sees the young boy smash it and runs to ask the kid why why did he have to kill that living creature ' in his rush to counsel the youth in the error of his ways the man neglects to pay his parking meter which starts off a whole chain of events involving people not at all related to him some funny some sad and some ridiculous this movie has a lot of laughs lots and there are many actors which you will recognize the main actors who stood out in the film for me were jamie kennedy from his comedy show the jamie kennedy experiment playing a fortune cookie writer john carroll lynch who plays drew's cross dressing brother on the drew carey show playing the animal loving guy who just can't get it right brian cox the original hannibal lecter in manhunter playing the germaphobic owner of a donut and chinese food take out joint there is one line where cox tells his chef to wash off some pigs blood that is on the sidewalk by saying clean up that death which is quite funny mostly because of cox's obsessed with germs delivery the funniest moment in the movie comes when a young boy imitates his father whom he heard earlier in the day yell out motherf ' while in the classroom another extremely funny and surreal scene is when trudie styler mrs sting herself and another actor perform a scene on a cable access show from the film the boy in the plastic bubble the actor who hosts the cable access show is just amazing he is so serious and deadpan and his performance as both the doctor and the boy in the plastic bubble is enthralling there are many other fine and funny actors and actresses in this film and having shot it in less than a month with a budget of just about 1 million the directors phil hay and matt manfredi who are screenwriters by trade having written crazy beautiful and the upcoming tuxedo starring jackie chan have achieved a film that is great funny and endearing
<START> it's great to see jorja fox in a role where she gets to smile a lot also loved hearing her sing nice change to see her out of her csi west wing er roles the movie itself was entertaining but it seemed skip some explanation in a lot of parts several of the characters seemed to be miserable one minute and happy the next and it was left up to your imagination to figure out why each character was quirky though and in some cases i couldn't wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next this movie wasn't full of squeaky clean people but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes feel bad about them and then find a way to fix them
<START> i must admit i was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this show before relatively any information was disseminated about it i determined that it was going to be a cheap spin off guided by ronald d moore wielding the retcon wand br br i was wrong br br the pilot leaves an excellent impression upon the viewers the accessibility is marvelous of course seasoned bsg veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot which is focused on the development of the cylons before the first war 58 years before the events of the bsg pilot the pilot also allows for newcomers clearly presenting its plot and ideas in the first part of the episode br br don't be mistaken caprica is not bsg we are presented with an immersive cerebral drama dotted by provocative daring and controversial ideas br br the casting maintains bsg's standards stoltz and morales are simply astounding morales' portrayal of joseph adama inspired by olmos' portrayal of william gives a wonderful glimpse of william's heroic father stoltz's portrayal of dr graystone provokes a lot of thinking and questions br br if the quality of the pilot is any indication of what's yet to come rdm and the creative team are set to continue bsg's legacy of first rate television programming with another masterfully created television masterpiece
<START> the matador is hit man movie lite if you can say that about a hit man movie the violence is never really shown but often introduced at first i was scared i was in for another retread of mid 90s gangster hit man hipster dark comedy but was happily surprised when i realized this is just a sweet and humorous story about friendship nothing terribly exciting happens in this film but every bit of it is kept me grinning the three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a great time making this film together the writing is sharp though at times it felt as if the script had been adapted from a stage play because of the one set dialog scenes this is a good film that i probably won't remember for too long but at the time it was a complete joy good film
<START> i'm giving ten out of ten it's one of the best movies ever absolutely smashed stunned and dazed by the whole picture marvellous playing of jason statham ray liotta and all the crew amazing plot just look into yourself and pluck up your courage to admit it touched your soul because it's strange but there are all the answers you've been ever looking for the very best mr ritchie the very best ever those who were looking for a simple figtings and skirmish keep yelling they are disappointed but there are lots of shallow movies in hollywood nowadays you can't remember what it was about the next day you had seen it on the contrary revolver is unique i could have hardly expected it's possible to portray such a clear and genius picture of myself of everyone who was to watch it absolutely unsurpassed astounding dazzling one can get insight watching this i have no doubt about that actually no words can express my admiration i'm still wondering how it was possible to shoot such a movie after years of giddy hollywood rubbish we had been watching thank you from all heart it's simply the best
<START> this film was bad bad acting bad directing bad writing but it wasn't bad in a funny way it was bad in a boring way i watched surface to air because i thought it might be a laugh it wasn't don't make the mistake i did there are plenty of more enjoyable ways to spend an hour and a half such as watching paint dry or reading the dictionary seriously
<START> the villian in this movie is one mean sob and he seems to enjoy what he is doing that is what i guess makes him so mean i don't think most men will like this movie especially if they ever cheated on their wife this is one of those movies that pretty much stays pretty mean to the very end but then there you have it a candy bar ending that makes me look back and say hokie as hell a pretty good movie until the end ending is the ending we would like to see but not the ending to such a mean beginning and then there is the aftermath of what happened guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending i'm left feeling that only one character should have survived at the end
<START> of the elements that make this the best at this point i have to say 1 is christine mcintire shemp's scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent i imagine that as one poster suggested christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil to be smiling at shemp's possibly dying br br another character who helps this stand out is the goon his look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goof ball hardly a character i would choose to meet in a dark alley or for that matter anywhere i would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this but hey when a short is this good who's going to complain not i
<START> on the way back from imc6 san jose california all five mind you three of us hardcore kamal fans of us had reached a unanimous verdict vv was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up monday not to mention we swore to stay off the theatres for the next year br br i won't blame kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist madan on vijay tv he said something like tamizh cinema'la photography editing'la namba munnera'na maadri screenplay direction acting'la innum namba munnera'la tamil cinema has grown in terms of photography and editing but we have hardly improved when it comes to screenplay direction and acting while you're watching vv those words ring very true br br now here are the 10 reasons to hate this movie br br 1 harris jeyaraj br br 2 harris jeyaraj br br 3 harris jeyaraj i'm barely holding myself from using expletives here but fact is hj has mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his remember 'anniyan' 'ghajini' with the jarring cacophony he bills as background music the next time i have an eardrum transplant he's paying for it br br 4 songs neither do the songs help move the movie's narration spatially temporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice the film feels like it's made of four very long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them br br 5 a short gone too far vv at best is fit to be a short story not a 2 hour plus thriller to use a clichÃ© here like the energizer bunny it goes on and on and on only in this case you don't want it to the later part of a movie feels like a big drag br br 6 kamal jothika pairing two ice cubes rubbed together could've produced more sparks than this lead pairing there's no reason you would root for them to make it together in fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie they make a good irritant to the narration hate to say this but kamalini mukerjhee's 10 minute romancing does more than what kamal and jothika achieve in this movie plus 'thenali' br br 7 kamal haasan's accent kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in india or in the us and it isn't new either he's been doing it since 'thoongadae thambi thoongadae' it's simply gets on the nerve imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the us he doesn't leave it at the immigration either he offers doses of advice to his men bewildered tn cops from keeranor sathoor and beyond in chaste kamanglish wha we hav here is plain bad police wok of course with nauseating effect br br 8 logic there are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance in the department of common sense which d c p in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after the scene inside the theatre was so bad towards the climax we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the hero's iq is he stupid can't he just use his siren or lights on a busy madras road kamal the cop on a police jeep chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude can't he just use his gun the guy on a bike starts on foot and we have a fully geared kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time i'm not voting in favour of the later but i'm just trying to explain the mood inside br br 9 gore violence if i wanted to watch women being raped their throats getting slashed more women getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity i would sit at home and rather watch a police report or kuttram the use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story not overwhelm it somewhere down the line gautum seems confused about what the extensions rapes murders are and what the mainstay story is br br 10 even a double shot espresso couldn't get the pain out of the head
<START> christopher lee is one of my favorite actors i'm trying to view all of his work he has been known to single handedly save movies with his presence unfortunately this is not one of them this movie suffers from a low budget and it's production values are disturbing please for the love of christopher avoid this film
