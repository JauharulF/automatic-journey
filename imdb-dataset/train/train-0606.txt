<START> film critics of the world i apologize it is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on but i ignored your advice and i have been deeply hurt however my decision to see the cat in the hat wasn't made haphazardly you see three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the calamity known as how the grinch stole christmas then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat so when the critics unleashed their fury against the cat in the hat another big budget seuss update with a big name star in the title role i thought that it must be the same old song how wrong i was br br for five whole minutes i thought i was in the clear the opening credits are clever the kids are charming and the production values are top notch then the cat showed up there are many problems from this point on but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of mike myers where the grinch was saved by the inspired casting of jim carrey the cat was destroyed by myers he can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong comic sketches every movie he's made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch from wayne's world to austin powers so he tries to do the same thing here it's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of snl not funny just painful not that the writers helped him out any after the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor this movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience i have ever had period so much talent and work went into something so vile i know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess i just hope that the wonderful spencer breslin and dakota fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies if you are a parent please avoid this like the plague with movies like elf and brother bear currently in theaters you have far better choices
<START> i must admit i burst out laughing when i saw one reviewer compare this to lotr well yes if you exclude the dwarfs the cast of thousands the great special effects the big battles the strong characterization the decent plot the good acting the classy direction and everything else which leaves you with the walking and boy does this film do walking if mr piano had his way this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the wisconsin countryside but every 40 minutes or so these pesky martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble you've never seen so much walking in a movie if this really had a 20m budget most of it must have gone on mr piano's shoes because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does which explains why there's no money left for decent effects a decent video camera or proper actors honestly it's like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes even on fast forward this is a looonnnggg walk br br as for the sci fi stuff i think it was a mistake to put martians in the film they only get in the way of the walking which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story br br i wonder how much mr piano charges to walk dogs
<START> the cameraman's revenge is an unusual short not because of the subject matter adultery or because it's animated winsor mccay had introduced little nemo on film by this time but because it depicts bugs to tell the story ladislaw starewicz had originally wanted to film actual bugs fighting but couldn't get them to do it on camera because of the hot lights they suffered through so he took dead ones and started using stop motion techniques to manipulate movements to his satisfaction this short does a good job of putting human characteristics on little creatures such as riding motorcycles painting filming kissing and dancing starewicz would also make frogland 1922 and the mascot 1933 but his first notable work would be this one if you're interested in this and the other shorts mentioned check your local library to borrow the dvd the cameraman't revenge and other fantastic tales from image entertainment
<START> after 7 years of watching that dreadful nonsense called star trek voyager i was feeling pretty numb next gen and ds9 were bloody good stuff and voyager ruined tv trek this opened with probably the best pilot to a trek show the crew were really good as were the choice of actors for the parts scott bakula played a typical first time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to the already know everything captains from before the rest of the crew were really likable in their roles and i think they got off to a good first season when the show was prematurely canceled i was really disappointed in a mirror darkly showed us what the cast were capable of pity a film or tv movie was never considered so much back story and founding of the federation left to tell including the onset of hostilities with the klingons
<START> seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with ronnie o sullivan defeating greame dott by 18 frames to 8 bbc 2 found a gap in their schedule and so decided to broadcast a walk on the moon a movie i had absolutely no knowledge off br br i missed a few seconds of the title credits so had no idea viggo mortensen starred in it and thought possibly it might be a cheap tvm certainly the opening with the mawkish pearl and marty taking their kids to a summer camp has that sort of made for tv feel though the brightly lit too brightly lit cinematography seemed to suggest this was a cinematic film and it wasn t until the appearence of viggo mortensen as hippy guy walker that i realised this was a cinema release after all someone of mortensen s stature wouldn t star in a tvm i mean that s like a legend like robert deniro appearing in a straight to video film wait a minute didn t bob br br some people on this site have mentioned that pearl and marty are an unconvincing on screen couple and i agree i can understand why pearl would be attracted to exciting hippy guy but have no idea why walker would be attracted to plain house wife pearl the sixties was before my time but surely if you ve got the choice between hippy chicks and bored house wives it s not really a choice at all mind you a lot of people took lsd in those days so i guess that explains it br br i feel the major problem of a walk on the moon comes down to the fact it s a romantic drama at heart just like you d expect in a tvm with several cloying coming of age scenes so why include a fairly explicit sex scene it jars with the rest of the movie and is possibly off putting to the menopuasal women who were 20 something in 1969 i say possibly because the movie also seems to aim at a teeenage market with the coming of age scenes and those teenagers will probably be bored with the historical and social context of man walking on the moon and woodstock in other words a walk on the moon tries to attract many types of audience but will probably appeal to none of them
<START> suffice to say that despite the odd ludicrous panegyric to his soi disant abilities posted here the director of this inept odious tosh hasn't made a film since well that is excellent news as far as i'm concerned br br dead babies has all of the bile of its creator but lacks the wit and technical proficiency that make martin amis the novelist readable br br when will the british film industry wake up and realise that if it wants to regain the status it once had it should stop producing rubbish like this and make something real people will actually want to watch br br avoid like the plague
<START> before i start let me say that my experience of this movie might have been influenced by the dubbing which i gather from other comments was the original one which is considered inferior by some so it is entirely possible that subtitles or the apparently new dvd version would make a difference i have also not read the corresponding book i'm only familiar with one other japanese manga and might be lacking cultural context br br potential minor spoilers ahead br br i usually like darkly tinged science fiction stories the likes of blade runner 12 monkeys etc but i did not enjoy this movie at all while it started out mildly intriguing it became tedious by the time it was only half way finished there are all sorts of problems let's start with what is probably the most severe the dialogue the characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences if they aren't shouting each other's names for the n th time they are usually grunting monosyllables kanedaaa tetsuoooo huh grrr etc this leaves most of the characters entirely underdeveloped and two dimensional it doesn't help in the least that a lot of them get only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say that would develop them away from the stereotypes suggested by the visuals br br the grunting is augmented by some random pseudo philosophical technobabble that sounds vague and uninspired even by star trek standards there is nothing deep and meaningful here it all seems haphazard thrown together at random from various bits and pieces of stock sci fi ideas with no coherency whatsoever br br what little there is of an intelligible plot is no more than an excuse to begin the overlong final sequence which consists of escalating scenes of mayhem and destruction not that there's anything wrong with a nice bit of mayhem and destruction of course but in this case you'll find yourself asking what's the point of it all and how long until it's over character development in the last 30 minutes or so consists of little more than tetsuo turning into pizza the hutt for no readily apparent reason br br the ending resembles the one in 2001 a bizarre string of images that far from resolving or explaining anything leave the viewer feeling he's just been looking into a kaleidoscope for two hours i'm sure some will claim that this sort of thing is art but to me it was just a lot of admittedly imaginative use of colour and shapes some of the music was also quite interesting unfortunately it's all style and no substance br br tired of disney want to watch animated movies dealing intelligently with adult themes i'm sad to say you're more likely to find that sort of thing in south park
<START> don't expect much from this film in many ways this film resembles a film that doris day starred in in 1956 title julie in this film doris who was a flight attendant stewardess in those days landed the air craft after her derange husband played by louis jordan shot the captain she did a far better job more convincing than kim ojah who took control of a 747 and manage to land it without much help from the control tower i know a little about 747 aircraft i use to be a flight attendant myself like i said do not expect much from this film it was done on a cheap budget the producers were to cheap to use a plane with the name of a airline on it oceanic is one name that several movies have used the only writing on this plane was the name of the company that made the aircraft
<START> difficult film to comment on how do you say it's bad well it isn't but then it's equally difficult to say it is good what it is is compelling viewing it is as close as you will get to utter devastation without being there it is the photographs of the tsunami approaching the coast of thailand brought to life you know you want to turn away but you have to watch br br the naudet brothers handle the commentary very well even in the most tragic of circumstances there view on something which is happening in another country neither panders nor insults the facts are on the cellulose and little is needed for the viewer to understand or comprehend what is going on br br you can't change history and you should not want this film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour
<START> twelve monkeys is odd and disturbing yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time it cleverly jumps between future and the past and the story it tells is about a man named james cole a convict who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996 at first cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist dr kathryn railly who tries to help him and a patient named jeffrey goines the insane son of a famous scientist being provocative and somehow so sensible dealing with and between reason and madness the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science fiction films br br the story is just fantastic it's so original and so entertaining the screenplay itself written by david and janet peoples is inspired by a movie named la jetÃ©e 1962 which i haven't seen but i must thank the director and writer of the movie chris marker for giving such an inspiration for the writers of twelve monkeys i read a little about la jetÃ©e it's not the same story but it has the same idea so this is not just a copy of it david and janet peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a modernized story which tells about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it's a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end the music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it doesn't really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it's so compelling composed by paul buckmaster br br terry gilliam who we remember from monty python as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me as i really never thought him as a director type of a person i know he has directed movies before but i really couldn't believe that he could make something this magnificent it shouldn't be a surprise though as he does an amazing job you can still sense that same weirdness as in the python's but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing yes it is indeed odd weird bizarre and disturbing so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through it's not as heavy as you could imagine but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch despite that the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks dreams jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it doesn't even make the plot messy in any part though it does need concentration from the viewer after all br br what comes to acting well the movie doesn't even go wrong there the role of james cole is played by the mighty bruce willis who probably does his best role performance yet to date now people may disagree with me as he did some fine job in for example the sixth sense as well but for me the role of james cole was so ideal for willis and he performs it incredibly well the character is very well written too yet performed even better cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself starting to question his actual time of living trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle by hardship he starts to loose his faith questioning if he can even trust or believe himself other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of madeleine stow and brad pitt stow plays the role of kathryn railly the psychiatrist of james cole who sees something strangely familiar in cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness she somehow starts to believe cole's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things brad pitt is so good in the role of jeffrey goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date the insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought pitt even an oscar nomination for it so i guess i'm not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing br br all in all twelve monkeys is a great science fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone especially for the sci fi fans it includes brilliant characters and superb role performances especially from willis and pitt and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that's so intelligent and clever yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer's attention by making it interesting and witty it's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too so it's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci fi motion pictures i've ever seen through the odd yet terrific vision of terry gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride hard to explain really but that's how it is it's mind blowing
<START> lauren bacall was living through husband humprey bogarts illness death when she did this film rock hudson was near the top of his 1950's stardom dorothy malone is in excellent form and wins an oscar for support robert stack is nominated falls just short for his role br br the story is a little soapy from another time but just as worthwhile as most dramas amazing how well drunks can drive in this film also how quickly stack sobers up in a couple of the films early sequences br br you can see why the cast is so good actually production wise this film is very good you can tell bacall is distracted during this film as while her acting is fine she looks emotionally drained in some sequences br br the sexual references in this film are so mild that many of today's young viewers would not realize what they are film does a good job telling a story actually leaves a sequel to be made at the end though none ever was made though written beyond the wind would be a good title
<START> spoilers ahead br br this is one of the worst movies ever made it's that simple there is not one redeeming quality about this movie the first 10 minutes are quite tricky they actually lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat instead you will spend 83 minutes punching yourself while watching stolen and poorly made scenes run without any organization the lake was ridiculous looked like an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed characters show their advanced teleportation powers for example alex thomas who falls into the lake drunk and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position angie harmon put up a pitiful performance as kate made worse by the space time continuum rupturing dialog that appears to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grader an example of this would be when she said flashlight in such a stupid manner that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can cringe before it snaps in half finally the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrific that i have ever seen it was like the cameramen were a bunch of chimps who had been given camcorders by scientists an example of this would be when we suddenly get a closeup of the headlight on alex's car i would bet that there was little to no time spent editing this movie the ending was absolutely pathetic the writers were obviously trying to create some sort of mysterious plot line that made the viewer say oh yeah instead we're left to view some dumb painting of a spider that somehow fits into the story line unfortunately there is not one perspective in the millions out there that could save this movie from being a festering piece of crap br br i give this a 5 out of 10 the 5 being from the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book
<START> when carol vanessa hidalgo starts looking into her brother's death she begins to suspect something more sinister than natural causes the closer she gets to the truth the more of a threat she becomes to her sister in law fiona helga line and the rest of the local satanists they'll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her nosy ways br br if you're into sleazy satanic themed movies black candles has a lot to offer the movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic soft core sex one scene in particular involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed unfortunately all the sleaze in the world can't save black candles most of the movie is a total bore other than the one scene i've already mentioned the numerous sex scenes aren't shocking and certainly aren't sexy the acting is spotty at best even genre favorite helga line gives a disappointing performance the plot really doesn't matter its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scenes together i'm only familiar with one other movie directed by jose ramon larraz compared with his daughters of darkness that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror black candles comes off as amateurish 3 10 is about the best i can do
<START> dooohhh my bwainn hurrrts well it certainly does after this endurance test of a film how on earth i managed to keep going without hitting the fast forward button lord only knows br br maybe it's me maybe i don't get the premise of the film or maybe i don't appreciate it's alleged mystical atmosphere in my humble opinion though the film has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to mcdonalds br br in addition the characters were all dreadful and there is more character development in a tom jerry cartoon yaarrrghhh why do i do it why do i watch such tripe it's enough to make one run away and join a monastery or the foreign legion yaargh an absolutley dreadful film in just about every respect apart from that it's not to bad
<START> considering how much money was budgeted for this film you would expect more from the story as a whole this could be quite possibly the most worthless movie i have ever watched there was no real advancement of anything character development minimal plot advancement maybe enjoyment none i'm not sure what points were even trying to be made if you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys american cia bombs everything that doesn't agree with our opinions all capitalists are corrupt and you like to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death have at for those of us who realize that it doesn't take killing off a good guy to make a point we'll stick to other movies in summary this was a horrible attempt at an 'ocean's 11' style hide the plot so person has to think movie because not only do you not know what's going on nobody who made the movie did either home alone 3 was a better cinematic piece
<START> i don't normally feel much of an incentive to comment on films i don't like but in a case like this one i just have to say something this movie is terrible illogical and stupid there are so many flaws in the storytelling that i don't even feel obliged to elaborate on because it's time for me to move on from this experience the most annoying point is however that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the motivations for bacon's character's madness are due to a power trip or a physiological reaction to his condition br br granted the special effects are impressive and in the past paul verhoeven has done some good stuff the director's cut of robocop on dvd is great however this movie is stupid and generally doesn't come near to explaining the point or technical aspect of the subject matter and instead settles for predictable action without any enjoyment br br in short as many other reviews here say wish i had read them before stay away from this film
<START> chris gerolmo took care not to simply give us a jack the stripper' type of list of murdered people he delved into the psychological characterization with convincing results perhaps mostly due to stephen rea's excellent performance playing off against donald sutherland with good empathy by both it was the playing of these two parts Â above all Â which made the film something more than just a morbid account of the history of the butcher of rostov supporting actors especially max von sydow carried out their parts really well good directing the photography was good too needless to say the fact that the film was shot in hungary was bound to produce a couple of aberrations but frankly given the depth of the story telling and interpretations we can completely forget these little trivialia br br for once a made for tv film from hbo has come up trumps recommended especially if you like to analyse characteriology and forget some of the morbid scenes Â which i hasten to add are never exaggerated
<START> perhaps one of the worst teenage slasher films i ever did see i'll start with the bad points of t he movie which pretty much covers the entire film first of all something no one can avoid terrible acting i swear they picked up some random kids off the street based on how they looked secondly bad unconvincing character work development you hardly even know half the kids who are killed in here all you figure is that they deserved it one way or another the scarecrow's character was overdone and a cheap rip off of the other great fantasy killers such as freddy or pinhead next bad dialog the scarecrow was full of horrid one liners that would make you laugh only because it was so terrible lines like let's go find some small animals to torture really just leaves you with an eyebrow raised last but not least next off bad casting how old was the guy who played lester like 30 the back of his head was balding for god's sake there is much more i could say about this film like it's cheap special effects it's high school film class effort but the point is understood it's just bad film making at it's worst as for what i found to be good in the movie entertaining for those with low low low standards would help put insomniacs to sleep a very cheap laugh or even a giggle
<START> hint number one read the title as the time of the mad dog or perhaps dogs this is a pretty good ensemble piece look at the cast and rent it you know you're curious already and first time director bishop gives them their chance taking his time letting the characters interact and chew the scenery as they wait not enthusiastically for the return of the big boss and whatever revenge ensues br br for some of us the highlight is seeing christopher jones after his self imposed exile from films he remains a commanding film presence and yes with christopher jones larry bishop and richard pryor involved this is the wild in the streets reunion party
<START> don't bother to watch this film would be better advice if you like marilyn monroe in her other roles this was a huge disappointment considering the great cast not just marilyn br br the story was just nothing certainly nothing like described on the vhs box of course there simply was no suspense precious little excitement and too many dull spots most of them trying to show why nellie monroe was so messed up this was not a good role for monroe even though i didn't need to see this character to know she could act some like it hot alone was good enough evidence for me but this role just didn't fit her and it's no surprise it wasn't one of her more popular films br br it's also too bad a film had the waste of the talents of actors like richard widmark anne bancroft elisha cook jr jeanne cagney donna cocoran and others br br summary it's not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game
