<START> maybe this isn't fair because i only made it about halfway through the movie one of the few movies i have actually not been able to watch due to lameness br br the acting is terrible the camera work is terrible the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy for example during a coke deal the coke is just kept loose in a briefcase i'm no expert but i think people generally put it in a bag br br they use the same stupid sound effect whenever a punch is thrown it's that over the top 'crunching' sound and they use toy guns with dubbed in sound effects br br worst movie ever
<START> no wonder most of the cast wished they never made this movie it's just plain ridiculous and embarrassing to watch bad actors reading cheesy lines while shiny classic showroom cars continuously circle a diner that looks more like a disneyland attraction students fist fight with the deranged principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a bronze civil war statue the watts riots with a cast of ugh 10 dermot mulroney tries not to gag while he makes out with a mary hartman look alike with the most annoying smile since 'mr sardonicus' noah wyle reads bob dylan lyrics to the wicked teacher with a swinging pointer and very bad face lift drunken virgin rick schroder sits in a kiddie rocket on his last night before entering the service silly giggling school girls dress up in leopard stretch pants and walk on the set of 'shindig' sing horribly off key and actually make it big in the music business and who wrote this compelling dialog i'm going to burkley and wear flowers in my hair i think i found someone to buy stick's woody these people are 'animals' these people are my 'family' as the shirelles sing mama said oh brother what a mess this is like a 'reefer madness' of the 60's except it's not even funny
<START> like all the taviani brothers films this one looks great but it is rotten to the core with false romanticism and coincidences heap upon each other in some facsimile of a story in actuality this is really just a sentimentally cheap tear jerker posing as an intellectually distinguished art film
<START> where to begin there's so much wrong and horrible about this movie i am not sure where to start okay the two stooges who wrote this crapper joseph green and rex carlton first they couldn't make up their so called minds for a name my guess they split the difference that's why the main title is brain that wouldn't die but the end screen says head that wouldn't die neither one knows anything about the medical profession after all doctors take oaths to do no harm killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered harm plus a little thing called blood and tissue matching rejection would spell death for jan in the pan plus who keeps a patch work monster what medical school did bill graduate from frankenstien university old fu or mad scientist tech the monster had no name that bugs the hell out of me plus the brilliant surgeon doctor bill cortner doesn't know how to keep a patient sedated all and all a disaster of a movie it's incredibly stupid and unwatchable except on mst3k i give it the thanksgiving turkey
<START> this movie was well done in all respects the acting is superb along with the fine audio soundtrack which i purchased because it was so moving it is my all time favorite movie ahead of eastwoods white hunter black heart this movie is simply the best br br cheers zuf
<START> that is quite an outdated movie which aims to showcase the youth's yearning for freedom in some dehumanizing british school oh yes it's like in the army you learn to obey and do what you're asked to yes the young dream of something else but it breaks their dreams and sweeps away their optimism on the threshold of life great br br basically that's how you could sum up the nice intentions in if nice intentions that arouses no cinematographic challenges the result is a declamatory movie do you see how boring i mean br br at least that oldie helped kubrick cast mcdowell in a clockwork orange a movie with a truly powerful social satire and no self indulgent sentimentalism
<START> this story is about the romantic triangle between a nth african male prostitute a french transsexual prostitute stephanie and a russian waiter who speaks no french and never seems to shave br br as a film it is dull dreary and depressing shot either on foggy overcast winter days or in badly lit interiors where everyone is bathed in a weird blue luminescence and yes i know it's because the white balance was out everyone is pale and downcast and looks haggard shabby and dirty bodies are bony and shot in such closeup that they look quite ugly and unappealing moles greasy hair yuk bad news in a film where people spend a lot of time either naked or having sex br br and the story well stephanie's mother is dying all three characters go back to stephanie's home village where through a bunch of flashbacks to desolate countryside and predictably dingy interiors we see a bit of stephanie's childhood as a boy called pierre the mother dies well and that's about it really character development is kept to a minimum as is the denouement of the story br br i suppose the storyline is not linear it would explain a lot of non sequiteurs but really after paying my seven euros i don't feel like having to construct the film myself that's what the director takes my money for to expect me to join the story telling process and get my hands dirty so to speak is asking way too much br br this film is a heap of pretentious rubbish made above all from a desire to epater les bourgeois ie shock the straights i can see how it was a shoo in for the berlin film festival and i can see why it got nowhere
<START> spoilers herein br br what really scares you killer sharks or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath br br maybe but those fears don't even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or consider and that is the death of one's own child pet sematary taps this base primal adult fear and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explore br br i've read comments about this film that include poor acting characters making stupid decisions etc i disagree the acting is actually first rate for a film like this maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario but the film's events are not only logical they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible this is the true horror of pet sematary it isn't that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that louis creed does despite warning or even past history br br the movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart the heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect and the results are horrifying in fact when the film dives into slasher territory near the end it's almost a letdown although i believe it's perfectly logical how it got there br br i am a true horror fan and i contend that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made if you don't think so see it again after you have children
<START> things to come is an historic film along with metropolis 1927 it stands as one of the first great science fiction spectacles it is also one of the first doomsday movies it is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the start of the second world war within a year and even in a subtle way the year it would end in the real world but then the film departs from reality depicting a world ravaged by war only substitute poison gas for nuclear weapons which of course did not exist in 1936 br br the last half hour of the film is an incredible sight making groundbreaking use of models and matte paintings later to become staples of the science fiction genre it is sad that after things to come sci fi would become identified with cheaply made b movies a stereotype that wouldn't be broken until 2001 a space odyssey more than 30 years later if they'd stuck with the quality of the effects in this film things would have been very different in hollywood br br raymond massey and some of his co stars play multiple roles in this film to good effect massey plays a great doctor who like role as a pilot from an advanced for 1970 civilization who tries to win over the populace of a devastated country ruled by a simple minded warlord a very effective performance by ralph richardson ultimately the storyline covers 100 years but that's a big problem with this film there really isn't a cohesive storyline br br perhaps in such an episodic film somewhat reminiscent of intolerance actually it's hard to have a conventional plot but i felt more could have been made of the material and although the visuals in the final third of the picture are indeed stunning and worth the price of admission the plot is nonexistent and the movie itself suddenly ends just as it is getting interesting maybe the producers were thinking of another future sci fi innovation a sequel br br things to come is a film every serious sci fi buff should see at least once unlike metropolis however it might not bear repeated viewings
<START> well i bought the zombie bloodbath trilogy thinking it would be mindless gory fun that's what it is without the fun this film truly is mindless it is absent of any plot or character development or any sort of storyline the basic problem with this movie is the kills and gore basically every kill looks exactly the same zombies ripping someone apart yeah that's okay but you need some original kills too i mean it got really lame every kill looked exactly the same filmed exactly the same way thats what killed me i love gore and the gore in this film did nothing for me it was just boring no storyline just the same lame scene over and over again with a different person i wanted to like this movie too i love shot on video gore movies like redneck zombies but i couldn't kid myself this film has it's good points but none of those are in the film i understand that many of the zombies helped out with the flood and there were like over 100 zombies which is pretty cool how they got so many people involved and helped out in the world but overall this is a terrible film
<START> i am compelled to write a review of this imax feature as a means of warning others to save your money almost any episode of desmond morris' the human animal or david suzuki's the nature of things could have bested the material presented not only does the director fail to make use of imax's incredible 65 to 70 mm film stock and gigantic presentation screen everything on screen is extremely unimpressive given the accessibility of such programming mentioned previously viewers are introduced to a pregnant heather her husband buster and their niece and nephew we follow them for an interminable forty odd minutes as they eat sweat listen to music etc although we are given access to scenes inside the human digestive track and learn about babies' natural diving reflexes do we really learn anything more than most grade school graduates are we even remotely entertained by the trans atlantic heather do we care avoid this film at all cost if you do wish to see an imax feature i suggest the beautifully photographed india kingdom of the tiger or the technically thrilling space station 3d trust me
<START> the best of the seven sam fuller movies that i've seen including park row run of the arrow verboten shock corridor the naked kiss the big red one and this film pickup on south street counts as one of the best film noirs it represents fuller at his most controlled i like him when he's out of control of course but nearly everything in pickup is perfect the film is absolutely beautiful richard widmark stars as a pickpocket who steals some microfilm that was meant to go to communist spies jean peters plays the woman who was carrying the film for her boyfriend played by richard kiley peters is forced to find widmark and get it back she finds him through a stool pigeon played by thelma ritter widmark and peters are attracted to each other which changes peters loyalties that and the fact that she learns she's working for communists the cold war stuff is really interesting the love story is done a little quickly and not entirely believable but it's not so bad that it harms the film unlike fuller's previous film park row richard widmark is great this must be one of his best roles but i'm not so familiar with his career that i can say that for sure thelma ritter gives the most memorable performance her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance and her final scene in this film is as touching as any you will find in the cinema i will never forget that 10 10
<START> still crazy is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of all time it has been erroneously compared to this is spinal tap which it has no relation to spinal tap is a satire and quite frankly not a very good one in spite of it's outing of many rock clichÃ©s unlike tap still crazy is populated by great actors great songs and great human situations you care about the people in still crazy that's all that matters oh yeah the music's pretty damn good too written by mick jones of foreigner and chris difford of squeeze american audiences were already familiar with stephen rea the crying game but would only later become familiar with bill nighy underworld love actually pirates of the caribbean ii and timothy spall the harry potter movies
<START> this movie portrays ruth as a womanizing hard drinking gambling overeating sports figure with a little baseball thrown in babe ruths early life was quite interesting and this was for all intents and purposes was omitted in this film also lou gehrig was barely covered and this was a well know relationship good bad or indifferent it should have been covered better than it was his life was more than all bad he was an american hero an icon that a lot of baseball greats patterned their lives after i feel that i am being fair to the memory of a great baseball player that this film completely ignored shame on the makers of this film for capitalizing on his faults and not his greatness
<START> my favorite part was when the credits started to roll i wish i could give it a 0000000000001 out of 10 i really wish i had that hour and thirty minutes back don't waste your money or time on it i really could have watched grass grow and felt better after wards br br nadia was really pretty and i hope the movie didn't destroy her career but she chose to be in it br br all in all it sucked more than any other movie has sucked more than kazaam and glitter combined that's saying something br br don't br br do br br it
<START> chances are if i watched this again i might get physically sick the film is so annoying unless you believe in psychics re incarnation and the other hocus pocus which this promotes big time the re cycling of souls they call it here puh leeze br br this story has been done several times before with such films as heaven can wait it's also been done a lot better too bad they had to waste the talents of robert downey jr cybill shepherd ryan o'neal and mary stuart masterson br br at least it's a pretty tame film language wise that's about the only redeeming quality of this movie
<START> the most succinct way to describe ride with the devil is with but one word authenticity i will not rehash what has already been said about this wonderous film but i would like to say how much the historical research and painstaking attention to detail the crew no doubt went through was appreciated by this filmgoer br br as a student of history familiar with the period and setting of this film i must say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films regarding bleeding kansas yes there were liberties taken on the actual events as all fiction is apt to do but the overall feel of the film is genuine authentic costumes authentic attitudes no pc hindsight here even the actors look authentic even jewel kilcher who has a small part in the film looked like she stepped form a mid 19th century photograph br br a few viewers i talked with have expressed their incredulity at the stylized dialog they cannot believe that 19th century farmers would talk like poets br br what they don't realize is that in this age of verbal slobbishness the american public public of the 19th century was a surprisingly literate and eloquent bunch these people were raised on shakespeare and the king james version of the bible the screenwriters reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people judging from documentation of the time the stylized dialog just adds to the magical atmosphere of the film br br but in addition to a historical document this film works on a visceral level as well beautifully photographed and performed it harkens back to the days of the great western epics the raid on lawrence kansas done so many times before in so many other lesser films is portrayed with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer right in the midst of the action br br romance adventure moral and ethical conflict this film has everything a discerning moviegoer could want br br in a year that was dominated by overhyped garbage like american beauty this great artwork was buried by an indifferent studio system but i am certain that ride with the devil will be given it's due in the coming years please rent this film you will not be disappointed
<START> there are bad movies then there are the movies that are so bad that they become almost art this is one of those films my partner and i are still both kind of shell shocked you know staring off into space and drooling you can tell that the people involved i hope they changed their names to protect themselves were having a blast and they definitely weren't shy i give this one a three out of ten just because of the gratuitous smut and really bad gore effects i laughed out loud during most of the movie so i guess you could say that it showed me a good time beware viewer the above words in no way construe that this is a good film because it is not all i can say in my defense is that it was impossible to pass up a movie with such a great title
<START> of those comments here before mine i mostly agree with edyarb's the story and the script apparently had potential to be funny but though managing at some points in other places it failed you could see them wanting to make a joke but no one in the audience laughed also agree with edyarb's view on the end credits leave it normal or make it cool but not what they've done now br br ok that gives a more negative feeling than what i actually had watching the movie i enjoyed it it was pleasant entertainment for a night and definitely didn't feel like a waste of money to get the ticket the best jokes are the ones that go a little bit outside of the expected and are fairly mature like luke wilson's character matt asking the super chick p nis or bed when she told him she'd get him a new one after a wild night in bed ending up breaking the bed and leaving matt sore br br i cannot however agree with bgs1614 who says that the film could earn an 'r' rating there was absolutely nothing in the film to justify that some sexual acts yes but nothing explicit only humorous and no nudity whatsoever maybe he was at a prescreening that showed more i'd like to compare this to two recent films i went to see with no expectations whatsoever superman returns and click i didn't really expect anything from either one i was a big fan of the original superman films and the trailer for click only showed it as a potentially chauvinistic which i wouldn't oppose film superman surprised me with actually having me feel good goosebumps about seeing his first heroic deed like seeing a long lost friend and feeling happy about it but for the rest of the story i'd rather watch my super ex girlfriend at least it offers some surprises click again was a total surprise much better and deeper than the trailer and about five minutes away from being a really excellent movie the jokes also work much better than in ex girlfriend both the naughty ones and the more advanced ones br br anyway the only reason i compared these three films is that they are the three last ones i've seen within a very short period and also because i went to all of these with basically no expectations at all i'd rank them click girlfriend superman
<START> this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen worse than the most abhorrent american dross worse than glitter mariah carey in american dross par excellence i can only imagine that the writer and producer were taking huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals and when discussing the plot actually thought it was a good idea it's not it is abject rubbish from very bowels of satan himself who could probably have written a better script had he put his mind to it robert jones as exce producer spending our tax payers money lottery money folks on this piece of nonsense should be accountable who on earth thought it would be a good idea to re make deathline i ask you camp as a christmas tree deathline 'mind the doors' is classic of really bad british film we really don't need a reminder and we certainly don't need a poor second rate badly scripted badly developed and badly piece of rubbish like this all this this from the uk funding agency that brought us sex lives of the potato men i rest my case br br do not pay any money to see this it is absolute and utter crap the one saving grace for the producers is that they got a huge wedge of cash our cash for making it they should hang their heads in shame br br i am staggered at the low low standard of this film it makes me mgr that our national body for the support of film actually thought it was worth supporting there is no hope for the british film industry whilst idiots are running the show harvey wienstein where are you come back we forgive you
