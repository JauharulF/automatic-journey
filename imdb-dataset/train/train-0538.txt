<START> people please don't bother to watch this movie this movie is bad it's totally waste of time i don't see any point here it's a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again
<START> this is possibly the worst version of the play i have seen several times on stage apart from the movie br br a very nice idea for the set up the american south can give a credible backdrop for the extreme reaction round hero's supposed misdemeanour br br but the execution widdoes is a very mannered beatrice giving a particularly poor performance waterston a fine actor is not much better as benedict br br the poorest performance is in the role of don john it makes keanu reeves look good perhaps the desire to make it a caricature along the lines of the villain who ties the maiden to the train track fits with the keystone kops capers of dogberry and his men but the acting makes you want to cringe br br successful set ups include the scene where they fool benedict into believing beatrice loves him were the acting competent it would be superb but the use of the river and the visual humour of benedict moving closer is well produced br br overall i had to force myself to keep watching but it certainly didn't keep my attention br br very disappointing br br with respect to latter comments above i am nearly 40 i've been watching stage and screen productions of shakespeare for over 2 decades might i suggest when trying to defend your friends you speak to the piece rather than attack other reviewers when you are so inadequately armed in terms of fact i can assume though from your distaste regarding youth that you are of sufficient age where the mannered acting of bygone days is more to your taste br br my personal favourite pairing was rylance and mcteer on the london stage unlike widdoes mcteer a skilled and charismatic performer can act
<START> as far as i am concerned this silent version of the merry widow is the worst version ever made there is no tenderness or love or spirituality about this version it is all macabre germanic sinister nonsense it reminded me of nazis falling in love who cares br br this silent version by von stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story in this one we have leering john gilbert and his gross relative the prince lusting after this silly american actress played by mae murray possessed with a modern permed hairstyle and implausible feminist manner that threw me off again and again i like my romances light and beautiful with slow build ups not harsh and sadistic like this one and come on those bee stung lips get rid of them girl br br go see a live performance of the show if you would like to get a real idea of the sweetness of the original operetta by franz lehar failing that wait till tcm shows the jeanette macdonald maurice chevalier sound version it's much better
<START> worst movie ever can't believe i wasted 90min of my life watching this crap the only reason i didn't turn it off was i wanted to see the gangster dude on the cover and he wasn't even in it talk about false advertising the people that gave this movie a ten are either dumb stupid or cast members or friends of cast members br br i gave it a solid 2 because no one else did br br i have to write more and i don't even want to wasting my time talking about this rubbish please don't watch it and if you did then vote so this movie can go where it belongs bottom 100 movies i can't even tell you how bad it really is think the worst movie ever that you've seen then times that be ten and thats this movie it sucked if you just think i'm being bitter then watch it i dare you this movie should be used to torture war criminals or terriosts if they watch this even two times and they'll be spilling the beans and begging for mercy
<START> from the q a before and after this is what i could gather some irish guy wants to make a movie nothing in particular just any movie so one night at a party he hears some ex roadie tell him a classic bit of rock n' roll lore the one about how gram parsons' corpse was stolen from lax by his loyal roadie so he could honor parsons' wishes that he be cremated out in joshuatree wow br br what a great idea for a movie rock n' roll well country grave robbing escapes friendship the 70's i guess we could get johnny knoxville from jackass cause it's kind of a prank right and knoxville wants to do a movie too why he must have thought he had the next snatch on his hand br br but this story's not really that exciting we need something for knoxville to struggle against like a psychotic girlfirend after his money but parsons' was married at the time that's o k no one knows that besides we could get christina applegate but what if the audience doesn't like the idea of stealing a corpse well we'll get his dad to join the chase but give permission in the end but parsons' dad killed himself when he was 10 in fact his orphan status and tragic childhood are key parts of the parsons mythology mythology we're making a movie this is creative problem solving br br it's an uncomfortable experience for anybody even vaguely knowledgeable on or interested in the subject applegate's presence is doubling jarring first her invented character is a beverly hills bitch before her time she might as well have walked around the whole movie a cell phone in her hand and secondly what kind of man would parsons be if he ever associated himself with that kind of harpy facts aren't just distorted or left out but reversed they could have easily found the villain they wanted in parsons stepfather who was attempting to whisk the body back to his home state where law would favor him in dividing up the considerable inheritance br br and the music oh the music i love the music is hacked up the bridge of a song here the chorus there forced to the background and in the end horribly covered by the hippest new indie band starsailor my girlfriend asked the unnecessary but irresistable question after the movie was anyone up there the writer the producers the director actually a gram parson's fan well no he'd never actually heard of gram parsons but of course blah blah blah i learned to love it and here's some factoids i read in a bio online another guy vouched for parsons' coolness by saying he and keith richards tripped on acid together and wrote wild horses together a mixed up bunch of facts as off base as the movie another person asked wasn't it morally questionable to rewrite history when most people would only know about it from this film well he had the real roadie's permission he was even set and the parsons estate gave permission and all these other people who got paychecks said it was great br br but what i really wondered was and asked in the embarassingly trembling voice of a truly impassioned parsons geek was if the movie's so cheaply made a million had they not considered the original gram parsons fanbase as an audience the director and writer seemed to think he was a nothing figure with no fanbase though i doubt any mojo magazine reading country rock 70's music fan would agree but a bunch of brits made it i guess and they just didn't care about cosmic american music or even knew it existed this isn't just not a truthful parsons flick it's not even in the right spirit it doesn't even fit the legend at the very least it should have had the sentimentality of one of his songs and plenty of people would love to be told br br i should mention the movie was received well from the bunch of stoned college kids just off the slopes and into johnny knoxville but if you're a parsons fan ignore the title it's just a movie for jackass fans
<START> i for one have shamelessly enjoyed every episode of pushing daisies this season and hope that the writers' strike won't brutally end the beginnings of a very good show ned is a pie maker who owns a restaurant in the middle of town and has a secret talent emmerson is a private investigator with his own unique quirks like his love of knitting charlotte chuck is the once dead but not anymore childhood friend and sunny spot of ned's life olive is the jealous but good hearted waitress oh and add the dog jim dale brings all the characters together with his wonderful narration of the show chuck ned and emmerson along with olive and occasionally the dog solve multiple murder mysteries with the assistance of ned's special gift of bringing dead people back to life the show is funny clean and romantic in a very cute and good hearted way and i'd recommend it to anyone
<START> i'm at this very moment debating whether i should even finish watching this poppycock of a movie they had a pretty interesting idea with the buried movie set and that was it so far this incomprehensible mess has no real story there is the buried set some wolf headed monster running amok an amulet and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf masked whatever it is what i would have missed had i had the good sense to eject this nonsense is a dune buggy chase some really bad c g i some incredibly stupid dialog more bad c g i and the hero fighting paper cut outs other than the original idea this film has absolutely zero redeeming qualities my mistake for continuing to watch merk
<START> for those deciding whether or not to watch this movie and are reading these comments for insight i first offer these four words don't waste your time chungking express was shoddily filmed slapped together quickly and seems as though it were conceived in its entirety by someone standing in line at a hong kong burger king i can't remember ever watching a film with an assortment of such one dimensional characters trying to work their way through a script this mundane it's an absurd effort with philosophically ridiculous dialog a man wanders into his flooded apartment and offers the stunning revelation that tears can be dried with a tissue but water takes time to mop up the same character is also seen carrying on a deep meaningful rapport with his towels soap stuffed animals dirty laundry etc the shaky wandering hand held camera work was another annoying feature i could have done without and if that isn't enough to make you puke in your popcorn we hear the old 60's ode california dreaming by the mamas and papas blaring over the soundtrack over and over again during a particularly lengthy sequence br br quentin tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to america through his rolling thunder productions company though i cannot for the life of me figure out why a man with his talent would bother he was known to have remarked i'm happy to love a movie this much a lot of us though hope he will concentrate on making his audiences happy with more worthwhile discoveries in the future
<START> i still can't believe this movie they got so much unbelievable things in it that it's hard to believe anyone wanted to make it br br the story is a joke but in the sense of being funny but more like no story at all how can you mix a slapstick comedy with a train robbery a prison movie town conspiracies sex jokes and a fbi agent you can't br br beside the terrifying directing the most noticeable thing are the actors i watched this film and thought 'is this really marlon brando no it can't be 5 minutes later is this charlie sheen wow maybe brando is true 5 minutes later this can't be donald sutherland 5 minutes later no not mira sorvino this movie is too bad for all of them at the end no no no this can't absolutely not be martin sheen not for 10 seconds of such a movie ' then it was over and i down with my nerves so many good oscar winning usually convincing actors in such a stupid dumb awful movie i rarely wanted to know so much how they came to act in this one they couldn't got so much money br br only just an unbelievable silly idiotic movie br br 3 10 1 4 5 1 6
<START> uncompromising look at a suburb in 21st century vienna mixing the stories of six groups of characters by former documentary maker u seidl is a provocative minimalistic and intense piece of observation cinema br br after the world wide spread of big brother reality shows hundstage takes modern voyeurism to an unsettling profound level hard to like but unignorable piece of european art cinema might seem cruel and seedy yet manages to convey the nihilistic alienated feeling of modern society in a praiseworthy manner br br a must for lovers of world cinema
<START> this is a 'sleeper' it defines nicholas cage the plot is intricate and totally absorbing the ending will blow you away br br see it whenever you have the opportunity
<START> this flick was a blow to me i guess little girls should aspire to be nothing more than swimsuit models home makers or mistresses since that seems to be all they'll ever be portrayed as anyway it is truly saddening to see an artist's work and life being so unjustly misinterpretated inconcievably or perhaps it should have been expected artemisia's entire character and all that she stands for had been reduced to a standard hollywood female character a pitiful physically flawless helpless little creature displaying none of the character traits that actually got her that place in history which was being mutilated here sadder yet was to see that a great part of the audience was too badly educated in the area to comprehend the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film and reality to portray the artist as someone in love with her real life rapist someone whom she in reality accused of raping her even when under torture just plain pisses me off if the director had nothing more substantial to say she should have refrained from basing her story on a real person
<START> with such actors as ralph richardson raymond massey cedrick hardwicke and margaretta scott how can you go wrong very unusual scenics especially the modern ones the realization of the modern machinery is very effective here you have ray gun blasts from building vehicles that help clear the area so new structures can be made although she's much younger in this film it's not very hard to figure out who the future mrs pumphrey from the bbc series all creatures great and small is going to be really effective reappearance of both raymond massey and ralph richardson the musical score is by the renowned swiss composer artur honegger and it is also unusual for the time 1936 it looks like they used really large sets or the effects make it seem that way lastly it's a really good story
<START> first of all it's very dilettantish to try describe way of history only from positions of guns germs and steel the same tried to do marxists from economical positions br br the reason of western success can't be just dumb luck the advantages of domesticated plants and animals we see that all around the world any advantages and bonuses are complete useless if they aren't wisely managed in the japan there isn't huge natural resources but japan is one of the top world economies the same situation in singapore but in nigeria country with rich oil resources there are only middle low success both of this nations had and still have access to western technology and inventions but why such gap br br in the end of movie daimond declared that it's very important to understand factors of guns germs and steel to understand maybe the main factor of world's difference is not geography but people ability to understand and use things the mental ability to understand and in this case geography is only subordinated
<START> i cannot believe how bad this piece of garbage is i want my 3 99 back words defy description of this poorly made piece of crap the dubbing in no way shape or form aligns with the actor's mouths the movie looks like it was filmed with a 1970's vintage camcorder i have shot better movies with my cell phone camera the gore is laughable due to the silly unbelievable plot the acting is what one would expect if you called all your friends over on a saturday afternoon and proceeded to get completely ripped then tried to put on a play in your garage don't get me wrong i wasn't expecting o'neil and i love zombie movies but the production values are so low in this film as to make it unwatchable avoid
<START> i'm going to have to disagree with the previous comment and side with maltin on this one this is a second rate excessively vicious western that creaks and groans trying to put across its central theme of the wild west being tamed and kicked aside by the steady march of time it would like to be in the tradition of butch cassidy and the sundance kid but lacks that film's poignancy and charm andrew mclaglen's direction is limp and the final 30 minutes or so are a real botch with some incomprehensible strategy on the part of heroes charlton heston and chris mitchum someone give me a holler if you can explain to me why they set that hillside on fire there was something callous about the whole treatment of the rape scene and the woman's reaction afterwards certainly did not ring true coburn is plenty nasty as the half breed escaped convict out for revenge but all of his fellow escapees are underdeveloped they're like bowling pins to be knocked down one by one as the story lurches forward michael parks gives one of his typically shifty lethargic mumbling performances but in this case it was appropriate as his modern style sheriff symbolizes the complacency that technological progress can bring about
<START> the plot is about the death of little children hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings during the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter in the end the serial killer get caught that's it but before you find out who dunnit you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors it is unbelievable how bad these actors are including hopper i could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time just don't watch the movie i've warned you
<START> over her dead body was a nice little movie it was decent and entertaining while still being pretty funny there were a few clichÃ©'s but i found most stuff fresh at first i didn't think it was going to be good at all when it started out if you can get past the first 20 minutes though the movie starts getting more interesting this film wasn't burst out in laughter hilarious and wasn't oh my gosh wonderful it was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was i don't see how this movie was bad it's rating is just a bit too low i could've dealt with a 5 5 but a 4 8 also giving this movie a 1 is disgraceful it was pretty good and there was nothing horrible enough about it to give it a 1 which is what most people gave it
<START> i read somewhere where this film was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 film noir criss cross i found the latter to be disappointing but it was still better than this film br br this movie is a neo noir since it's modern day and it's in color two things that purists would make it be disqualified for film noir status br br the biggest negative to it however wasn't the cinematography that was fine but the muddled storyline hey some of '40s dashiell hammett stories were similar but i didn't care for some of those either the filmmakers here did not help the situation by placing flashbacks into the story what seemed like every three minutes no wonder it was the keep up with this story it was ridiculous what happens is that by the 45 minute mark their is so much confusion nobody cares anymore i know i didn't
<START> this film is outstanding and wonderfully scored prince's oscar for music was richly deserved many people don't know he won one i think this is one of the best films to watch as a couple late at night on dvd a great surprise prince does a fine job acting and is pretty good at conveying pain on camera morris day wendy and lisa are good in their supporting roles very cool landmark film
