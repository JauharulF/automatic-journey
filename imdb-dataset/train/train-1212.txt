<START> who would have thought that a movie about a man who drives a couple hundreds of miles on his lawn mower to see his brother could possibly be good cinema i certainly didn't i thought i knew what to expect one of the most boring experiences of my life well i was as wrong as i haven't been wrong too often yet because this is one of the best most realistic and honest hollywood films i've ever seen br br giving a short resume of the straight story isn't very difficult it's about an old and stubborn man who steps on his lawn mower and drives off to another state to pay his brother a visit when he hears that the man has had a severe stroke that's already special on itself but what makes it even more special is the fact that he hasn't seen his brother in ten years because of some stupid argument in the meantime he has his share of bad luck and problems but he also meets a lot of people whose lives he influences in one way or another with his philosophical approach to life despite all the difficulties he drives on for weeks not knowing if he will reach his goal seeing his brother again before it's too late br br i can easily understand why there are people who don't like this movie and that's also the reason why i will not say that these people don't have a heart or things like that this movie hasn't got any flashy action scenes it is as slow as the lawn mower the man is driving on and no you don't have to watch it for the nice soundtrack either because there isn't any but why should you watch it then well the simple answer is the story i haven't seen such a touching movie with such a powerful story very often and the fact that this actually comes from hollywood and to make things even better from the disney studio's that's right the same studios that overwhelm us with sugar sweet nonsense makes it even more special i'm not ashamed to admit that i had the tears in my eyes a couple of times while watching it probably because the whole situation of not seeing someone for many years because of some stupid argument is all too realistic for me br br some people will argue that the story is very shallow but i really don't agree with that perhaps it is because they only see that old man driving on his lawn mower and don't want to think any further if you look close enough than you'll understand that this man is doing all this because he knows he has once been wrong that only his pride stood in the way of seeing his brother again and that he wants everybody else to see that too so they won't make the same mistake if that isn't deep enough how much deeper does a story have to go for you then br br i would also like to add that this movie really had it all some beautiful landscapes finally an american movie that shows something else than the skyline of new york chicago or some other big city some very fine acting by richard farnsworth sissy spacek and a very understandable way of telling despite the fact that this is a david lynch movie i know now that i was completely wrong by assuming that this movie wouldn't be to my taste it's one of the very best movies i've seen in a long time this movie aimed for my heart and hit the bull's eye i give it the full 10 10
<START> i have always been keen on watching hong kong movies but all of them failed to meet my expectations until now burning paradise doesn't contain the flat humor most hk movies have nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film the story is not complex but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some intelligent space the only truely intelligent martial arts film i have seen is crouching tiger but since hollywood is involved it is no true hk movie for me there are some incredible fight scenes in this movie from the first one which is one of the coolest i have ever seen yet so short to the last main scenes but mind there's also a lot of blood that flows people cut in half decapitated etc the production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even though some shots must be pretty technical notice the sheet of paper that he throws and got pinned into a wall yep it's not tsui hark or john woo that made my favorite hong kong film it's ringo lam and i'm sure as hell going to check out more from this director ace
<START> the cast is ok the script is awkward at times and it takes a while to figure out what the point of the movie is i found myself looking forward to doing the dishes the shehan bit is a cheesy statement on the war i guess we were supposed to not notice it we did its a house you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes the shower part huh what was that about literally it is i have a client ok you can use our shower yawn the angles are trying way to hard there was a set of woods suddenly its gone cause you can see right through then next it is deep and animals are dying in the end this is a horrendous movie of boring proportions
<START> i'm gonna give it to ya straight this movie is amazing foreign gay films are so fast surpassing american gay films in production quality acting and story while so many american indie gay films are grainy bad sound amateur acting trite story lines and a surprising lack of any nudity or erotica top quality foreign gay films have been popping up like this one from france the cinematography is beautiful thought out meaningful the story is adult and complex but not difficult for anyone to follow the acting is intense and professional both leads are fantastic as well as the entire cast the boys are more than just good looking and there's plenty of full frontal nudity you follow the entire year of these boys from their meeting to the end all the little nuances of a relationship's the details of falling in and out of love are there beautifully performed it left me wanting more check it out
<START> oh man if you want to give your internal crow t robot a real workout this is the movie to pop into the ol' vcr the potential for cut up lines in this film is just endless br br minor spoilers ahead hey do you really care if a film of this quality is spoiled traci is a girl with a problem psychology has developed names for it when a child develops a sexual crush on the opposite sex parent but this girl seems to have one for her same sex one and i don't think there's a term for that it might be because her mother dana is played by rosanna arquette whose cute overbite neo flowerchild sexuality and luscious figure makes me forgive her any number of bad movies or unsympathetic characters here dana is not only clueless to her daughter's conduct she seems to be competing for the gold medal in the olympic indulgent mother competition br br it's possible that dana misses traci's murderous streak because truth be told traci seems to have the criminal skills of a hamster it's only because the script dictates so that she manages to pull off any kind of a body count br br a particularly hilarious note in this movie is the character of carmen a mexican maid who is described by dana as around so long she's like one of the family although she dresses in what the director thought would say i just fell off the tomato truck from guadalajara carmen is so wise to traci's scheming she might also wear a sign saying hey i'm the next victim sure enough traci confronts carmen as carmen is making her way back from mass and bops her with one of those slightly angled lug wrenches that car manufacturers put next to your spare as a bad joke i rather suspect than in real life those things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are for changing a tire br br in another sequence arquette wears a flimsy dress to a vineyard under cloudy skies talking to the owner cut to her in another flimsy dress under sunny skies talking to the owner's brother then cut to her wearing the first dress in the first location under cloudy skies but it's supposed to be later you get the picture we're talking really bad directing br br as for skin don't expect much although traci does own a nice couple of bikinis br br for those looking for a trash wallow 8 for anybody else 1 2
<START> i loved this movie i'll admit it this has to be the best straight to video movie i've seen well me and my friend decided just for shits n' giggles that we'd rent this movie we knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected plus more when that red neck gets slammed up against the tree by the sasquatch we literally watched that part about three to four times it was that amazing hysterically of course and why oh why does the main character have to roll that much like honestly we know that you're in danger rolling that much isn't gonna help all that much but really if this movie is in you're local video store rent it it is worth the money and it's not even that bad like it's bad but not incredibly bad overall complete amazing will be in store for you if you rent this movie
<START> i'm dumbfounded yes that's right i'm really caught here no way did i find it awful but on the other hand it was a frustrating experience in macabre hysterical and murky incoherency the idea behind such a trim minimal low budget indie production isn't bad but it's a confused muddle and in the end didn't do anything for me it's amateurish and simple it wants to exploit beyond reasoning and do so in that of late fashionably rapid filming style we have the documentary laced hand held camera moving everywhere despite never leaving the van and sometimes feeling unfocused and blurry making certain details hard to figure out lately you kind of get use to it but there are times when it does become too distracting and even nauseating keeping it still will help the context has little groundwork which has five teenage girls on their way home from a football game late at night and becoming lost on the back roads at a road side store they become involved in a minor accident which smashes an unoccupied suv headlight scared they flee and not too long that one light suv appears behind them soon to make their night an unforgettable ordeal in terror spending most of the time playing out a drawn out noisy and relentless cat and mouse game br br as for being disturbingÂ i guess that depends some moments can make you squirm with its attention to pain desperation and demented brutality with good use of piercing sound fx that seem to be more favoured over the imagery and not forgetting the alienating background sound effects but also i found myself snickering too in passages it can be repellent and intense with a real gradual rush but hardly believable the injuries of random characters never seem as serious like you were to believe despite obviously they should be watch how blood runs freely but it's not entirely convincing and can get dull the constant nocturnal car chase could only do so much before getting repetitive we get screaming spewing bleeding running cursing body fluids and so on quite unpleasant details followed too with little really to do it needed a much stronger script than the measly forced one that was penned up too many cringe moments arose from it and there was not much in the way of depth for the characters and situation they were in it was about set pieces waiting for next torturous encounter and it drew it out long enough helping out is it had an unpredictable pattern br br the performances jennifer barnett angela brunda danielle lilley sandra paduch and mia yi are workman like with their distraught characters and draw an authentic chemistry to make up for the script's weaknesses in its character foundation veronica garcia's flipped out bug eyed intensity as the loony driver of the suv was somethingÂ yeah something her character's real motivation for terrorising the girls and her unstable state of mind is virtually non existent i guess being psychotic was good enough now probably the most unnerving thing i came across in the feature was that hideous soundtrack terrible techno music to cheesy hard rock and an overwrought closing score it never felt overdone or got in the way but it did stick out like a sore thumb co directors greg swinson and ryan thiessen try to get the most out of their slight resources but even with it edgy spirit it ends up being something quite ramshackle maybe it was enjoyable to make but watching it just wasn't the case
<START> bellocchio refers to this as a mainly political movie a description of the revolutionary movement in italy but that seems more metaphor than reality well almost everything in the movie seems like metaphor the revolutionaries of whom we see and about whom we learn very little might as well be mafiosi out with the old and in with the new br br andrea's papa a psychoanalyst seems to stand for the usual traditional bourgeois values morally upright unperturbed clean and tidy thoroughly ritualized br br giullia the girlfriend of a revolutionary seems to represent what can happen to someone who needs very badly a cause to support but is unable to muster up the kind of devotion such a commitment demands i'm guessing here andrea the adolescent boy seems to be the only guy in the movie who is not in some unquiet way upatz he's respectful of his father but disobedient too he loves giullia or so we assume although he's not really old enough to have learned how to manage his reflexes optimally but he leaves her in order to show up at school and complete his final exams his course between these contradictory lifestyles could be described as media he's the man in between who knows the meaning of gradualism who can keep his cool while those about him are screaming br br most of this is summed up during the oral part of his finals when he is asked to translate and comment on an excerpt from antigone which contrasts the traditional authority of the gods with the notion of secularity and free will br br that brings us by no particular course that i'm aware of to marushka detmars she brings to mind a new yorker cartoon of a few years ago two hippos are neck deep in the river staring at a gazelle drinking from the bank and one hippo says to the other i hate her she's a good actress let me get that out of the way but so is everyone else in the film she carries with her in her speech and manner the rich glitter of outright lunacy and it all comes from the actress too not from directorial aid detmars isn't nuts the way catherine deneuve was nuts in repulsion the walls don't turn to rubber and grow hands instead we see her animated sometimes too animated and she gives us shocking jolts when her mood abruptly changes and becomes threatening the way a looming thunderstorm is threatening br br a critic described her as sultry but that's probably not the word he was searching for she's compellingly beautiful with her fluffy brown hair her wide white ready grin her impulsive giggles and her eyes are like the eyes in the paintings on the walls of ancient egyptian tombs the sexy parts are pretty erotic not so much because one of them is explicit but because we've gotten to know the characters involved it's more interesting to spy on the honeymoon couple next door than go to a skin flick actually there isn't that much sex there is only one scene of simulated intercourse but the director lets it play out in what seems to be real time at least real time for an eighteen year old boy br br the young man who plays andrea is fine too which is a necessary thing because the film depends almost entirely on him and giullia they have to carry it and they do if it were not for their performances i'm not sure this would be as interesting or as admirable flick as it is it could easily have been turned into a rather slow boring romance br br worth it
<START> aka trinity is still my name this sequel looks like it was done to capitalize on the outstanding european box office success of they call me trinity only this time joseph e levine and avco embassy pictures wanted to capitalize on it in america as well too bad they didn't get very far since the hill spencer pictures have had only had marginal success here in the u s and this largely boring drawn out film doesn't help it out any br br trinity and bambino swear to their dying father harry carey jr that they will become successful outlaws and take care of each other they later get involved with arms traffickers who smuggle guns out of a monastery and who mistakenly think they're a pair of federal agents it all winds up falling flat in spite of a couple of funny scenes especially the one where trinity and bambino are in a fancy french restaurant and don't know how to carry themselves and the scenes with the card sharks was mildly humorous as well br br the opening title music sung by gene roman sounds like a fair bobby goldsboro like early 70s pop song while the music cues sprinkled throughout the movie are pretty good not sure if i'd want to buy the cd soundtrack of it but some others might br br the film could have had a half hour whacked off of it and it wouldn't have dragged on for so long it looks like a lot of scenery is being chewed up here in fact i lost interest in it about 2 3rds of the way through the dvd is also terrible with a constant hum in the soundtrack and a poor print that looks like it should have been sent to that great scrap heap in the sky br br a big step down from the previous film br br 4 out of 10
<START> i found this very touching as spike and heaton stay together all the way through this film not to say there isn't a few betrayals along the way i thought the chase was put aside the relationship between the two was foreground i think i had already guessed that there were so gay intentions on the part of heaton my favourite scene had to be the bit where heaton and spike were stuck in the marsh and spike runs off i generally thought spike wasn't coming back i have to say that if it wasn't for our film studies teacher making us watch this i would have probably never seen it overall i thought this film was pretty good and i would recommend it to any person who is a fan of british made films
<START> this light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value it gets quite hysterically funny at times but if you haven't spent any time on 'that' side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it erupts br br the cast of characters meld well together and are quite believable in their roles how grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was well played she's a true lady and my favorite is grace's white pimp suit that she wears br br i highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud who cheers for the underdog or just wishes to watch something different
<START> there is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film major chick davis pat o'brien o'brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets the bombardier but he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly in fact he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military he's tough when he has to be yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor roles he perfected in other films his character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves o'brien seems natural in the role and plays it in fine fashion two things help this movie o'brien's performance and the spectacular special effects ending
<START> this movie documents the harlem ball circuit of the mid eighties much more fun than than palazzo volpi though just as diseased this movie is a true gem of squalor one cannot help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness the sole purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomenons of the trash and the glitz here the most genius of trash is extremely well documented and duly glamorized the characters' penchant for idolatry of all that is glamorous inspires even more adoration of the characters themselves on part of the viewer creating a phenomenon of a phenomenon effect which makes this movie a piece of art
<START> if i could say it was better than gymkata i at least felt my money was not totally wasted br br then i saw steven segal's on deadly ground br br this movie should see a resurrection though on mst 3k if santa claus conquers the martians could make tom servo's head explode one wonders what mayhem this movie could cause br br there is a very good reason why kurt thomas never had a movie career br br the writers of this dreck should be forced to wear placards every day of their lives that say bitch slap me i was a writer on gymkata
<START> this is one of the best bond games i have ever played because br br the missions are very very fun to play they have lots of action in them they can be really hard sometimes that makes it even more fun the weapons that you use are really good the cars in this game are really good the driving missions are fun to do this james bond game has a good story to it the voice over actors in this game are really good and it is cool that pierce brosnan is in this game and the way the characters look is really good because they look like what they look like in real life which is really cool also the graphics in this game pretty good br br overall score out of
<START> very heart warming and uplifting movie outstanding performance by alisan porter curly sue i saw this movie when it was first released and enjoyed it immensely i just caught it again on the mplex channel and curly sue touched my heart again
<START> i enjoyed this movie a lot i thought that the plot of the movie was realistic and relevant to anytime period in american history there is always that woman that does what she needs to do to climb the class system i feel that the character of lilly was portrayed correctly and could of not been done better what i enjoyed most was when she realized what love really was throughout the movie all of the men that fell for her were in love with her had given her everything even lost their careers for her until she had met cortland she did not understand why these men gave up everything for happiness the way her life had ended up was far from what she expected to be possible i'd recommend this movie to anyone of a mature audience so you are able to understand the content and the under laying meaning of the movie and plot
<START> wowwwwww about an hour ago i finally finished watching this terrible movie i wanted to turn it off within the first like 10 minutes but i figured i'd give it a chance because it just hadddd to get better or at least have some redeeming qualities like i figured at the very least it would be a make you think type movie or like really intelligent or very well filmed or something needless to say that was not the case and i wasted about an hour and a half of my life im not even going to get into why its terrible because its a waste of my time to explain that this may contain spoilers imdb you should calm down on the spoilers thing and pay more attention to making sure that the people who rate the movies and comment are not paid to write good reviews or involved somehow in the movie or anything else like that i thought it would be humorous after this terrible film to come see hoe bad the rating would be and i was very very shocked to see the fairly high ratings all the ratings with about 7 10 stars clearly must be about some completely different movie im still a big imdb fan but seriously rethink this rating process because this movie should be rated no higher than maaaybbbeee like a 3
<START> some unsuspecting films carry a message that resonates in the hours and days after viewing such is the case for carol's journey el viaje de carol a beautifully crafted 2002 film from spain based on the novel 'a boca de noche' by Ãngel garcÃ­a roldÃ¡n who also adapted the book as a screenplay war and its consequences are not new subject matter for films but when that war theme plays in the background as a subtle driving force to develop characters especially children who must face adult life influenced by the games of adults the result is a different and more tender examination of the coming of age film genre br br carol clara lago is a 12 year old spanish american youngster from new york who with her critically ill mother aurora marÃ­a barranco returns to her aurora's home in 1938 at the height of the spanish civil war a home that has been left deserted by her father don amalio Ãlvaro de luna since his wife's death carol's father robert ben temple is a fighter pilot who has sided with the republicans against franco and is rarely with his family aurora has a past she left her lover alfonso alberto jimÃ©nez to marry robert and alfonso in turn married aurora's cold sister dolores lucina gil carol is an independent girl who remains aloof to all but her grandfather don amalio until she meets others her age but not of her 'class' tomiche juan josÃ© ballesta and his two friends at first resent carol but as events develop carol and tomiche are bonded by what feels like the first awakenings of love when aurora dies of her illness carol must live with alfonso and dolores and their daughter blanca luna mcgill yet turns to her grandfather for support and to her mother's best friend and teacher maruja the always radiant rosa maria sardÃ  to understand the disparity between classes and the senseless war that keeps her beloved father from her side through a series of incidents carol and tomiche learn the rigors of becoming adults facing more traumas in a brief period of the war than most of us experience in a lifetime the ending though sad is uplifting as carol's journey to maturity is complete br br the film is shot in galicia and portugal and contains some extraordinarily beautiful settings captured with gentle sensitive lighting by cinematographer gonzalo f berridi and enhanced by the musical score by bingen mendizÃ¡bal director imanol uribe understands the fine line separating pathos from bathos and in electing to concentrate the story on the children involved he makes an even stronger statement about the futility and cruelty of war the cast is exceptional the stars clearly are young clara lago and juan josÃ© ballesta but they are supported by the fine veteran actors in the adult roles this is a visually stunning work with a lasting message and should find a much larger audience than it has to this date grady harp
<START> my father dr gordon warner ret major us marine corps was in guadalcanal and lost his leg to the japanese and also received the navy cross i was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was the technical adviser of this film and i am hoping that he had an impact on the film in making it resemble how it really was back then as i read in various comments written by the viewers of this film that it seemed like real life my father is a fanatic of facts and figures and always wanted things to be seen as they were so i would like to believe he had something to do with that br br he currently lives in okinawa japan married to my mother for over 40 years ironically she's japanese and a few years ago was awarded one of the highest commendations from the emperor of japan for his contribution and activities of bringing back kendo and iaido to japan since mcarthur banned them after wwii br br my father was once a marine but i know that once you are a marine you're always a marine and that is exactly what he is and i love and respect him very much br br i would love to be able to watch this film if anyone will have a copy of it and i'd love to give it to my father for his 94th birthday this year
