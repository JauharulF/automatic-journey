<START> having borrowed this movie from the local library a couple of weeks ago intending to originally see this on or a few days after memorial day i finally got to seeing sayonara just this morning in this one marlon brando plays major lloyd ace gruver a general's son who's been raised a certain way being transfered from korea to japan where his girlfriend eileen webster patricia owens conveniently happens to be before leaving he tries to persuade one of his men a joe kelly red buttons out of marrying japanese woman katsumi miyoshi umeki since that's a violation of military fraternization laws with the romance of him and eileen on the outs however ace not only becomes the best man at joe and katsumi's wedding he falls for an asian himself after he and captain mike bailey james garner go out on the town and watch headlining entertainer hana ogi miiko taka on stage bailey himself is dating one of the dancers fumiko san reiko kuba eileen herself seems to have a fancy for one of the kabuki performers nakamura ricardo montalban i'll stop right there and say that this was a mostly compelling drama about the prejudices concerning american asian relations of romance that was very touching from beginning to end even seeing hispanic montalban playing an oriental isn't too embarrassing though it's a good thing his part is short and there's some nice touches of humor like that of brando's head hitting the top of button's and umeki's inside doorway more than once red and miyoshi themselves deserve their oscars especially red with his defiant and proud emotions throughout rookie garner before being cast in his legendary role on tv's marverick is fine in his scenes with brando and miiko taka shows great restraint in her initial characterization as an anti american while i've read there were some changes from james michener's novel i can't imagine director josha logan who had previously adopted another michener work into the broadway musical south pacific and would eventually make that into a movie as well not staying true to the original source he certainly provided some inspiration with the ending scenes that made the heartbreaking earlier tragedy in the film a somewhat necessary plot twist some of the production numbers may have made the movie a little longish but otherwise sayonara was wonderful educational experience about the '50s mores that permeated america and japan at the time
<START> first of all when i saw the teaser trailer for wendy wu i was definitely excited brenda song one of the hottest girls on disney channel would be doing martial arts and i was fine with that until i saw the movie the action was poorly constructed the movie couldn't have realated to anyone the fighting was unrealistic and it sucked along with the plot if you really think about it's a wannabe buffy the vampire slayer a girl who is the descendant of other warriors who were women a girl wants to ignore her calling and wants to become homecoming queen the watcher who bug's her to prepare for a big fight against some ancient evil the idea just wasn't all that original the movie is waste of time
<START> spoilers khamosh is totally unrealistic lacks a plot and was basically only made to see stars portray themselves the most suspenseful scene in the movie was when shabana azmi is in the shower and then we see her tv playing the shower scene from psycho this movie actually expected users to believe that naseeruddin shah's character has a good enough memory to remember where certain shots were fired and how many br br spoiler begins br br at the end the killer spills his guts to shabana azmi long enough to allow naseeruddin shah's character to run up and shoot him br br spoiler ends br br it is a little humorous only a little in the beginning to hear the director and cast members throwing insults at each other and hearing shabana azmi exclaim oh sh t br br overall a baaaaaaaaaaad movie br br rating out of 2 out of 10
<START> i watched it subtitled as it was in russian but really enjoyed it the main character sasha was born cursed with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body he lived his whole life unhappy because he was different and because anger caused him to do deadly things br br when sasha finally found love in a young woman named katya everyone tried to take her away from him ending in a deadly battle there was a fair amount of gore but not too much for the weak stomached br br not for people who like the regular old hollywood movie but for those who enjoy independent films kinda got the feeling of an asian fantasy film
<START> this movie only gets a second star because i work downtown and liked seeing it destroyed the effects were pretty good i hear it was the most expensive korean film ever made being the most expensive and still absolutely horrid makes it a massive waste of money i rented it so i won't complain too much about what i paid but it was a couple hours that i'll never get back plot holes abound terrible acting all across the board i do not recommend giving up the time to watch this movie life is too short if your friends want to watch this run away i can't stress enough how bad this film was br br where the hell did the second dragon come from why didn't he show up sooner how did they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs just 500 years ago
<START> br br upon concluding my viewing of trance or the eternal or whatever the producers are calling this film i wondered to myself out of all of the bad movies i could have seen couldn't i have at least seen one that was entertaining even if a film is not well made in terms of acting directing writing or what have you it can at least be fun and therefore worthwhile but not only is this film bad in artistic value it's incredibly boring for a plot of such thinness it moves awfully slowly with little dramatic tension at the very least in a low brow attempt at entertainment the deaths of the characters could have been cool and or gory but the creators of this dreck failed in that department as well br br what does this movie have going for it pretty much nothing unless you get entertainment out of watching christopher walken who is capable of being brilliant put so little effort into his acting that he falls into self parody mode why did he decide to do this film anyway br br i give this film 3 10 because god help us there actually have been worse movies made before
<START> i have heard a lot about this film with people writing me telling me i should see it as i am a fan of extremely bloody gory movies i got my hands on it almost right away but one thing or another always kept me from watching it until now i would have been better off not remembering i even had it br br this movie was atrocious the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was i know it was a story by clive barker and all and no i have not read that story but it appears to me that if you haven't then you will be as i was completely clueless and utterly disappointed br br the film begins good enough the actors are convincing the story interesting the first scene is bloody a great way to catch your attention i thought the blood looked a bit bad but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on i was wrong br br the blood and effects are so horrible it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that for instance someone could knock a person's head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer wtf cgi blood did they even use any real blood at all my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film unbelievable acts of dismemberment eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head arms cut neatly off does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies too dark scenes every scene is either an odd yellow color or in hidden in shadows it just gets worse and worse i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake there's just too much add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial killer movie turns into some demonic supernatural monster movie at the end no thank you it should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway ok with a conspiracy theory thrown in and an overzealous photographer maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant plausible doable and a lot better i think than the real story that could have and should have worked instead it became a creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you and unless you read the book well you just won't ever understand it fiasco tragic what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential if you like mindless fake blood and gore you'll love this but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it stay away far far away
<START> so being a fairly deep fan of horror movies it's been a while since i've seen one that really made me jump or fidget nervously br br definitely going to get this on dvd when it comes out a hell of a lot better than the ring the thing that i don't get is that so many people that we talkd with after the movie thought that it was horrible well if that's what you think then so be it i know what i liked and it takes a fair amount to get me to actually feel scared so i have to say that this one is worth watching br br now you might be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a neat and tidy line because the plot goes back an forth a little bit to help build the story i think that if it was shown in chronological order it would have ruined the whole thing br br i'm actually glad that this movie had very little bloody messes in it maybe the rest of you studio writers and whathaveyous will realize that you don't have to splash the red stuff all over the set to make people afraid
<START> brown of harvard is a hard movie to pin down we expect a lot more from our movies these days so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20's were a bit more innocent william haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and even glory all of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted except for the homoerotic tie between billy and jack pickford the town nerd the movie has everything romance tears love death and even sports it's a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century
<START> spoilers i rented tesis or thesis in english on the strength of director alejandro amenabar's later effort the others based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepfest that film was i assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and i was in the mood for some good horror instead i wound up with the most tedious preposterous excuse for a lame brained slasher movie i've seen since the german film anatomie which this one kinda reminded me of br br the plot has potential but it's thrown away within the first 20 minutes it revolves around innocent n pretty psychology student angela's ana torrent a jessica harper deadringer thesis on the subject of violence in films through some far fetched circumstances too dumb to go into here she winds up in possession of a 'snuff' tape on which two men torture mutilate and kill a young girl for the camera angela and her horror buff friend chema fele martinez are both shocked yet intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of who's responsible for it br br this leads to well nothing br br they never really give a reason for why they want to find the girl's killers since they resolutely refuse to contact the police throughout any of the unfolding events even when their own lives at risk and the mystery itself is as limp as graham norton in a room full of bunny girls there is only one proper 'clue' the type of camera the killers used is discovered and that's a a really weak one and b wheeled out in the first 20 minutes the rest of the so called 'unravelling' just occurs through blind luck increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a slew of awful transparent and thoroughly pointless red herrings that are chucked in merely to pad out the running time br br seriously amenabar might know his stuff about ghost stories but he's clearly never read a detective book in his life the key to a good whodunnit is to have a large cluster of potential suspects and to eliminate them one by one with clever deduction and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence before moving in for the final twist in tesis potential spoiler ahead the killer's identity is guessed correctly by the amateur 'detectives' almost instantly and then we get 100 minutes of the writer trying feebly to throw us off the scent until he runs out of ideas throws his hands up and says ok ya got me it was him after all as for any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes no such luck you're watching the wrong movie if that's what you're after br br the only thing that drags tesis down further from just being a dumb badly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make some ludicrous muddled up 'point' about violence in films i have no idea what stance it's attempting to take on the subject but it seems determined to cram in a ton of misguided confused psychobabble in between the rest of the gibberish and say look at me i'm political the final scenes in which the point of the movie is supposedly hammered home are so utterly absurd and puerile one can't help but wonder if amenabar feels embarrassed now when he watches this if he doesn't he certainly should this is total 'amateur night at the slasher house' stuff br br overall i can't believe i wasted two whole hours it felt like at least six on this just hoping something might happen the urban legend of 'snuff films' and that is basically all they are despite the way this film tries to suggest they're some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world is an area that can be so tantalisingly exploited in good horror films videodrome anyone but it's so easy to step over the line into childlike 'wouldn't it be cool if ' territory with it ie my little eye tesis hits an all time low for the 'snuff movie' genre on every level this one is better left dead and buried i'll award it a 1 out of 10 for some nice lighting but that's all it's getting
<START> although i bought the dvd when it first came out and have watched it several times i never wrote a review br br i loved it when i first saw it and i love it still br br sadly it seems it never made enough money to motivate anyone to do a follow up i have to assume qt still controls the rights but after kill bill if he does a film that is as true to the comics and books as my name is modesty with another tough female lead anyone not familiar with the character will see this as a let down br br peter o'donnell wrote his stories to focus more on psychological suspense rather than action thrillers br br the tug of wills between modesty and miklos is very true to the source material and is tense suspenseful and fascinating to anyone who doesn't have to have gore and explosions alexandra did a great job in playing how o'donnell's character would have taken control of the situation br br i find this particularly ahead of the curve following the sorely needed reboots of batman and james bond after 2 dismal earlier efforts although not nearly as well known to the public this is really a reboot of the modesty character and it is really sad that probably no more films about her will be made
<START> i have not seen this movie but i must having read all three of thor heyerdahl's books kon tiki ra and aku aku i am actively looking for a copy of this movie br br the thesis that peruvians migrated to polynesia is alive and well considering that this crew had no gps and only an old fashioned valve tube radio with a 6 watt output their voyage was heroic to say the least br br please reply to this message if you can tell me the location of a copy of this video br br i would be interested in buying it
<START> as a huge fan of horror films especially j horror and also gore i thought nekeddo burÃ¢ddo sounded pretty good i researched the plot read reviews and even looked at some photos to make sure it seemed like a good gory and scary movie to watch before downloading it so excited it had finished and ready to be scared and recoiling in horror at the amazing gore i was expecting i was terribly disappointed the plot was ridiculous and didn't even make sense and left too much unexplained the gore was hilarious rather then horrifying and what was with the cartoon style sound effects the acting was probably the only thing mildly scary about it i did not understand the cactus idea and the way the mothers husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after following a flashing light they left both pretty unexplained or perhaps i missed it as my mind couldn't understand what i was actually seeing i appreciate the way it was supposed to be shocking and a few scenes the strange cannibalism and own mother kissing certainly were i just think they went a little bit far and not even in a horrifying way they made it to unconvincing which made it more believable to be a comedy rather than a horror in my opinion however it is a very entertaining film and got a lot of laughs out of me and a couple of friends but sadly we were expecting horror not comedy so its worth a watch for the entertainment value but don't be expecting a dark deeply scary and horrifying film you'll just be disappointed if this was a horror comedy spoof i'd probably rate it about a nine the climax being the weird scene when the husband climbed inside his wife's stomach and closed up her wounds but as a horror sadly i gave it a one
<START> this movie had it all action comedy heroics and best of all some of the finest actors gunga din will remain a classic to be enjoyed by all who like good movies excellent picture i have it in my collection
<START> this was in short a terrible disappointment by far the worst adaptation of one of my favourite novels the dialogue was horribly clumsy i could sense no feeling behind the words expressed by the characters the lines were delivered too hastily and felt rather out of place they could just as well have been cited by statues the chemistry between george c scott and susannah york was non existent and watching an american rochester felt strange he could have at least tried to do a british accent i like george c scott as an actor but this simply did not work i felt like i was watching highlights from jane eyre where the main pieces of the story had been randomly put together with no regard to the flow of the story the scenery and music were all very nice but i could feel none of the passion and love that is supposed to be between jane and rochester and the movie left me totally unmoved br br if you want to see a good version of jane eyre i suggest you watch the 1983 bbc version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke or the 1997 version with ciarÃ¡n hinds and samantha morton now these two are brilliant adaptations
<START> i can understand after watching this again for the first time in many years how it is considered one of the worst laurel hardy's for me it isn't as close to as bad as air raid wardens and the bullfighters but there are some definite huge flaws in it the film is set up to show laurel and hardy as the owners and instructors of the dance studio hardy is funny as the prancing lead of a london bridge dance surrounded by 20th century fox starlets while in the next room laurel teaches the beginners ballet while wearing a ballerina outfit a clumsy carpenter spills glue on the floor leading to a predicable gag where hardy ends up the looser then in come the racketeers now selling insurance covering up their protection racket one of them is a very young and handsome robert mitchum but no sooner do they bully the boys into buying insurance they are arrested br br this is the end of the gangsters and the last time we see the dance studio the rest of the film is devoted to laurel and hardy's support of wealthy patron trudy marshall and her inventor boyfriend robert bailey they first try to help them hide their relationship from her disapproving parents matt briggs and margaret dumont and hopeful suitor allan lane whom we can tell right off is a no good swine this leads to briggs' hidden bar being revealed to tea totaling dumont and a gag where a rug is literally pulled out from the wealthy patriarch which crashes his bed into a pond below when bailey uses the boys to help display his ray gun pandemonium ensues the dead pan butler announces to case and dumont that their house is on fire br br later hardy wants to use the insurance policy to gain money to pay their dance studio rent and hopes to get laurel to break a leg to do so there is no reference to the fact that the insurance salesmen were gangsters and that the policy would probably be invalid even if they were to have become legitimate insurance salesman after being arrested their licenses would have been revoked laurel ends up getting off a bus which had been abandoned by the driver over a supposedly rabid dog only a frosting covered cake devouring toto look alike or possibly the actual pooch causing oliver to end up on a huge beach roller coaster that somehow the bus has ended up on perfectly fitting its wheels onto the tracks roller coaster gags can be exciting as evidenced in abbott and costello go to hollywood and this one is amusing but anticlimactic br br as the story wraps up all of these gags seem to have no point giving the impression that this was simply a series of one reelers put together to make a full length feature hopefully part of a double bill l h as i've mentioned in other reviews of their later films had lost much of their luster after leaving hal roach's employ but surprisingly here they do not come off as old and tired looking as they had in films made in the same year had the gags not been as amusing as was the case with some of their other films this surely would have ranked a 2 as opposed to a 3
<START> they had such potential for this movie and they completely fall flat in the first cruel intentions we are left wondering what motivated the lead characters to become the way they are and act the way they do there is almost no character development whatsoever in this prequel it's actually a very sad story but this film did nothing for me it was as if they left out good writing in place of unneeded f words and the end makes absolutely no sense and doesn't explain anything the writing was just terrible another thing that bothered me was that they used at lease 3 of the exact same lines that were in the original such as down boy or the kissing scene and a few others i can't remember i was not impressed at all by robin's acting but amy did a great job that's about the only thing that reconciled this movie
<START> i think the opening 20 minutes of this film is perhaps one of the most exciting filmed with the brilliant music score working to build tension to a shattering climax what cinema goers made of this in the 30s i can only imagine the 'times' said at the time 'a miracle has come to the screen ' watch it and marvel
<START> i was very moved by the story and because i am going through something similar with my own parents i really connected it is so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing was once vibrant and passionate and then there's the mistakes they made and have to live with i loved ellen burstyn's performance and who is christine horne she's fantastic a real find there is probably the most erotic scene i've ever seen in a film yet nothing was shown it was just so beautifully done overall the look and feel of the film was stunning a real emotional journey cole hauser is very very good in this picture he humanizes a man spiraling downwards i liked the way the filmmaker approached this woman's life never sentimental never too much just enough to hook us in but not enough to bog down
<START> after finally watching walt disney's song of the south on myspace i decided to watch ralph bakshi's response to that movie coonskin on afro video which i linked from google video in this one during the live action sequences preacherman charles gordone takes his friend sampson barry white with him to pick up pappy scatman crothers and randy philip thomas years before he added michael for his middle name professionally as the latter two escape from prison during their attempt pappy tells randy a tale of brother rabbit voice of thomas brother bear white and preacher fox gordone and their adventures in harlem as expected in many of these bakshi efforts there's a mix of animation and live action that provides a unique point of view from the writer director that is sure to offend some people another fascinating animated character is miss america who's a big as in gigantic in every way white blonde woman dressed in skin tight red white and blue stars and stripes who has a hold on a little black man and has him shot in one of the most sexually violent ways that was shockingly funny to me there are plenty of such scenes sprinkled throughout the picture of which another one concerning brother bear's frontal anatomy also provided big laughs from me there's also a segment of a woman telling her baby of a cockroach she was friends with who left her that was touching with that part seeming to be a tribute to the comic strip artist george herriman i was also fascinated hearing grover washington jr 's version of ain't no sunshine heard as part of the score most compelling part of the picture was seeing the scatman himself depicted with his head in silhouette during the opening credit sequence singing and scatting to a song that has him using the n word in a satirical way when i saw a vhs cover of this movie years ago it had depicted brother rabbit in insolent mode in front of what looked like the warner circles with the slogan this movie will offend everybody that is ample warning to anyone who thinks all cartoons are meant for children that said i definitely recommend coonskin to fans of bakshi and of every form of animation
