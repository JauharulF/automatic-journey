<START> although cameron grant was clearly hired to replace andrew blake over at ultimate pictures when the latter started his own company studio a he practically outdid the master right out of the gate when it came to setting up steamy sex scenes so while all the window dressing blake had pioneered starlets in fetish lingerie and sun glasses coiffed and made up as if they're about to hit the catwalk remained very much present and accounted for grant added his own personal spin to the carnal content in doing so he raised the heat to a level that had eluded big a ever since his first Â and imho best Â film night trips cam's maiden effort elements of desire might still have been handicapped by an overly slavish adherence to the blake aesthetic with a surfeit of girl on girl gropes but his subsequent dinner party already shows him at the top of his form in what must surely rank as his masterpiece br br the title spells out the premise as a group of well to do friends and acquaintances gather over dinner to swap sexy stories with an extended orgy at the conclusion scrumptious juli ashton and tammy parks smear food stuff all over each other's flawless physiques in their kitchen sequence that is sure to delight those with a taste towards combining pleasures of the palette with those of the flesh busty crystal gold here catalina was rarely more than a reliable second stringer adding spice to several ona zee bargain basement noirs yet looks absolutely stunning here in a romantic four poster frolic with fabio lookalike vince voyeur beautiful blondes kylie ireland and yvonne making out with marc davis for the record the latter two were an item at the time under a waterfall complete the eye candy section of the movie br br time to get cooking early jenna jameson daisy back then foreshadows the greatness to come as she drains frank towers mark slade on his subsequent shift to the gay side of the industry of all vital juices albeit with a little help from brunette diva for effective contrast the scene's stylish industrial setting providing an atmospheric backdrop to the full tilt sex taking place impossibly hunky construction worker gerry pike seeks to cool off on a sweltering summer day by hosing down a prospect too tantalizing for prim 'n' proper business woman asia carrera at her all time most achingly pretty to pass up best of show must be the imaginative sequence that has nasty norma jeane and handsome sean michaels teasing the pants off each other Â for starters Â while separated by a glass partition right until the predictably splashy conclusion br br with sex that proves either artsy or hot and more often than not both grant has concocted a veritable smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord of fleshy wares to continue the film's gastronomic analogy the title implies couples may be the prime intended audience but an alternation between naughty 'n' nice should rightfully include that something for everything recipe so many adult features are aiming for acting as his own dop the director shows great eye for detail like the shot of asia carrera's pristine white shoes being spattered with mud enriching his vision this marks him out as a great filmmaker rather than a merely serviceable one as was the case with nick steele who stepped up to take his place at ultimate Â effectively making him a replacement's replacement Â when he packed up for greener pastures
<START> after apprehending the man responsible for the murder of his boss deputy sheriff thomas jefferson geronimo iii is assigned the task of taking the killer back to italy on the way however the plane is diverted to malta not long after landing the killer escapes now and with little help from the maltese police deputy sheriff geronimo is out to recapture a murderer but will his shoot first take names later brand of texas justice work in a foreign country br br let me get this out right up front i've seen final justice both with and without the mystery science theater 3000 commentary i've seen the scenes that were cut that help make the movie a more coherent whole and i've seen the cut up tv version that was used for mst3k having said that i've got to admit that i much prefer the mst3k version why because final justice is one lousy movie the mst3k commentary helps make it much more palatable on its own it's a real snoozer of an action movie with corny dialogue often delivered with such thick italian accents that it's impossible to understand bad acting weak direction gigantic plot holes and most everything else you'll find in a bad movie and if most of final justice wasn't so bad it's good it would be one terribly dull movie on top of everything else so yes i enjoy the often very funny mst3k commentary over the bad movie on its own br br my main sticking points with the mst3k commentary and with most of the reviews i've read on final justice however involve the criticisms of joe don baker the main weaknesses in baker's performance actually have nothing to do with his size or the wardrobe choices of his character or any of the other jokes flung in his direction instead i think much of it is has to do with the poor decision to cast him in the lead in the first place joe don baker has always struck me as a decent enough actor but he's not the kind of guy i would call an action hero by any stretch of the imagination he's more of a sidekick as he demonstrated with solid performances in a couple of james bond movies or if you really want to blame someone for the problems with final justice point your finger at director greydon clark clark's resume can't begin to compare with baker's so i say lay off joe don baker
<START> peter jacksons version s are better films overall from objective point of view that being said they are not my favorite screen versions of lord of the rings and let me explain why br br firstly the acting of the on screen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with jackson's lotr the whole cast is too run of the mill are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of ralph bakshi version are better actors than real people one could ask well they are not really silly save for hobbits later about them and they certainly pack more personality than jackson's party even with much more limited dialogue time and that is because of superior voice acting of the bakshi's lotr take aragorn for example in this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authority aragorn the lord and with a seasoned rasp aragorn the ranger this is due to john hurt's brilliant voice acting compare that to viggo mortensen's rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven hurt beats mortensen hands down br br and then there is gandalf probably the most dominating and the most popular character in the whole saga in this bakshi version gandalf william squire is a real wizard and by that i don't mean he shoots bolts from his fingertips he does not but his presence is just captivating he is a mystical powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease add to that his looks tall old as the ancient oak beard long as his body sharp eyes wizardy hook nose and of course the classical wizard hat a perfect gandalf just like in the books ian mckellen's gandalf in the other hand is simply just too boring he looks too human sounds too human acts too human and wears no hat or wields no sword yes a sword in this bakshi version gandalf scores couple of bloody orc kills with his sword as he did in the books and those are stylish slow motion kills gandalf is not a power to be messed with and it must be noted that while i'm sad to say this the great christopher lee didn't bring saruman alive fraser kerr in this movie did even with a very limited screen time and lines br br before i move completely to visual aspects of the movie it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presenation of the orcs are also superior to jackson's pretendeous bad guys bakshi's orcs taunt their enemies or each other constantly with growls screams and nasty language they are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion and finally the black riders or the nazgul those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one not just some riders wearing black and they speak with haunting voice which mesmerizes their victim my favorite scene in the film is when the nazgul are chasing frodo near the river while peter jackson couldn't do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thundering sky br br but as much i like this film more than jackson's the latter are if only technically still better and that is because of some key visuals as you know bakshi lotr features a mixture of animated characters all hobbits and the main cast and real actors covered with paint i don't really have a problem using real people in animation this way but they just don't fit very well with traditional cartoon figures this is especially true with humans riders of rohan tavern people etc orcs are different matter since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters orcs while played by humans with animation mix look far superior to jacksons version they have brownish green skin shiny red eyes flat face and pointed teeth br br biggest screw up in this films visuals howerver are the hobbits while i prefer almost every character in bakshi version compared to jackson the latter has clearly superior hobbits in fact they are perfect with bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn humanoid disney bambies and you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them so be warned again the voice acting is ok with them too but the actors mouths cannot save the immersion damage made by these little weasels well i never really liked those halflings anyway br br general failures in the bakshi script are well known limited playing time with limited budget and a lot of missing scenes so while this film covers nearly half of the story it doesn't do it in extensive detail compared to jackson's version br br in a summary the ralph bakshi version of lotr has a superior br br overall atmosphere it feels more like middle earth overall voice acting music i really dig the fantasy score by kont rosenman gandalf aragorn one of the john hurt's finest roles king theoden orcs black riders elrond he's not some fairy hippie in this one br br while jackson version is better br br because it covers the whole story overall visuals and special effects gollum smeagol balrog hobbits br br lord of the rings by ralph bakshi even with it's well known shortcomings is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of tolkien's fantasy world very well if not perfectly i'll give it a score of 8Â½ out of 10
<START> this is a film that was very well done i had heard mixed reviews while it was in production and have been waiting for its release cheers to the director and all the actors the supporting cast gave eva mendez what she needed to take this to the top as everyone else here states the latter portion of the film is riveting katie cassidy did an amazing job with her character being she had not done a lot of work when this film was made she has quite the career ahead of her i was amazed at her performance i completely enjoyed the film questioned my values in life and priorities and am a better person for it a great message lies within the film release it so all can enjoy
<START> like most people i was intrigued when i heard the concept of this film especially the film makers were then attacked aspect that the case seems to emphasize what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob br br then to watch the film and discover oh what they mean by the film makers were attacked was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said someone should beat those two kids up the picture on the cover the chase as it were total fabrication which i guess ties in with the theme of the film lying and manipulation to satisfy vain stupid children with more money and time then sense br br i have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film it's like michael moore's roger me but if roger me was moore mocking the people of flint it's completely misdirected and totally inane wow can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited to have markets full of food what jerks and it's not so much look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah since it wasn't just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors it was that as many people in the film say the prices were absurdly low someone mentions that they should've known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck that's not proving anything except that people who are poor will go to a store that has low prices bravo fellas way to stick it to the people on the bottom br br way to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people you should be very proud how about for your next movie you make a documentary about iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then say haha no such house exists your so stupid and loved to be lied to by the media br br morgan please like me spurlock unleashed this wet fart of a film and it's no surprise since spurlock as one hit wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of him br br avoid like the plague
<START> boris and bela do well together in this film whether they are against each other or paddling the same boat i saw this one in 1972 and just purchased it from borders this year this time watching it with my children i took note of 2 things it held the attention of a 3 4 and 5 year old and i caught a few things i hadn't when i first watched it very swift story with an unpredictable end a must for movie buffs
<START> this film started out very promising with the story about a director who loses his sight and a blind woman who is bound to help him however somewhere in the middle it seemed like the script writers didn't know where to go from there br br one unbelievable event followed the next russia must be very small because they are all bumping into each other all the time the motivation of the female lead character comprehensible why does she still follow him after they got off the ship why doesn't she try to borrow a mobile phone on the ship to call somebody the side stories were completely ridiculous was the story with the mother and the boyfriend supposed to be funny and what was the story with the younger sister about still with all this seeming arbitrariness of the plot the movie managed to be completely predictable br br the saddest thing about it is that there was a lot of potential as i said the idea of the film was good the visuals and the score were very beautiful and the actors of the main characters were good too so this could have been a really good film but it wasn't
<START> this one has a lot going for it sinatra styne cahn pamela britten and a lesser amount of dross iturbi grayson plus a little ho hum kelly it was sinatra's first real movie where the producer's spent a buck and you could see it on screen previously he'd appeared in two low budgeters higher and higher and step lively but if they'd only relied on the sinatra pipes and deep sixed grayson's plus iturbi's ego tripping piano spots we'd have been left with a much tighter movie and a better showcase for sinatra as it is he scores heavily in all his songs from the two duets with kelly we hate to leave i begged her to his own solos what makes the sunset the charm of you and i fall in love too easily despite this step lively remains the best sinatra musical of the forties on one tenth the budget
<START> unhinged is one strange little film a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre it's hard to really write a satisfying review of this film simply because of the fact that the film is so unique it's plot is fairly overdone three young women on their way to a rock concert get in a car crash and end up stranded at the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter very quickly the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic on top of that the mother and daughter seem to have a very very strange relationship as they quarrel intensely in front of their houseguest at dinner the old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and slut and accuses her of sneaking guys in at night to sleep with them halfway through the film when one girl finally decides she better wander off to find help the killing begins br br as far as the acting goes this film is at the bottom of the barrel none of the three stranded girls can act particularly the lead girl it is almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same wooden tone throughout the film the mother and daughter are better but not much the film is also quite dull in parts and really really drags the killings are gruesome but nothing we haven't seen before however as mentioned on here the film really gains points with it brilliantly disturbing and gory ending it comes totally from left field and has the same shock value as the ending the the camp classic sleepaway camp unfortunately the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from horrendous acting and boring boring pacing the isolated creepy looking mansion and the dark foreboding lighting does give the film a grainy realism but that is quickly shattered when one of the characters attempts to act it may be worth it if you can stick it out until the end but i say you are better off just fast forwarding to the last 10 minutes 4 out 10
<START> first off to get my own personal feelings out of the way let me start by saying that i hate so called comedies where every single character is written and played as being so stupid that you wounder if they're all the result of inbreeding br br now i will say this i did see the first three american pie movies and while they weren't the most amazing movies that i'd ever seen they were all right and outright masterpieces compared to the three american pie presents films i still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie br br i also have a few other questions too br br who thought that this was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources br br who approved the final script and what was that person smoking when they approved it br br and lastly why did anyone think that it deserved to be released into theaters where the average cost of admission is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on where you live when it should have gone straight to the discount bin at blockbuster or wal mart br br there is so much wrong with this movie that i can't write a really comprehensive review of it because it would exceed the maximum allowed words on this forum so i'll just touch on the biggest things wrong with it br br the plot is generic uninspired and stupid and characters are all about as interesting as watching paint dry for eighty minutes but the biggest thing that i can see wrong with this movie is the acting br br while most of the cast are talentless no namers who will probably be forgotten in a few years br br the one and only big name in this movie is eugene levy who spends almost all of the time he is on screen with this knowing smirk on his face that says to the viewer i know this isn't funny and i'm wasting my talents but hey i'm getting payed for it so who cares he doesn't even try to make any of his jokes funny he really deserves better than this garbage br br as i mentioned above most of the rest of the cast are horrible even though some of them have been in some really great tv shows tyrone savage from the classic canadian series wind at my back plays a character who is so unbearable unlikeable and irritating there are things that he could teach to tropical skin diseases that you almost wish he'd die a slow and painful death on screen christopher mcdonald ncis law order just hangs around on screen and wastes what talent he does have by being in this film br br maybe the next film in this series will just be a soft core porn with a story line so they can get around the mpaa and get an r rating this movie goes all out with pointless nudity vulgarity and pointlessly offencive sexual content that it should have gotten the x rating the ratings board must have been drunk or on drugs when they reviewed this film for its rating br br it's interesting that twenty five years ago when wes craven submitted a nightmare on elm street to the mpaa for a rating review they forced him to cut twenty five seconds of footage i believe that it was part of a death scene that had a silicone casting of a breast in it to avoid getting an x rating and he had no other choice but to do it or the film wouldn't have been released br br but this kind of needlessly offensive trash can get the r rating today because it's all done in the name of comedy if this movie was a drama or horror film with this kind of content there would have been a huge stink over the content and it would havegotten the dreaded x rating br br the last thing that really annoys me is the writing this movie is written to play out like the wet dream of some twelve year old kid with an extremely overactive sexual imagination its quite juvenile and extraordinarily crass nearly every expository situation that is supposed to move the corpse that this movie calls a plot along is so telegraphed that any intelligent viewer can see it coming a mile away and and the so called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes never mind the often repulsive sexual references and constant unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior it feels like this film was written by some incompetent first year hack in a low rent film school script writing class br br the long and short of it is its time to kill this series before it gets any stupider more crass and offensive this pie is filled with road apples
<START> if you fast forward through the horrible singing you will find a classic fairy tale underneath christopher walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role his trademark style of acting works well for the sly puss in boots the other actors are well for their parts i did not find any of the acting terribly fake or awkward the king in particular appears a real dunce though and i wonder if he is supposed to be i can not remember the original tale the special effects are typical of the eighties but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see today overall i recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child at heart
<START> this film appears to draw a borderline on one side those who love it on the other those who find it unbearable br br to begin with there is an awful lot of comedy in this film that many viewers are not getting of course jet li's mask looks like bruce lee's kato he's supposed to it's a joke the guy who has a time bomb sewn to his heart outrageous of course it's a joke some readers will probably ask if this film is supposed to be so funny why all the excessive and gory violence well for one thing the tolerance for this level of violence is actually different from culture to culture and while hong kong audiences would recognize this violence is extreme it's certainly only slightly more than average for a hk action film br br also black mask is really the kind of film that takes a genre's conventions and pushes them to extremes simply because the conventions themselves are wholly unrealistic after decades of watching people get shot without any noticeable open wounds many people were horrified to see bonnie and clyde and the outlaws of the wild bunch spurting blood all over the place but the fact is when you're shot with rapid metal projectile it's almost certain that blood will spurt especially from an artery br br this film is a chinese comic book movie it is true that the spiderman films never get this gory but if they were faithful to reality they would be well despite its comic book origins this film is faithful to reality br br the only complaint i have is the flashy over stylized filming and editing if the makers of this film had shot it with an eye to hollywood style nostalgia as e g the rocketeer or the recent sky captain film i doubt anyone would have found it offensive br br but as it stands i still had a lotta fun watching this movie
<START> it would help to know why it took so long for a book as movie ready' as the house next door to be adapted for film or television the book was copyrighted in 1978 one reason could be problems designing 'the house' the house in this lifetime film is really so ugly that i can't imagine anyone buying it in fact it's so ugly that someone would probably have come and destroyed it as soon as it was built br br i'm not crazy about horror genre books but this one was hard to put down when i came across it around ten years ago the main characters are not the kind of people to look for anything occult in life and this is one of the book's strengths they are not people who would conclude that the architect was some type of demon or the devil personified without witnessing and analyzing the events described so well in the book however it is a downbeat book for the most part and i don't think that appeals to the people who run lifetime maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in years to come a better house better music a better screenplay and darker lighting would certainly help
<START> a longtime fan of bette midler i must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads a literal rainbow of emotion and talent bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire as well as new songs from the bette of roses album spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone the one and only divine diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around
<START> hello there br br this is my first post in imdb even though i use it as a reference for quite a while i would therefore like to salute you all the fact that i am a greek is inevitably going to affect my judgement i hope not to your annoyance br br i spent 2 years of my life all we greeks did actually analysing omirus epos and not homers as you see everywhere rhyme by rhyme if i recall well it was iliada iliad on 8th grade and odysseia odyssey on 9th grade warner's troy was a big disappointment to me and my fellow greeks around the campus i study in the uk br br iliad epos is one of the very best literature works ever made it was composed by a greek poet omirus a whole 400 years after the actual war historians put trojan war around 1200 bc and the actual reason of the war not being helen's beauty but the strategically crucial position of troy that said one may now understand that omirus epos is not presenting the actual events as it's not accurate historically but this was never the purpose of this work br br reading this huge poem one can find himself wondering for the very definitions of honour love anger hate heroism discipline loyalty and so on the best part and the most educational as well were these prolonged talks between the warriors before the battle none of these though were revealed in 'troy' br br warner's troy was really cheap to my eyes and to other intellectual people english finnish and german colleagues of me as well it is a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario by the way perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster computers graphics did the whole work and yet it is wolfgang petersen's best work br br i conclude saying that you'd better watch something else instead i would give troy 2 out of 10 it is a really expensive b movie br br cheers br br alex

<START> a french film ester williams would love but the synchronized swimming was only a hook for the story of three girls in a paris exurbia finding themselves no question where sciamma's sympathies lie as all the boys are depicted as animaux but actually only the 3 girls are in focus and for the entire time with the few adults and the other adolescents being mostly in the background marie is a stick of a girl unattractive but determined she wants to be a swimmer and forces herself on floriane a renascence quality beauty per one reviewer and she is also a friend of convenience to anna not unattractive but for her the time of her body's perfection was short and now she is an adolescent in a women's body what ensues is a journey to self realization without a road map but there is a glumness about the three that is un natural where is the gaiety and mindless chatter of youth while the dÃ©nouement was breath taking with floriane's self absorption beautifully portrayed as well as the equally beautiful union of marie and anne it all seemed abstract sciamma's puppets
<START> i absolutely loved this movie when i was a kid i cried every time i watched it it wasn't weird to me i totally identified with the characters i would love to see it again and hope i wont be disappointed pufnstuf rocks i was really drawn in to the fantasy world and to me the movie was loooong i wonder if i ever saw the series and have confused them the acting i thought was strong i loved jack wilde he was so dreamy to an 10 year old when i first saw the movie not in 1970 i can still remember the characters vividly the flute was totally believable and i can still 'feel' the evil woods witchy poo was scary i wouldn't want to cross her path
<START> this is a dumb movie maybe my judgment wouldn't be so harsh if the film didn't promise so much but i just felt like this movie cheated and played me for a fool at every turn br br i didn't have any beef with the acting but i thought the characters were awful the movie starts off with clive owen's character telling us what a criminal mastermind he is and how he planned the perfect bank robbery something he frequently reminds us of later oh yeah he also tells us he's in a prison cell although that turns out to be a dumb metaphor any idiot knows that the best bank robbery is one where a minimum number of things could potentially go wrong and you're long gone before the police show up but clive owen's scheme requires hanging around the bank for hours for no reason but to stalk around and look scary as far as i can tell he also has to control hostages negotiate with cops and most fantastically of all perform a this old house job on the bank's stockroom and hide out there for a week i hope he brought enough food and a bucket to pee in and then sneak out again yeah that sure sounds like the perfect crime to me clive this plan has so many moving parts that the only reason it didn't fall apart was the screenwriter said so br br and then there are the many unexplained details why were the cops so convinced that the crooks had accomplices among the hostages who the hell is jodie foster's character and why is she so important that she has the mayor at her beck and call and she doesn't have to tell denzel washington her agenda because it's above his pay scale how dumb are these cops that they can't figure out one guy speaking in a foreign language for hours is not the sound of a criminal gang planning a robbery how did the robbers slip away and why did clive owen stick around for a week how did they find out about the bank chairman's past and the number and contents of his safe deposit box why the hell would clive owen let in jodie foster or the cops since when do they make toy ak 47s that look real up close how the hell do you bug a pizza box anyway how did clive owen manage to sneak out of a secure area of the bank during working hours undetected did this dispassionate criminal really feel bonded enough to this cop denzel to slip him a diamond br br none of these questions are ever answered there are films that achieve depth by leaving you to wonder about events that happen off screen but i never felt that way about inside man it felt like the scenes that explained these things were cut from the movie or these questions never had any answers in the first place and that's weak particularly annoying is jodie foster's character who won't disclose what she does but never seems to tire of reminding us how important she is we're just supposed to take her word for it i guess br br the only reason i gave this movie two stars is i laughed at denzel's taxi cab and pina colada gags and at the kid's outrageous video game other than that this movie has no redeeming features
<START> ok this one's a weirdy honestly i can't tell you all the inner plot points of the beast cuz i started losing interest when nothing happened during the first 45 or more minutes but just wait it definitely does pick up br br the plot involves something about a monster in the woods that some french aristocrat chick screwed back in the day eventually you see the beast which looks like a guy dressed in a giant rat bear costume with a horse cock attached to it the scene takes place with the aristocrat woman running around the forest looking for a lost sheep the sheep ends up dead and the woman gets scared the beast pops up rapes the chick and shoots 400 gallons of spunk all over her eventually the chick starts to enjoy the beast's attention which results in some pretty novel simulated sex scenes including an unnervingly erotic foot masturbation scene where the woman jerks the beast off with her feet while the monster shoots more huge loads everywhere yeah i've got a twisted foot fetish so sue me the whole film is told in flashbacks and long winded dialog scenes that tended to be a bit tedious a shocking but predictable ending concludes this extremely strange film br br the beast is a film that i find kind of hard to rate the cinematography itself is quite eye catching and the sets costumes and locations are elaborate the plot is a little convoluted and seems to take it self awfully seriously for what ends up being such an unintentionally hilarious film about a chick boning a rat bear a good bit of tits ass and hairy 70's french bushes to help make up for the dull first half of the film i have to honestly say that if it weren't for the graphic scenes of the beast spackling all over the willing maiden this film would have been a real bore that is unless you like dull dialog and some graphic horse sex the beginning has a very up close and personal scene of two horses boning including a pulsating and spunk covered female horse vagina yum but the beast sex scene is so strange and such a refreshing change from the rest of the film that i have to say that those scenes alone make up for what otherwise would have been a real snoozer i have to recommend this one to anyone who thinks they've seen it all the beast rape really is out there and something to be witnessed also recommended to any fans of 70's 80's sleaze films this one ranks pretty high with them worth a look for you sick rat bear beastiality lovers out there like me 8 10
