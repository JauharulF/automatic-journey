<START> you have to respect this movie it may be just a dumb kid's movie but it's the 1 most frequently requested film title in online movie forums requested by people who remember the story but can't remember the title therefore what follows is a much needed detailed plot description since i haven't been able to find such a description anywhere else on the internet br br a typical 2 story house is shown in suburbia 7 year old bridget narrates about suspecting something is going on since she and her 11 year old brother andrew are getting presents from their parents for no apparent reason bridget's present is a stuffed penguin that she immediately names sweet william bridget describes her relatives aunt ruth a bossy nurse taking care of grandmother grams the hugging grandmother who makes dolls out of socks and her brother andrew who's into electronics and is grumpy grams accidentally hangs up on the lieutenant governor which indicates she's getting in the way while living with the family the two children eat breakfast while the adults discuss moving grams to a retirement home bridget makes an awful looking pancake sandwich containing cereal eggs bacon strawberries and syrup as andrew looks on incredulously the two kids then discuss grams and andrew says bluntly that grams is being put out to pasture bridget talks with grams in the attic has a play tea party with sweet william in her bedroom then a living doll unexpectedly pops out of her bedroom closet mirror br br bridget and the living doll become acquainted the curly haired living female doll is named huggins and lives in huggaland bridget gives huggins a baseball cap from andrew's room huggins hides under some laundry when bridget's mother comes by then the mother throws the laundry into the washing machine with huggins in it bridget rescues huggins and dries her off with a hair drier they discuss the problem with grams getting old and having to move away huggins says bridget could talk to the bookworm in huggaland about it since he knows everything they step through the mirror to visit huggaland but one of bridget's tennis shoes becomes lodged in the mirror br br rather than walk around with one shoe bridget goes without shoes in huggaland they immediately meet hugsy a curly haired living boy doll in huggaland huggins gives hugsy the baseball cap they also meet tickles bubbles impkins and tweaker and all the dolls sing a song while sitting on a bridge hugsy takes bridget and huggins in his hugwagon to see the bookworm who lives atop a stack of giant books the bookworm consults the old encyclopedia and finds that old age can be cured by eating the fruit of the youngberry tree however only one such tree exists and it's in the country of shrugs ruled by the mad queen of quartz the only way to travel to shrugs is to jump down a deep hole that is located inside a nearby giant book br br bridget and the two dolls gulp three times jump down the hole and tumble out soon they walk down a sideways sidewalk hear the sea of glass breaking and fall off the sidewalk when the sideways gravity ends they encounter the hairy behemoth which looks like a mastodon has four tusks and breathes fire out its trunk but hugsy boldly goes over and hugs the behemoth who thereby turns into a baby elephant whose name is hodgepodge hodgepodge had been under a spell by the queen and owes hugsy a favor so they all ride on hodgepodge's back to the castle they enter the castle are surrounded by troll like beings the queen queen admira comes and bridget asks for a few youngberries the queen refuses then eats one for herself and brags about her own youthful good looks while looking in a hand mirror hodgepodge faints when the queen says he should be digested the queen is upset when bridget mentions that wicked witches should have warts so the queen freezes bridget and orders the three others to be taken to the dungeon but the queen carelessly leaves the key to the youngberry tree's dome by the lock to the dome lifting apparatus br br hodgepodge wakes up in the dungeon and uses his noodle trunk to pull the jail's door down thereby freeing himself and the two dolls with him they find bridget standing petrified the dolls hug her which causes bridget to be revived before they flee bridget finds the left behind key to the youngberry tree dome lifts the dome off and they pick some glowing youngberries and put them in a jar the queen catches them but the queen's arm is trapped under the descending dome while reaching for the key that bridget left on the ground the queen suddenly turns very old since she is deprived of the youth giving berries and appears to die soon bridget steps back through the mirror into her bedroom but trips on the bottom of the mirror spilling the berries onto her floor and the berries quickly vanish into smoke one by one her mother calls for her and andrew to say goodbye to grams who is leaving for a retirement home andrew drops his usual grumpy standoffish facade and hugs grams telling her he loves her and that he doesn't want her to go away their father is moved and decides to keep grams there after all and everybody hugs and cries including aunt ruthie who had been the main person pressuring grams to move out br br andrew asks bridget for his st louis cardinals cap bridget starts to explain how she gave it to huggins of huggaland but andrew doesn't want to listen to what he believes are her fantasy stories so he turns around to look for it in her bedroom one of the dolls secretly hands the cap back through the mirror to bridget bridget puts the cap on andrew's head andrew is mystified and leaves her bedroom without saying anything bridget cheerfully waves at the mirror
<START> i am quite the mitchell leisen fan so it was a great anticipation that i rented this movie but the print i got was extremely bad so worn down from use and scorched seemingly beyond repair the movie was so dark so dark that in certain scenes that are cinematographed in the dark you can't see a single thing that said i believe i share the same opinion as the first review of this movie it starts out unusually and does not tote the lines and rhythms of your typical hollywood 30's movie heck not even your typical hollywod movie of any era it seems the director has been influenced by the europeans because there is a certain caustic realism to the proceedings from the opening shot which is so crafted in camera movement and placement as maggie carole lombard and skid fred macmurray meet you half expect them to start singing make believe from show boat it starts with a few laughs and poor anthony in a one scene role where he speaks not a word of english gets slapped around by freddie skids is a bum who doesn't care that he's a bum that's why he signs up in the army where he can hide from the world he's just been released though and in a set of screenplay shenanigans she misses her boat for new york this is when the movie kicks into high gear and we begin to get those french movie of the sixties vibes to the whole proceedings the scenes are so well acted by lombard and cecil cunningham the movie gains a pulse macmurray is good too as he and lombard fall for each other as she nurtures his talent for the trumpet then the temptress arrives in the form of dorothy lamour enough with plot the movie has fantastic montage sequences that dazzled me they are very good and lombard scores a home run in this movie but in the second half a bit more is called of freddie and he fails to deliver the goods with a heavily melodramatic ending and an actor you don't believe the movie falls short but since it is not your typical movie in structure set design and direction it is worth a look for what is what it was one of the 37 hits of the 1936 37 season i don't know its exact rank though
<START> dick tracy is one of our family's favorites the actors are great the art direction is exceptional the music is magic it's not supposed to be to kill a mockingbird it's a fun experience br br stephen sondhemim's songs are stellar back in business is energetic sooner or later is just right what can you lose is haunting even tunes like live alone and like it add to the story br br got to love the giddily over the top performances of al pacino dustin hoffman glenn headly charlie korsmo mandy patinkin james caan dick van dyke supporting villains the list is far too long and yes even madonna and warren beatty are awesome written with a smile a minute how many times have we looked at each other and said wait a minute i'm having a thought it's gone br br however one of most telling things about in this film is that everyone involved seems to be having a good time and that above all adds to the enjoyment for the viewer so if you haven't already why not give dick tracy a chance accept it for what it is a sunday comic strip brought to life and in a wonderful way
<START> trifling romantic drama directed by clint eastwood about the loving relationship which grows between a comely hippie kay lenz and a los angeles real estate agent in his golden years william holden surprisingly affable within this highly concocted arrangement the script is slight but not without some thoughtful passages still the scenario is such a middle aged clichÃ© by now that most of the picture comes off as puerile it may have worked much better with different leads holden and lenz don't match up well her stature is so slight he seems to tower over her making their intimate scenes less stirring than simply uncomfortable dated blurry romantic and mostly unmemorable from
<START> the world of the 1973 sci fi drama soylent green is what we could be seeing if we aren't careful it is a world in which new york city's population has topped the 40 million mark in the year 2022 overpopulation air pollution year long heat waves and food shortages are the rule the only hope comes from a food product called soylent green but what is this particular food stuff really made of that question is at the heart of this admittedly somewhat dated but still intriguing film based on harry harrison's 1966 novel make room make room charlton heston stars as thorne an nypd detective who comes across the murder of a top corporate executive joseph cotten as it turns out cotten was on the board of directors of the soylent corporation the people responsible for all those food stuffs that the people have to consume in lieu of the real thing heston believes that this wasn't just a garden variety murder that cotten was bumped off for a reason he gets a lot of help from his slightly cantankerous but very astute book edward g robinson in his 101st and final cinematic appearance and a few timely reminders of what the world used to be like what robinson finds out about soylent green shocks him beyond all imagination but before he can tell heston all of what he knows he has himself euthanized and when heston does indeed find out the secret of soylent green well that part has become immortalized into cinematic history br br under the very professional guiding hand of director richard fleischer the boston strangler fantastic voyage soylent green is a fairly grim but thought provoking look at a dystopian future that humanity might be living if we don't curb our tendency to strip our planet of its natural resources indeed this was a project that heston himself had had in mind for filming as far back as 1968 after he had struck gold in the sci fi genre with planet of the apes a fact that probably gets lost whenever his ultra conservative political philosophy comes up in conversation after all soylent green is hardly a tract for unrestrained capitalism robinson as always is the consummate professional in his last role the sequence where he is euthanized as he looks at video of the world from a better era set to the music of tchaikovsky beethoven and grieg is quite simply heartbreaking the film also benefits from solid supporting help from chuck connors as a very convincing heavy brock peters as heston's superior and leigh taylor young as the woman who tries to help heston in his inquiries br br it must seem easy these days to dismiss soylent green for being dated but those who do it ought to think twice for this film's world may end up becoming ours in actuality if we don't watch what we do with what we have today
<START> kareena kapoor in a bikini hmmmmmmmm br br akshay kumar br br anil kapoor br br maybe saif br br kareena kapoor in a bikini br br good banner br br kareena kapoor in a bikini br br not one good reason not to see this movie br br or so i thought didnt these people make jbj br br why o why did i forget that br br for all the criticism the first half of the movie isn't that bad br br there is some intrigue and you feel a sort of irritation mixed with excitement that i felt when seeing guy ritchie movies like lock stock and snatch br br kareena kapoor is sizzling in a very skinny model sort of way br br akshay kumar is akshay kumar as only he can be br br anil kapoor is annoying but kind of funny you almost forget that most of the time you cannot understand him br br saif is sidey ala main khiladi once again br br there is the occasional laugh and a few chuckles and a few goosebumps during the kareena saif love story kareena in the rain behind me on my bike hmmmmmmm br br but mostly this half promises more than it delivers br br which makes the second half all the more unbearable br br there was almost a cheer when the interval came not only because because of the wet kareena because of what people thought were the things to come br br instead we were treated to mind numbing torture which is difficult to put in words br br saif suddenly seam like a comic sidekick br br suddenly the sexy kareena looks anorexic you realise that the second last floor is now empty and her face looks to big for her body only girls can notice this and make other guys notice the second last floor was my observation br br anil kapoor and his sidekicks get on your nerves br br akshay kumar is the only one who carries off the madness to some extent but even he become intolerable after a while br br all the while you are subjected to one absurdity after the other br br why what when where what have i done to deserve this br br a collective gasp went trough the audience before every song in the second half which were ordinary even without the movie around it br br cannot relieve the trauma anymore br br conclusion br br this movie starts of as a buzz which you feel could even turn out to a high but ends up slowly moving towards a headache and then rapidly turns into a full blown migraine attack br br please don't watch this movie for any reason other than academic interest br br s cast akshay kumar first half br br s what when how who to much confusion need a book to fill this br br s cast the whole second half need many pages to fill this br br total 3 10 im trying to avoid the 1s and 2s too not seem to extreme but make no mistake this movie is unwatchable no matter how decent the first half is
<START> this is definitely one of jet's best efforts few actors are able to play the stoic as jet li can the action is rapid fire and special effects boosted for intensity purposes as a result it may take americans a little off guard a little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a jet li film i feel that it is an excellent introduction to jet's work and look forward to further masterpieces especially fist of legend making it into the us market a nice mixture of gunplay and physical conflict will satisfy most action flick enthusiasts
<START> rented this one accidentally it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting didn't find out until i got home watched it anyways absolutely fantastic a wonderful movie and one of my top three favorite of all time i recommend it to everyone br br the story is enjoyable and easy to follow this could have been easily messed up but the actors and director do a great job of keeping it together br br the actors themselves are fantastic displaying wonderful character and doing a terrific job br br gotta find a copy somewhere
<START> set during wwii bedknobs and broomsticks is a fun filled fantasy adventure for kids starring angela lansbury as an apprentice witch who with the help of three evacuee children and a 'professor of witchcraft' thwarts a nazi invasion br br brilliantly inventive with loads of laughs this movie will delight kids of all ages with its great characters exciting story and catchy tunes lansbury is perfect as eglantine the not quite perfect witch who takes the three children on the adventure of a lifetime and her three young co stars cindy o'callaghan roy snart and ian weighill are equally impressive as the cockney rascals who aid in battling the nasty hun br br the special effects are somewhat dated but let's face it kids don't care too much about these things so long as they are entertained and entertained they will be with some impressive scenes which brilliantly mix live action and animation to great effect and more genuine movie magic than a hundred harry potters it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinematic escapism in fact only a rather drawn out musical number set in portobello road mars the film's perfection but with so much else to enjoy that can easily be forgiven br br and besides any film featuring uk television legend bruce forsyth as a 'flash' harry style spiv is guaranteed a good rating from me
<START> brendan filone is the absolute best character in the sopranos he died by getting shot in the eye this was the best and well orchestrated scene ever in the sopranos brendan filone is too good brendan filone shall haunt uncle junior in his dreams until uncle junior can't take it anymore brendan filone is the best character brendan filone was killed in episode 3 denial anger acceptance but his legacy will live on forever brendan filone is the best character on sopranos brendan filone is the best character ever i recommend this show to anyone who likes drama and wants to see good death scenes and great directing and producing because it doesn't get any better than this series brendan filone is the best
<START> this film is available from david shepard and kino on the before hollywood there was fort lee nj although that is a shortened version with just the behind the scenes movie sections i'm not sure if blackhawk films only had a film print of these parts or they edited out the other scenes the original blackhawk version was retitled a movie romance the complete feature does survive but the preprint for this version had some nitrate decomposition and a couple of sections looked bad so that may be why blackhawk's version was edited br br directed by maurice tourneur the film has tourneur playing himself or more likely a caricature of himself supposedly director emile chautard and future director joseph von sternberg also can be spotted br br country lass mary doris kenyon longs for a romantic man to sweep her off her feet she dreams of a troubadour that will woo her but is constantly interrupted by the only available local boy johnny applebloom br br meanwhile a film company from new york actually new jersey is filming a western in the countryside mary sees an indian in full headdress and raises an alarm spoiling a scene that the movie company is filming she is immediately attracted to the dashing film star kenneth driscoll robert warwick he encourages her to leave her home and try to become an actress in the big city br br when she arrives at the studio she discovers that everything about the movies is fake the doors and walls are just flats that are hastily assembled for the set that lanky walk of the western hero or the happy skip of the heroine are just acting too the sets are on a big revolving stage so the angle of the sun can even be manipulated the black attendant at the studio signs all the movie stars' autographed photos the signs on the wall say positively no smoking but everybody smokes anyway even the titles of the film which are illustrated nicely emphasize everything fake about the movie making life br br movie star driscoll is just as disenchanted with the ho hum of everyday film making he makes a temporary split from girlfriend vivian june elvidge to pursue this exciting country girl his plans are dashed when mary's screen test is a stinker we don't get to see the actual film but only the audience's pained reactions to it br br mary is devastated but she doesn't want to admit to everyone back home that she was a failure so she continues to see driscoll and we she has lunch with him in the studio cafeteria along with other extras dressed as policemen soldiers cowboys etc br br mary decides to stay with driscoll at a party with their movie friends she agrees to marry him although there is not much love between them surprisingly her mother appears with a cake especially for mary's birthday this causes mary to re evaluate her future br br this film has all kinds of fascinating scenes of studios movie sets dressing rooms editing rooms etc if you've always wondered what went on behind the scenes when a silent film was being made this movie peeks behind the curtain
<START> having not seen the films before and not being able to stand matt damon i was reluctant to go see the bourne ultimatum when we were asked to see it for as film studies br br however i was pleasantly surprised that even a film with damon in it could be enjoyable br br fast fight scenes crazy motorbike chases and big explosions were what threw you out of your seat in tbu the near misses between the cia and bourne kept you on your toes and throughly entertained br br nevertheless several things really grated my cheese br br firstly the fact that the film was just a series of bourne cia bourne cia bourne cia this sequence got repetitive and ultimately dull although damon did keep us entertained and seemed always one step ahead of the cia i was getting a bit annoyed with the constant survival of bourne he crashed a car and got out as if he had tapped it or something very unrealistic br br and secondly inevitably the shaky camera it was so shaky it was completely noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class even the tutors seasick we were told by the tutors that if we ever used that in a film we made in class it would automatically be wrong and we would be told to use a tripod fair enough if greengrass wanted it to look like we were there watching damon and stiles holding a conversation but surely we wouldn't be shaking our heads that violently br br but all in all tbu is an enjoyable film and worth a watch but i didn't think it was the best film of the year despite being an entertaining piece of cinema br br 8 10
<START> my original review of this film was simply the word sh t written 2000 times over although this was a very accurate critique i felt my review should be a little more descriptive br br i will start with the lead actress her facial expression doesn't change once in this film she doesn't show fear happiness or depression her skills in body language pretty much come down to darting her eyes left and right and looking like she don't know jack she is an emotionless husk who i'm guessing has had too much botox her lack of facial expression through out the film is outmatched however by the deplorable love affair with the lead actor which seems to spring out of nowhere and has them making out on a beach and falling in love within a couple of hours of meeting one another the lead actor whose hair demands more attention than he did was mediocre at best and did not once make me feel like he was genuinely in peril br br the only thing that tops the hideous acting is the directing storyline and inaccuracies in plot i have seen tampon ads with more structure than this movie the is no development in character they just seem to say and do things that i could never believe a real person would br br this film would not have been bad if it was trying to be crap on purpose like snakes on a plane but it was trying so hard to be a serious action flick that i couldn't even laugh i believe i now have a brain tumour from watching this film and thinking up all the different ways i could have used that budget and cg team to create something far superior if i bought this on dvd i would smash the dvd to pieces burn it then dissolve it in hydrochloric acid for good measure don't watch this film
<START> once upon a time there was a director by the name of james he brought us wonderfully thrilling science fiction such as terminator and aliens these movies were the stuff blockbusters were made of and he looked to have a fantastic future ahead of him as the dawn of computer generated special effects landed upon the film industry terminator 2 showed gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new era br br and then it happened 1997 countless awards obscene amounts of money outlandish barrage of advertising maximum profit margin titanic was here br br i have never ever been one to jump on the bandwagon and be overly critical for the sake of it in fact i have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just to get an argument going titanic however was a film i only took one single positive out of that of kate winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughout br br quickly the dialogue was like something out of beverly hills 90210 the acting was more wooden than my nephew's tree house images meant to terrify were actually comical man falling from ship and hitting propeller historically false don't even get me started because there's too much it had dire theme music up there with the bodyguard for cheese and the pointless love story was so tedious self absorbing and pathetic that it disrespected the plight of everyone else involved i was glad when he died and disappointed when she did not br br it was plainly obvious from the word go that this picture was designed to appeal to mtv watching bubblegum chewing boy with car chasing teenage girls decaprio himself resembled something less heroic than the weedy member of a boy band who would drag their sex starved boyfriends out for a three and a half hour chick flick hoping to get lucky later the worst aspect was that it did not stop at that point millions of dumbed down culture vultures went to see this expensive waste of celluloid because it cost so much to produce it must be great and steve and barbara said it was good and they know their movies br br the crowning glory arrived when titanic swept the boards at the academy awards king james of hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening on which his three and a half hour farce was based it looked to me as if he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune off inaccurately portraying the circumstances that lead to the death of a lot of people br br however if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of rubbish they deserve to get ripped off good luck to hollywood if that is how they want to make money i'd do it if i had those kind of chances in life br br it is right up there on my all time worst movies list with other silly historically false human interest tripe like the patriot and pearl harbor
<START> san francisco is a big city with great acting credits in this one the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city they didn't even manage the most basic of realistic details so i would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a san francisco movie you will not be thinking oh i've been there you will be thinking how did a two story firetrap stinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby some of the leads used east coast speech styles and affectations it detracts but the acting was always competent br br the stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles at least in the beginning the chinatown story was the most effective and interesting the plot is weak ripped scene for scene from classy hong kong action movies the originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance they were framed and paced better but the acting is fun and we get to see james hong and other luminaries br br the white boy intro was pointless i think the filmmakers didn't know what to do with it so they left it loosely structured and cut it down the father is an odd attempt at a berkeley liberal really folks everyone knows it's not groovy to live in the ghetto but his segments are the most humorous they threw away some good opportunities educated and embittered on the west coast a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in new york they are equally intolerable but always distinguishable that would have been interesting this was not br br the hunter's point intro was the most disappointing it was the most derivative of the three and stylistically the most distant from san francisco you've seen it done before and you've seen it done better even the video game was better br br despite the generic non locality and aimless script these characters have potential the actors have talent and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction about ten minutes before the ending good concept placed in the wrong hands br br ps there is a missing minority here see if you can guess which one
<START> life begins is a wonderful pre code film starring some of the best of the era it is set in the maternity ward of a hospital particularly in the room for the women expected to have trouble in it is an older woman a tough unwed mother glenda farrell a frail young woman an italian woman and the main character loretta young who is spending 20 years in prison for murder her husband eric linden is at the hospital at every second aching to know that everything will be okay aline macmahone plays the nurse who is great at her job br br this film is highly interesting and entertaining it isn't terribly shocking in any way but it is interesting to see such a neglected subject on the silver screen the acting is brilliant all around loretta young is gorgeous here in her prime eric linden comes out of nowhere and is sincere as can be his innocence is reminiscent of michael j fox glenda farrell is great as always a staple of pre codes and for good reason
<START> in 1978 a phenomenon began the release of john carpenter's halloween got people queueing around the block to witness the evil that is michael meyers the critics loved it the world loved it it was imitated and has gone down as one of the greatest movies in cinematic history br br plot 15 years after a murder took place four friends all females are babysitting and having it on with their boyfriends on halloween night after escaping from a hospital the night before michael myers returns to his home town to stalk these people he murders 3 of them silently and subtlety he does not speak he walks slowly he hides br br only one of the friends escapes after being saved by doctor loomis michael's pursuer and doctor br br there is one reason why halloween works so well simplicity we don't know where michael is we don't know why he kills and he frightens us they're the only reasons why we are afraid br br john carpenter wrote the movie and directed he builds unbearable tension throughout the story and scares to such a degree that sometimes we cannot watch and the climax is truly startling br br as horror this is essential it is terrifying and well acted it is also mysterious michael is a force not a human a force that cannot be denied br br the sequels focused too much around michael and his history this movie focuses on the fear of the unknown perhaps that's why this thing is a masterpiece
<START> i had been looking forward to seeing dreamgirls for quite a while what with all it's raving reviews nominations and media attention and i must say the first quarter of the movie was good it really portrayed the black music scene back then however as the movie wore on me and my whole family were bored out of our wits the singing just kept coming one after the other i mean seriously just one more music number and it would have broke even with rent br br furthermore i noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters i just didn't care what happened to them even when eddie murphy's character died of a drug overdose i knew i should have been sad but i just couldn't feel any emotion for that character the characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in br br finally the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care which goes along with the lack of character development this movie reminded me of a copy cat movie based on ray chicago and rent ray and chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion overall i think this movie would best suit someone who doesn't really care about an overall story yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances
<START> for me this movie just seemed to fall on its face the main problem for me was the casting of glover as a serial killer i don't know whether this grows out of type casting or simply his demeanor but i doubt glover could ever portray a convincing villain he's a good guy and that's always obvious in his performances other than that the film is your run of the mill serial killer story nothing very innovative
<START> in a not so conventional sense of the word br br this movie was one of my favorites as a young child and i just recently remembered it and thought to look it up while many of the details are no longer clear in my mind the overall feeling that the movie gave me has stuck with me over the years br br if parents feel that their children can handle mature and sometimes violent themes then i highly recommend this movie it taught me a lot about life and death and brought forth in me a lot of emotion to this day it remains one of my favorite films
