<START> first off let me say i have wanted to see this movie for about a year now because i knew angelina jolie was in it and i love her but my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie anyhow no video stores carried it but low and behold the local library did i watched it and absolutely loved it yes there were italian stereotypes but it was done well and funny it was not degrading in any way br br every actor and actress did a superb job i laughed very hard at the sexual humor overall i think this movie is well worth seeing if you can find it it is adorable and just plain fun to watch i rarely rank movies as a 10 but i give this one a 10 br br go find it and watch it
<START> first one has to take into account the time period this film was made in 1995 rappers were in it and that added to the flair of it br br remy was a socially awkward teen trying to find his way and couldn't until he met and was befriended by nazis they took him in nazi's aren't all this awkward but like most gangs they fill a void that is missing be it economic social emotional whatever michael rappaport played the part perfectly br br omar epps was the hot shot track star with a questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder he kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his plight and had his girlfriend and professor to straighten him out on it br br kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in until she was date raped she then found her self experiment with her sexuality and getting involved politically br br this film deals with racism and like most things that deal with racism people's own perspectives come into play br br i read so many comments about how there were no 'evil' black characters but there were evil white one nazis so what remy wasn't portrayed as evil at all he was trying to find his way and kept failing until some skinheads accepted him he was scared it was sad to see him devolve how he did he even says right before he kills himself i didn't mean it i wanted to be an engineer br br ice cube and busta rhymes were angry black men ice cube was somewhat of an intellectual and busta rhymes was just portrayed as a dumb thug they both showed no consideration at all for their roommates and generally appear to not like white people very much they were angry like the nazis but not on the level of nazis in terms of overall badness sorry if this makes it seem unfair but are there really black groups like the nazis no br br people say it shows white bad black good not true the only bad white characters were the nazis and the police which is more or less true in real life kristen was a good girl her boyfriend omar epps roommate was a good guy and even remy was a good guy he was just misguided br br omar epps ice cube and busta were seriously flawed characters angry and inconsiderate although their constant harassment by police seemed to justify some of their anger remy's inability to fit in seemed to justify his anger as well br br good movie well done like all movies that deal with racism its a great piece to get a discussion going br br i don't think cube and busta coulda beat those nazis though
<START> the matador is a strange film its main character julian played with an unusual mix of charm and unbalance by brosnan is not your typical hero julian is a hit man who is experiencing a late mid life crises having spent 22 years in the profession of cold blooded murder he now finds himself stressed out and desperately lonely and so after a chance meeting at a bar with danny greg kinnear he latches on and begins a halting awkward friendship danny the quintessential nice guy is dealing with some stuff in his own life and truth be told could use a friend as well the two make an unexpected connection and danny sticks around to hear julian's story even after learning the unsavory truth about julian's work br br matador approaches a subject not completely unheard of in cinema the anti hero assassin films like 'assassins' and 'grosse pointe blank' come to mind but matador differs in several key ways first of all the killing and gore is implied but never really shown in any detail meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an adrenaline rush this movie will probably disappoint you and second unlike most anti hero films matador makes no attempt to show remorse and redemption from its main character julian's job is simply presented as an 'it is what it is' kind of thing this is unusual given that 99 99 of us would consider killing for money horrific and yet this unorthodox approach is perhaps what makes the film feel authentic although we don't like to admit it almost anything could become mundane after we did it long enough maybe even murder did julian's victims deserve to die who is paying to have people killed who knows the movie never deals with these questions the focus is on julian and his stumbling shuffle into a genuine friendship if you read about someone like julian in the paper you would have a passing thought that people like him should be ripped out of society like a cancer but forced to watch his life you are drawn in by his intense humanity sympathy for the devil i guess br br brosnan's take on julian is well done and deeply unsettling he doesn't completely divorce himself from his james bond good looks and smooth charm but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix weird or crude remarks in the middle polite conversations and sudden shifts from suave charm to childish tantrums and sad desperate pleas for acceptance it keeps you guessing about his grasp on his sanity and how it will affect those around him it's a bit like listening to a piano player that occasionally and unexpectedly hits a wrong note while he plays but it works the films only other major role that of danny is not nearly as meaty kinnear turns in a solid if unspectacular performance as a regular joe with a regular joe life and problems br br the film doesn't really have any huge shocks or m night shyamalan twists but i wasn't able to guess the ending and it felt satisfying it doesn't have any deep philosophical or spiritual insights and yet it felt very human and it didn't have any heart pounding car chases or gun battles and yet i thought the pacing was well done and i was never bored maybe the only real message here is about the human need to reach out and make connections with one another and how those needs have no moral prerequisites even a murderer needs friends and even good people can be friends with bad people it's a comment on the strange random world we live in a good film worth seeing
<START> when i first saw this film i thought it should have come from the children's section it's very fun and at times humorous and is actually quite a good story but it severely lacks the romantic chemistry that actors like meg ryan and tim robbins are capable of delivering i must note that walter matthau is perfect for the part of albert einstein and his performance is extraordinary but that's the sole exception this film appears a bit forced the directing lacks substance and oh yeah the music is ridiculously awful it didn't put me in a very good mood but if you are not expecting a smart well crafted comedy romance tale then this certainly can be entertaining like i said it should be in the children's section einstein and his buddies are a good relief from tim robbins' boring almost tense quest to steal meg ryan's heart a very conflicting film but as long as it's not taken seriously this can be an alright movie
<START> this film plays in the 60s and is about an italian family romano his wife rosa and their two children gigi and giancarlo emigrate from solino in italy to duisburg in the ruhr area i like this film because i think it is quite realistic it shows problems which many foreign families have when they come to another country they have to get used to a new culture a new environment and this can be difficult especially if you don't know the language it is difficult for the family but they find a way they open a restaurant which offers typical italian food and it is named solino like their hometown the film also shows different conflicts gigi and giancarlo fall in love with the same girl and although rosa has to work very hard romano refuses to pay money to engage more workers etc etc but stop i don't want to tell you how it goes on you should watch the film yourself it's a nice one i have also made a referat about it and examined scenes which show different cultural attitudes and there are a few
<START> you've heard it said to live every moment as if it's your last whether it's your last day or not i beg you not to waste any part of it watching this nichole hiltz provides some nice moments of eye candy that alas stays wrapped and david deluise shows why he should stick to the small screen or dog food commercials a shallow unrealistic plot with dreadful dialogue means there is no art in the art of revenge br br
<START> this was my second time watching the film via the french language version as opposed to the first which was dubbed in italian and i feel that it improves on subsequent viewings br br a compelling if slowly built up character study that's beautifully shot and with the parisian settings being equally impressive in the long run it's not top grade polanski and i would rank it at number 9 in his filmography but it's still a confident mix of subtle chills and surprisingly often broad comedy it also features a fine cast all of whom are in good form but especially isabelle adjani melvyn douglas and jo van fleet br br even so i'm a bit baffled by the sudden compulsion for trelkovsky to 'change' into the previous tenant apart from the owner of the cafÃ© opposite the apartment building where he is given whatever simone used to have without asking him if he wished any different there is little to indicate as far as i could discern anyway that this is what everybody wanted of him okay so he found simone's belongings still lying in the apartment but what exactly drove him to wear her dresses and make himself up as her even if he apparently started doing this unconsciously following his nightmarish visions in the bathroom the last section of the film where adjani all but disappears is almost anti climactic especially the scene where the landlord and the other tenants witness his attempted suicide as if it were a night at the opera a concept which had already been used 46 years earlier by jean cocteau in the blood of a poet 1930 br br the ending then is at once predictable and unresolved just what made the two occupants of this particular apartment jump out of the window i remember this factor bugging me on first viewing as well and i'm sorry to say it's no clearer now mind you the film's first two thirds are pretty solid but i wish that polanski had been less reliant on obscure plot points throughout
<START> as i understand it after the chinese took over hong kong the infamous cat 3 hong kong movies kind of disappeared at least until now and what an amazing movie this one is i knew it was a rough crime drama going in but being the first cat 3 i've purchased that's been made recently i wasn't sure what to expect br br a cambodian hit man goes to hong kong to knock off the wife of a judge who is also a lawyer turns out the judge made the arrangements for the hit man because she was divorcing the judge and threatening to take all his money this is all known within the first ten minutes so nothing is being given away after the hit the cops locate the hit man pretty fast but in trying to arrest him several police officers and civilians are killed he eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy before he escapes back to cambodia this is a movie that never stops and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath yes it is very violent and intense many cops are killed as the hit man proves very very hard to track and take down when they do locate him along the way the hit man in trying to hide in a dump finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man he helps her and saves her from the guy and she persuades the hit man to take her along with him in his escape i loved this movie it's like a roller coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed as one incident leads to another and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hit man the acting is exceptionally good and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking there's no let up in this movie not even with the very very incredible ending the ending is pretty much unbelievable and also a fitting end to all the action and violence yes the violence is brutal at times but this is a very no nonsense crime drama that will knock your socks off dog eat dog definitely needs a more widespread release including an r1 release for sure great movie highly recommended
<START> would have better strengthened considerably by making it as a br br 50 minute episode of the outer limits too much superfluous material and stuff like the chief bad guy looking like he'd escaped from the phantom of the opera didn't help the whole 'night of the living dead' sequence was extremely silly and quite unnecessary after all if the dead were to punish anyone for their sins now remind me exactly who was killing everyone again
<START> the actors play wonderfully especially kenneth branagh himself it's good that robin williams got the comedy role of osiric otherwise it could be a bit strange to see him in such a production it is really great that kenneth decided to use the fullest version of the text this happens definitely not too often thanks to that the viewers can see the whole not the chosen by the director parts also thank god that the film is in a classical form no to surrealistic fanfaberies although tytus andronicus was impressive nevertheless but still hamlet is a different story at least that's my point of view
<START> it's hard to believe an action packed jet li movie could be so boring but this was transcendant trash the plot is an amalgam of other hong kong chopsocky flicks the martial arts action is all special effects and no human talent br br it's a comic book story about a group of super human soldiers who are to be killed because they're mentally unstable one of their number li who holds off an incompetent army to save them and rebuilds a life as a pacifist librarian the saved killers resurface with an austin powers quality plot to take over the world and li sheds his new life to save the world br br the version i saw was dubbed and that may have accentuated the cheesiness of the wafer thin plot and comic book 25 cent special effects but i suspect even ninja turtle watching 8 year olds would have found this juvenile and hollow
<START> a movie documentary about different people in austria on the hottest weekend of the year it follows what they are doing and maybe more what they are not doing the tempo is very quiet so you have to relax breathe in breathe out before you see it br br first you think but nothing is happening and you get a little angry over that and thats the problem because its the mood of the film and the really nice social realistic pictures which are nice in this film a lot of people will say its disgusting but its not that bad i think its more used for the marketing and theres some really funny moments a 60 old woman stripping i guarantee its the most unsexy striptease in film history its movie which is real i think thats the word right up in your face and that makes it a bit scary no computer manipulation here its real life and as we all know movies can win over reality when it comes to doing sick things so its much worse in the real world br br if you survive the movie you can start to look at your neighbors and think maybe they are like the persons in the movie i bet theres a lot of them out there sick crazy people living with a nice facade after seing the movie i feel its more interesting to look at my neighbors br br but maybe you shouldnt see this movie on your first date
<START> the author of the book by the same title should not have let her name be used for this movie if you have read the book this movie takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events in the book and its spirit that the movie and book seem to have quite little in common except the title and some superficial details the movie adds nothing in terms of artistic merit to the book's own literary achievement br br for those who have not read the book you will also be disappointed not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace it doesn't offer anything more while it is moving slowly like character development for example some viewers might be entertained by some of the graphic lesbian love scenes later on in the movie but you might as well watch a showtime special for the stuff they show in therese and isabelle its fairly tame and not imaginative at all
<START> plan b is strictly by the numbers fare except for one thing i surprisingly found it to be rather insulting br br jon cryer is the star of this film and plays his usual smarmy egotistical snotty character that was actually endearing in pretty in pink and has not been amusing ever since grating doesn't even begin to describe his performance ricky mark matheisen is a muscular blonde struggling actor who gasp is only worried about his hair and getting laid talk about a stock character ugh at least the other three characters are somewhat engaging lisa darr and lance guest play a grounded optimistic caring couple who are struggling to conceive since they are not whiny drama queens however their roles are apparently considered boring and they aren't given enough screen time sara mornell rounds out the cast by playing gina your usual nice and good looking young woman who just can't seem to find the right partner in love i've seen this character a million times before but at least her performance overcomes some of the shortfalls caused by the predictability of her situation br br what startled me about this film was its juvenile promotion of stereotypes they introduced a russian character for the sole purpose of mocking him and making fun of the way he talked he was portrayed as being wild ignorant and amazingly shallow they were just getting warmed up though for the usual nonsense about gays gina decides to be gay for a while since she isn't having any luck with guys honestly that wasn't that bad except they really went overboard when gina brought a lesbian to a christmas party her friends were throwing her lesbian date had very short hair like i'm sure all lesbians do she also got quite upset like i'm sure all lesbians do when gina had the nerve to put on lipstick finally her date goes around the party hitting on just about every woman there and mouths off when gina expresses her disappointment of course we all know how gay people can't stay faithful for so much as a couple of hours much less months or even years right please note the sarcasm in that statement thank you br br this film was based on a tired and predictable premise to begin with but cryer's unlikable performance combined with the idiotic stereotyping sinks this movie to the lower depths of cinema 2 10
<START> dear me peter sellers was one of the most oddly talented actors there has been but his choice of films say after 1964 was very unfortunate he didn't seem to realize how to use his talents he would have been better off working with more of the kubricks of the film world than the people he did of his later films only the optimists of nine elms and being there have impressed me of those i have seen br br that said the boultings and sellers had made a few films prior to this that hardly sound that bad i have yet to see carlton browne and heavens above at least in the sense of using sellers well to a degree but there's a girl in my soup really is a poor film and a dire choice on sellers' part in terms of character in his films from 1955 64 you can usually expect at least some very inventive twist and always an enigmatic conviction in his roles here you have peter sellers trying to play a typical romantic lead it's almost sellers playing a niven cad without the joviality he certainly does not convince try as he might or create an interesting character he should have left such parts to masters of suavity such as cary grant and concentrated on those intriguing dramatic and comic roles that he was famed for br br hawn and sellers really do not establish any genuine chemistry this is no easy genial romance of the like perfected by william powell and myrna loy it is very artificial seeming all the way through i know that it is part of danvers' character that he is a dry procurer of ladies but he doesn't really change from that in a way that convinces sellers has a very grating way of playing charm as well this character really has no depth and really does not gain the viewer's sympathy or interest sellers goes through the motions in a way one would not think possible when remembering the magnificence of his shifty iconoclastic performance in lolita br br there really is nothing to say about the plot direction or characters as frankly they leave little or no impression this is truly one of the most anaemic complacent misguided and lightly dull films i have ever seen a nonentity of a vehicle for sellers' undisputed talents br br rating 1 2
<START> it's a great american martial arts movie the fighting scenes were pretty impressive for american movie made in 90's of course the fighting scenes aren't that good as in honk kong movies actually only few american movies have fighting scenes which are as good as in honk kong movies even nowadays when you watch american martial arts movie you are expecting to see less impressive fighting scenes but still having some nice moves which can be surprisingly good sometimes or at least that's what i'm expecting from these movies i was impressed by this film some fighting scenes were really impressive the acting direction and the plot were good enough so it's a really worth watching movie if you like american martial arts films of the 90's
<START> the directing behind this film was fantastic for a comedy many of the scenes appear to be out of a comic book and much darker visually not story wise than what i expected granted this may not be the funniest movie ever made especially if you are into very crude sexist jokes as this has very little of that compared to others like something about mary or american pie as you rewatch it several jokes stand out and get funnier if you have ever read a comic book or watched a comic book type movie batman x men etc and liked them you will probably enjoy the subtle humor that continues throughout the movie if you didn't like them you may like the respectful ridicule that this film has for those if you did like this movie the dvd has some cool extras 8 10
<START> first of all i saw this movie when i was 7 years old at a christian scholl i attended needless to say that i was scared out of mind not because it was scary but because the content cmon i was 7 anyway the cinematography was pretty bad and the acting was cheesy that's very bad considering that i was only 7 and i remember that the one thing that still haunts me is that dreadful song i wish we all were ready where the chorus ends with you were left behind i wouldn't suggest seeing this one i probably will just for nostalgic reason besides i'm sure the remake is much better the best part of this movie though has to be when everyone dissapears vacant cars crashing lawnmowers running on their own pretty hilarious
<START> well it looked good on paper nick cage and jerry buckheimer collaborate again this time on a mix of heist movie da vinci code american history 101 and indiana jones but oh dear this is to indiana jones what speed 2 is to speed a reasonable cast including john voight and harvey keitel battles against a puerile script and loses badly the film is little more than an extended advert for the freemasons however these freemasons are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf these freemasons are the natural descendants of the knights templar and nobody mention 'from hell' or jack the ripper i don't think i've revealed any plot spoilers because there are none there is virtually no suspense no surprises and no climax it just stops national treasure aims for dan brown but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of scooby doo sans the humour
<START> as someone who has both read the novel and seen the film i have a different take on why the film was such a flop first any comparisons between novel and film are purely superficial they are two different animals br br the novel is probably intended as a satire but it arrives as a cross between tragedy and polemic instead any comedic elements such as those which later formed the stylistic basis of the film version are merely incidental to the author's uniformly cynical thrust and lest the omnipresent white suit of the author fool you into thinking this is another mark twain think again a more apt literary precedent would be the spectre of ambrose bierce in a top hat and tails tom wolfe is equal parts clown and hack more celebrity than author always looking for new grist for his self absorbed mill br br it is therefore no wonder that the excellent production skills and direction lavished on the making of the film were doomed from the start unlike true satire which translates very well into film polemics are grounded not in universally accessible observations on some form or other of human behavior but in a single minded attack on specific people whether real or fictional straw men who have somehow earned the wrath of the writer any effort to create a successful filmed story or narrative from such a beginning must have a clean start free of the writer's influence or interference br br having said that i too find fault with the casting it is not merely that incompetents like bruce willis and melanie griffith fail to measure up but that real talents like tom hanks f murray abraham and morgan freeman are either totally wasted or given roles that are mere caricatures br br there is enough topical material here for a truly great film satire but it fails to come even close
