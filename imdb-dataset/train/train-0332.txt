<START> a bug's life is like a favorite candy bar it's chock full of great little bits that add up to something really tasty br br the story couldn't have been better it's clever has heart emotion and every character has a nice arc a growth or change by comparison the only characters in toy story to have an arc are buzz who learns to love being a toy and woody who overcomes his resentment of buzz there are tons of laughs and cute moments in a bug's life all of the actors turn in great voice work and the animation both the motion and detail is superb br br this serious movie buff doesn't throw around 10 s lightly but this movie certainly deserves the 10 i gave it
<START> we can start with the wooden acting but this film is a disaster having grown up in ny i can tell you that this film is an insult to anyone who is familiar with the community or the people i'm not even a defender of the culture in any way and found this to be a hollywoodized piece of trash to fit its own fictional ridiculous culture presentation and language that anyone who watches seinfeld knows is inaccurate this is a colossal waste of time and even worse is not exactly interesting since the outcome is obvious and the scenes of confrontation are laughably bad who acts this way nobody br br the writer's name sounds israeli or something of that nature but it is clear he doesn't have a clue about the subject he is writing about looking at his bio it is shocking he lived in new york and wonder how much real connection he had with the community even mediocre films like a stranger among us are better and more closer to the truth than this dreck reading this guy's credits it's no wonder he has written scripts on all c grade films that somehow feature stars shocking perhaps he knows someone because this script is even below par for a bad dolph lundgren film
<START> greetings again from the darkness what ever happened to the great barry levinson he directed two of my all time favorites in avalon and diner he had some fine movies as well rainman but always provided something of interest until now i believe the worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is that it is boring envy is the definition of boring never of big fan of pure slap stick dumb and dumber i was just stunned at how god awful this movie is there are maybe 2 chuckles in the whole thing if you can pay attention that long the best part of the film is the running gag of the title song by a redbone sound alike if the film had been written as well as the song it would have been tolerable rachel weisz is a wonderful actress and i realize they all want to do comedy even julianne moore but the real world exposes one weaknesses snl cast member amy poehler is her usual over the top in her role as trailer park trash turned princess the disaster of the film is jack black and ben stiller the first work commute together flashes some promise but after that their chemistry disappears due to the poor script this script is like most of jack black's character's ideas not a bad thought but no hope for success
<START> while originally reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of watching lost i accidentally caught one episode at the beginning of season 1Âthe one with the polar bearÂand it has had my undivided attention ever since the show that is not the polar bear so bear heh with me while i throw out as much rambling semi coherent praise as i can muster br br lost takes a simple idea of a passenger flight full of people crashing onto a desert island and gradually adds extraordinary depth to its premise by exploring each character deeply and unflinchinglyÂwhat drives them who are they where did they come from it soon becomes clear that the island upon which they are stranded acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives whether they're running away from something sawyer and kate among others or getting in touch with spirituality locke claire but lost also zooms in on the island itself and the mysterious horrors that it houses and they all seem to be strangely connected br br while television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting abilities most of the cast of lost are in truth spectacular actors for their respective parts projecting heart and humour in their performances there's also a multitude of eyecandy but not generally of the plastic hollywood kind as most tv shows the characters all feel very real and they are extremely compelling to watch their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable sappiness petty arguments or cheesy melodrama although they are annoyingly secretive Â these people are first and foremost trying to survive and whatever relationship appears is treated secondary to action the realism of these characters facilitate an already well sculptured plot br br about this plot imagine a tree as the template plot then the branches as subplots in this case one branch for every character Â well lost adds twigs to each branch and then tiny twigs to those twigs as other story lines if you're a brother sister to one of the main characters in the flashbacks you will get your own storyline if you're a dog you will have your own storyline unless the writers manage to weave them all together into some glorious culmination in the end they are setting themselves up i am more than a little worried there will be some disappointing cop out to this show as i'm sure most people are br br but assuming the writers do pull this off lost is possibly the best show ever to hit television br br 9 10
<START> imagine the worst a team episode add even more bad taste remove humor and you might get an idea of how despicable this movie is looks like a teenager stole daddy's camcorder and filmed the explosion of his little sister barbie model house pathetic
<START> if you really enjoyed the 2002 resident evil movie then you should just see it instead of waisting 2 hours you'll never get back i can not believe that no one has commented that this movie is just a cheap knock off of re first a special commando force is the unique defense for a facility with a computer matrix that has an ai and holographic projection and this hive rip off has a series of traps that inevitably kill off one member of the squad at a time there's even a chess reference in the code names which was in the dialog of re despite the fact that there are no zombies the rook the movie's nemesis is some sort of bio creature very pail in color suggesting necrotic tissue with a lot of cyborg components just like a super mutant of re so a wag of the finger to mr richard taylor for claiming any credit for this story br br they are not the same movie obviously but the writer got the idea watching resident evil i think
<START> playing out as a sort of pre runner to the great escape some 13 years later this smashing little british film plays it straight with no thrills and dare do well overkill first part of the movie is the set up and subsequent escape of our protagonists whilst the second part concentrates on their survival whilst on the run as they try to reach sweden the film relies on pure characters with simple effective and yes believable dialogue to carry it thru and it achieves its aims handsomely no little amount of suspense keeps the film ticking along and as an adventure story it works perfectly for the time frame it adheres to so a big thumbs to the film that may well be the first of its type br br 7 10
<START> no it's not the horror movie this one is actually a love story br br the ring is a silent film from 1927 that stars two boxers and the woman that comes between them she loves the boxer known as one round jack she loves him until the champion comes along that is even though she marries one round she starts overtly flirting with the champion until the climactic final boxing fight between one round and the champion she comes back to one round's corner just when things look their bleakest and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife love back br br this film was very early in hitch's career but the limitations of the time must not have made him make a lasting film although there are special film tricks and some comedy relief this film just does not hold up to any of his later work it must have been extremely risquÃ© for the time period though with the shameless adulterous wife that may have been the draw back in 1927 while looking through all of these old films it is amazing how i think that they could be redone on today's screen and really come off maybe i should be the one br br skip this movie unless you are planning on watching all of hitchcock's films you could fall asleep in the middle
<START> this is the second british rank film to adapt the stories of sommerset maugham to film all but one story from 'quartet' does not travel well into the contempory era and the actors speech is decidedly clipped as only british pre 1950's actors delivery can be in anycase 'trio' seems tighter and more filmic than the first film adaptation br br one of the problems these two films can't overcome is that their source material was written 25 30 years prior to the films consequently by the 1950's maughm's pre war popularist small morality storyteling seemed rather quaint if not downright coy
<START> i think the best of times was a lost cause from the get go the initial premise guy drops the winning touchdown pass against a rival high school team can never seem to get over it and then tries to reunite the two teams to play again is one of the dumbest i have ever heard since ron shelton went on to write much better sports films i wonder if there was more to it then that i hope this film wasn't green lit with shelton pitching the story as i wrote above br br so we have the premise going from there you would think or hope that there might be a few twists along the way to keep things lively no such luck this script follows every predictable clichÃ© you can think of there isn't a moment in this film you won't see coming a mile away before the film reveals it and the ending well if you can't figure out the ending by the end of the first reel then you haven't paid attention or seen any other sports movie in your life br br robin williams and kurt russell star and bore in the leads williams is the poor schmo who dropped the big pass and russell is the quarterback who threw the fateful pass gee do you think russell will suit up just once more to see if he and williams can right a wrong that the town has never forgotten this is such a lame duck comedy with a lame duck script that one can only shake their heads wondering what might have been sure there are a few chuckles and to be honest there is one truly funny scene williams and russell have marital problems and the wives invite them over for dinner to resolve things neither guy realizes that they have been invited over on a monday and yes monday night football is on keeping in mind that the two teams playing have a combined one victory the men williams especially try to resist the temptation to find out how the game is going the scene dissolves into some hilarious bits as williams goes to check the score by using a bathroom visit as a ruse when he returns he coughs the score to russell later as russell is starting to make the moves on his wife williams wheels the television into their view from another room br br it's an inspired and funny scene in a mostly uninspired and stupid movie
<START> a christmas story is one of many people's all time most beloved films acs was able to take the viewer to a time and a place in such a way that very few films ever have it had a sweetness and goodwill to it that is rare br br so i awaited and awaited its sequel it runs in the family the film was almost released a couple of times only to be pulled at the last minute when it finally came out iritf was and is i guess a total failure br br the sets and cinematography were just fine but the directing totally completely missed the mark the film was nothing more than a cash flow formula of lazy casting lazy writing and disconnected acting br br the narrator jean shepard who was one of america's great humorists and story tellers forced upon us a false reprise of the warm wit he used in acs he over emoted and why he did that i'll never know he somehow managed to become an annoying overwrought parody of himself br br the writing and acting in iritf is inauthentic and forced the actors may have seen acs but whatever wit and nuance that was in acs mustn't have registered at all on any of them the acting was embarrassingly slapstick and bereft of any of shepard's dry humor br br acs will always be a real treasure but to call iritf a sequel is to insult all of the fans of jean shepard and acs
<START> i saw this film 12 years ago on tnt it was susanah york's birthday and they were showing this film as a double feature with tom jones 1963 i have not seen this film on tv since i took interest in seeing this film because one of the stars is the very funny and talented jim dale as lusty the sailor i believe that dale now does the narration of the harry potter books on casette but anyway he is quite funny this is a fast paced comedy it is not on vhs or dvd columbia pictures should go through their film collection and consider restoring and releasing this film to dvd christopher plummer is hilarious as lord fopington ian bannen is also quite humorous as ramble the sailor this is a bawdy comedy the kind of film one no longer sees with great production values 1 2 stars out of
<START> a fragment in the life of one of the first female painters to achieve historical renown artemisia tells the true story of a young italian woman's impassioned pursuit of artistic expression and the vicissitudes she encounters the film features sumptuous costuming and sets and a good cast and acting however it is muddled in its attempt to depict the esoterics of the art and the time and is uninspired in its representation of the passion of the artist as painted on canvas and explored through her involvements with men a good film for those interested in renaissance painting or period films
<START> this is my favorite of the three care bears movies once again i liked all the songs the big problem however as most people have pointed out was that this story contradicts the original for those that saw the first movie recall the bears met their cousins who they apparently never knew about it wasn't of course until the end that the cousins received their tummy symbols after proving how much they cared in this story however the cousins grow up with the care bears and have tummy symbols all along that being said this isn't a bad movie as long you keep it separate from the first i thought the darkheart character much more evil then the nicholas of the first but at the same time i felt it added a sort of balance to the sweetness of the care bears i also liked the we care part at the end although i know other people had mixed feelings about that scene and of course i loved the songs my favorites being growing up and forever young the care bears movies have always had such good songs ten stars for a very good movie
<START> one of the best films i have seen in the past five years the cast is universally spectacular in a tale of young love and bravado on the lower east side of new york city with the two leads being superstars in the making funny charming sad and inspiring this is a totally refreshing take on urban youth that puts larry clark's often nauseating shtick in the gutter where it belongs although i have to admit that bully was a cut above his normal fare raising victor vargas is one film you will kick yourself for missing so don't miss it
<START> this film is being described as a comedy but it wasn't a comedy at all like any panahi film it was a very realistic drama depicting the common thread of social inequity and hypocrisy but it was very funny much lighter than the director's dark and serious the circle my favourite iranian film the resourcefulness of the girls and the banter between them and the soldiers was both completely believable as if it were a documentary and completely hilarious br br the filming the actual match and aftermath was astonishing it added a realism much like australia's kenny of course a very different film br br the performances from all the non professional actors Â soldiers and girls Â were very credible it was very moving to see the passion disappointment and excitement of these girls anyone in this country who thinks muslim girls wearing a chador are any different to their own daughters should go see this film Â it will be a real eye opener br br to me the soldiers represented the current paradigm they started out with stock standard official policy responses to all the pleas of the girls as the film progressed they found it more and more difficult to maintain this stance when what seems like all of teheran breaks out into wild celebration everyone is caught up in it and the ridiculousness of the current policies is obvious to one and all br br it was a very moving and unexpected ending and gave the film a really nice blend of emotions frivolity drama and social commentary though it's adult cinema i think mature minded children from about seven onwards would really appreciate this film as long as they can read subtitles br br it is remarkable that a repressive country like iran is able to produce films of such quality by the likes of panahi and kiarostami perhaps the constraints there force directors to be extremely resourceful australian and other film makers could take a leaf out of their book
<START> a warm touching movie that has a fantasy like quality br br ellen burstyn is as always superb br br samantha mathis has given many great performances but there is just something about this one will haunt your memory br br most of all you've got to see this amazing 5 yr old jodelle ferland i was so captivated by her presence i had to buy the movie so i could watch her again and again she is a miracle of god's creation br br judging by the high imdb rating i'm not the only one who was mesmerized by this young actress
<START> richard dreyfuss is indeed in this flick but in a rather small part he is not the obsessed filmmaker he's the group's business manager accountant even the box describes the film inaccurately there are no erotic scenes with sondra locke as advertised unless one uses the term erotic quite loosely i would not have considered viewing the film without richard dreyfuss being in it as a major character i might have however had i realized that the famous 60's anthem leonard cohen's suzanne was an artistic influence other than the brief recitation of lines from the end of james joyce's ulysses and an interesting visual reference to the end of ingmar bergman's the seventh seal i found it a poor attempt to meld symbolic elements and moods immortalized in films like last year at marianbad and un chien andalou if you like the idea of the eccentric artistic troupe there are many superior films ranging from bye bye brasil to cecil b demented
<START> as a long time fan of all the star trek series i found this a disappointing episode and i wonder if the liberal use of flashbacks featuring will riker's exploits both positive and largely romantic and negative lots of pain and a crewmate's death was a money saving device as were many of their bottle shows episodes in which all scenes take place on the enterprise diana muldaur who also appeared at least twice on the original series deserved a better final appearance than this for her character dr kate pulaski loyal viewers in the star trek world is there any other kind also were shortchanged this was the last episode of second season thus the season ended not with a bang but with a whimper
<START> tripping over i must say at first i was a little disappointed in the first few episodes but having faith in the show and abe forsythe's unquestionable talent i continued to watch i can safely say i'm now glad that i did the story did develop quite well and all the characters have a strong base and most don't have any information missing br br the only thing i can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by the character lizzie br br some good acting coupled with a stellar plot really gets this show over the line here's to hoping for another season
