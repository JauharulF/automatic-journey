<START> so what's in those missing 10 minutes that were so horrible they had to cut them out from the original film we were three years into the film production code barbara stanwyck had starred in the original play but here carole lombard plays maggie king co star fred macmurray is probably best known for double indemnity with stanwyck as well as his hit tv show my three sons keep an eye out for a young dorothy lamour bob hope movies and the too fabulous franklin pangborn who spiced up just about every film put on tape of course he works in the beauty salon on the ship add the sublime charles butterworth and anthony quinn good timing and clever banter at the beginning maggie's buddy ella is played by jean dixon who was the best friend in holiday and my man godfrey in swing high maggie the tourist meets a soldier who is leaving the army maggie misses her boat when it leaves port and gets tangled up with the soldier the dashing 20 something quinn has a small scene at the local bar in panama where johnson macmurray has been playing the trumpet maggie harry butterworth and skid band together and try to figure out how to get back to the states some good singing by lamour good but brief acting performance by cecil cunningham as murph the wise helpful owner of the local saloon in panama while others have lamented at how bad it is it wasn't so awful and is even a little exotic with the fake central america locale setting for the first half of the film
<START> it aired on tv yesterday so i decided to check it out this was one of the last bruce timm paul dini dtv projects related to their old 1992 batman the animated series after that jeff matsuda came along and re imagined batman with his new the batman series but anyway the story of this new batman movie centers around the appearance of a new vigilante known as batwoman however batman feels the need to stop her because of her extreme methods and also in the meantime take down the pengiun and ruphert thorn who both are secretly working with carlton duquesne who's having family troubles and another villain which is later revealed in the movie on a weapons smuggling operation they also put a bounty on the batwoman the question is who is this mysterious batwoman and is it possible that they could be more then one it's up to batman to solve this mystery and stop penguin's latest operation for an animated movie it has a fairly complex plot and a serious tone which is good another plus was the complete redesign of the penguin who looks much more like the sophisticated mob boss we're used to seeing in the comics unlike his previous designs that borrowed elements from tim burton vision of pengium sewer rat and circus freak even though the movie contains a love subplot it's never carried that far and doesn't derail the movie like say batman forever the voice acting is standard quality for these direct to video projects if only batman mask of phantasm took this route kevin conroy still shines as batman bruce wayne and like i said despite running for some very short 80 minutes it manages to make a pretty good and complex storyline complete with a few minor twists and bucket loads of action there are a few downsides however nightwing is nowhere to be seen and i'm sure barbara gordon and bruce wayne don't click as a couple even though is just referenced tim drake aka robin does very little in the movie and to be quite frank i was never a big fan of paul dini and bruce timm's batman character design especially in their batman shows post btas this the new adventures of batman and robin well it kinda makes batman look fat then rather a well built bulked up individual kinda like the jeff matsuda character model from the batman bruce wayne seems a bit awkward those blue eyes make him look more like clark kent then bruce though it's true they do look very much alike another downside is rupert throne no explanation as to why he is in this deal but it's safe to say he's has goons and what's a cut of the deal which does very little more then hang out with the penguim or get himself hurt every time he points a gun at someone count how many times this happens in the movie and you'll be surprised overall a good batman animated movie worth at least a rental
<START> this movie is just plain silly almost every scene has some bit of humor running gags slapstick and great jokes the acting isn't that great and the plot is cliche but the jokes more than make up for that if you have a chance to see this movie i recommend that you do
<START> 'una giornata particolare' is a movie that has a title that sounds so familiar i thought i had seen it more than once now that i finally i have seen it i am very glad this is one of the better italian movies i know with one of the most wonderful performances by marcello mastroianni who stars in other masterpieces such as 'la dolce vita' and '8 1 2' both from the great federico fellini directed by ettore scola this is a movie that takes the time to introduce the characters and slowly develops a story on a special day the day adolf hitler visited rome br br marcello mastroianni plays gabriele the neighbor of antonietta sophia loren she is a member of mussolini's party pretty fanatic in her thoughts and he is a member no more the reason for that i will not reveal on the day every person from their building including her husband and children is out to see hitler they are still in the building antonietta's bird escapes and flies to gabriele's apartment and this is how the two meet right before antonietta went to gabriele he thought of killing himself again for reasons i will not reveal how the story develops from here i will not reveal but it is what happens between the two that makes this such a special day not the fact that hitler is in rome br br like i said mastroianni has a wonderful performance you see he is a man who desperately wants someone around him although at first we don't know why may be he likes antonietta may be he is in love with her may be there are other reasons antonietta feels what we feel what does this man want from her she likes the attention anyway we see how she does her hair to look attractive for the man loren plays the scenes very good as well we understand her questions although we can't be sure what her intentions are the moments where we find out both their secrets if that is what you can call it is a great moment how the story develops from there is even more interesting but i don't want to spoil it for you this is a movie you should see great performances and a beautiful cinematography and the message it gives us still stands today
<START> what a load of leftist hollywood bilge this movie glorifies mutiny as brave and noble if it be for pacifist principles the fairytale ends with the pacifist character played by danzel washington actually getting promoted for his treason what is it with these hollywood tools is this still payback for mccarthyism br br if i sound cynical it's because i am fed up with movies hawking a political agenda the military brass in this movie are portrayed as what else gung ho war mongers sound familiar ever see a movie where the cia or any government agency is not evil think about it yet again crimson tide stresses the point the hackman character u boat captain ramsey comes across like a raving lunatic until the very end when of course he comes to his senses does a complete 360 renounces his blood lust suggests a promotion for the treasonous ron hunter and repents by retiring from the service a guy mutinies takes command of your boat puts the u s at grave risk of receiving a nuclear first strike and you promote him what hogwash
<START> the nsa cia fbi fsb and all other snoop agency in the world should watch this movie to gain information as to how to spy on people as mst3k commentary states it sanata has the dirt on every santa's tentacles reach far and wide there is no hiding from the klaus organization br br from telescopes that can spy over millions of miles to ears that can hear everything its amazing that the cia doesn't have santa on the payroll br br satan's dance routine is hilarious pitch he is so useless br br the cheese factor in of this movie is tremendous very low budget but so fun to watch i recommend watching the mystery science theatre 3000 version for even more laughs br br you even get a laugh at the missfortune of the good kids br br i give this a 1 for production quality and a 10 for pure cheese and fun factor
<START> i never watched the 'next action hero' show and until reading the other comments here did not know that this movie was the 'prize' from that competition i was just flipping channels and came across this and found myself watching dare eagerly all the way to the end br br yes the plot's been done the most dangerous game etc but i was hoping for and almost received the 'gotcha' how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end i think the high tech was overdone gps's and gave me cold sweat flashbacks of night rider but it nevertheless was not too overdone br br the basic problem i had with this movie was the degree of sod suspension of disbelief that was required of the viewer do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenades at a public bridge and no cops show up to investigate could a limousine do countless donuts in a las vegas intersection and no cops show up pleeease way too much of that type of thing fun to watch but keep it at least plausible thank you very much br br the final solution was good but the ending was disappointing with the after taste of a bad star trek episode at least now i understand why the acting was so cheesy except for zane who doesn't get near as much work as he deserves imho they were winners from a reality show br br knock me out
<START> midnight cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969 drawing an x rating by today's standards it would be hard pressed to pull an r rating jon voight who has been better is competent in his role as joe buck an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in new york city he meets a seedy street hustler named ratso rizzo who tries to befriend buck for his own purposes the two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic as ratso dustin hoffman simply shines hoffman has often been brilliant but never more so than in this portrayal he is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison losing the academy award to john wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences director schlessinger has a deft hand with his production but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer worth seeing for hoffman's performance alone
<START> van damme what else can i say bill goldberg there we go now we know this movie is going to be really horrible br br i saw the first five minutes of this movie on tbs knowing it would be bad but not even i thought it would be this bad the plot is awful van damme is getting old finally but unlike arnold his movies are as well br br forget this movie don't see it ever i wouldn't even be paid to see this film br br 1 5 stars at its heart lies a wonderful action packed thrill ride br br well maybe not but the marketers would sure like us to think so wouldn't they br br john ulmer
<START> i don't think any player in hollywood history lasted as long as david niven did given most of the weak films he had to carry by dint of his incredible charm he could act got an oscar for it but most of the material he did was as light as one ply of two ply tissue paper br br happy go lovely is a case in point it's a musical and for the most part you'll remember vera ellen's dancing you'll remember that they are in scot's costume as the film is set in edinburgh during their festival but if you can recall a single song from it you must have a photographic memory br br the plot is light vera ellen is the american lead in a musical that apparently is getting its out of town tryout in edinburgh she starts in the chorus and runs late one day she gets a lift from the chauffeur of a millionaire greeting card king everybody now assumes she's the main squeeze of the millionaire doors open up as they've never opened before br br the millionaire is david niven and he goes along with it and the various situations that are engendered by the mistake cesar romero has some good moments here as the frantic producer of this musical br br in the end though happy go lovely is light and harmless fluff which david niven did so much of and got so tired of
<START> really it's nothing much i only recommend watching it if 1 you're a big fan of any of the main stars 2 if you really want to check out the first time lucille ball was seen with red hair br br 4 out of 10 stars
<START> i was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers i saw it one late night on tv and it hit the spot i actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared yet i remember it pretty well with a nice twist or two and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm michael pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead i definitely recommend it as a rental although some of the themes which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989 now may seem tame which is a shame considering that contemporary edginess is often just used as a necessary marketing tool sort of like clamoring just to get noticed
<START> john van druten's bell book and candle is a delightful and unexpected fantasy about a coven of modern day witches living in new york city it was obviously an attractive movie property it had a stellar part for gillian holroyd for her erstwhile book publisher enforced sweetheart shepherd henderson and her madcap family and circle including shep's bewildered fiancÃ©e the hateful merle kittredge against whose chances with shep gillian begins her magical spell casting it even had pyewacket a siamese cat familiar with well timed miaows sidney redlitch a fake witch expert with atrocious pretensions and bad manners in short it seemed to its producer perhaps box office magic and so it proved to be so many things were right about its production it only had one element not perfect but i found the rest to be amusing charming and very consistently entertaining to begin with the screenplay by daniel taradash kept the best qualities of the fine theatrical play but opened out its scenes to include greenwich village and other areas of new york's scene the technical production was beautiful with cinematography by the legendary james wong howe a fine score by george duning more than clever sets by louis diage and gowns by jean louis in the attractive cast were wolfe barzell howard mcnear janice rule as merle ernie kovacs as redlitch jack lemmon as gillia's mischievous brother wonderful comediennes elsa lanchester and hermione gingold as fellow witches and lovely kim novak in one of her most touching parts as gillian jimmy stewart was the imperfect element in my judgment he did well with the comedic portions of his part but he was never convincing as a new york book publisher and a bit too old for the part of henderson anyhow but director richard quine used subtle lighting pace changes and unusually composed shots to indicate the oddness of the witch portions of the film keeping the other portions very luminous but straightforward in their presentation the plot's main crisis in the film comes to pass when in reality gillian falls for henderson who does not believe in witches at all she started out merely to alienate him from his fiancÃ©e her stuck up college rival later when henderson tries to walk out he keeps coming back to her and realizes he is under a spell as she has apologetically tried to explain to him meanwhile sidney redlich has been summoned by witching spell to come to new york to sell his book to henderson of course he knows nothing at all of magic but is quite puzzled and interested to find out why he had come anywhere at all but gillian's brother enlightens him all comes out right in the end in this romantic satire as gillian proves her love to henderson by losing her powers which is what happens to witches when they truly love a mortal of course he never really wanted to resist her anyhow the film has sprightly dialogue charm and a little magic of its own in the fey charm of the witches and the torments gillian must undergo in her battle with herself and to win the man she loves a lovely ending to this beautifully photographed and unusual romance makes its amazing realism though a fantasy just about complete in my view memorably delightful
<START> anarchy and lawlessness reign supreme in the podunk hick hamlet of elk hills the town elders deputize tough cagey vietnam veteran aaron a wonderfully robust and engaging performance by kris kristofferson and several of his fellow vet buddies to clean up the place the plan goes sour when aaron and his cruel cronies decide to take over elk hills after they get rid of all the bad elements it's up to aaron's decent do gooder brother ben amiably played by jan michael vincent to put a stop to him before things get too out of hand writer director george miami blues gross pointe blank armitage whips up a delightfully amoral cynical and wickedly subversive redneck drive in exploitation contemporary western winner he expertly creates a gritty no nonsense tone keeps the pace brisk and unflagging throughout and stages the plentiful action scenes with considerable muscular aplomb the rousing explosive climax is especially strong and stirring the first rate cast of familiar b feature faces constitutes as a major asset victoria principal as ben's sweet hottie girlfriend linda the fabulous bernadette peters as flaky saloon singer little dee brad dexter as the feckless mayor david doyle as a slimy bank president andrew stevens as an affable gas station attendant john carpenter movie regular charles cyphers as one of the 'nam vets anthony carbone as a smarmy casino manager john steadman as a folksy old diner owner paul gleason as a mean strong arm shakedown bully and dick miller as a talentless piano player moral don't hire other people to do your dirty work william cronjager's slick cinematography gerald fried's lively harmonic hillbilly bluegrass score and the abundant raw violence further add to the overall trashy fun of this unjustly neglected little doozy
<START> i watched this movie every chance i got back in the seventies when it came out on cable it was my introduction to harlem which has fascinated me and bill clinton ever since i was still very young and the movie made a big impression on me it was great to see a movie about other young girls growing up trying to decide whom they wanted to be and making some bad choices as well as good ones i was dazzled by lonette mckee's beauty the great dresses they eventually got to wear and the snappy dialogue as someone being raised by a single mother as well i could really identify with these girls and their lives it's funny these characters seem almost more real to me than beyonce knowles
<START> wenders was great with million hotel i don't know how he came up with this film the idea of giving the situation after spt11 and the view of american society is hopeful that makes it 2 out of ten but this is not a movie is that the best someone can do with a great idea the west east clash there are important things going on in middle east and it is just issued on the screen of a mac with the fingers of an amerian girl who is actually at the level of stupidity because she is just ignorant about the facts the characters are not well shaped and the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me at the ending scene lana says lets just be quiet and try to listen and the background music says i will pray the thing is not about religion actually but it ends up with this how you are gonna see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray the lights are already shining on the truth its just that nobody wants to see it ps my home is not a place it is people the only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence but it is wasted behind this film making by the way as someone mentioned below americas finest young man are not finest they are just the poor and the hopeless ones who sign up for the army in need of good paychecks which is not provided by the government
<START> kazan's early film noir won an oscar some of the reviews here go into extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism and rate it very highly i can almost see where they are coming from but i prefer to take a more toned down approach to a long forgotten film that appears to have been shot on practically no budget and in quasi documentary fashion pneumonic plague is loose in the streets of new orleans and it is up to a military doctor widmark and a city detective douglas to apprehend the main carrier palance the film is moody shot in stark black and white and makes very good use of locations widmark is wonderful as usual forget the symbolism crime equals disease and disease equals crime and just enjoy the chase it is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century as it is of a particular style that was very short lived post wwii through the early 1950s and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher for those who will be watching this for the first time sit tight for the big chase at the end it is something else and frankly i don't know how they filmed some of it i can say it probably took as long to film the finale as it did the first 90 percent of the movie
<START> i tend to love everything the great late paul naschy r i p ever was in while not all films starring naschy are great they all have a specific charm that can be found nowhere but in naschy flicks and they are always entertaining there is no rule without exception however as el mariscal del infierno aka the devil's possessed 1974 proves while the film does have the specific naschy flick charm it sadly drags far too much and gets really really dull in between naschy stars as the evil baron gilles de lancrÃ© who oppresses the people and uses black magic and bloody rituals to stay in power when gaston de malebranche guillermo bredeston who fought side by side with gilles de lancrÃ© against the british learns about the baron's evil behavior he decides to turn against his former comrade in arms and help the people free themselves from the satanic baron's tyranny br br directed by leÃ³n klimovsky who is best known for directing naschy in la noche de walpurgis the werewolf vs the vampire woman 1971 the film was scripted by naschy himself naschy often scripted his own films and one must say that he mostly did a better more original job than it is the case here el mariscal del infierno is mostly built up as a historical adventure rather than a horror film and it gets quite boring throughout the middle it often resembles the sword and sandal films from the 50s only that this film is set in medieval times the satanic part was probably only added because the great paul naschy's name is linked to the horror genre the film has its good parts paul naschy giving weird speeches paul naschy looking weird paul naschy doing satanic stuff paul naschy torturing innocent victims etc but sadly most of the film concentrates on the boring hero and the good guys and these moments are boring the female cast members are nice to look at but unlike most naschy films this one features no nudity and sleaze there is some gore but it mostly looks clumsy and isn't as fun too look at as it is the case with most other naschy films overall el mariscal del infierno is only worth a look for my fellow naschy enthusiasts there are dozens of films starring the spanish horror deity which should be seen before this one such as el jorobado de la morgue the hunchback of the morgue 1973 la orgia de los muertos the hanging woman 1973 el espanto surge de la tumba horror rises from the tomb 1973 latidos de panico panic beats 1983 rojo sangre 2004 or any of the 'waldemar daninsky' werewolf films r i p paul naschy legends never die
<START> i participate in a filmmaker's symposium and this film was shown after we had already seen a not so great film and participated in a 40 minute discussion even though it was incredibly late and we were weary the entire audience really enjoyed it br br personally i thought the film was hilarious in all the right spots and i loved the quirky cast of characters they really grow on you in the film
<START> i absolutely despise this movie no wonder jose larraz disowned it at one point and refuses to discuss it i admire larraz's work especially his more obscure slasher sex maniac thrillers like savage lust or scream and die his work has a kind of inescapable artiness about it that he can't seem to switch off owing in part to his secondary career as a painter cartoonist it's too bad he never made a western his vision would have been perfect br br black candles is easily his most notorious film and probably his best known after the masterpiece vampyres and it's notoriety revolves around one scene where a satanic coven enacts a bizarre rite involving extracting the reproductive fluid of a goat symbolizing the beast as some kind of nauseating balm to be used in preparing the waif like sister of a murdered man for her role as the bride of satan the scene in question is staged in a way that looks rather convincing even without the display of any plumbing apparatus the goat may have been endowed with relying upon the histrionics of the actress recruited to play the supplicant in the ritual and lots of guttural chanting on the film's recycled musical score heard in a half dozen films attributed to jacinto molina the perverse nature of the scene is more implied than shown in graphic detail heightened somewhat by the knowledge that said supplicant is actually the teen aged daughter of the satanic priest my but they had fun concocting this movie br br the problem with it is that there isn't much to deconstruct or contemplate aside from the paper thin rosemary's baby derived story of a woman being weaned into her role as satan's bride by a sophisticated coven of satanists living in the hedgrowed outlands of a very sinister britain led by eurohorror sensation helga line these satanists are comprised of doctors lawyers land owning magnates and other upper crust dignitaries who actually owe their professional success to their worship of the devil all you have to do is sell your soul and the world can be yours only watch out whom you may sell out to pay back petty personal conflict or you may end up being felched with a sword br br the film attempts to combine this heady satanic trip with oodles or borderline graphic sex and should correctly be regarded as a kind of apex or culmination of the sex and horror spanish thriller traditions popularized in part by mr molina ms line and which had amazingly flourished under the disapproving eye of one generalissimo franco the dictator who controlled spain up until 1976 while he lived his decree was that spanish cinema was to be free of graphic depictions of on screen sex spanish directors often made two versions of their films one with the sex concealed for their own screens and one with the fornication on display for export as difficult as it was for the filmmakers to express themselves the result was a sort of interesting tension that usually results when artists flirt with the forbidden spanish horror from the 1970s has a very special flavor to it that is somewhat of an acquired taste it's not for everyone br br but in a bizarre turn of events without franco's influence on their culture spanish horror sort of dried up in the late 1970s when their gothic castles and demonic orgies suddenly found themselves passÃ© when compared to new sensations like jaws and the star wars phenomenon and without franco's constraints their were suddenly a flood of overtly graphic thrillers that came tumbling out of the pipes in the very late 70s early 80s of which black candles is perhaps the best known due to it's emphasis on sexual deviancy with a barnyard animal larraz' major horror films have always revolved around sexual taboos the lesbianism of vampyres the incest of scream and die deviation but here the effect of the depravity is to overshadow the rest of the production nobody cares about anything else but the traditionally censored trip to the goat barn and watching a cut version without the scene in the barn is almost an exercise in pointlessness the sex isn't graphic enough to rate as porn and the chills aren't chilling enough to rate as horror br br so black candles is essentially a behavior study here is how high society british satanists might behave in their secluded mansions out in the west midlands or whatever between sex scenes the actors actresses sit around and have lots of discussions the best thing the film has going for it is an undeniably oppressive atmosphere of claustrophobia with most of it's action taking place in the tightly confined interiors of ms line's character's mansion nearly every avenue of fornication is hinted at so fans of soft core sex romps with a hinting of supernatural horror will be amused and of course the vicarious sex criminals amongst us will enjoy choking their chickens to the goat barn scene but the ultimate conclusion of the film is silly pretentious intelligence insulting and probably perfect for such an otherwise forgettable exercise in applied sleaze br br 2 10 without the goat barn this movie just isn't the same and with the scene it's probably a bit too much for most viewers larraz was correct to disown it
