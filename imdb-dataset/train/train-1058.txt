<START> is the only way to describe this movie about subjects that should be surefire scandal sex celebrity power kirsten dunst grins her way through her role as silent movie star marion davies like she thinks she's in legally blonde the guy who plays william randolph hearst overacts to the point where you want to reach into the screen and slap him eddie izzard is pretty good except that he's playing charlie chaplin and is about oh 125 lbs too heavy for the part hard to believe this hamfisted uneven wreck was directed by peter bogdanovich but then again he hasn't made a watchable movie in what 30 years sometimes there's just no coming back
<START> revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic films since in fact most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events unfortunately what this film lacks in drama is compensated for by an overabundance of boredom one cares not who wins loses dies or lives just end it as soon as possible this is due in large measure to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology scenes of paris and the french countryside have a cardboard quality about them they might better be done on a bare stage and left that way one cannot expect the amazing effects of the house of the flying daggers or the golden compass but after all this is a 2002 digitally mastered production characters seem to enter a scene for the sake of entering a scene so much so that one loses count of the number of times character enter and leave rooms in my view this film turns the french revolution of the 1790s into the papier mache revolution of a papier colle world
<START> think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as power rangers and you have this film from 1990 robot jox a movie where you fight with giant robots two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins the robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are less colorful so while this movie is not good it isn't all bad to watch there are as i recall two robot fights in this one one that ends badly and the final showdown there is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done the fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage but still somewhat fun to watch this movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament so it is worth checking out once but probably not more than that
<START> i'm a fan of matthew modine but this film which i stumbled upon on cable is absolutely witless i see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same so there was no one around to check her worst instincts there are no surprises no original lines and no original characters the goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character what a waste of all this acting talent given how expensive it is to film in new york these days i have to wonder how this got made in the first place and if you're wondering why i watched it at all it came on after a film that i like on cable and i left it on while i worked at the computer it's not a very demanding picture
<START> i sat down to watch this film with much trepidation and little hope i didn't think it would be possible for this film to live up to its subject matter but it absolutely did and then some first i must say that jared harris did an extraordinary job as john lennon at times it seemed that harris was channeling lennon the resemblance was often uncanny and he clearly studied lennon's mannerisms and vocal inflections aiden quinn was quite good as mccartney also bearing a striking resemblance to macca although he did occasionally trip over his scouse accent br br this work of fiction was well written and well directed it was pure fantasy of course but sometimes i felt like a voyeur peeking through a keyhole at this reunion the rooftop scene was especially moving as mccartney told lennon what he had never heard as a child that he was worthy and important and it could never be his fault that he was abandoned by his parents i also enjoyed the scene in the park where the pair of them danced with absolute abandon to the reggae band br br my one complaint would be this i am not so sure that john was as caustic as he was portrayed in the film at this stage in his life he had settled in to his domestic situation quite nicely and he was actually known to be quite friendly when approached by fans only a few years later he was very friendly when he was first approached by his assassin for an autograph on the day he was murdered br br mostly this film served to stir up those feelings again about what might have been had john lived a bit longer i am quite sure the beatles would have come back together at some stage and i am quite certain that lennon and mccartney would still be friends today br br well done vh1 i will watch it again and again br br
<START> she may have an oscar and a golden globe but this film shows why she also is a perennial razzie nominee to do a film that is so bad must be an indication that she needs money she could do ads on why you shouldn't talk on a cell phone while driving especially at night on the way to a crowded mall br br susan montford should stick to producing shoot 'em up as she is not very good as a writer director br br she is accosted by four thugs in the mall parking lot and the first thing they do is tell her they have a gun what does she do she starts pushing and cursing them like she knows martial arts or something she manages to get away but gets lost in the forest after crashing why didn't she run to someones house we get four thugs with guns chasing a lady with a toolbox of course their guns are no match for her wrench ha of course she also has a tire iron and a screwdriver those poor thugs br br now she's home for christmas and she brought a gun
<START> i've had a thing for this kari chick for a while and as far as how she looked in this movie no complaints but after catching it last night in high definition i am certain that's the only thing in the movie that isn't substandard the script is horrible the acting is horrible the direction is horrible i saw in another comment someone commenting on how great the sex scenes were what not at all when a movie is this bad you might as well just turn it into softcore porn but instead i get to see some pasty white dude blocking me from seeing wuhrer's body and scenes that offer me nothing except a tease they should have just gone cinemax so that the movie wasn't a complete waste of time but no with a script this awful they should've capitalized on wuhrer's looks since that's the lone pro of the movie 2 10 only because she looked so hot
<START> i love this film it is well written and acted and has good cinematography the story blends action humor mysticism and tenderness with great sets and beautiful location shots see it buy it show it to your friends br br the acting is good and murphy especially does a fine job portraying the reluctant unlikely hero i enjoyed all the characters and found them to be interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions br br i cared what happened to these people and while the outcome was pretty predictable the good guys win the hero gets the astonishingly attractive girl and the holy child saves lives who doesn't see that coming it still made me happy when everything worked out well in the end thank god this film's dignity was never ruined with a crappy sequel grab some popcorn cuddle up on the couch and watch this fun happy and entertaining film
<START> they must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the hollywood bus station they then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived you know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot four young boys playing in grainy slow motion accompanied by voice over narration next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion once they're grown it's easy to spot the writer director among the four he's the quiet contemplative long haired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants this means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from hickville to hollywood only there's no writing or directing talent on display here and if you still can't figure out which one he is here's a hint the auteur and his character have the same middle name it took over an hour to figure out that these twenty something men were supposed to still be in high school what looked like a prison was apparently a high school the warden turned out to be the principal once more the poor misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement murder and pillage but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father how about hitting back kid like you do everyone else numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose howlingly bad dialogue many scenes badly out of focus cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience overacting in the extreme and if you don't quite get the self important speeches or the slow motion scenes just listen to the overbearing music it will clue you in and what you're supposed to feel poor marisa ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films the biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies run over puppies chained to a tree rob and steal all the while complaining about their sad sorry lives but if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college yeah that's the ticket why is it that every twenty something filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important so interesting that the world can't wait to see it onscreen if this movie is as autobiographical as it seems then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants
<START> if your a fan of airplane type movies this is a must see set in the 1920's and 30's johnny dangerously has not only great actors but great lines knock down dat wall knock down dat wall and knock down dat wall you shouldn't hang me on a hook johnny or sounds like johnnys getting laid its definitely a spoof of the old james cagney movies and references them a lot there's a great scene when jhonnys walking down death row and has a priest set up for his escape listen closely to the fake priests readings its pretty funny another great scene is when dom delauise plays the pope watch his reaction to johnny after he tips the pope a lot said without making a sound i recommend this movie to all who love to laugh or are old movie buffs
<START> it was only when i saw napoleon dynamite that i remembered seeing cracker bag just beautiful sentiment and yet never stooping to being soppy there is some terrific cinematography and the lead girl is quite brilliant it captures more than the nostalgia of the time it has a real heart to it it is the achilles wound of childhood that is exquisite and painful a simple story is always effective when done well this glendyn ivin has a big future and i for one am looking out for his next project the follow up is always the most difficut thing it's like the second album blues for most people br br i just hope his next film is not something lame like a shark film cheers to all enjoy your cinema
<START> this movie is great if you enjoy watching b class movies that is this is a classic college 80's slasher movie in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack a horrible film but worth renting to make fun of or just to watch old men pop out of closets with knives kinda funny if you ask me
<START> i have to tell you this is a great movie it surprises me sometimes how good a movie with no pretenses can be this one is just fabulous it could be that it isn't trying too hard to send any kind of message it just tells a whimsical fun story i gave it a 10 out of 10
<START> considering john doe apparently inspired kyle xy's creator i was expecting its pilot to be quite interesting however i probably had too high expectations because i was quite disappointed by it first they turned the protagonist into a freak who had the crazy idea of showing off his amazing knowledge in front of an audience in a public area so after that scene i began to worry that it was just entertainment but the problem is that it got worse as none of the other characters were properly introduced they focused too much on john doe which made the story far less intriguing i was also slightly disappointed by dominic purcell's performance because i found he didn't make a believable john doe an other problem was the police story it really felt like dÃ©jÃ  vu and it wasn't a pleasant sensation it leads us to the worst issue in the bunch the episodic format i could already see the fillers coming one after an other br br so overall i was very disappointed by it and don't recommend it to anyone considering how bad it was i better understand now why the show got canceled in some way i have the impression that it missed its target developing characters to help the protagonist find his own identity it's sad because there was potential like the people he met at the club the production quality was also quite good and the casting correct but i'll never know if it got better probably not because i don't plan to watch the next episode
<START> i tried to watch this movie twice and both times i still couldn't make it to the end credits first time i managed to sit through the first fight sequence then lost interest second time i managed to force myself to digest over an hours worth of shoddy acting lame sfx and extremely poor direction pales in comparison to the original br br anyone ever hear about the old et atari 2600 fiasco for those who haven't let me fill you in it's 1982 et is one of the biggest box office smashes of all time atari decides to release a movie tie in game on their 2600 home console system to cut a long and financially painful story short the game flopped big time and resulted in thousands upon thousands of atari 2600 et games to be dumped in landfills because they couldn't even give them away let alone sell them br br what does universal soldier the return have to do with this story look at the 3 2 rating and figure it out for yourself br br awful film imdb forced me to give it a 1 out of 10 because their rating systems doesn't go as low as 0 let alone into the negatives
<START> this may just be the most nostalgic journey back in time through time to when one's childhood starts a journey to reminiscences back forth onwards upwards forwards backwards up down all around the boy jimmy h r puffinstuff dr blinky cling clang ludicrous lion even the evil witchie poo too through through the latter day inspirations of lidsville the brady kids saturday morning preview special sigmund the sea monsters and land of the lost both the new old are what this very show bridged the gap to as well as the donny marie show the brady bunch variety hour a k a brady bunch hour even the paul lynde halloween special maybe even other things in between beyond the buck just keeps on moving on on even beyond expectations as well as unexpected bounds now as we get updated in march of '06 we know that jack wild's gone so now it make's it even more symbolic for us to really get nostalgic including now in august of '06 both when jack wild guest stars as himself on sigmund and the sea monsters as well as when on a latter episode h r puffinstuff does too and to recall all of the other nostalgic journeys of all the syd marty kroft characters as well including the h r puffinstuff goodtime club the donny and marie show the brady bunch variety hour a k a the brady bunch hour etc truthfully stephen steve g baer a k a ste of framingham ma usa
<START> had fun watching this film despite the feeling i got a lot of the time that this film was almost copying monsters inc there're quite a few things that are extremely similar between the two the relationship between an animal monster and a small child other animals trying to break that relationship etc it felt like that pretty much throughout the film to me br br one of the redeeming features though is scrat very very funny character even if he serves no purpose
<START> the movie has a great written genre story it features all of the usual columbo ingredients the way lt columbo approaches and bonds to his suspect the way the mystery unravels for him columbo's dog the cat and mouse play which is great in this one and luckily as well some good relieving humor mostly involving the columbo character it's all written despite the fact that it doesn't even have a truly original concept columbo hunting down a detective murder novel writer had been done more than once before in a columbo movie br br it's also an extremely well directed movie from james frawley who after this directed 5 more columbo movies in the '70's and '80's he provided the movie with style and some truly great and memorable sequences br br it's one of the slower moving columbo movies despite not having a too long running time this style and approach doesn't always work out well for a columbo movie but in this movie it does which is perhaps not in the least thanks to the acting performances of the movie br br most columbo movie either starred a big well known star or a star from the early days of film making as the movie its murderer this movie stars the rather unknown 81 year old ruth gordon she didn't starred in an awful lot of movies throughout her career but she is still well known to some mostly for her role in rosemary's baby which also won her an oscar she had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of acting which some people might not like though it earned her 4 more oscar nominations throughout her career prior to her win for rosemary's baby in 1969 she has some great interaction as well with peter falk in their sequences together br br the movie also stars a still young g d spradlin i say young because i only know him from his latest productions out of his career despite the fact that he already was 57 at the time of this columbo production he is still alive but retired from acting ever since 1999 br br an even better than usual columbo movie entry br br 8 10
<START> sniper gives a true new meaning to war movies i remember movies about vietnam or wwii lots of firing everybody dies bam bam sniper takes war to a new level or refinement the movie certainly conveys all of the emotions it aims for the helplessness of humans in the jungle the hatred and eventual trust between beckett and miller and the rush of the moment when they pull the trigger a seemingly low budget film makes up for every flaw with action suspense and thrill because when it comes down to it it's just one shot one kill
<START> besides the fact that it was one of the few movies that i ever shed a tear over bye bye manhood this is one of the most beautifully crafted indian films that has ever been made from the finely crafted sets to those haunting looks meena kumari gives no one can ever forget it the music of pakeezah is amazing all the more if you can understand the sublime poetry and is definitely one of those omg 5 minutes another song movies you get the feeling of how trapped sahibjaan is in among all the amazing jewelery she wears and fountained court yard she casually walks past br br a parody of all the dreams you've ever had
