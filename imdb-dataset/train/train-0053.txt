<START> this movie is about a dysfunctinal family but not just any dysfunctional family it is about the family of the father of our nation india although the film focuses mainly on the estranged relationship between mahatma gandhi and his eldest son harilal gandhi it shows how the mahatma had to kill m k gandhi how he had to sacrifice his family life in order to achieve our freedom every time mohandas karamchand gandhi and his son would try to get close the mahatma would come between them this is a beautifully done film akshaye khanna has proved himself to be a top actor he expressed emotions very naturally darshan jariwala who mainly stars in plays gurukant desai's lawyer in guru has portrayed gandhi wonderfully as a real human being unlike ben kingsley who made him look like a god shefali shah the girl from monsoon wedding has also done a really good job of showing how kasturba gandhi was torn between father and son this movie is touching and so is its soundtrack raghupati raghava sung in a very unique manner i saw this movie just 3 hours ago it released in dubai a day earlier on the 2nd and when the movie was over there was pin drop silence and while exiting out of the theatre not one person pushed another can you imagine us indians not pushing not one there was a sacred silence
<START> this is just usual indian garbage that gets turned out as cinema as indians we can proudly boast that we have the biggest cinema industry however it also the worst br br how can other poor countries have films with real characters that challenge the views of their respective societies and we just keep on pumping out garbage take a look at russia iran china and latin america look at the brilliant films they have and we get crap like kisna br br get real people no wonder the international community in general laughs at indian cinema
<START> this movie was made in hungary i think anyway the countryside is gorgeous the people who play the farming folks were totally fascinating their horsemanship is awesome i got more into the native people the farm life and how heroic they were trying to hide brady from the evil nazis who where looking for these parachutists they even sacrificed their life in several instances the young orphan lad that brady befriends was a sweet kid you will marvel at the riding i think and the action of trying to evade the nazis it is entertaining and comic in some spots and very tragic in others ladies have hankies handy as you will be devastated at the end i own it and have watched it several times in other words not just a one time around flick its a keeper
<START> i saw this movie once in or close to its release year 36 years ago 1969 although i can now only remember bits of it i long to see it again the parts i remember rightly or wrongly include mustard gas in the trenches and suzie kendall as a german spy offering some bloke sexual favours in the back of an enclosed truck to get military information from him the music score was especially memorable and emotion stirring in the league of gone with the wind and i would love to hear it again there must be some commercial or copyright reason why this movie is not available anyone know why i doubt its anything to do with a lack of quality or interest
<START> from the opening dialog and scenes i knew i knew i was in for a train wreck didn't want to look but couldn't turn away if it weren't for the meer eye candy of this film i would have given one star the fact that the interaction between characters and relationship behavior were so far fetched added by poor direction and horrible story make this movie nothing more than a low budget disaster money is definitely not a necessity to make a good film but this movie fails so horribly there was no chance to rebound br br if you were stuck out in the woods your childhood best friend dying from an unknown disease other friends dying around you stranded in a strange place what would you do br br a run away from everyone and try your luck on your own b have sex with your friends girlfriend c take a hot bath to relax your sorrows to include shaving your legs d bash in the head your childhood best friend and life long crush with a shovel e all of the above br br according to eli roth none of these answers are that far fetched in fact all are plausible and well represented in cabin fever the total lack of reality and illogical attempt at explaining what people would do in traumatic situations throws this film in the bonehead bin at your local rental store stay away stay far away
<START> what more could anyone want he's a history lesson foreign language tutor nra representative and ambassador to burundi dressed in a nice silk frock and heels i laughed so hard i left a puddle his woes about puberty transvestism public school and done in several languages made the absolute finest stand up routine i have ever seen i think about it now years later when i see cake tea and cake or death and hear something translated into french the mouse is under the table the cat is on the chair and the monkey is on the branch i like his versions of what jerry dorsey could have been named before he settled on englebert humperdinck i really hope to see a lot more from this wonderful guy he has a lot to teach us and a wonderful way of telling it thanks for your time
<START> i went into this movie after having read it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift who was made into a monster by society suffice to say i was expecting something entirely different from what i got but it was a happy surprise my friend and i both thought the movie was very romantic the fact that the male lead isn't bad to look at surely helped and there was enough plot development action and even humor the fact that it takes them until the 3rd part of the movie to now each other's name had the whole movietheatre laughing to keep you entertained and invested in the story so in short not what i expected but a very good surprise indeed i'll definitely buy this movie when it comes out on dvd
<START> hak hap or black mask in english was a disappointment i was told that it was a sort of japanese version of the matrix imagine my disappointment the film was either badly dubbed or the soundtrack didn't time well with the film another thing is that the dialogue was pretty much bad there was very little thought put into the english version of this film and it appeals only to the senseless action genre not a film i would want to see again
<START> after being sent to prison for no less then 10 nor more then 40 years for being busted with drugs and refusing to give up her accomplishes jackie erica gavin of russ meyer's vixen and beyond the valley of the dolls in her last film role has to get accustomed to life in the big 'doll' house or at least try to in this early film by jonathan demme due to it's tawdry nature and sheer watchability i would also rank this as one of his best films right below silence of the lambs and stop making sense but so far above any of his other movies this minor classic is just campy sleazy and fun enough to be an amazingly good guilty pleasure and thankfully never once goes overboard into all out parody of the women in prison genre it almost washed out the rancid bad taste of the ludicrously preachy philidelphia from my mouth however the film is not without it's downfalls the 'un'talent show is a huge chore to sit through and goes on far too long barbera steele is sadly wasted among other small things but don't let those gripes stop you from watching an otherwise enjoyable movie br br my grade b br br dvd extras 5 minute roger corman interview cast crew bios original trailer and trailers for candy stripe nurses with nudity big bad mama 2 big doll house with nudity crazy mama br br eye candy juanita brown cheryl rainbeaux smith erica gavin roberta collins ella reid lynda gold and some others all show skin
<START> lots of reviews on this page mention that this movie is a little dark for kids that depends on the kid this isn't a movie for a 2 6 year old it's more geared toward the 8 years and older crowd i saw this movie when i was 10 i absolutely loved it at the time most animated movies were a little too childish for my tastes this movie deals with more serious issues and therefore has a little more emotional impact in this movie characters can die and be sent to hell this gives a little more emotional weight to the scenes where characters are risking their lives the good guys aren't always perfectly sweet and nice like other cartoons they have real motivations like revenge and greed but also compassion and friendship shows that things aren't always black and white br br excellent movie
<START> i notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings 1969 1972 or not old enough to appreciate them i think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it br br i was a youngster at the time of apollo but i was old enough to understand what was going on the entire world followed the moon landings our families gathered around the tv to watch the launch newspaper headlines screamed the latest goings on each day from launch to landing from moonwalks to moon liftoff all the way to splashdown in a multitude of languages in school some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on tv during apollo 13 the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate you couldn't go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was the world was truly one community br br now with a buffer of 30 odd years after the fact it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down we are left with our history books and anybody can claim that history is wrong and attempt to prove it with a bunch of lies and made up facts while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence showing otherwise not to mention the proof that dwells in the souls and memories of those who lived through these wonderfully heady and fantastic days
<START> i am guessing the reason this movie did so well at the box office is of course eddie murphy i think this was his first movie since beverly hills cop so at the time he was hot considering that one made over two hundred million and it was r and this one made about 80 million and it was pg does say it was not all that popular i have never been a big eddie murphy fan so that is probably another reason i didn't care for it much at all this one has eddie as some sort of finder of lost kids he must find the golden child or the world is in terrible peril the plot is very bad but as bad as it is it does not compare to the special effects i had seen better stuff done in the 70's than some of the stuff this one offers ray harryhausen did better stuff still the main reason you see a movie like this is because of eddie unfortunately he is not very funny in this one at all and it just seems stupid to put him in the raiders of the lost ark type scenes i guess they were hoping for a fish out of water effect but to me it just did not work
<START> for whoever play games video games here did anybody notice that the gta vice city mansion inside the game and some other things including weapons from the movie that are connected to this movie and this movie inspired the makers of the game rockstar games to copy some things from this movie and by the way this is one of the best 80's movies out there i recommend this for anybody who still didn't see it 10 10 no questions asked
<START> actually this movie was not so bad it contains action comedy and excitement there are good actors in this film for instance doug hutchison percy from the green mile who plays bristol another well known actor is jamie kennedy from scream and three kings the main characters are played by jamie foxx as alvin who was pretty good and also funny but the one who most surprised me was david morse as edgar clenteen he plays a different character than he usually does because in other films like the green mile indian runner the negotiator or the langoliers he plays a very sympathetic person and in bait the plays almost the opposite a man without any emotions which was nice to see the only really negative thing about this film are the several pictures of the world trade center which makes this film perhaps look a little dated overall i thought this was a pretty good little film
<START> this program is really overrated a detective like danny pino's hot headed character would have been transferred to the rubber gun squad years ago the whole squad is made up of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of 2007 every vietnam veteran character they've ever had has turned out to be the killer unless it was another vietnam veteran there has only been one black murderer and he was put up to it by his white boss the only hispanic killer was a race traitor who killed another hispanic to frame a hispanic street kid for a crime that naturally two rich white kids committed what a bunch of propaganda hey screenwriters minorities and poor people commit murder too only on this show are most murderers upper class whites br br what's more the arrests of people in their 70s 80s and 90s for crimes they committed 50 60 years ago are a joke no real life da will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick the state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor the prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they won't serve a day the only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex nazis whose high profile convictions boost da's careers
<START> the kids aged 7 to 14 got such a huge kick out of this film that we gave a copy to all of the other kids on our birthday list this year they all loved it kids from 2 to 7 watch it repeatedly and frequently and we get a kick out of watching it with them br br it's rare that a film entertains the kids for so long and offers laughs for the adults too most enjoy it more than the first br br top quality production and an excellent cast led by christopher showerman as a superior george athletic energetic and wholly credible with a lovable innocence and a particular knack of taking a tree in the face well supported by the inimitable christina pickles as the evil mother in law thomas haden church as the evil jerk rival and everybody else this is fun
<START> 6 10 acting not great but some good acting br br 4 10 director makes some stupid decisions for this film br br 2 10 writer story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws br br 4 10 overall score for this movie br br don't waste your time with this film it's not worth it i gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens storywise not in good way because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes too many special effects slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards it's always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there's too many tracks in this one in the first hour there is almost 50 50 dialogs and musics
<START> this is a movie that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get noticed that is it the dialogs are pathetic and the sensuality of the sex scenes is absolutely absent the acting and the dialog are more suited for high school children yet the subject is intended for adult audiences it is a gutless and shallow movie it could have been way better if it had a story and more drama ah and on top of that one more thing why are inner monologues so excessively used makes it seem so cheap all in all an embarrassing movie for romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view it i know the means are scarce but that is not always an excuse for a movie flopping as this one does and please start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians tudor chirila they can't act
<START> this movie is a perfect adaptation of the english flick unfaithful ashmit plays the role of richard gere emran that of olivier and malikka the perfect cheating wife role of lane they have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the indian masses br br even then the movie has got the full traces of unfaithful though it couldn't catch up with the original it was a cheap soft porn of the bollywood lovers where mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer in the future if the indian directors plan to remake a english movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the indian censors though the film bombed at the box office the actors got the undue recognition in future the directors should be a little more careful in remaking a oscar nominated film br br all said this is not a family film so take the extra caution while watching it at home with family
<START> the excruciatingly slow pace of this film was probably the director's express intention in order to convey what life was like growing up as a village teen in china however i found the combination of the glacially slow 'plot' and the general filming style so impersonal as to be totally alienating particularly to a western audience at times i actually had trouble telling some characters apart as they were filmed from such a distance two hours in and i was totally past caring as someone who is not only interested in music but is also very into the history and culture of china and is by the way no stranger to chinese cinema i couldn't engage with a single character and found nothing to get my teeth into it begs the question if i disliked it who on earth would like it give me zhang yimou give me chen kaige give me the work of just about any other chinese director i've ever seen this sorry effort just doesn't measure up at all i'd be sorry to see chinese cinema judged against this benchmark
