<START> this film is like an allegory of the gospel it has such direct honesty and innocence you can not possibly believe it was made after the world war when italy was ravaged and devastated and was filled with a huge homeless impoverished population it is a monument to the best qualities of the human spirit as well as to the endless creative resources of that land of inspiration br br toto is a character like doestoevisky's idiot a modern christ finding his way in a big city he is goodness and purity fortified by love and his acts change the people he encounters as much as the miracle working dove the story is told in a natural manner and simple style yet imbued with a magic that is almost a premonition of fellini's surrealist fantasies it is one of the most inspiring uplifting movies ever made
<START> i also having endured hundreds of children's movies in the past consider this to be one of the worst i have ever seen br br 1 i resent in this day and age having to explain to my children that russia is not the bad guys also that mocking russian names like poopchev is inappropriate br br 2 the grandfather fly's birthday party scene contained a quasi sexist joke in which he implied that males drink beer and women talk on the phone two other flies also needlessly use the word crap twice br br 3 the whole movie largely smacks of 1950's stereotypes and propaganda that i thought we as a nation were proud to have risen above br br in all it's just crude badly animated even more badly written and not worth wasting the time to view
<START> the pros of this film are the astonishing fighting scenes absolutely incredible sword moves and martial art show off a true john woo masterpiece the story tends to be a bit week though but it never overshadows the overwhelming display of acrobatic martial art action if you are into martial art movies you are going to love this one
<START> beautiful and touching movie rich colors great settings good acting and one of the most charming movies i have seen in a while i never saw such an interesting setting when i was in china my wife liked it so much she asked me to log on and rate it so other would enjoy too
<START> sometimes it takes a film making master like kubrick to bring that extra little something that unique untractable and elusive ingredient that transforms a great movie or a great script into a masterpiece one for the ages br br it's not just that stephen king's story has enough meat and potatoes making it difficult for even the most workmanlike of directors to miss heck even king himself didn't fare so bad it's how kubrick perceives king's universe how he transforms the page into screen time that renders the shining both a visual feast and a compacted masterclass in directing br br kubrick's miss en scene is as usually terrific the movie progresses with a brisk sharp lively pace even though it's neither fast nor heavily edited and it clocks at no less than 160 minutes the camera prowls through the lavish corridors of the overlook hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration linear tracking shots exposing the impeccably decorated interiors in all their grandeur there's a symmetry and geometrical approach in how kubrick perceives space that reminds me very much of how japanese directors worked in the sixties as if what is depicted is inconsequential to how all the different elements are balanced inside the frame br br certain images definitely stand out the first shot of jack's typewriter accompanied off screen from the thumps of a ball like drums of doom coming from some other floor or produced by the typewriter itself as though it is an instrument of doom all by itself later on proving to be nothing short of just that a red river flowing through the hotel's elevators in slow motion jack hitting the door with the axe the camera moving along with him tracking the action as it happens instead of remaining static as though it's the camera piercing through the door and not the axe the ultra fast zoom in the kid's face thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his pov and of course the bathroom scene br br much has been said of jack nicholson's obtrusive overacting his mad is not entirely successful because well he's jack nicholson the guy looks half mad anyway playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself shelley duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices kubrick ever had coming from a streak of fantastic performances for robert altman in the seventies 3 women thieves like us nashville she brings to her character the right amounts of fragility and emotional distress a terrific and very underrated actress
<START> in a time when the constitution and principals the united states were founded on are trampled underfoot by an administration desperate to distract attention from its own internal problems where the geneva convention human rights and foreign sovereignty are unapologetically discarded a thriller about the state taking illegal action that far exceeds that of the terrorists they are countering might seem appropriate however if you want to see a film about that try ed zwick's flawed the siege instead because nada is one of the most infantile 'political' thrillers ever made like robert altman's pret a porter the director has taken on a subject he seems completely ignorant of and imprints his ignorance on almost every frame br br his terrorists are a wildly unconvincing group of stereotypes fabio testi dresses as if he were auditioning for mad magazine's 'spy vs spy' strip michel duchaussoy behaves like an absurd kids in the hall send up of the sociology professor from hell mariangela melato a cardboard middle class revolutionary wannabe who behave at every unconvincing plot turn as if they want to be caught the corrupt authorities fare a little better but are still painted in unconvincingly broad strokes br br it is possible to make a smart film about dumb people cf election but this is a moronic film about dumb people made by people who think they're intellectuals who are talking down to the masses in truth were one to recast testi duchaussoy and melato with jim varney johnny knoxville and shannon tweed the result would actually be to raise the intellectual content of the film not lower it br br chabrol might just have got away with his characters and events if he took them seriously but his staging is so inept the fight scenes would embarrass a kindergarten class while the shooting of the kidnapping is more inept than the kidnapping itself and his inability to get his cast to perform with at least some approximation of recognisable human behaviour so blatant that it is actually embarrassing to watch special mention must be made here of duchaussoy so very good in chabrol's que la bete muere he is stunningly bad here in a performance that is so far over the top it's back again br br chabrol has made some fine films but you would never guess it from this amateurish mess a newcomer to his work would never want to see another of his films after this which would be a great shame utter drivel and a sad waste of a potentially interesting material one star out of ten and that's being very generous
<START> i agree with those reviews i have read here and i have no words to define such a turkey like this but despite everything i still can find a reason for movies like this to exist do you remenber those happy days in which video was a prosperous business and a lot of movies were made with the only reason of filling the shelves of the video stores this movie comes from that period and i can imagine that was the only reason for which it was produced and the same happened with many many many other stinkers do you remember rambo imitations and so many slashers of z grade i still feel nostalgia for that period about this movie i can say i didnÂ´t waste my time watching it because i pressed the fast forward button after the first fifteen minutes just to find a very funny scene in which a guy was pushing an axe against heads which exploded because as you perfectly notice they were made of plastic and about the end well it was so badly filmed i could not understand what happened thatÂ´s the same i had not followed the non existing plot at all but boy video age was a great age despite movies like this
<START> this movie was terrible to say the least i was hoping for a lot better after seeing high school musical the whole entire movie was a complete rip off of the simple life only it wasn't a reality show br br the acting was not good at all amanda michalka had her moments when she wasn't that terrible on the other hand alyson michalka was bad all the way through chris gallinger who played the love interest of amanda was playing a french guy but had an awful accent one good thing about this movie was the completely adorable michael trevino who played alyson's love interest just something to keep in mind if this movie had been aired before high school musical it probably would not have seemed as bad but it was no comparison br br overall i give it a 2
<START> there are so many stupid moments in 'tower of death' 'game of death 2' that you really wonder if it's a spoof at times it felt like i was watching a sequel to kung pow rather than a bruce lee film br br to be honest this film has bugger all to do with 'game of death' if anything it's more a sequel remake of 'enter the dragon' incorporating many elements of that film particularly the actual footage bruce lee's character billy lo apparently investigates the sudden death of his friend and encounters a piece of film that was left with the man's daughter when the body is stolen during the funeral billy is also killed and it's up to his wayward brother to avenge both men's deaths br br tong long stars as brother bobby lo and doesn't really have the sort of charisma to carry the film his fighting abilities are very good however bruce lee obviously turns up thanks to no longer deleted footage simply to cash in on the legacy saying that on the whole the footage is actually edited in better than in 'game of death' but it doesn't stop the film from being a mess br br ok so the fights are actually very entertaining dare i say mind blowing and make the film at least watchable but there are so many daft elements to this film that it really tests your patience first off there's the supposed villain who lives on his palatial estate or is that mental institution seriously the nutter eats raw venison drinks deer's blood carries a monkey on his shoulder and owns some peacocks and lions this attempt to make him look tough and intelligent just makes you feel sorry for him you half expect someone to escort him back to his room br br in fact this middle section is awful and when the scene involving a naked hooker and a lion suit arrived i turned it off however i did finish the film and was kind of glad i did because the fight scene towards the end much like 'god' was the whole reason for watching while the story is an embarrassment the action is very good and contains excellent choreography br br but even the finale disappoints if the premise was anything to go by what we were told was that the 'tower of death' was a pagoda that was upside down and underground this sounded great like a twist on bruce lee's original idea with different styles of fighting on each level could this be the 'game of death' that was originally planned no the film should have been named generator room of death because thats as far as the tower goes of yes there were indeed one or two 'different' styles there were foil clad grunts leopard skinned henchman and stupid monk it's as though enter the dragon had never been made with the plot being a poor imitation br br worth watching once for the fast paced fight scenes but so stupid sometimes that it hurts if this was intended then fine thumbs up however for recreating that projector room scene from 'enter the dragon'
<START> i'm giving this movie a 1 because there are no negative numbers in imdb rating system this movie was horrible it was very badly acted the story was poorly written the action was unbelievable i doubt even the salvation army could battle as poorly as the troops did in this film i won't even write any plot spoilers because the movie just isn't good enough for plot spoilers to write comments on the plot would be pointless if i were to compare this movie i'd have to compare it to reign of fire however although i didn't like reign of fire either that movie at least was better than this one br br some of the people in the theater left before the movie was even halfway done the only reason i didn't was because i simply didn't think to do it i was hoping for a feast of cgi and fighting masterfully done but that isn't what happened the martial arts lasted all of 30 seconds and that was from an exercise routine done during the flash back scene very disappointing the cgi was not done well either one scene comes to mind during one of the earlier tank battles the troops are firing away at nothing someone forgot to cue the animation guys on that bit of film so the street was totally devoid of bad guys i'm also thinking the bad guy's voice was dubbed by the voice over of imotep from the mummy movies had that same scraggly echoing thing going on someone owed some royalties here since i mentioned the fight scene i'll say yeah that might be considered a spoiler but only to the purists i suppose br br don't go see it don't buy the dvd when it comes out either you have been warned
<START> typical thriller has been done many times before simple plot outline cop liotta becomes obsessed with russell's wife and he tries to bump off good ol' kurt so he can have her this is beyond predictable it doesn't even try to make you guess the plot is the plot and there's no thinking outside the box here i guess then the only reason to watch it is to see how it develops but nothing is done originally or interestingly there's not really anything to say about this film it's not particularly bad but there's no good points either russell plays russell and you know what you're gonna get when you see him in a film ditto liotta stowe has an annoying cher esque voice i read the plot outline and i could see the film in my head it was so obvious and basic i watched it and it rolled out in front of my eyes exactly as i had imagined i felt not a drop of emotion throughout i have no feeling towards this film it's as if i never even watched it considering this it's a pretty pointless film isn't it still i'll give it 3 10 for some reason
<START> i'm the sort of person who went down to the local library and read books on babbage's difference engine whilst my schoolmates were playing football etc so if there is any such thing as a target audience for this film then i guess i'd probably be included in that br br maybe i just need to watch it again a previous reviewer mentioned not to watch this film whilst being tired maybe that was my mistake br br i tried my best to enjoy this film and there are aspects of it that i do like but overall i found it amateurish and quite plodding br br being somewhat of a self confessed computer nerd i just can't help but pick up on the exact time frame when the movie was actually made and how the employed graphics reflect that time i e 1997 having played games of the era c f mind grind to cite one example this film cannot escape that 16 bit colour low res multimedia explosion of that time now thankfully this has somewhat lessened in more recent years in the gaming world at least in favour of actual game play br br having to resort to watching this movie via a german fta satellite channel as i don't think it's ever been aired on uk fta tv well not recently anyway i was mildly amused to see the end credits note gottdog god dog had 4 people working on it's design maybe it's mean spirited of me to be amused by this given that ten years have elapsed since the movie was made nevertheless the end result makes movie graphics from the eighties look good by comparison br br but as for the main story i agree that the format isn't the best idea like others i agree that ada deserves a film without the sci fi angle and a more straightforward biographical approach would perhaps be better suited to covering the life story of this remarkable lady br br there are fundamental mistakes that undermine my enjoyment of this movie first of all the underlying idea that somehow lost real world information from the past can be accurately reconstructed through some sort of extrapolation via software based intelligent agents seems somehow ludicrous br br also the theme running through the movie that a computing device can indeed predict the mechanics of all things through the course of time e g the winds is now known not to be the case br br ok so the victorians may have held this view but the 20th century works of gÃ¶del proving that no mathematical system can be complete turing's works on the limits of computability not to mention chaos theory and quantum mechanics have all completely undermined these ideas which seem central to how the modern day researcher's software is supposed to work br br finally the clicking of the mouse in the air to mean programming is also just plain wrong as previously mentioned br br this film maybe could have been ok but at least some technical and scientific consultation would have given the film some much needed credit in the believability stakes br br i won't forget the film though as like pi it is clearly a unique work but with too many fatal mistakes for me to truly enjoy it 3 10 from me
<START> this was the worst movie i have ever seen molly molly hall could not act at all she had no emotion it was all blah blah blah like she was reading out of a boring text book the smart kid and the kid who loves food there names weren't worth remembering were so annoying it drove me crazy when ever the talked it was about some scientific thing or food mollys dad didn't show enough emotion about his daughter missing the police officer and mollys dad said the same thing like four times it was just horrible everything was repeated way to much beatrice should have had something bad happen to her for being so mean i just wasted a moment in my life by watching this movie
<START> the first scanners may not have been a great movie but at least it was original there is no such novelty to this one the acting is worse in my opinion and the story is slower and nothing special i also didn't like the dialogue and the special effects are no better than in the original this is movie is inferior to the first one in all ways the only thing different about it is that it is loud and chaotic at times but that doesn't make a good movie if they had done something better with the story and made it interesting this could have been a decent movie i actually couldn't get through it all without fast forwarding through it to me this is a forgettable movie and not much more despite all that there are worse movies being in a generous mood i'll give scanners 2 a 4 10
<START> this appalling film somehow saw the light of day in 1988 it looks and sounds as if it had been produced 20 or 30 years earlier and features some of the worst songs ever included in a major motion picture i weep for the parents and children who paid top dollar to see this
<START> whenever a columbo story deviates from the familiar plot colorful killer commits crime columbo smokes out killer columbo becomes a pest in the process the writers somehow are never able to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes this episode deviates in the extreme and the result is a major flop br br would you believe columbo never faces the villain till the very end br br frankly i was tempted to turn it off about two thirds through br br oh the sacrifices we self appointed reviewers make
<START> christopher durang must have been taught by a memorably awful nun because he just can't let go of the concept the play sister mary ignatius explains it all for you was presented at least in hollywood in precisely the same tone as diane keaton's lecture scenes here sister mary was an exaggeration a lampoon a bitter satire of a serenely confident doctrinaire and highly judgmental nun and as played by lynn redgrave she was hilarious but the movie insists that we take this exaggeration absolutely seriously while as mentioned maintaining the same tone in the explains it all scenes the two approaches clash headlong and in the last twenty minutes the movie goes off the track plunges into the gorge and explodes there are no survivors it could have worked if the tone of the scenes with the four former students and their encounter with sister mary been pitched the same as the sister mary scenes or if the sister mary scenes been presented more realistically this way simply doesn't work at all
<START> 1st watched 8 26 2001 3 out of 10 dir tobe hooper scary yet sadistic which makes sense portrayal of a relative of the marquis de sade carrying out the same sadistic acts and enjoying it that supposedly his predecessor did this tobe hooper film really doesn't do a whole lot different than his similar in style freddy krueger movies with the same star freddy himself robert englund playing a dual role the marquis de sade and his relative it is also seems like it wants to really poke at christianity but then loses that in the end much to my chagrin but leaving an inconsistent feel to the movie could have been much worse if excesses were taken in sex and violence but they try to keep this at a minimal despite some disgusting scenes my final thought is why would hooper want to make this movie it obviously took awhile to actually get distributed then it has to be advertised gruesomely and with hooper's name in the title to hopefully make some money on his name and his gore it's obvious this didn't work
<START> being a fan of the manga and anime of go nagai devil man devil lady violence jack etc i was looking forward to this one i'd seen neither the manga nor the anime so i had no preconceived notions going in good thing too what we have here is a series of silly softcore movies of the type that used to turn up with alarming regularity on cable channels late at night while it's tame compared to what gets rammed down the throats of regular cable viewers our hero's naughty bits are either tastefully tucked away behind a strategically glued on scarf or emblazoned with a ridiculous sunburst effect there are prolonged scenes of bondage and torture that lend the proceedings just enough smarminess to make it unsuitable for the kiddies while i have nothing whatsoever against nude female heroes i do dislike amateurishly made movies there are at least four in this series on the plus side there's at least one stunningly beautiful actress in each of the four episodes i saw it's no wonder nagai's testicle boy never made it
<START> this a rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every level however if your after the true facts about such legends as hickcock cody and calamity jane then look elsewhere as john ford suggested this is the west when the truth becomes legend print the legend the story moves with a cracking pace and there is some great dialogue between gary cooper and jean arthur two very watchable stars who help to make this movie the sharp eyed amongst you might just spot gabby hayes as an indian scout also there is a very young anthony quinn making his debut as cayenne warrior he actually married one of demilles daughters in real life indeed its quinns character who informs cooper of the massacre of custer told in flash back the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the american west with american history so please take time out to watch this classic western
