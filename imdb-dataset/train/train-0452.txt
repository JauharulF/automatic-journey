<START> a man readjusts to life alone after 45 years of marriage he also has to solve the problem of the family milch cow tulip which refuses to allow itself to be milked until that is he visualizes his wife who was the one who used to milk tulip br br tulip is based on a real story told in griffith's family of her grandparents' generation the film is a nostalgic look back at a disappearing way of life one where people still felt some sense of responsibility for each other set in the lush green victorian the australian state not the era countryside br br writer and director griffiths evidently has further ambitions in both areas and this multiple award winning 15 minute short is a fine beginning to her reel
<START> atlantis the lost empire is a better movie than i thought i never thought this movie would lead to my expectations true this movie started slow but as the movie wore on it became more to my liking the story takes place in 1914 and is about a guy named milo milo believes in the fabled atlantis along with friends of his grandfather he embarks on an amazing adventure of his own along the way he must endear friendship betrayal trust and more the voice cast is great they surely know how to carry movies with only their voice talent the music is nothing special but likable anyway the animation is not the best but it is still good enough overall this is a good family movie for all ages i rate this movie 9 10
<START> i saw this movie when i was about 8 years old and i liked it but it wasn't until i watched it again at the age of 13 that i really understood it for what it is a cartoon about a criminal dog with a real heart of gold adopts a little girl in order to exploit her for her talents to talk to animals the dog star charlie b barkin is murdered by his formal business partner carface who is absolutely diabolical by the way his soul then goes to where else but heaven only to find a golden watch that is really his life's time which charlie being the sneaky but lovable cad that he is steals and rewinds sending him back to earth once back on earth charlie goes about seeking revenge on the evil carface this is how he comes upon young anne marie the lonely little orphan that can talk to animals whom charlie plans to scam for her talents in order to get back at his enemy carface but scoundrel charlie actually comes to care for young anne marie and his plans unfoil as he must make up his mind to do what is right after anne marie discovers what her best friend charlie has really been using her to make money for a new and better dog casino now he must rescue her from the dreaded carface i still love this movie even at the age of 22 the idea and plot really are quite different and original from that of many other animated films i especially like the idea that a dog plays the role of the villain for once carface was even better than he was in the all dogs go to heaven sequel in that picture he appeared quite dubious to his role of villain
<START> put aside a dr house repeat that i had missed and a desperate housewives new to watch this one i don't know exactly what plagued this movie i never thought i'd say this but i want my 15 minutes of fame back br br script direction i can't say i recognized the stable of actors the usual suspects but thought herbert marshall was a class addition and sat myself down for a good cheesy flick boy was i wrong dullsville br br my favorite parts where the office girl makes with the 029 keypunch and puts the cards into a 087 sorter lol the computer i'd like someone identify the next device a 477 it's before even this dinosaur's time br br and we dinosaurs don't have that much time to waste
<START> spoilers this was an ugly movie and i'm sorry that i watched it like jan kounen's dobermann it suffers mostly from poor editing or lack of it it is as if the director was so in love with his work that instead of cutting the movie down to a pace that kept your attention he added all of the footage he had shot together there are maybe two cool scenes in the entire movie one of them is spoiler when benkei is petrified and the camera starts spinning around him that was cool but okay we got it move on please the camera won't stop spinning around this guy there's maybe one or two more cool scenes that i forgot about in this flood of mediocrity but the last duel scene is not one of them it may be because unlike in the earlier sword handling scenes shanao isn't masked but just because the director couldn't find a stuntman who somewhat resembled asano tadanobu doesn't give him the right to go ahead and make up 80 of the sword fight with extreme close ups of sword clashes and all from the same angle may i add the director should learn from the american produced 1995 bullet train ninja movie the hunted i personally saw the village raid scene as a tribute paid to the social activists of the previous generation who were confronted by the police in the violent demonstrations of their college years the situation where innocence is oppressed by an authoritative and armed branch of the government unwilling to understand seems to be a message common in the japanese media due to the strong influence of socialists and communists who are a political minority the movie versions of gto and salary man kintaro are two other recent examples end spoiler i don't understand i just don't understand why people who don't speak the language of the movie find praise worthy material in this maybe the worst was lost in the translation br br the ending of the movie on which marketing played a lot is a different interpretation of the legendary encounter between shanao and benkei but that legend is not the most popular in japanese folklore and it is so detached from contemporary themes that after 138 minutes of over played visual techniques who cares how the director wants to re interpret the story director sasaki hirohisa of crazy lips said that there was an unpleasant trend among new japanese directors to ignore japanese audiences and target their movies for foreign film festivals in order to gain faster international fame this works although it doesn't make sense because the point of an international movie fest is to introduce to the world what kind of movies are being made in other countries what kind of movies people watch in those countries certainly not gojoe and the like
<START> everyone is either loving or hating this film i am going with loving it is so well shot and so well acted beautiful this film is for people who appreciate well crafted film making if you are not a fan of well done films of course you would hate this but if you like the tops of acting photography story and development look no further then here
<START> the unseen is done in a style more like old hollywood mysteries than a horror show the film is somewhat slow but lots of bizarre imagery keeps it the film alive and watchable the basic idea of young girls stalked by something in the basement is old but good acting and production make the movie worth watching the movie is notable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects i rated it an 8 out of 10
<START> 108 tarzan and his mate 1934 released 4 20 1934 viewed 8 6 08 br br john dillinger escapes from prison and robs a bank in iowa bonnie clyde kill two highway patrolman in texas births ralph nader gloria steinem alan arkin richard chamberlain br br doug after we were rather disappointed with the original 'tarzan the ape man ' we discovered among fellow users and historians that the second film 'tarzan and his mate ' was the best in the series it's true i got a huge kick out of this movie johnny weismuller returns as the titular vine swinging animal dueling wild super hero and maureen o'sullivan reprises her role as his entirely fantastic lady love jane who sports a two piece outfit for the first and last time here in my review for 'ape man ' i stomped on jane pretty good for her obsession with clothes and her incessant screaming but she's redeemed herself for me here make no mistake o'sullivan is the star of this movie and jane is the most capable character in the entire cast she acts as the ambassador between holt and tarzan she can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals and she knows how to hold off an angry pride of lions when she's out of bullets she's even got her own jungle scream now the chemistry between johnny and maureen is irresistible she's totally got him trained cheeta is quite charming as well taking drags off of martin's cigarette the plot is mostly an excuse for tarzan to do battle with the jungle's most vicious animals especially lions crocodiles and rhinos the effects though always visible are much more dynamic and cool and complement the action nicely oh and you can't talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene all i can say is yes she is naked very exciting stuff br br kevin wow just wow when it comes to down and dirty pre code action adventure nothing holds a candle to 'tarzan and his mate ' the inevitable sequel to tarzan the ape man is a kick ass violent and risquÃ© jungle epic i doubt there will be another tarzan movie in the future that takes no prisoners the way this one does you'd be hard pressed to find a full scene in this movie that would be code approved or animal rights approved for that matter the gruesome violence doesn't even wait for the happy jungle couple to show up before it pushes even the limits of today's adventure movies and after t j enter the picture there's plenty of early morning cuddling and ass naked afternoon swims see it for yourself if you don't believe me i love maureen o'sullivan most of all in this film in the first film jane seemed like a walking contradiction like the writers back then just didn't know how to portray a character like that but here she is a great precursor to kick butt females of later cinema although she still requires tarzan's assistance in getting her out of most jams she does a lot more than just waiting around to be rescued her personality is perfectly believable for a woman who has been living relatively comfortably in the jungle for a year i watched this with my mom and i enjoyed pointing out to her just how much jane has tarzan trained as jeff foxworthy put it she totally has the ape man at her every beck and call although there is a host of dated optical effects throughout the film there is still plenty of hair raising tarzan vs predator battles that are performed mostly for real that and the men dressed as apes are a lot more convincing this time around spoiler the film climaxes as the jungle erupts with a shocking orgy of animal kingdom violence that leaves tarzan and jane the only two humans still breathing although the couple rides off into the sunset reunited and victorious i can't help but imagine how this story will seem to the next safari who will hear about the previous bunch of humans who went to find tarzan and jane and were never heard from again end spoiler one of things that still bothers me is johnny weissmuller's smooth hairless bod and over styled coif other than that this is pre code action adventure that is absolutely not to be missed br br last film it happened one night 1934 next film twentieth century 1934
<START> i love this film the noir imagery combined with spillane's no nonsense character mike hammer works marvellously to create a mood and feel seldom found in low budget detective films of the early fifties it may not be 'the maltese falcon' but this film makes it's own solid contribution to the genre spillane is often criticised for alleged misogyny etc but his 'dames' are way above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence poor old mike hammer as effectively played by biff elliott is blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist whom he meets when investigating the death of an army buddy when the penny finally drops his face is a picture good to see that 50s censorship did not force the film makers to omit the famous last line a bona fide low budget classic
<START> recap something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of antarctica the mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on antarctica julian rome a former seti worker is brought in to decipher the message problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his and the situation quickly turns awkward especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him and the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly soon the object is in the open the mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity it is decided to open the object but just before that is done julian decodes the signal do not open but too late and the object explodes as it is finally breached and two things unleashed on earth the first is an alien that had been dormant in the object and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff and washington that is suspiciously updated on this historic event decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth so a russian nuclear submarine carrying nuclear weapons is sent to antarctica br br comments the movie holds a few surprises one is carl lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful well worked through and a lot better than expected unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own and this time not in a good way actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes it is never really explained why washington know so much why washington is able to command russian submarines why the object is in the antarctic and has woken up now it is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable english some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to earth before and knew the language and obviously chose english why but then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the earth from the virus send their do not open message encoded and finally the end is as open as an end can be br br the movie is a little entertaining but too much energy from me must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good br br 3 10
<START> i started to watch this movie expecting nothing just another movie to watch but since the first twenty minutes the artwork and main character who is enigmatic doesn't talk much really got me in this movie br br i really liked this movie it was dark beautifully acted and really touching it's a bit slow but the immersion was complete the directing was awesome by letting us know bits by bits the story leading to the conviction of joey and his life behind bars the music was really great and very well incorporated into the scenes the ending was unexpected with a twist i didn't see coming it's not the kind of movie we see often
<START> stupid and just plain weird movie about some kid who becomes traumatized when he finds out santa isn't real he grows up and becomes an adult brandon maggart who makes lists of people who are naughty or nice one christmas he snaps and sets out to kill the naughty people dressed as santa of course br br boring and just plain bad killer santa movie if you're looking for gore it's not here only a few of the murders are shown and they're not that gory with very fake effects most of the movie just contains brandon maggart talking to himself and slowly going crazy the script is trite the acting is terrible and it leads to an ending which had me staring slack jawed at the tv seriously i had to rewind the tape and watch it again to make sure i wasn't hallucinating really really poor ending br br if you want a scary christmas flick rent black christmas the original 70s version not the terrible remake avoid this one at all costs
<START> shinjuku triad society albeit from perfect is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber conventional realm it's a yakuza triad picture involving cops versus japanese or chinese gangsters mostly chinese as the title suggests but already even in his first technical 'debut' takashi miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from here on in social issues like black market trading of precious goods in this case human organs usually from children nostalgia for childhood and one's roots which was especially prevalent in dead or alive 2 thumbing of the nose at taboos like gay sex and satirical rape violence towards women blood curdling violence it's certainly not as surreal as some of miike's most recent films but this is expected as he's trying out things that he's just starting to learn following a track record of straight to video programmers it's got all of those qualities and it's also like the films that would follow from it equally savage and heartfelt crazy in spots and sardonic in its drama and solid for genre fans br br the story concerns two brothers one a chinese orphan raised in japan tatsuhito kiriya kippei shiina pretty decent as a eastwood esquire anti hero hero who's become a detective and another who's become a gangster or a would be one the main arch likely takeover gang comes from wang a definite pun on what the gang represents during its spare time played by tomorowo taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes and his partner karino takeshi caesar who's threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who's just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a miike movie there's some intrigue involving the organ trading scheme with the gangsters which kiriya almost becomes a victim of and the gang's penchant for gay sex at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want it all leads up to vengeance and redemption qualities that miike and his writer are trying to emulate from shakespeare hence the macbeth bit with wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying it won't come off br br if it doesn't add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great shakespeare play would have it's par for the course of a film like this miike's goals are met though just met in his low scale ambitions a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime and what the realm of unrepentant sex with both sexes brings out psychologically in the characters at the same time shinjuku triad society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting black comedy from the miike oeuvre some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face or the randomness of the interrogation as it goes into a very twisted area there's even a laugh out loud line from the young sex slave after finishing an act on one of the bosses thank you mr weeny burger miike and his writer don't have enough here to make the film a full on dark comedy like ichi or of course visitor q but there's enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters br br as the first entry of the black society trilogy as it's called i was quite impressed and it's a fine quasi calling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema
<START> several story lines are interwoven here around different women characters the shoes they wear serve as an indication of their troubled lives all are transformed at the end of the movie adela antonia san juan leads a brothel her daughter anita monica cervera is retarded and has a restricted life leire najwa nimri is a shoe designer with problems and loses her boyfriend maricarmen vicky peÃ±a has lost her husband and now raises the children from his deceased former wife isabel Ãngela molina is a bored rich lady br br other characters are used to connect the five main women characters in storytelling not everything is given away in the beginning some connections are established surprisingly late in the movie and that adds to the experience the shoe theme is driven to extremes for example when leire as a shoe designer and working in a shoe store where she steals her shoes faints she breaks one of her heels br br in editing small connections are made between the scenes a telephone rings a cigarette is lit a song etc are used to make the connection and fast cuts frequent change of storyline keeps it from being boring or reaching tv levels it is strongly music driven to set tone and atmosphere the cities of madrid and lisbon serve as the backdrop for the stories and shots of those cities are used to extend the story beyond the characters one of the more moving shots is when anita who makes the same walk every day widens her walk and restricted life from the relative calm of her street to the busy main road how the restriction of space is visually translated is well done as with most spanish movies a lot of storytelling is done visually using the soap like stories as the simple backdrop there is a poetic ending that is somewhat romantic and sentimental but is still beautiful br br as ramÃ³n salazar is too much in love with his own material it is overlong some scenes are kitsch and on the soap level including the acting adela's love life isabel's doctor the shoe theme is exaggerated and is a weak metaphor br br this is often compared to magnolia because the structure is the same but they are different magnolia is more technically competent but somewhat mechanical this has more the ability to translate emotion and atmosphere visually after seeing this you are inclined to immediately move to the new movie city madrid
<START> this movie brings back many memories of the classic cinema of old where actors didn't have to take their clothes off to make viewers watch their film br br firstly i think the main plus point of this movie is the amazing chemistry between shahid and amrita it is definitely the making of the film br br i have seen lots of comments regarding the film being sickly sweet and overly slushy in response to this i think to a certain degree this is a correct analysis however considering this is a barjatya film i think that compared to mpk hahk hssh and mpkdh it has been toned down significantly hssh was almost unbearable to watch in some places br br in this film however when the sentimental moments come along you find yourself smiling wishing the budding couple all the best and hoping that nothing bad happens to them br br another major plus point is the performances of shahid and amrita both have acted very well especially shahid who looks great in the film amrita looks simply stunning and should be taken seriously as a future major star br br although i really enjoyed the film as a whole i do feel that it was too long some of the middle could have been trimmed off and it would maybe made even more of an impact i also think the music although it fits into the film when you see the situations is slightly old fashioned and the movie could have benefited if a more up to date soundtrack had been available although the picturisation of the songs mujhe haq hain and hamari shaadi mein are wonderful br br all in all i definitely recommend this film its romantic looks stunning and has a dramatic climax i won't go into details just in case you haven't seen it br br ps if you're prone to crying take a tissue i needed several
<START> thanks jymn magon for creating disney's 2 best cartoons ever this show has improved very much over the years as a kid i didn't like it because i thought it was a rip off of ducktales which was my favorite disney thing at the time like grandmoffromero then later on though it was good but not great but after reading the reviews here i decided to give it another chance bought the dvd set watched the whole pilot the first day i got it was very pleasantly surprised it's still my favorite episode although the series did live up to it and by the end of disc 1 i knew this was going to be a top tenner br br the characters are so complex charming my favorite has got to be wildcat he's absolutely hilarious and sweet to boot my next favorite is baloo the best pilot on the show i can see why 'ol jymn built the show around him then it's kit cloudkicker he baloo have the best relationship in the series after that louie jim cummings did a perfect job of impersonating the original voice after him rebecca she has made me laugh pretty hard and i do believe she and baloo eventually marry and finally for the heroes molly although she's my least favorite i still like her i think she's a very cute character much better than webby from ducktales and the villains were very original don karnage his air pirates always crack me up kahn is ice cold and ruthless and the thembrians are always at least amusing br br as said before the stories range from hilarious time waits for no bear romance of red chimp to nothing short of touching the old man the seaduck paradise lost to fun funny exciting adventures in search of ancient blunders my favorite for whom the bell klangs these are only a few of my favorite episodes anyway talespin is disney's best aside from gummi bears some reasons for this gb had a decent amount of my favorite character cubbi while ts didn't have enough of wildcat but in the end talespin remains a classic bottom line 10 10 6th best cartoon ever
<START> first let's all agree that lorenzo lamas could never be considered a skilled actor barely even decent sometimes just plain lousy however in this piece of called snakeeater the film industry as a whole sank br br first let's start with the plot a vietnam vet named jack kelly aka soldier who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through 2 guys' feet and pins them to the floor gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister had some potential but still pretty thin to begin with br br now the acting being an actor myself i am qualified to say that this was some of the worst acting in the history of the art lamas is well himself the jackasses playing the clampets deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere especially talented ones who never get their big break br br finally the action the gunfighting is so so at best and the fist fighting is deplorable i've seen more real looking fights at the renaissance festival and those were pretty fake looking br br readers listen to me avoid this piece of caca at all costs if it were the only film in existence you still would want to avoid it for the sake of your brain cell count do not watch this thing
<START> twist endings can be really cool in a movie it's especially interesting when the twist is right in front of our eyes but we just don't pay attention those type of twist endings are the one's that make people think then we've got twists like this film has twists that whether or not you pay attention you have no clue what's going to happen when they reveal this kind of random twist instead of shock it's somewhat a dumbfounded reaction this film starts off like it's going to be an interesting take on horror but after about 20 minutes it's nothing but boring dialogue and a stupid twist br br three young women are going to a concert so they get lost traveling through the woods and hit a tree trunk they end up at some old creepy lady's house who hates men and they are greeted by her homely daughter marion laurel munson strange goings on happen as these girls stay at this house for several days instead of trying to leave or get home and the suspense progresses into a dumb slasher br br this film is too caught up in it's dialogue and it's always between only a few characters we have the main three girls the creepy spinster and the old lady and conversation of any importance does not go beyond these five to make matters worse they never have anything interesting to say it's actually quite maddening sitting through their conversations we want to know what's going on and instead they just talk and talk and talk about nothing br br plot holes are abundant here the house these girls stay at when they get in their car accident is apparently three miles from anywhere wow three miles a two hour or less walk will kill them why didn't they get a ride with the worker for this household who was driving into town did he have a one seater how come these girls never question leaving and just willingly stay rarely even checking up on each other why did this have to have so many dumb twists maybe the answers are in the boring script br br having a slasher film with five characters is really a bad idea it's not thrilling it's not scary and the ending is definitely out there but undoubtedly dumb br br my rating 1 2 out of 79 mins r for nudity and violence
<START> this movie was absolutely ghastly i cannot fathom how this movie made it to production nothing against the cast of the movie of course this is all the fault of the writing team you take the old average plot let's dance our way out of being poor and destitute or step in this case but this one lacks any semblance of a true plot or at least one that anyone would care about with canadian speaking actors in what is supposed to be an american setting this film falls very flat on a positive note the directing was pretty good and cinematography was pretty decent as well looks like the production budget was very generous as well my only request is that this team leave the writing alone and go find actual screenwriters to help them bring words alive on film net result how she move is how she sucks
<START> it's a short movie from david lynch with just 8 minutes but it got all the lynchian ingredients it's mysterious dark inconclusive eerie and strange and before the blond girl starts to talk it's even a bit scary the soundtrack is exceptional to create this odd atmosphere because it's also sinister and mysteriousÂ br br about the setting itself it hasn't the traditional red curtains but it has socking purple painted walls which give it an equally effect of eeriness br br the plot is about a girl who's locked in a dark room and she cries for help then comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way saying she's there just because of her faultÂ we don't know what did happen or what will happen nextÂ it ended unsolved and puzzling as a good lynch movie must end br br it's a great short despite some amateurish acting the girls are professional actresses but i think their acting could have been better in this short
