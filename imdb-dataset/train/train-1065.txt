<START> read eric's review again he perfectly described my own feeling for this film so more eloquently than i ever could i'm only writing here to further encourage you to look for and see it br br i saw it many years ago on tv the ifc i think it is such a unique film i hesitate to make comparisons it was filmed in northern mexico somewhere in the relentless badlands of coahuila zacatecas san luis potosi this isn't the sedona like durango mexico of the john wayne films but a truly stark and wild place i have to find the novel now to check on the original location of the story like the location this movie is strange and wild and wonderful and weird and absolutely not for everyone it is the kind of production that almost motivates me to study film br br i hadn't actually forgotten this movie it is indelible yet over the years i had forgotten of its existence i know nobody who has seen it had never read of it nor seen any reference to it erendira is such an unusual name i'd even forgotten the title well i'll be looking to buy a copy now br br i have since the above posting become a huge fan of gabriel garcia marquez and so regret not having read him before br br relative to msmyth's comment below the movie was filmed in mexico but the author is colombian and was not commenting on mexico or mexican history in any way although marquez now lives in mexico for political reasons this story is universal br br i am still trying desperately to find a copy of this film for my library liked the movie you have to read the story and then everything else garcia marquz wrote and by the way the original location in the story was colombia
<START> i first saw the live musical at the denver center for the performing arts and it was absolutely mind blowing stunning and had such fantastic continuity of plot and dialogue that i liked it much more than most musicals that i have seen on the stage the interesting thing is that you never got to see zach's face he was always in the dark but his presence was powerful and guided the direction of entire production whe i heard they were making a movie from it i waited with bated breath but when i watched the movie version i was so bummed out disappointed that i felt i was cheated the movie lacks the captivating mood set in the live production and it never allows you to be completely in close touch with every character personally i would like to see the live version again and if that should ever be revived i would wholeheartedly recommend that you go out of your way to see it it will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy
<START> wow it's been years since i last saw this movie watching it in 2008 is certainly different than watching it in 1986 initially i didn't' think i would make it through the movie hunt stevenson michael keaton was so obnoxious arrogant and disrespectful that i found it hard to watch him he embodied every negative stereotype of americans if that wasn't bad enough once the small american town's finest workers were shown the image only got worse on the opposite spectrum the japanese were presented as emotionless robotic workaholics the movie wasn't even all that funny i only hung in there because of the nostalgic value of it and i'm glad i continued the watch br br just like boxing judges are swayed by how you finish the round this movie went from about a three up to the seven i rated it because of the ending the end was excellent you always want a harmonious ending and this was just that it was great that the town got to keep there jobs and keep the factory but what was most special was the marriage between the japanese customs and values and the american customs and values it was a mediocre movie that ended on a high note
<START> the ruth snyder judd gray murder in 1927 inspired ogden nash to write a broadway play called machinal more famously it inspired james m cain to write two short novels which anyone who has actually reached the point where they are reading this review would be familiar with double indemnity and the postman always rings twice both became film noir classics of the 1940's double indemnity being arguably the most perfect noir ever made some of the real life elements of the snyder gray story were captured by cain the old age and indifference of albert gray ruth's high sex drive ruth and judd's passionate affair and complicity in the murder and that famous double indemnity insurance clause missing elements included the fact that the actual setting was a very urban manhattan albert snyder being a respected newspaper editor the numerous incompetent and failed attempts were also ignored in order to cut to the chase br br cain's double indemnity was filmed perfectly by billy wilder let's ignore stanwyck's ridiculous wig as one of those interesting accidents of film lore the postman always rings twice however was filmed thrice and ossessione an italian version and luchino visconti's first film was the first of three versions before commenting on it i'll recommend the lana turner john garfield version of 1946 in its entirety and five minutes of the 1981 jack nicholson jessica lange version for the great sex scene on the dining table br br ossessione is not as noirish as the postman always rings twice it has a strong neo realist look which makes it a great movie but a lot of the essential noir elements are missing it does not have low key lighting and unconventional camera angles the dialog is not hard boiled and instead the film concentrates more on characterization this is the longest version of the story and goes deeply into characterization its also a lot more sexual than the lana turner version we have a very obvious adulterous relationship and giovanna is very obviously a nymphomaniac a new character is introduced into the story la spagnola with very obvious homosexual overtones there is also a small but very well played role for a dancer who moonlights as a prostitute br br this is a far greater study of the working class than of crime the audience really gets the feeling of poverty and grime the drifter is a complete tramp the wife is no lana turner and may even have been a prostitute before marriage her husband is an obscene capitalist obese rude and arrogant i think the casting was brilliant for this film my only beef is with the overlong running time everything is drawn out too long and it would have been more effective if it had been more economical nevertheless fans of noir and realism will definitely like ossessione as i did
<START> somewhere inside this movie is a half hour episode from the twilight zone trying to get out whereas cube was taut well made claustrophobic and mind engaging i'm afraid cypher is a bloated tedious rehash of several well worn themes which just don't add up to much especially if you have seen almost any other half way decent sci fi film before br br cypher manages to drag all the way through its relatively short 95 minutes right to the incompetent ending none of the characters spark off each other and for a film made in 2002 the technology is truly cheesy it is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of cube it's not a bad movie but it is most definitely not a good one br br when you've watched the grass grow and paint dry and are bored of your stick insects then by all means watch this film but the other activities will probably prove more stimulating
<START> this could be looked at in many different ways this movie sucks its good or its just plain weird the third one probably explains this movie best it has strange themes and just has a strange plot so who else but christopher walken would play in this no matter how bad average or even how good it might be br br the acting was what you would expect especially out of ben stiller jack black i have always liked so you know what you will get out of him but this is not bad christopher walken is always off the wall he is always enjoyable to watch no matter how bad the movie is comedy wise it is somewhat funny this of course meaning that it does have its moments though very few but can get a little over top here and there which makes me feel like the movie is just desperate for laughs but of course not in a good way br br the directing was average as well barry levinson is a slightly overrated director and really did not do a good job here this movie seemed that it had a lot more potential and he did not do much to reach it just very average and did not seem like a lot of effort was put into making this film br br the writing is the key to a good comedy obviously that means the writing here failed at best it is below average considering it does have its moments it was not too horrible that is never a good thing to say about a movie though br br if not for christopher walken and it stupid ridiculous ending i would have given it a lower rating he is always quite a character in his movies stil this is just a whacked out strange movie with strange characters that really don't go anywhere not completely horrible but i would not really recommend it though because it is a very forgettable movie
<START> natural born killers 1994 br br cinema cut r br br director's cut nc 17 br br it's an unusual oliver stone picture but when i read he was on drugs during the filming i needed no further explanation 'natural born killers' is a risky mad all out film making that we do not get very often strange psychotic artistic pictures br br 'natural born killers' is basically the story of how two mass killers were popularised and glorified by the media there is a great scene where an interviewer questions some teenagers about mickey and mallory and the teenager says 'murder is wrong but if i was a mass murderer i'd be mickey and mallory' mickey describes this with a situation of 'frankenstein the monster and dr frankenstein' dr frankenstein is the media who has turned them into these monstrous killers br br most oliver stone films examine the flaws of the america the country that the director loves and admires i guess 'natural born killers' is about the effect of mass media technology and how obsessive as a nation americans are and most of the world over things such as mass killers and bizarre situations br br the killers played by woody harrelson mickey and juliette lewis mallory are executed astonishingly by two excellent actors who step into the lives of two interestingly brutal killers mickey and mallory believe that some people are worthy of killing perhaps in the cruel theory of social darwinism survival of the fittest mickey says in his interview in prison that other species commit murder we as humans ravage other species and exploit the environment the script is interesting but it is questionable how much this film amounts to in the sense of making us think about society and human behaviour rather than the intensity of a 2 hour bloodbath that we have seen br br the last hour of the film takes place in a maximum security prison we see the harsh realities of prison life the attitudes of the warden etc overfilling of prisons maybe stone is questioning the future the path that society is leading to br br two other interesting characters first a reporter who runs a show about 'america's maniacs' and is obsessed with boosting ratings that he goes to any length to capture the story of mickey and mallory the other is police officer scagnetti an insane perhaps sadistic officer that is in love with mallory he also has some weird obsession with mass killers since his mother was killed during the massacre at waco texas by charles whitman br br the cinematography is superb different colours shadows styles create a feeling of disorientation the green colour most evident of all is green to resemble the sickness of the killers in the drugstore when they are looking for rattlesnake antidote br br the camera work is insane shaky buzzy it takes some determination to get use to it and accept it highly unorthodox psychedelic and unusual br br 'natural born killers' does not glamourise the existence of insane murderers it questions it and how we as the public may fuel this attribute br br although the above review sound quite positive i did dislike the film quentin tarantino who originally wrote the script for the film was not pleased with the altered screenplay and he asked for his name to be removed i can see why while mildly interesting at times natural born killers is a mess of a picture br br 4 10
<START> deliriously romantic comedy with intertwining subplots that mesh beautifully and actors who bounce lines off each other with precise comic timing a feat that is beautiful to behold when cher's spineless fiancÃ© asks her to help him make peace with his estranged moody younger brother no one could dream the consequences which follow operatic symbolism catholic church confessions love bites and falling snow moonstruck is timeless and smooth it takes about 15 minutes for the picture's rhythm to kick in there's an early sequence with the grandfather and his dogs at the cemetery that's a little rough and a following scene with cosmo and the elderly man at the gate that seems obtuse but the patchwork of the plot is interwoven with nimble skill and the movie's wobbly tone and kooky spirit are both infectious 1 2 from
<START> really and incredible film that though isn't very popular extremely touching and almost life altering was for me at least br br definitely worth seeing and buying added to my favorite movie list it's number one now br br this is a very touching movie that all people should see br br the man in the moon we'll it's just incredible it's now my favorite movie and i only saw it today and i'd recommend it to anyone above 15 as long as you're somewhat mature if you don't really try to feel the characters emotions then you'll never get the true meaning and value of this movie but it really is incredible just watch it because it'll alter the way some people look at life worth seeing 5 5
<START> this is an abysmal piece of story telling it is about an hour into the movie before we have much idea of what it is supposed to be about the characters often mumble inaudibly actions frequently seem to have no relation to each other nobody seems to be concerned about who actually murdered the girl a pair of spooky kids go swimming in waters that seem threatening but nothing happens the irishman gets punched in the face by one of his buddies for no apparent reason to continue would be as boring as the movie itself the only half entertaining element is the landscape photography but anyone could point a camera at the australian outback a get memorable shots overall dreary incoherent pretentious and downright annoying for wasting so much of the viewer's time
<START> i've long heard that to get their start in 'legitimate' films many behind the camera types work on porno films br br the people who produced and directed this monstrosity stayed too long br br poorly paced staged and written it uses a lot of perfectly good talent diehl dorn eggert badly br br much sexual activity is teasingly implied here by the brassiere popping host to the alien creature but it never crosses the line br br you'll still want to shower afterwards though
<START> what i like about you is one of those series you need to see but aren't sure you would see the beginning is cool and its sucks you into the series just for fun the second part i season 2 3 which are more stale they come and go in what you want what happens with many series is that they don't end with something special because the second part of the series always goes down into the drain this one also somewhat did the third part is the one to spoil and ruin the whole series usually but it doesn't this ending is perfect for the series it fits perfect actually i was pretty angry about all these guys in val's life actually i wanted to end with jeff in the end but later on it changed they chose to take vic into the series after almost 3 seasons without him and that was the biggest surprise and also what made the series go on top br br see it many times the series is actually very cool just don't expect the second part to be that good it isn't but the third part does what was needed and made the series to one that was worth the whole thing i am happy to say i was glad and happy about the series and now i will go over to see two guys a girl and a pizza place when i have seen the whole series i will be back
<START> first of all 'st ives' the film is only fairly loosely based on the robert louis stevenson story of the same name but for once this is not a criticism the original novel was a work in progress unfinished at the author's death and in freely adapting it and giving it an ending the film makers have brought to life some endearing characters who although different from stevenson's originals would i am sure have charmed and amused him br br it is 1813 capitaine jacques de kÃ©roual de saint yves is a breton aristocrat orphaned by the revolution's guillotine now serving as a hussar in napoleon's army we meet him going out for the evening claiming that since a hussar who is not dead by 30 is a blackguard he at 34 is now on borrowed time certainly as he faces a string of challenges to duels our dashing hero seems in danger but a surreal prank on his colonel provides him a way out of the duels and into the bed of a beautiful courtesan singer unfortunately it also results in losing his commission further misadventures result in him being taken prisoner by the british and sent to a pow camp in a scottish castle br br while carving toys and boxes jacques catches the attention of flora the young niece of miss susan gilchrist a well travelled woman of the world who lives at swanston cottage they fall in love and most of the story concerns flora helping jacques to escape and to find his emigrÃ© grandfather the old comte of course there is a problem jacques' older brother alain a dissolute alcoholic is perhaps understandably far from pleased when grandfather disinherits him in front of the whole household the very instant that jacques has appeared cue treachery there is also an entertaining subplot of the romance between the awkward naÃ¯f but good hearted major farquhar chevening and aunt susan who has travelled through most of the ottoman empire and been a prisoner of the turks br br even allowing for a natural prejudice in favour of any film in which the heroines share my surname 'st ives' is magic it combines splendidly swashbuckling swordfights a balloon flight comedy and romantic adventure i would recommend it to anyone who loves 'the kind of film they don't make anymore' fairbanks colman flynn co the acting is splendid anna friel makes flora a spirited and appealing heroine and jean marc barr is delightful as jacques a genuinely lovable hero miranda richardson and richard e grant are already great favourites of mine and have great fun as susan and farquhar whose relationship runs as a comic counterpoint to that of the leads as the rakish scheming but ultimately tragic alain jason isaacs shows as he did more recently in 'the patriot' that he has the classic swashbuckling style besides the dashing good looks please please will someone cast him as a hero in the genre br br my main quibbles with the film concern settings and costumes in the book the castle in which jacques is a prisoner is clearly edinburgh but the film shot in ireland germany and france has 'highlandised' the setting making the retention of place names such as swanston inveresk and queensferry decidedly incongruous the costumes too are a real hotch potch from 1780s through to the period in which it is set while this would not be implausible with more down market characters making do it seems odd for well to do ladies such as the heroines to be wearing 1780s gowns in 1813 clearly the costuming decision was Ã¦sthetic these earlier styles are visually far more appealing and elegant than regency fashions and they work in the idealised world of the film as a whole 'st ives' is 90 minutes of pure delight
<START> for my first taste of shakespeare on stage i cannot believe what these people did to a perfectly good play br br let's start off with the good bit shall we br br alan rickman is alright although some of his dialog could have been delivered with more feeling the rest of the actors needed to pull it together br br romeo romeo whyfore art thou not dead yet romeo the actor while not only completely wooden and deadpan could not read his lines with any gusto at all he was completely out of focus had difficulty even looking juliet in the face and absolutely no grace with the lines that he was given whoever cast him deserves to be punished juliet is almost passable but she gives no depth to her character and seems to be completely out of touch with the play mercutio was incredibly creepy and completely out of character for the entirety of his dialog benvolio was unfeeling and mercilessly choppy with his lines br br i was forced to endure this half baked production of romeo and juliet the acting was stilted and the costumes were nothing short of distracting i have seen kindergarten puppet shows with more effort put into them i only wish that i could give this movie a rating of zero
<START> i can find very little thats good to say about this film i am sure the idea and script looked good on paper but the filmography and acting i am afraid is not the standards i would expect from some very talented people i would doubt that this features highly in their cv filmography michael caine appeared wooden at times in his role as the doctor and at no time no did i actually believe in his character the plot was unbelievable especially with regard to the victims son some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other films that at times i wondered if it was actually a spoof thriller the lighting at times was dark and this added to the feeling of watching a low budget movie with some big named stars wondering why i bothered to watch it at all
<START> this was one of the all time best episodes officer sean cooper was murdered in his patrol car back in '68 a dying convict in the state penitentiary reveals that he stole a block of heroin from the car after the shooting his case is reopened with the presumption that he was corrupted as a policeman br br further investigation into him as a police officer and a human being reveals a war veteran involved in a forbidden love this type of love was considered shameful and something to at least keep hidden at that time br br while this isn't the type of love i personally support he was still a policeman and a human being and shouldn't have been killed for it the sound track was excellent keeps me watching the dvr and the selective use of black and white mixed with color to emphasize one object or give a particular feeling to a scene was especially appealing i shall be watching this one in repeat
<START> it is so gratifying to see one great piece of art converted into another without distortion or contrivance i had no guess as to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a film worth seeing if you loved bulgakov's book you would be understandably afraid of seeing some misguided interpretation done more for the sake of an art film project than for actually bringing the story's deeper meaning to the screen there are a couple examples of this with the master and margarita as complex and far fetched as the story is the movie leaves out nothing it is as if the filmmaker read bulgakov's work the same way an orchestral conductor reads a score with not a note missed why can't we find such talent here in the u s so now my favorite book and movie have the same title
<START> i just came back from a pre release viewing of this excellent sci fi film noire it's style is definitively unique and very well made it is filmed with actual actors but transformed into a black and white comic strip style you have never seen before it goes one step further than sin city and it does it well it's a successful combination of french comic and movie cultures the story and mood remind of blade runner and if you liked that one you will surely like this one too the storyline is intelligent never boring and has some nice little twists this film is a must see for any cinephile except perhaps those who absolutely don't like sci fi or b w
<START> this movie is exciting daring and the music is very good the movie moonwalker was meant to coincide with the album bad 1987 i have bad it is excellent the movie begins with michael jackson performing man in the mirror on stage then it shows a history of michael from his early days in the jackson 5 right up to the bad era oh and badder is good too badder is a music video parody of the music video for bad the single it then shows the speed demon video the song and the video are very very good indeed same for leave me alone which appears after then it shows the movie moonwalker after a few minutes he plays smooth criminal in a club called club 30s like it when he does the lean anyway nice to see you bye bye
<START> perhaps the most personal of david lynch's works is his most accessible this time rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent anything more than vivid nightmares lynch provides a reflective fragile meditation on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds reassurance in both the simple true story of an iowa farmer richard farnsworth who rides a lawn mower to wisconsin to visit his estranged stricken brother there are still plenty of the unique and original visual dreamscapes some rather striking aerial shots of the heartland filmed by veteran cinematographer freddy francis to make it an undeniable lynch effort and characterizations that are some of his most unforgettable farnsworth is excellent in a stoic yet personable way allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become a part of his life and sissy spacek turns in some of her finest work in a smaller role as his mentally challenged yet observant daughter whose painful secret is revealed in a poignant way through a gentle turn in the sensitive script by john roach and mary sweeney but the rest of the small cast to a person delivers indelible performances one of the most notable being barbara robertson whose accidental killing of a deer is both uproarious and sad at the same time but that's vintage lynch with his ability to engage and unsettle you at his best to those unfamiliar with lynch or know him only by his violent disturbing reputation this is an excellent place to begin for those who know his work this is one of the finest in his repertoire
