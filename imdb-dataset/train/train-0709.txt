<START> drew barrymore is an actress that has gone through bad periods not only in her career but in her personal life too after being a prodigy child actress she descended into obscurity with mediocre films of low quality while she has recovered from that dark past this movie stays as a reminder of drew barrymore's worst days br br the movie starts with an interesting premise very reminiscent to brian de palma's raising cain with a plot dealing with multiple personality disorder that sets the story for a horror thriller barrymore stars as holly gooding a young woman who is trying to make a new life in california after a traumatic event of her past in which apparently her other personality killed her mother br br suddenly her past returns to haunt her as her evil personality is back in her life willing to ruin her new found peace and her new found love in the middle of the chaos his new boyfriend patrick highsmith george newbern will try to help holly to face the demons of her past br br unlike de palma's underrated thriller doppelganger is for the most part a mediocre film that not only never fulfills it's purpose it also concludes in one of the worst endings of movie history while barrymore is definitely not at her best she manages to keep her dignity with an above average performance the rest of the cast however range from mediocre to painfully bad over the top performances although leslie hope manages to be among the best of them br br the script is full of clichÃ©s and de palma's influence is quite obvious while the movie tries to be original by making literary references in almost every line the dialogs are dull and the wooden acting certainly doesn't do any good it has a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons and excessive use of special effects br br the make up effects are done by the outstanding knb and are really among the few good things in the movie however the bizarre over use of the effects in the totally out of context ending decreases the impact of knb's work and makes cheesy what in a different movie would be amazing br br the fact that this is a b movie is no excuse for it's low quality as with a better and more coherent script this could had been an interesting movie sadly all we have here is a mediocre film that gets worse every second worthy for barrymore's beauty 3 10
<START> i was 10 years old when this show was on tv by far it was my favorite the actors were very credible alexandra bastedo was just gorgeous i just order the dvd 15 episodes they didn't have super powers they just had superior human skills strength hearing sight the 3 actors were very good in their rolls very believable there was a good story in each episode at the time there were no special effects or explosions everywhere so the script was suppose to be good and the characters performs were great there was no fancy stuff like in other shows they didn't try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show i highly recommend this tv show to anybody that like good stuff
<START> man even plan 9 from outer space is better than this movie this flick doesn't have enough plot for half an hour yet they managed to extend it for an eternity of more than an hour jet li and corey yuen are pretty good specially in those exaggerated fight scenes but stuff like the legend of fong sai yuk is much better than this sorry thing that would be better left unmade
<START> dirty harry has to track down a rape victim who extracts revenge by shooting her assailants in the goolies before killing them probably a more apt punishment would be to let them live after the initial shot and let them suffer forever like she and her sister has anyway an action packed story set again in san francisco and santa cruz the chief rapist played by andy drake is suitably vile and gets his punishment at the end of course not a classic movie but better than the others except for the original dirty harry
<START> well made but basically dreary low life melodrama which according to the accompanying interview with lead isabelle huppert writer director pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical detail given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved it doesn't do him any compliments and he does seem to have been a troubled man as huppert also says that pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot br br the acting is uniformly excellent however despite their relatively young age huppert and co star gerard depardieu as the title character were already at the forefront of modern french stars a status which with varying degrees of success they both still hold to this day br br i have 3 more of pialat's films in my vhs to watch pile albeit all in french without english subtitles due to this fact but also loulou's oppressive realism in spite of its undeniable artistic merit i can't say that i'm in any particular hurry to check them out now
<START> i saw this movie primarily to see brooke burke as jill who i had meet briefly in la at a modeling trade show in her first feature film i was hoping to see more of her but thought she did very well acting her role since she is such a beautiful and poised tv host and model it was not surprising i was left wondering why she was killed and what happened as a result maybe i just missed it br br i wasn't really sure about the genre of this movie and although i liked the actors i felt like it was for a college audience i tried to keep an open mind considering horror wasn't my favorite genre but felt like i had outgrown the gags it seemed to drag out in some places leave you guessing in some places about what powers the evil professor had and like a lot of other films had an unsatisfying ending br br having written a couple of scripts i know a lot of this is difficult and may come down to personal opinions how many movies you have seen studied and those you relate with at a point in time br br in a nutshell i found it interesting but not a satisfying plot and ending for me if jill brooke burke would have returned through the portal in the end and kicked everyone's ass that would be a satisfying ending and would earn a higher rating
<START> one of the more enjoyable aspects of asian cinema or indeed most anything done outside these holier than thou united states are the permutations that crop up in post world war two japanese manga comics for instance are to be found a veritable endless variety of subjects many of them handled in uniquely imaginative fashion the same thing happens in genre film making as well though again i'm referring to movies made outside the u where we're just too sophisticated in our close mindedness to appreciate anything that isn't about or by us would an american company for instance back not one but a series of movies featuring a masked professional wrestler el santo or a werewolf paul naschy or a real life martial artist bruce lee as for television forget it while i still love the kung fu series that starred the late david carradine i've always felt that the americanized version of asian martial arts was how to put it kindly a bit lacking to this very day there hasn't been a pay per view channel to feature asian martial artists playing asian martial artists in asia there are lots of soft core porn masquerading as entertainment shows but the so called action channel for instance has yet to import or to produce a true martial arts teleseries before brother cadfile was investigating murders on the bbc there was of all things at least one kung fu movie that featured a group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder mystery the 5 deadly venoms in its own right as fascinating as any other genre based whodunit western cop show etc this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work it's now available from dragon dynasty and the print is beautiful and the dvd commentary by bey logan is exactly the kind of intelligent thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve if you're a martial arts movie fan rejoice one of the greatest movie genres of all time specifically the martial arts movies of the 1970s and early 1980s are getting a long overdue second life and greatly appreciated second look on dvd
<START> turgid dialogue feeble characterization harvey keitel a judge he plays more like an off duty hitman and a tension free plot conspire to make one of the unfunniest films of all time you feel sorry for the cast as they try to extract comedy from a dire and lifeless script avoid
<START> br br step aside for hollywood veterans the wayan brothers were 'asked' thats what hollyweird demanded and thats what it got however like so many of its recent decisions this one was a stupendous mistake br br the director is so out of touch with todays audience attempting to bring back physical pratfalls and gags in place of funny dialogue is just a disaster i knew it the audience knew it and the cast knew it br br what a shame why did they ever consider changing directors not only that but the two wayan brothers played as two of four primary characters without them its just a farce and a sad one br br sp br br
<START> i have loved this movie all of my life it's such an intelligent story also with plenty of classical allusions eg the ship that went missing decades earlier was called the bellerophon well in classical mythology this was the man who slew the chimera a legendary beast composed of two or more other creatures in fp walter pidgeon is clearly the chimera himself and his id monster br br i like movies where the writers have clearly credited their audiences with a modicum of intelligence unlike most modern blockbusters which spend 150m on special effects but about 1 50 on a screenplay br br cheers
<START> i used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap if you look at promotional pictures posters of the bill now you will see either two of the officers hugging kissing or something to do with friendships whereas promotional pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime this proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing police drama to an average type of television soap when i watch it i feel like i'm watching a police version of coronation street or something similar i have to say i still like the bill as i'm interested in police work and that type of thing but i really miss the greatness that the bill used to have i want to rate it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill over br br as for the script and characters they have both gone downhill most of the great characters are gone now although a few still remain i think and i'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely aren't its just that they lack the tough looks personalities and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are at the moment involved with silly relationships and family trouble br br overall being one of the only police programs on television these days the bill will always be a crappily interesting thing to watch but like i say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness if thats the right spelling and would now be classed as a terrible unreal television soap br br recommended to watch for a good laugh over the stupidity of the police officers involved 2 10
<START> this german documentary in english is about a scottish environmental sculptor named andy goldsworthy he makes art from objects he finds in nature for example early in the film we see him taking sections of icicles and gluing them together with a little moisture into a serpentine shape that seems to repeatedly go through a vertical rock br br of course the icicles melt but that transience is a part of most of goldsworthy's work he goes to a site and gets a feeling for it deciding intuitively what to make that day he talks of having a dialog with the rocks and other materials that he works with attempting to work with rather than against them it might be stones or flowers or leaves or sticks the sculpture might last for minutes or years or might not even last long enough to be completed and photographed the work seems to be more of a process than a goal br br the film and the work is beautiful inspiring and thought provoking it moves pretty slowly which is appropriate for the material but you should be sure to go when you have had a good night's sleep but do go if you have the opportunity br br search the web for some other pages about andy goldsworthy or to read about his local sculpture at stanford university there are also several books available with photographs of his sculptures br br my thoughts skip reading this part if you want to find what this film means to you completely independently i recall a couple of ideas that occurred to me while watching the film which i thought i would share for those of you still reading first the transitory nature of much of andy goldsworthy's work reminded me of the natural ebb and flow of human life we're born we live and eventually we die that's natural and that's also naturally a part of goldsworthy's art br br the other thought was to be awestruck with the way that goldsworthy has managed to integrate his passion and his work so thoroughly into his life most of us have work which is tolerated at best a life which we hardly notice living and passions which we really mean to spend more time on if we even remember what they are andy goldsworthy has managed to create an amalgam of all of these aspects of his life that looks like it works very well and is nourishing for him and those around him wow br br seen on 8 28 2002
<START> this film once sensational for its forward thinking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation has been reduced by time to a mere curiosity it seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film had been banned and seized by governments in many countries given how socialistic sweden eventually became the 'radicalism' of its politics once controversial appear naive and almost mainstream four decades later and its sex scenes at one time the subject of sensational obscenity trials look pretty tame in a modern context nevertheless the film and accompanying documentaries detailing its many controversies and influences remains marginally watchable as an early reliquary of 60's youth rebellion one part of the film that still holds up its self consciousness with respect to the 'fourth wall' every once in a while the filmmakers film themselves making the film the satiric playfulness of this still elicits a chuckle
<START> it's a road movie with a killer on board brian kessler david duchovny a sophisticated urbane writer wants to conduct field research on american serial killers but neither he nor his girlfriend carrie michelle forbes has the money for a cross country tour of murder sites so they advertise for someone to share travel expenses who they end up with is a young couple early grayce brad pitt and his girlfriend adele juliette lewis two better examples of poor white trash you will never find in all of cinema br br indeed early and adele are what make this film so entertaining as they babble cackle confide muse speculate drool and otherwise behave in ways i haven't seen since reruns of the beverly hillbillies early's idea of california people think faster out there on account of all that warm weather cold weather makes people stupid that's enough to convince adele i guess that explains why there are so many stupid people around here to which early responds proudly it sure does early continues to instruct adele about california you never have to buy no fruit on account it's all on the trees and they ain't got no speed limits and i hear your first month's rent is free state law br br but poor early has some well mental problems which become ever more obvious to brian and carrie as the four travelers proceed west across the u s as they enter the desert southwest with its beautifully stark landscape kalifornia starts to look more and more like the hitcher 1986 and early starts to act more and more like john ryder everyone's maniacal hitchhiker whose terror seemed so unstoppable br br in kalifornia the acting is uneven duchovny's performance is flat brad pitt is surprisingly effective despite his overacting at times michelle forbes is great as the avant garde photographic artist but my choice for best performance goes to juliette lewis with her nasal voice and heavy duty southern accent she is stunning as the naive highly animated child like adele br br toward the end the film takes on a twilight zone feel to it as our travelers enter a nevada nuclear test site with a dilapidated old house full of test mannequins the plot dissolves rather messily into unnecessary and preposterous violence an ending that was somewhat disappointing br br overall however kalifornia is an entertaining film thanks to a clever concept great scenery especially in the second half good cinematography great dialogue and that wonderful performance by juliette lewis
<START> alexandre aja's remake of the hills have eyes was one of the bright spots of 2006 not only was it a remake of a classic horror film but it was pretty damned good too so nearly a year later we are being treated to the sequel to that remake while original scripter wes craven is back as producer and co scripted this film just fails to rise to the level set by the original and the remake a group of military trainees stop by in the desert to check in on some scientists and find themselves run afoul of the mutant family from the first film at least those that remain plus some new ones there's plenty of gore to be had here what annoys me about this film is the utter lack of characterization the viewer does not give a damn about what happens to any of these people because we haven't gotten into them even the mutants had some characterization last time out and this time nothing gore for the sake of gore is pointless there has to be a reason for this to happen for it to be interesting nothing that happens here is interesting and what is it lately with rape scenes in films here we get yet another one for no real reason hopefully this is one set of hills that won't be visited again
<START> i came to watch guerrilla part two of steven soderbergh's biopic of che guevara without having seen the preceding film and without more than a cursory knowledge of che's life at the same time i was rather apprehensive that this would be both a heavy going history lesson and an unrepentant love letter to the iconic revolutionary as it turns out this film far exceeded my expectations br br guerrilla works remarkably well as a standalone film the story of che's failed attempt to lead a revolution in bolivia then under military rule is a compelling tragedy the initial impetus brought by che's arrival incognito to lead the guerrilla war is lost as misfortune follows misfortune the odds stack up against the revolutionaries us backing for the bolivian army hostile conditions in the rainforest suspicious locals and che's failing health are just some of the difficulties which beset the nascent rebellion br br soderbergh's portrayal of che is largely uncritical but this film is no hagiography the style is refreshingly undramatic with a subtle and effective soundtrack by alberto iglesias adding quiet drama to many scenes che is undoubtedly the centre of the film but there are very few close ups of his face and we are encouraged to see the people fighting alongside him and sometimes against him too where soderbergh wishes to demonstrate che's virtues we see it in small episodes such as the loyal acolyte who upbraids two fellow guerrillas when they question che's leadership and emphasises the sacrifice that he has made in leaving behind cuba to fight again for revolution br br the direction throughout is superb part two feels tightly edited despite its narrow focus and is able to communicate a great deal through images without the need for a narrator to spell things out for the audience at the start of the film we see a few short clips of lavish parties in post revolutionary cuba immediately furnishing us with ideas as to why che would sacrifice his old life to fight again in another country later on the portrayal of guerrillas marching through the unending rainforests stands out as a strikingly beautiful scene and helps to create a feeling of the enormity of the task before this tiny band of revolutionaries br br if there is a problem with the film it is the distance between the viewer and che which though it does allow us to appreciate the context of the insurgency and the people around him makes it hard for us to understand him better as a person true benicio del toro is utterly convincing in the lead role Â so much so that it is difficult to remember that you are watching an actor and not the man himself however watching guerrilla as a standalone film means that we are given precious little insight into what is shaping che's thoughts words and actions it is to be hoped that this is more to the fore in the first part of soderbergh's biopic i cannot comment on that yet and certainly the strength of part two is making me look forward eagerly to seeing the prequel
<START> young erendira and her tyrranical grandmother provide for a great fantasy from the new world this interpretation of gabriel garcia marquez' la incrÃ©ible y triste historia da la cÃ¡ndida erÃ©ndira may not rub marquez purists the right way eventhough the story stays intact and still carries the full force of the work the strength of this film is in its acting especially papas as the grandmother marquez fans and marquez novices alike will enjoy this movie for its real gritty brand of witt
<START> yes its an art to successfully make a slow paced thriller br br the story unfolds in nice volumes while you don't even notice it happening br br fine performance by robin williams the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film however the core plot is very engaging the movie doesn't rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering the direction is good use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good br br very nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story
<START> well i must say that this was one hell of a fun movie despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty cheesy and there were some odd moments where the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason i was not disappointed the story was actually pretty interesting the last member of the poison clan must track down the other five members and discover who among them is using their skills for evil and who is using them for good the catch being that during training all of the clan were masked and all have since returned to society in disguise and changed their names br br the fights are a joy to watch as each member of the poison clan has a different fighting style toad my favorite snake scorpion lizard and centipede the fight scenes have the actors jumping all over the place and thankfully the camera stays planted and uses a wide enough shot so you can clearly see all of the action br br the one drawback to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence but stick with it and you won't be disappointed
<START> hilarious hardly begins to describe this one of a kind genuine tour de star wars force luke how strong vader the strength of a small pony in which being the master he is he doesn't even break a sweat ingeniously sparing himself mascara leakage and that's with almost 2 hours of whirling his way thru history its birthplace europe and more br br from heimlich's middle of the night i've invented a maneuver to the british empire's do you have a flag and ancient deadbeat gods jeff the god of biscuits and many more this is fish flop on the floor to jumpstart your lungs funny br br and i confess to having passed on this video dozens of times over the years seeing as a british transvestite standup vogueing on a chair is one longshot of a rental after all especially one going back 10 years now and yet the material is not only timeless but almost oracular turning present day into nothing more than an amplified funnier sadder version of where we were at a decade ago although come to think about it that may just be a coincidence
