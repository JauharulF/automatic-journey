<START> this isn't one of arbuckle's or keaton's better films that's for sure fatty's wife is tired of all his heavy drinking so she takes him to a sanitarium where a psychiatrist keaton claims to have a guaranteed cure well once there arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and is taken to surgery then he escapes and is chased about the place where he meets a cute girl who also wants to escape finally despite staff chasing them about they escape at which point it becomes apparent that the girl is crazy and arbuckle is soon recaptured however he awakens and everything after the surgery has all been a dream there was no sexy crazy girl and dr keaton isn't as big an incompetent as he seemed in the dream br br a lack of humor is the biggest problem with the film sure making fun of mentally ill people is pretty low but in its day it was guaranteed laughs i'd laugh too if there was just something funny to respond to a lot of energy and that's all br br fyi during one of the chase sequences fatty wonders into a race for men over 200 pounds wow what are the odds of that and shortly after this he backs into a post on which the number 5 was just freshly painted as a result the five is now on the back of fatty's shirt and he looks like a regular participant however the number should have appeared backwards on fatty's shirt but came out front ways a mistake as they should have realized the mirror image would have been a backwards 5
<START> incarcerated train robber near yuma breaks free his chain gang and heads for the retired sheriff responsible for killing his wife as well as a hidden stash of gold which remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter attempt to bring the western genre up to date with 1970s style violence and brutality isn't even in the same league as some of the new fangled westerns which came out of the late '60s it is impossibly simple and square with the female characters merely around as punching bags and possible rape victims as the former sheriff back in command charlton heston gives one of his laziest least inspired performances ever he has one good moment attempting to read a letter and fumbling for his glasses james coburn as the half mad half breed is pretty much on auto pilot as well but coburn has a way of turning even the hoariest dialogue and situations into something prickly and unnerving it's his show all the way 1 2 from
<START> after buying the dvd in a bargain bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover i popped it in the dvd player and everything looked good nice animated menus and a whole lot of extra features but when i played the movie itself what a let down it is the worst thing i have ever seen and i have seen some bad movies in my time the comment that praises the movie here at imdb is actually from the people who made the film so don't believe it unless you like to waste your cash
<START> i've read a few of the reviews and i'm kinda sad that a lot of the story seems glossed over its easy to do because its not a book its a movie and there's only so much that can be done in a movie us or canadian or anywhere br br colm feore does at least for a recovering f g hag like myself a great job of not only playing the 'friendly neighborhood' gay man but playing sick i mean the man really can't get much more pale though you might never know it from the strip down near the um end br br if you need decrepit there are a few sking movies you might like br br being the daughter of a recovering alchoholic the druggie brother david cubitt was the trick for me i'm going to give him cred he grew up quick and believe me that's good and as an aspiring writer moimeme i can dig a lot of his insights and overviews but i'm more prosy than poetic br br i may be easy to please but i enjoyed it a nice story pretty well put together by canadians quelle surprise just toed the line of the 'movie of the week ' missing it by not being as drawn out greatly appreciated and it was rather cleverly portrayed
<START> i must say that i had wanted to see this film for a long time and i was not disappointed the acting of dominic monaghan is simply fantastic as a part insomniac myself i can relate with how the story develops i have never experienced anything of the sort but some awake moments overlap the sleeping and it can be scary it was a great film worth every penny i hope that one day i can work with tess myself it would be an honor and beyond i can recommend it for everybody maybe not small children as they may get scared but if you are an insomniac like me you'll understand the world the mysteries and the fear you'll love it br br f
<START> i remember seeing this one when i was seven or eight i must have found the characters round because they left a impression in my mind that lasted for a long time after the end of the movie and the ending now that's sad well for a 7 8 year old kid br br i had the opportunity of seeing this movie again lately and found that the plot was too simple the character two dimensional i guess it's the kind of movie that you can only with the innocence of a young child pity br br i recommend this one for all you parents with small kids i saw it in its original french version so i cannot tell you whether the translation is good or not
<START> sandra bernhard's without you i'm nothing the movie released in 1990 followed on the heels of her 1988 off broadway stage production what she and others refer to in the movie as her smash hit one woman show br br there were several changes in monologues and one liners and the movie version visually re vamps the story taking sandra from a fabulous existence as a successful stage performer in new york during what she calls her superstar summer to an illusory almost desperate existence back in her home in los angeles her fictional manager in the film refers to it as getting sandra back to her roots to upscale supper clubs like the parisian room br br there's a point to be made here sandra tries to appeal her liberal worldview and her sometimes harsh critique of american pop culture to an audience that doesn't completely see it in l a she's playing to a predominantly black audience trying to relate her ideas when all these people seem to want is shashonna a madonna look alike stripper and even then with shashonna dancing to drum beats that resemble those from like a virgin there's not much to be said for the audience's enjoyment of the show the scene in the club throughout the movie is dryer than a bone a funny scene to catch is of a rotund man from the audience helping shashonna out of her pants br br but if she's going down sandra's doing so with style and force conveying everything from foul confidence to punctured vulnerability right to the point at which she's naked literally pleading for acceptance and yet somehow still swimming in the pool of her own transparent stardom her depictions of interactions with the likes of calvin klein jerry lewis bianca jagger ralph lauren and what we're lead to believe is warren beatty are fictional and hilarious br br sandra begins her show in her most awkward moment performing a quiet but mystifying rendition of nina simone's song four women while dressed in a mufti and other african garb singing lines such as my skin is black my hair is wooly and they call me sweet thing br br she resurrects and celebrates the ghosts of underworld art in a tremendously funny description of the frenzied estate auction for andy warhol leave it to andy to have the wisdom and sensitivity into the hours and hours of toil and labor that went into the indian product that they've been so lucky to cash in on this whole santa fe thing happening br br she expounds on the excessiveness of hollywood consoling a distraught friend then admonishing him saying mister if this is about ishtar i'm getting up right now and walking out of your life forever because that's too self indulgent even for me br br sandra illustrates the expectations of women in the age of feminism dressed as a cosmo girl sandra retells her young girl fantasy to become an executive secretary and marry her boss she eventually concludes in relief i'll never be a statistic not me i'm under 35 and i'm going to be married br br sandra extols the opening of sexuality in society when he touches you in the night does it feel all right or does it feel real i say it feels real mighty real br br finally she cries for change in progressive american society by channeling disco greats patrick cowley and sylvester and proclaiming eventually everyone will funk br br all this comes in the form of glitzy schmaltzy but wonderful cabaret performances of songs written and originated by billy paul burt bacharach hank williams and laura nyro to name a few at the same time the idealized fictional incarnation of sandra her self generated mirror image floats around town a beautiful black model with flowing gowns and tight bustiers reading the kabala studying chemistry and listening to nwa rap music br br in without you i'm nothing sandra bernhard explores emotions and existences that up until then she'd only toyed with as a regular guest on late night with david letterman her almost child like enthusiasm for shock exhibited throughout the '80s is thrown aside in the face of a subtler allure and her confidence in the face of materialism and american celebrity proves refreshing this approach to comedy would change sandra's direction forever and mark the more mature more personable entertainer to come br br if you like subtle humor to the point of engaging in inside jokes about glamour celebrity sex loneliness despair and shallow expressions of love and kinship this movie will keep you in stitches it may not be meant to be funny across the board perhaps it's a bit unsettling or even maudlin for some but consider the emptiness of the world sandra paints for you and you'll understand just how funny and brilliant she really is br br but see without you i'm nothing with a friend in the know because it's definitely funnier that way before you know it the two of you will be trading sandra barbs and confusing the hell out of everyone else
<START> wow a truly fantastic 'trip' movie that has tons of super surreal imagery dark intent and a black pretty strange sense of how cartoon animals must see the world it's populated with a very cute off world bunch of characters that bend and flow with warped backgrounds as with all cool fantasy the wandering plot is secondary to the eye popping visuals and we follow a little cat and his zombie sister as they encounter death deluge water elephants samurai swordsmen and pigs that fish i'd never heard of it but now i love it probably because it reminded me of the surreal pencil work of american cartoonist bill plympton it's a demented delight for fans of odd pretty things and it had me glued to the screen for fear i'd miss something amazing simply put it's 'hello kitty' without the 'o'
<START> branagh is one of the few who understands the difference between a film and a play hamlet is probably the most faithful adaptation of shakespeare to a film and yet is a very dynamic film almost an action thriller the scene of hamlet's meeting with his father's ghost won't leave your mind
<START> this movie was crap with a capital c the opening scene showed promise but that promise was broken shortly after the viewer learns where the plot is going br br and the wooden statue morty who was rather creepy in the original film looks plain goofy in this one it was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic costume and by the way who else thinks morty is one of the most un scary names on planet earth it ranks right up there with jimmy or fred when it comes to horror value or why not just name the wooden statute henry freakin' kissinger run it's dr kissinger that'd be about as scary as morty br br and then there's a scene where the hero hits his father's tombstone with a sledgehammer you might guess a two by four someone might venture no he angrily beats his father's tombstone with a twig a freakin' twig but worse than that once the characters walk away the tombstone actually and inexplicably bleeds oh brother br br there's also a native american guy who lives with the main character's grandparents but apparently does nothing except morty maintenance he perpetuates creepy morty legends warns those who scoff and even fixes morty's arm when it becomes damaged during a childish prank but for all his respect for and tenderness toward morty does morty give a rat's hairy behind no br br the movie drags on and eventually several people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears sort of this film is a real yawner don't rent it
<START> never having seen this movie based on the entertaining novel by nicholas katzenbach and taking into consideration the first rate cast assembled for the production we decided to take a look just cause while not a horrible film takes too many liberties with the original material that jeb stuart didn't quite succeed in his treatment arne glimcher directed br br the first thing we think when a young black man is hauled to the local precinct for interrogation is police brutality after all sheriff tanny brown and police officer wilcox show no mercy in beating bobby earl who is accused of killing a young white girl we feel horrified by what the officers do to the prisoner br br then the scene changes evangeline bobby earl's grandmother is sent north to ask a distinguished harvard professor a retired lawyer the young man wants paul armstrong to defend him she old woman is convincing enough for armstrong to take a look at the case he is also convinced of the young man's innocence br br things are not exactly what we thought they were when blair sullivan a man who is serving time in the same facility as bobby earl comes forward to tell about how he is connected to the young girl's murder and changes the dynamics of the case the way it plays in the movie it serves to confuse the viewer and distract armstrong from arriving at the truth br br this thriller is made enjoyable by sean connery who plays armstrong laurence fishburne an intense actor makes a fine impression as the sheriff who as far as we can see is guilty of abusing his prisoner ed harris has a wonderful opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors blair underwood kate capshaw ruby dee and the young scarlett johansson are seen in supporting roles br br the film even with its faults will not disappoint
<START> what seemed as a good premise for a movie unfortunately it fails to deliver on nearly every level very hard to follow at the start of the movie i actually found myself fighting the urge to turn it off the biggest problem from a visual aspect is the fact that the camera work is simply over the top with so many arty splicings and semi subliminal cuts throughout the movie that actually distracts you from the from the overall story it really tries too hard to immerse you in the moment and build to a suspenseful ending but the movie just has so many half conceived characters and non relevant script it just leaves you feeling disappointed and confused as to why they tried to go so deep with it
<START> if you didn't enjoy this movie either your dead or you hate adam sandler or don cheadle br br an excellent cast all of who gave good performances this movie proved that adam sandler is good actor despite what critics say adam sandler is becoming a very well respected actor it all started with his performance in big daddy then he did a couple bad movies then he broke through with terrific performance in 50 first dates the longest yard then click and now reign over me br br back to the movie adam sandler plays a man who has lost everything the closest thing to family he has are a mother in law and father in law after his old college roommate cheadle ran into him he seems to turn his life around i will say no more because i do not want to ruin the movie but i strongly recommend this movie one of the best movies of 2007
<START> this film resembles in many ways enemy of the state' with will smith and gene hackman as we have an innocent black man being pursued by the government' with all the modern technology known to man usually when storyline is copied like this the result is a disaster that does not apply here of course i love everything david morse does so maybe my comments are not fair but there were more good things about this film then that the main baddy played by doug hutchison was brilliant and the story flowed with excellent extras such as david paymer and robert pastorelli our hero alvin sanders played by jamie foxx was however irritating most of the part he is so out of place cracking bad jokes evoking no sympathy from the audience or not to begin with the strange thing is that he kinda grows on you and on his followers as well i didn't expect much when i rented it but was surprised with a good solid action movie with comedy bits 7 10
<START> it's one of those dramas that's so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny the script is absolutely dire direction appalling lighting purely armature the only thing letting it down from a true so bad it's good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard but doesn't at least destroy any speeches there's continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout and finally last but not least the acting is appalling for a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this
<START> an interesting change from the first one there was more mystery to this movie then the first even when it ends your asking yourself what happened who was the killer there are some good parts through the movie the first half starts off slow and then in the last half the pace picks up all up the movie is enjoyable the story is 22 years after the events that occured in the first film norman bates is out of an asylum and back to the bates motel but when a woman turns up claiming to be his real mother things start going wrong perkins plays an aged norman well again and the scene at the end was excellent he swang that spade awfully hard
<START> anyone who had never seen anything like the fight scenes in the matrix has never seen this movie the fight scenes were choreographed by action scene psychopath yuen woo ping who also did the fights in the matrix and the fight scenes are somethin br br li plays a supersoldier who feels no pain who now lives a life as a pacifist librarian ya got me when other evil supersoldiers begin killing off local drug lords to take over the drug trade li teams up with his cop buddy to help stop them br br there are some absolutely crazy things going on in this movie one badguy gets his arm lopped off with a pane of glass and hardly notices the fights scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches the body count is way up there li has seldom been better and he has surrounded himself with a bevy of beautiful female costars yip kicks some serious ass as a fellow supersoldier anthony wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord no suprises there he makes a cameo in every hk movie it's unfortunate they don't make action movies like this in the us i wouldn't have to sit through all of these horrible dubbing jobs to see that action that i crave so much recommended
<START> i love the comics although i do have problems fully understanding the stories Â the visual style is unique with all its dirt dust and decay so i thought i knew what i was up for surprisingly i understood the main plot Â but some extremely poorly decisions where made for its visual style br br i mean really bad looking cg human actors in close ups Âwhy it did not work at all horus and the other egyption gods was successfully made in cg and very close to the comic version br br i think with real actors this movie could have been a cult movie br br what a shame
<START> 1st watched 8 3 2003 2 out of 10 dir brad sykes mindless 3 d movie about flesh eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle and yes we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3d wow not that has been done time and time again in 2d in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh eating that's what made the original zombie classics good the flesh eating was just thrown in as an extra we're actually bored throughout most of this 3 part chronicle because of the lame twilight zone like easily understood and slow pacingly revealed finale's the last story is actually the story the movie started with having a reporter investigating a so called ghost town and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well well i think i've said enough watch the classics not this 3d bore feast
