<START> growing up joe strummer was a hero of mine but even i was left cold by this film for better and worse the future is unwritten is not a straightforward behind the music style documentary rather it is a biographical art film chock full of interviews performance footage home movies and mostly pointless animation sketches lifted from animal farm the movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour br br the campfire format while touching in thought is actually pretty annoying in execution first off without titles its hard to even know who half of these interviewees are secondly who really needs to hear people like bono johnny depp and john cusack mouth butt licking hosannas about the man they were not relevant to strummer's life and their opinions add nothing to his story br br this picture is at it's best when strummer through taped interviews and conversation touches on facets of his life most people did not know about the suicide of his older brother coming to terms with the death of his parents the joy of fatherhood to me these were most moving because it showed joe strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we all must face br br there have been better more straightforward documentaries about strummer and the clash westway vh1 legends and kurt loder's narrated mtv documentary from the early 90's come to mind joe strummer the future is unwritten is for diehards only
<START> a trio of low life criminals led by matt dillon botches a late night burglary they flee but quickly cross paths with the police who just happen to be in hot pursuit of a terrorist of course the police mistake the burglar gang for the terrorist the real terrorist gets away and the burglars are forced to take refuge in a small dive of a bar taking hostages unaware why the police are so intent on catching them and guess who else has picked the bar as a sanctuary for the night br br unbelievable absolutely and it goes down hill from there spacey did acquire a good bit of acting talent matt dillon faye dunaway gary sinise viggo mortensen and m emmett walsh but they're all wasted mostly because after all the characters get stuck in the bar all they do for the remainder of the film is argue endlessly and aimlessly long before the conclusion of the film you've stopped giving a damn about what happens to them
<START> there have been many movies featuring bigfoot the majority of which are not good but most at least have a goofy charm to them sasquatch hunters doesn't even have that going for it it's just a crashing bore br br sasquatch hunters is about a group of paleontologists primatologists and forest rangers that venture off into a remote part of a pacific northwest forest bones belonging to some sort of abnormally large primate have been discovered in this region and since apes aren't natural to north america to begin with this leads to a scientific expedition sure enough they soon discover a whole burial ground full of the skeletal remains of these enormous ape like creatures i think we all know what happens to people that disturb ancient burial grounds in the movies br br the first half of the movie consists of uninteresting interchangeable characters assembling their gear hiking through the woods stopping to rest hiking through the woods some more pausing long enough to investigate and discuss a few findings along the way yet more hiking through the woods looking for a group member that has vanished even more hiking through the woods digging through dirt random theorizing and gathering around a campfire to discuss what little they've done that day when sasquatch finally shows up it just turns into people stumbling around in the dark while being picked off one at a time done in a blink and you missed it fashion and the actual killing occurs off camera all of this is excruciatingly boring br br the movie wants to be taken seriously and the director is clearly trying to build suspense but there is none to be found thus we are left with dull drawn out scenes of people wandering around the woods just to get somewhere and wander around the woods at night trying to act scared i'd be lying if i said i didn't make liberal use of the fast forward button to speed these scenes up br br as for sasquatch himself much like every other character else in the movie it doesn't have much to do and lacks a distinct personality it looks like a shaggier version of king kong which isn't all that bad except in the scenes where they used cgi instead of a man in a bigfoot costume which is painfully obvious during the daylight monster scenes a part of me can't help but feel that even using computer effects to bring bigfoot to life is a tad sacrilegious if there is any single movie monster that i believe should only be brought to life through situation it's bigfoot br br this is one of those movies that doesn't so much have a plot as it does a premise that's all it really is a premise which the people involved stretched out to make a feature length motion picture without bothering to add all the ingredients to make a worthwhile movie
<START> this will not likely be voted best comedy of the year a few too many coincidences and plot holes however we are talking about a movie where a hit man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldn't come as too much of a surprise brosnan is excellent in this role gone is the wooden james bond a role he was wasted in if he can maintain this kind of quality i hope he continues to make comedies greg kinnear is also excellent as brosnan's straight man i've read a few negative comments in here about hope davis but i thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within there are lots of good chuckles as brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where i nearly died laughing my father a consultant nearly lost it when julian describes himself as a facilitator much like grosse pointe blank another hit man comedy the humour can be very dark if you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself
<START> stranger than fiction angered me so much i signed up on imdb just to write this review stranger than fiction is a surprisingly complex touching and thought provoking movie until the very end once you suspend multiple lapses of logic why didn't will ferrell hear emma thompson's voice 10 years ago when she fist started writing her book the phone rang the phone rang again how could she not know it's him calling etc the movie challenges one's thoughts about mortality fate and sacrifice br br the brief history of literary themes provided by dustin hoffman should especially entertain former english majors and maggie gyllenhaal is always a pleasure even though will ferrell might just as easily be an ax murderer as a bumbling soul her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faith br br ah but the ending until the very end i would have given 9 out of 10 stars to this movie the movie as a metaphor for life's journey as a tribute to the notion of 'writing true ' as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy but not both is outstanding the entire movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of will ferrell's fate and no matter how endearing a character he may have become we know full well why we will accept the ending the last act occurs the screen goes white the credits roll a profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film an end that would have been debated for weeks br br no no credits rolled say it isn't so say hollywood didn't tack on another 10 minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the movie dustin hoffman got it right when he said it's no longer a masterpiece it's ok an apt review of the movie except to me it wasn't even ok i was so offended about the betrayal of 'writing true ' about the decision to pander the film that i actually burst into angry tears explaining this on the ride home from the movie i don't often cry i could care less about most movies but i am still angry about this one br br my questions for zack helm the writer are this did the original movie end when the screen went white and were you forced by the vapid movie powers that be to tack on an ending unfaithful to the core of the movie or did you tack that maudlin ending on yourself i've read you're brilliant i hope your original script ended the movie the first time br br i know zack helm will never see this review and i've been unable to find a contact for him to ask myself but please movie goers am i the only one who feels this way about stranger than fiction one good thing came from me seeing this movie i doubly admire lost in translation now
<START> i cannot believe this woodenly written and directed piece of cliche film got made there are about four good looking shots the director should think about switching to still photography and that's it a strong cast is utterly wasted scenes repeatedly end at the least interesting moments and the script says nothing new please spare yourself this movie
<START> it kept my attention to the end however without spoiling the film for anyone when she fixed the fridge by getting a book from the library you knew how the film would end when she went back to library for a book on self defence against and assassin the film for me said nothing of worth is becoming an assassin really a remedy for mental illness or just another symptom
<START> consider for a moment what it must be like to be uwe boll somewhere perhaps in those places that jack nicholson said 'you don't talk about at parties' boll knows that david lean had head lice as a child that had more talent for film making than him gore whores metal heads and the socially dysfunctional may bump into him on the circuit and tell him otherwise but general audiences find the teutonic helmsman's output so bereft of originality wit or imagination that he's become the internet's bogeyman Â an online discursive synonym for photochemical excrement boll does his best to ride over these naysayers exploiting tax credits available in germany and canada to keep working and raising money from a network of dentists as zero mostel did with old ladies in the producers the difference being that mostel's character knew he was making bowel fill maybe uwe knows it too br br such is the level of hostility toward each new 'bollbuster' that imdb patrons sabotage their ratings by voting 1 before they've seen it boll's attempts at silencing his critics by challenging them to a boxing match and knocking them out just made them more determined indeed he's probably the only filmmaker that's boosted thesaurus sales as critics search for inventive ways of describing garbage br br this onslaught has made uwe a very thick skinned man so much so that he must feel like he's wrapped in a carpet but one who feels as if he's bullied by the entire world like most people in that situation he lashes out determined to upset as many people as possible with the memory of a tearful evening holding variety's review of house of the dead never too far from the surface this 'i know you are but what am i' strategy for reclaiming the initiative produced the blunt satire of postal which attempted to napalm the dissenters with jokes about 9 11 christian fundamentalism jihad nazism and paedophilia such a litany of invective requires a satirist with the mind of peter cook and the visual imagination of chris morris but the closest boll gets to either man is the o in their surname br br in seed shot back to back with the aforementioned game adaptation boll is back with a story about a sadistic serial murderer is there any other kind who gets the chair only for two attempts to fail in permanently curtailing all signs of life mindful of the fictional law that says anyone still alive after 3 attempts must go free though if you'd been fried with that much electricity why would you want to they pronounce him legally dead and bury him only for the disgruntled killer to resurface and begin a whirlwind tour of his gaolers br br boll begins his 'exploration of nihilistic rage' with seed watching footage of animals being tortured for experimental purposes from there we're treated to the killer's stock in trade Â kidnapping dogs babies and grown women and allowing them to starve to death on camera only to become maggot food we're invited to reflect on what a depraved race of amoral meat sacks we all are Â our inhumanity to each other and our fellow creatures acting as a lighting rod that acts as a catalyst for the most disgusting vestiges of the human condition yes we're worthless gormless sadists and worse than that we won't give uwe a good rating on the imdb in short humanity is bunk br br of course you might think that uwe relies on our worst excesses for his livelihood and with that in mind it's a bit of a bipolar piece on one hand hating its audience and positively basting itself in the sour milk of human kindness Â the milk that poor old boll has had to drink for so long while simultaneously whipping out its member and inviting those with a pornographic lust for on screen depravity to marvel at its sheer arse splitting girth br br the result says nothing about society and its discontents more the corrosive effect bad press is having on its director poor uwe is obviously a very angry man Â one scene in which a poor woman gets her brains hammered to a pulp while tied to a chair no doubt a surrogate for his own fantasy's about dispatching various web critics that it's there but takes an avant garde approach by failing to be attached to any kind of narrative thread shows that boll is a pornographer whose happy to engage with the blood lust of his audience and knows that plot is surplus to requirements he's made a film which is competently shot but utterly desolate i wanted to make a horror movie that was no fun boll told the audience at the film's world premiere and he has on that flimsy manifesto succeeded but if this was supposed to convince the director's detractors that he was a serious genre filmmaker he'll need something genuine to say as well as a better more original way of saying it
<START> this was usually producer alexander korda's advice on set to many of his underlings the film is credited with three directors but in truth alex zoltan korda and william cameron menzies helped out pushing it to six br br for john kobal's 1987 book the top 100 movies his survey of 81 film critics saw the thief of bagdad reach 55th place a closer examination reveals only jose luis guarner john russell taylor and kobal himself actually voted for the picture but their high placings were enough to take it to near the half way mark br br the outbreak of the second world war saw the movie's production shifted around england and america eventually seeing completion in 1940 and winning three technical oscars like citizen kane it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than love br br the special effects outstanding for the time are still reasonable and actually hold up if you squint but it's not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions among them is an amusing horse constructed out of a kit model which when a key is inserted up it's rear end begins to fly there's also a killer toy of the six armed goddess kali perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her and a quite horrific looking giant spider also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet but most memorable has to be rex ingram appearing as in a superb moment of cinematic conceit a djinn genie nearly a thousand feet tall ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature and adds an element of danger to the proceedings and look out for the moment where he's tricked back into his bottle br br john justin does well as the arabic king who for some strange reason has an english accent and a stiff upper lip sabu the astonishingly muscled 15Âyear old is near namesake abu a likeably cocky thief after they cross paths with the evil jaffer conrad veidt justin finds himself blind and abu is turned into a dog when it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind ahmed's justin's perspective we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues in truth the second half is someway the better being full of greater incident and more fantastical in nature br br three small songs pepper the piece though as the film lasts for 100 minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient i wouldn't classify this as a musical it's all great fun justin and june duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads veidt is the boo hiss villain and abu is the youthful irrepressible robber it may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of 40s english movies but once you've sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in quite commendable
<START> i almost did not go see this movie because i remember march of the penguin was not that much exciting i went mainly because disney promised to plant a tree if i go see it on the opening weekend but after i did go see it it was simply amazing the fact that the photographers can capture impossible images are simply worth your money you also get to see different habitats different vegetation animals and natural phenomenons that will not only shock you simply because you would never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic but also touch your souls and raise the question of humanity versus the world of how our lives have deviated from nature to such a degree that we take for granted of the natural beauty and miracles that are quintessential to our biosphere you don't have to be an earth lover or a tree hugging environmentalist to appreciate the mere awesomeness of this documentary you simply have to be a curious soul who questions the value and miracle of living enjoy
<START> spoiler alert i wish i could discuss this without revealing specific plot points but i can't sorry br br i was looking for an imdb review of the george c scott movie when i stumbled across the summary and reviews for this version it had so many positive reviews that i decided to order it even though a while truncated and rushed i thought george c scott embodied the tortured nature and physical appearance of the book's rochester to a t and b even while looking at the dvd's cover i was thinking isn't timothy dalton too good looking for the role the latter concern was reinforced by the fact that i decided to re read the book while the dvd was on backorder that said the minute i started watching this i was captivated at first it was disconcerting to hear 1840's dialog spoken as written with little or no attempts at modernization but dalton and clarke threw themselves into it so thoroughly that i actually enjoyed the fact that the adapters trusted the audience to follow archaic speech to have so much of the book up on the screen was an extra bonus i know someone who won't watch any versions of jane eyre because who wants to see a film about a man who keeps a poor crazy woman in the attic frankly if someone who hadn't read the book stumbled across the hour and a half or two hour versions they would think that's pretty much all the story entails rochester's secret and its affect on everyone around him luckily this version is actually about jane eyre's whole life br br some people have criticized the casting dalton is too dashing clarke is too reserved i can't argue against the first point but he is so in the moment that i believe he is rochester to me clarke's performance is on the mark jane eyre is quiet guarded if one remembers the book so much of the adult jane's fieriness and passion occurs during her private struggles some of the criticisms baffle me reviewers say clarke is too short or isn't pretty enough the book goes on ad infinitum about how small and plain jane is ms clarke shouldn't be tall and the filmmakers toned down her looks to make jane's declarations of her lack of beauty credible she can scarcely help it if dalton is tall some say there is no chemistry between the leads what the scene when jane finally comes out of her room after the wedding fiasco fairly vibrates with passion and longing and sadness and regret and that's just the first example that comes to mind br br i do agree with some of the other criticisms i too missed more scenes with helen burns and the rivers siblings some of the dialog was oddly truncated when rochester declares jane you misjudge me i do not hate her because she is mad i waited for the rest of the exchange when rochester explains how if jane were to go mad he would still love and care for her it's a powerful moment in the book and i wish it had been included i think it was a mistake to bring a scene with rochester into the part of the story where jane is on her own it might have been done for clarity's sake but i found it jarring i wanted the sly humor of the scene where jane opines that rochester's ardor will cool and he'll become gruff again but he may like her again by and by dalton's performance is so good that the rare misstep is glaring when rochester weeps in the library i saw him as an actor doing a crying scene not as rochester as for the sets if anyone has ever caught an episode of the 1960's show dark shadows one knows what to expect very stark and sometimes rickety looking interiors others have commented thoroughly and succinctly about the make up job rochester sports at the end yikes it is bad the conclusion is too abrupt after all that anguish and suspense i wanted a more rounded off ending and on my copy of the dvd having credits at the beginning and end of all eleven 25 30 minute episodes gets to be a bit much that said i am so glad i have this film and will watch it again and again
<START> the best thing you can say about this movie is that if you are a fan of sonny chiba this movie gives you lots of him chiba makes speeches chiba poses chiba sneers chiba glares at the camera chiba punches and kicks the living sushi out of a whole bunch of bad guys chiba sits around on couches and chairs and looks thoughtful pensive chiba drives his car br br i enjoy chiba as an actor and a martial artist but even for a chiba fan this movie may have a little too much sonny chiba it's obviously something of a vanity vehicle for him and no i wouldn't put street fighter in the same category because in sf he plays a ruthless amoral anti hero and he shares the camera with an intriguing cast of friends and foes here he's front and center almost all the time and he tries to be batman captain america and bruce lee rolled into one toshiro mifune and chow yun fat couldn't pull this off for the length of an entire feature film and sonny just kind of wears out his welcome at least he could have changed out of his suit once in a while br br the movie is further messed up by an entirely gratuitous and badly done introductory sequence apparently tacked on to the front of the film for the american version and a goofy cheer viva chiba viva chiba that starts things on the wrong foot there is some astoundingly amateurish and inappropriate dubbing sonny or his usual english stand in apparently couldn't be bothered to do the vocals for the american version so they got some poor dope with an entirely different and smoother voice and dialect that is quite jarring coming from the face we all know and love from street fighter br br even with all those flaws and the overexposure this could still be a minor classic but the camera work and the fight scenes are hopelessly cheesy i'm willing to believe that karate actually works if someone as amazing as chiba's character is supposed to be does it but the director and cameraman hedged their bets by chopping and editing fight scenes with a weed whacker so you can't really see what's going on most of the time it's not all bad there are some decent shots and compositions and there's at least one memorable and nightmarish moment when the bad guys appear in the client's bedroom in a genuinely inventive way br br and as for the actual plot forget it for a bodyguard chiba's character is something of an idiot the screenplay depends on his making mistakes and oversights that repeatedly place him and his client in perilous situations so he can fight his way out of them and after 30 minutes it strains even the most credulous judgment to think that this guy is supposed to be any good also if his character was really out to destroy the japanese drug trade he'd have taken his client by her neck 10 minutes into the screenplay and shaken her until her teeth chattered like a castanet until she spilled her little secrets and a whole lot of pointless death and conflict would have been avoided br br still as a whole this movie is a long way from the bottom of the barrel it's still sonny chiba and he's still fun to watch i paid a buck to get this off the bargain dvd rack at a local mega mart and i feel it was worth watching once
<START> if this is based on the true life relationship as purported between ms curtin and mr levinson i'm thrilled i do not know them personally this is painfully slow and both characters take stupid pills liberally throughout the movie while the theme song gets played into the ground many stupid scenes with people acting stupid does not make for a comedy
<START> the plot intellect is about as light as feather down but the advantage here is the boy and girl classic refusal we have become accustomed to in the gay divorcee and top hat is now absent instead of the typical accidental acquaintance the dancing duo are the former lovers bake baker and sherry martin who are still in love since their dancing days br br of course being a 30s musical there's the problems of misunderstood romance classy courtship and the slight irritation of a sabotaged audition with bicarbonate soda has costing ginger something rather special and then in the grand tradition of dwindling finances there's nothing better for hollywood's best entertainers than put on a show br br delightful numbers from irving berlin are sprinkled throughout the show top hats and evening dresses are saved right until the end which remains a refreshing change fred and ginger are out again to charm the world and charm the navy everyone and everything is once again just so enjoyable br br pure classic silliness at its best but with astaire and rogers we just know it's got to work br br rating 8 25 10
<START> a great film slow yes br br but original deeply atmospheric dark and horrifying perfectly surreal feels like a nightmare br br i'd compare it to david lynch eraserhead inland empire blue velvet style maybe with mixed with a little bit of barton fink and naked lunch insects also a bit of jodorowsky fando y lis br br add some night on earth angel heart and a bit of begotten pi would it be wrong to mention tetsuo jacob's ladder barker's the forbidden and salome that should form together at least the concept of a dark night nuit noire br br if you're out for avantegardistic and or surrealistic cinema like i am you're gonna like this one if you're expecting anything else like a movie full of action with some average plot try your luck with something else br br final words the plot is very very strange and unusual and that's probably the 1 reason why most people who don't appreciate this film hate it
<START> i'll keep this fast and sweet five girls on their way home from a football game decide to take a 'short cut' that leads them down a deserted forest ridden road of course nothing but good things happen to them and they safely arrive at their destination br br alright they don't soon they're hunted down by a deranged chick who has some severe mental issues and what ensues is 90 minutes of sheer boredom br br i hope to never see any of these actors in any movie ever again their screaming screeching voices gave me a headache and the script was so poorly written that it included a lot of repeat phrases and nonsensical hysterical screaming all in all one of the worst cheap horror flicks i've ever seen and i've seen a lot
<START> carlito way the original is a brilliant story about an ex drug dealer who hopes to leave his criminal past and so he invests in a club and the deals with the trouble that comes with it br br this film was br br i saw the trailer and knew instantly it was going to be bad but after dismissing films in the past and finding out they were great lucky number slevin tokyo drift i gave this a shot and it failed within the first five minutes br br the script is something a teenager would come up with if given five minutes to prepare it was weak with weaker dialogue it seems there is an instant need for romance in a gangster movie so brigante decides to beat a guy up for the girl and she say's 'yes ' and if you need to act bad just throw racism around as we learn from the 'italian mobsters' br br the acting was terrible to say the least i found 'hollywood nicky' hilarious br br i absolutely hate all these musicians turning to movies lets face it the only reason p diddy did this movie was so he could play a gangsters the actress who plays leticia was weak but beautiful the sex scene was weak but we got to see her which was okay br br but overall i expected it shed light on how carito ended up in prison and the love of his life and the assassin towards the end completely added to the horrendous movie that is br br carlito's way rise to power
<START> the film exposes the blatant exploitation of the chinese worker generally female garnering footage from the chinese business owner who shares his unashamed and delusional viewpoint his american counterpart also as unashamed and delusional the oppressed workers who are given a voice and of course the drunken americans who wear the beaded necklaces mindlessly celebrating in new orleans br br the glimmer of hope comes when some americans are actually outraged that people making their beaded necklaces were getting paid like 0 10 per hour to do so you also have a feeling that the workers may have a chance to escape working in the bead factory but will probably do so when they get fed up with the punishment treatment popular with the factory owner and or they just get too exhausted to work up to 20 hours a day of hard labor br br i have wondered where those necklaces came from not realizing how completely grueling and arduous it would be to make them i just truly appreciated this film as it beautifully portrays the impact american indulgence has over something we consider relatively innocuous in our society on peoples on the other side of the world honorable mention goes to wal mart it is simply amazing and clearly just the tip of the iceberg
<START> generally i've found that if you don't hear about a movie prior to seeing it on dvd there's probably a good reason for it i hadn't heard about this movie at all until i was in a blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf since all the good movies had already been rented out the ones i wanted to see anyway i figured i'd give this one a shot br br it's really not much different than other movies in the genre such as the singles ward or the r m if you're into those type movies you'll probably enjoy this br br however if you're not a mormon this movie probably won't appeal to you there's no way to avoid the overtly religious mormon message contained within and at times it comes across as sappy and cheesy ultimately if you don't fall within the mormon demographic you're probably better off watching something else br br admittedly there were some very funny moments in the film but i didn't think that it was enough to salvage the movie overall
<START> a nightmare on elm street the dream child br br this is a bad movie there's no escaping it i love the series and i think freddy is probably the best character ever in horror movies but even being a fan i can't help but see this movie is mediocre br br there's not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters by now they had just given up they don't even try they are the production of course hoping for a few more easy dollars br br the story doesn't grab your attention its so simple it's almost absent br br alice a survivor from part 4 is now pregnant freddy is coming back through the baby's dreams at the beginning we learn that to stop him alice must find his mother and that's it br br the story advances slowly since there's so little plot meaning it turns pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and awful acting in fact that's the only scary thing the acting since the deaths are not even slightly cool br br the characters are so uninteresting we couldn't care less for them br br the girls are as unattractive as possible the whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theatre group i've seen better actors in school plays it's embarrassing really br br lisa wilcox still manages to bring some class to this she is beautiful sexy and has some talent but the material just didn't let her shine what a pity br br stephen hopkins work is nowhere close to renny harlinÂ´s brilliant direction in dream master he tries some imaginative shots near the end but that tension harlin and craven created so well in the previous movies is no where to be found br br the dream child is just another unimaginative sequel it's the kind of movie that give horror series a bad name br br the end for the once scary freddy it's too sad to see him now a clown that's not funny a bad joke goodbye freddy
