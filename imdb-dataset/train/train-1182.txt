<START> house of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part a psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the game br br have you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators you're never sure of who is exactly who in this movie br br this is both a quality and a drawback of the script as the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency but all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development br br this is definitely one of the best movies about gambling
<START> i think that this film was one of kurt russels good movies kurt russel is my favorite actor so i think that he is a good actor in any role he plays but this movie had a lot of action in it and i know that it should have more then a 5 6 out of 10 on the meter but many people did not like this movie oh well i thought it was good so i think that every one should see this movie if you see this movie and like it i think that you should see back draft also with kurt russel i give soldier 1 2 out of
<START> cartoon network seems to be desperate for ratings beginning with the cancellation of samurai jack the network seemed hellbent on removing all the shows that made it so popular such as the powerpuff girls dexter's lab dragonball z etc when the ratings started to plummet cn began putting up some pretty mediocre shows though total drama island action and chowder stand out because of their clever writing and audience pleasing gimmicks there are plenty of other shows that either terrible remakes george of the jungle or rip offs of other shows such as the marvelous misadventures of flapjack where the title character acts just like spongebob and then there's johnny test which is something of a replacement for dexter's laboratory though it's much more of a sheer rip off than anything br br the show's characters are clearly derived from dexter's lab only this time the focus is on johnny a blonde or fiery haired character who torments his twin sisters susan and mary who just happen to look just like dexter from the orange hair to the glasses the impossible technology there is even a rival genius named bling bling boy or eugene who appears to be sitting in for mandark then there's dookie johnny's best friend and talking dog one of dexter's i mean susan and mary's early experiments br br dexter's laboratory was probably one of the best cartoons on television with its simple but effective art style lovable main character and episodes that don't seem to be a long drag johnny test is a lot different the art style here isn't nearly as eye pleasing in fact it looks absolutely awful the characters have motivations that make them really annoying or repulsive like how most of the series' episodes consist johnny and dookie's quest for havoc on the neighborhood girl sissy whom johnny secretly likes or the twins' obsession over a boy next door seeing these two geniuses swoon at the sight of abs and the fact that johnny appears to be someone you would never want to associate with there is no real connection between the viewer and characters br br one thing the series heavily exploits in its name is that johnny is susan and mary's guinea pig for their experiments these range from turning johnny fat ugly monstrous and even into a woman the twins then help johnny in whatever scheme he's planning in return for his services whenever there's an episode involving this kind of win win deal it usually comes undone at the seems and those that doesn't come completely off the rails never ends satisfyingly br br the writing ranges from mediocre to horrid however the 'fat' episode constantly repeats it's phat with a ph there's a difference you know which is a line that should never be repeated especially when the episode seems to promote child obesity with johnny becoming a famous star with money and videogames just by becoming fat br br let's talk about how the show doesn't completely rip off dexter's lab the show tosses in a lot of characters from two men in black named mr black and mr white a military general who seems to need all his problems solved through johnny and his sisters and lots of super villains though even here the show again steals ideas for other sources like a mr freeze teenage clone an evil cat with a butler who wants cats to rule over man like the evil talking cat from powerpuff girls a bumbling maniac mastermind a trio of evil skater 'dudes' and even a mole man which is probably the most clichÃ© villain in the media br br to top it all off alongside its ugly animation and unlikeable characters the voice acting is either passable like the voices for mr black and mr white to just plain ear splitting johnny dookie and just about every villain in the show the theme song seems to be the only catchy thing to this show but then it was redone just a few episodes with a band that just ruined it br br so in the end johnny test is not a good cartoon its horrible references and jokes about teen culture will dismantle little children's interest in the show while its bright coloring ripped off characters and dragging episodes will ruin the experience for teens it's just another one of those crappy shows that cartoon network is over promoting to trick people to watching it like mtv toward rap if you need a show that will satisfy your children for a half hour you'd better stick to spongebob because johnny test is more of a test of patience than anything else
<START> i found this to be a so so romance drama that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it it's not a hallmark hall of fame type family film with sleeping before marriage considered normal behavior but considering it stars jane fonda and robert de niro i would have expected a lot rougher movie at least language wise br br the most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult that's the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes but to be honest the film isn't that memorable br br it's still a fairly mild nice tale that i would be happy to recommend
<START> the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made i love all six of the stooges curly shemp moe larry joe and curly joe all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team br br this is a good three stooges short it funny and its cast includes christine mcintyre symona boniface gino corrado fred kelsey sam flint chester conklin theodore lorch lynton brent judy malcolm vernon dent john tyrrell heinie conklin and bess flowers the stooges performed very well in this short i recommend this one
<START> i don't have words to describe how good this movie is only a genius like amrita pritam could have written such a real depiction of the days of partition the movie kept haunting me for many days br br urmila did the role of her life in this movie she put life in the role of puroo and manoj vajpai did no less in his role as rashid it is hard to imagine anyone other than these two doing the role of puroo and rashid the punjabi costumes looked so natural on urmila and manoj looked like a natural punjabi mussalmaan br br sandhali sinha as lajjo and suri as ramchand did fabulous job priyanshu chattarjee did good work as triloki br br some of the scenes you just can't get out of your mind when puroo meets lajjo for the first time it brings tears to your eyes the climax is just killer i was expecting a tragic ending but thankfully the ending was wonderful br br this movie is in the same category as pakeezah mughal e azam banaras etc not to be missed
<START> now i recently had the viewing pleasure to watch the hilarious comedy bachelor party one of my new favorite comedies laughed until it just hurt type of movies so i naturally wanted to see the sequel hoping it would have the same laughs but instead bachelor party 2 the last temptation is made by the american pie generation where it's tasteless and defeats the hole purpose of the first film yeah the first film has nudity but it doesn't show in every single scene also the plot is exactly the same from the first it's not always a complaint with me but this could have been a little more original the only thing is that i'm glad that at least no old actors from the original appear in this movie because it would have been cheesy or really silly looking br br ron and melinda are engaged after only 2 months of dating everyone is against it melinda has a rich family but they're pretty happy with ron and melinda's brother todd is scared that ron will take his job so they go out on a weekend to miami for a bachelor party and todd is going to make sure that he'll trap ron into a picture that will make melinda change her mind about the marriage br br bachelor party 2 the last temptation has a couple laughs here and there but over all fails to deliver what the first film accomplished these guys ron's friends were more obnoxious than likable except for seth he was kinda funny the only likable characters other than seth is ron and melinda everyone else just more or less gets on your nerves you wanna watch this film just watch girls gone wild it's the same thing only it doesn't try to pretend that it's a film stick to the original bachelor party that's the movie that's going to get you in tears of laughter br br 3 10
<START> i couldn't give this film a bad rating or bad review for two reasons robin williams and toni collete the film has the potential of being a thriller and there are some slight disturbing elements that lean to the psychological which was something the film could have focused a little on robin williams plays gabriel noon a storytelling night time deejay who is going through personal issues his lover moves out and gabriel is having what seems to be a case of storyteller's block one day he receives and reads a story written by a dying 14 year old boy named pete boland rory culkin pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents he lives with his adopted mother and social worker donna boland toni collette gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with pete but things seem strange when gabriel attempts to meet him and discovers the possibility that pete boland may not even exist i won't go into detail because i don't want to spoil the film but i will tell you this it is quite predictable fascinating atmosphere for telling a story and good performances from robin williams and toni collette who i thought was the film's key character collette is without question one of the most talented and loveliest actresses her ability to tap into the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very uncanny and i hope to see her win an oscar hell i think she might pull off getting a best supporting actress nod for this one if the script were a little better the film starts off as a psychological thriller but a predictable one at that if your curious to know the film's ending and twists then see the film otherwise i would rent another predictable thriller called hide and seek
<START> will they ever make movies without nudity and sex this came on at 3 00 on sunday afternoon and i couldn't believe what they showed thank god my son was outside or i would have been freaked out if he had seen the soft medium porn do people who make movies not care who they offend or corrupt kids could have been watching after church and that is what they show the acting was good and i enjoyed the suspense but gee there was violence and bad guys but that is to be expected in a western movie randy travis was really good in his role if the writers directors and producers would just quit putting on so much uncalled for sex scenes what has to happen to get them to quit going in that direction where can i complain
<START> with that line starts one silly boring british sci fi film the great vorelli from the movie devil doll builds a teleportation machine only to have his funding cut off by blanchard a bearded man who has a thing for bow ties and men with large eye brows when his experiment fails the good doctor learns that lembach the man who controls all of the grants in the world will be staying in london for a few days he attempts to project himself into the house of blanchard with the help of his comely lab assistant sheila needless to say something goes wrong and he winds up looking like a rat the rest of the movie is devoted to the good orange haired doctor walking around london shocking people with his mutated hand and wearing a diaper on his face there are some more killings some modest paper work and finally the doctor vanishes to where ever rat faced doctors go thankfully no one decided to make a sequel
<START> this is a frank loesser masterpiece of amusing lyrics competent themes and solid construction by those who adapted damon runyon material to the musical's book what is surprising about the film is how seamlessly the musical numbers flow from the storyline abe burrows did the book with contributions from loesser michael kidd was the choreographer and the outstanding art direction was contributed by joseph wright the storyline can be told in two sentences nathan detroit played by frank sinatra needs cash to finance his permanent floating crap game to amuse big julie a chicago mob boss he bets odds player sky masterson well presented by marlon brando that he cannot get a salvation army girl to go to havana with him masterson wins the bet saves the mission falls in love with the girl gets the gamblers and riffraff at the crap game to attend a service and tells everybody the lady was impervious to his charms a complete lie of course he ends up with the lady and detroit marries hi long suffering fiancÃ©e vivian blaine others in the cast include stubby kaye johnny silver robert keith b s pulley as big julie the mobster sheldon leonard regis toomey mary alan kokanson kathryn givney as the salvation army leader veda ann borg and jean simmons as the tepid salvation army girl sarah brown the famous musical numbers in this award winning broadway smash include fugue for tinhorns guys and dolls luck be a lady i'll know a person could develop a cold and the oldest established permnanet floating crap game in new york joseph l mankiewicz of cleopatra and letter to three wives fame directed the proceedings and the flow of the work is very interestingly and successfully kept moving he is equally adept at getting fine dialogue acting and directing such huge numbers as luck be lady the varied and challenging brawl section the havana a woman in love section created for the film that precedes it the presenting of the title song guys and dolls and pet me poppa set in the club where blaine works the acting is very uneven simmons seems wrong for the part at times brando gets by with the singing and is very good much of the time on instinct charm and underplaying even in the comedy scenes sinatra tries hard but is wrong for the role for several reasons as nathan detroit blaine is a bit too theatrical in selling her numbers which she of course sings professionally leonard toomey kaye keith and pulley do what is asked and more at all points the stylized opening and closing are made to work well all in all this film is a triumph for loesser's amiable and subtle lyrics for director mankiewicz as ringmaster and for the genre of musicals itself so ably justified in this instance delightful and very different
<START> obviously written for the stage lightweight but worthwhile how can you go wrong with ralph richardson olivier and merle oberon
<START> yikes did this movie blow the characters were weak the plot weaker i figured this couldn't be too bad because it has christoper walken oops he must have done this because he was bored and needed the money the characters were supposed to be irish but noone had an irish accent i am desperately trying to find something nice about this i can't except walken did a fine job with a wooden character find something to read or watch discovery don't ever see this movie
<START> let me set the scene it is the school holidays and there is absolutely nothing at the movies i am with my friend deciding what to see we look for a movie that is starting soon and the grinch comes up we buy tickets not knowing what to expect what we got was a roller coaster of fun br br jim carrey who may i add is my no 1 actor in the whole world was absolutely magnificent as the grinch in this ron howard's best movie next to apollo 13 the way that this movie was made the scenery the actors the props and the music was just amazing it really brought this childhood movie to life br br the story is based upon the story of the grinch as we all know the grinch is a horrible person who just can't stand christmas he lives high above whoville and has never mingled well with the townfolk but one little girl is going to change the grinch's look on life and on others in a drastic way br br cindy lou who played by adorable new actress taylor momsem meets the grinch as finds the kind part of him straight away she attempts to break the barrier and to help the grinch move in and mingle with the towns people br br all up this movie is a barrel of laughs for the whole family both kids and parents a solid 10 10 well done jim br br
<START> amazing movie i saw this movie for the first time on a flight and could not believe that i had not even heard of it before getting on that plane while it may seem at first to be a chick flick it is a film that everyone should see and will enjoy men watch this movie with someone you love you will enjoy it as much as she does and it will score you big points
<START> i truly wish i was not writing this review i'm a christian so i waited anxiously to see this movie it seemed great a christian movie with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing not that i buy the bible code itself you can make it say anything you want i do however believe everything inside the bible so i'm sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes i had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while i was in the theater i would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable tension scenes i'm sure once the final credits began to roll however i could reflect there were many parts of the movie i liked some mostly unexpected plot twists some effects that were indeed special i'm not counting the visions those were poorly done and some interesting technical work fades sets that type of thing unfortunately i got the distinct impression that if i read the book of revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour i could've gotten a better script and the music was beyond cheesy even for a bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue so i wish i could be like everyone else in the theater like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was but i'm not someone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words over a biblical shell and slaps a christian stamp on it i need a good plot and believable dialogue before i can enjoy most movies and this just didn't have either i'm sorry but i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone and that's the tragedy when will we see some intelligent christian fiction it has to be out there somewhere
<START> i generally find loretta young hard to take too concerned with her looks and too ladylike in all the wrong ways but in this lyrical frank borzage romance and even though she's playing a low self esteem patsy who puts up with entirely too much bullying from paramour spencer tracy she's direct and honest and irresistible it's an odd little movie played mostly in a one room shack in a hooverville unusually up front about the depression yet romantic and idealized tracy playing a blustery hard to take regular guy who would be an awful chauvinist and bully by today's standards softens his character's hard edge and almost makes him appealing there's good supporting work from marjorie rambeau and glenda farrell who never got as far as she should have and jo swerling's screenplay is modest and efficient but the real heroes are borzage who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical close up and young you sort of want to slap her and tell her character to wise up she's too good for this guy but she's so dewy and persuasive you contentedly watch their story play out to a satisfying conclusion
<START> girlfight is a story about a troubled teen named diana guzman michelle rodriguez diana is burdened by her mothers suicide and a sexist father living in a sexist community a short temper and plenty of things to spark a fire shes about to get kicked out of school for fighting her brother tiny ray santiago is training with hector jaime tirelli in boxing diana is told by her dad sandro paul calderon to deliver that weeks payment for tiny's training while diana is walking through the gym she realizes thats what she wants to do she wants to box diana asks her dad for money to train but he refuses because shes a girl and should do more 'girly' things all diana wants is to be treated like any other guy not looked down upon because she is a woman she steals money from her father to begin training br br great movie genius pure 'effing' genius recommend to anybody who needs to see a good clean movie with no 'monkey business'
<START> this motion picture has a steady haunting pace backed up with great acting one of chamberlain's best performances and a story that is revealed to us over time br br beyond that the music fully establishes the mood and assists in maintaining an uneasy cautious and somber tone br br weir's story is enhanced by using aboriginals their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy tale that is ominous br br although they are unrelated in story as well as genre this maintained the same feeling within me as ursula le guin's lathe of heaven 1980 br br the last wave is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments remember hacking and slicing doesn't make a film a horror movie it's the psychological element of fear and trepidation that rests within us all
<START> if you liked watching mel gibson in million dollar hotel then you might enjoy watching burt reynolds in yet another film so bad it could never be distributed i can only attest to the dvd version so maybe the vhs version is better quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes have been so poorly done that everythings seems red i first thought my dvd players was messed up it wasn't if you insist on watching it i recommend you adjust the color on your tv until it is black and white if you don't you will never be able to get through the film if you do it will simply remind you of a poor film students attempt to revist the style of pulp fiction
