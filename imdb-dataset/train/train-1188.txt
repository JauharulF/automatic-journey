<START> i heard many stories about this film being great well i took my chance when i saw it for a cheap price at ebay last month br br i watched it and i have only a few comments about it br br 1 terrible story line 2 terrible acting 3 bad fighting scenes br br i never seen any worse movie in my life so far when the storyline is bad than at least make the fights something more interesting but both are done ridiculously bad br br the only positive thing about this movie in my opinion is nikki berwick god she looks nice in this movie br br that's about it
<START> some day we'll walk in the rays of a beautiful sun some day when the world is much brighter the 5 stairsteps o o h child br br movies about black teenagers usually involve inner city gangs dealing drugs or committing violence to a hip hop soundtrack films about the everyday problems of ordinary inner city teens are hard to find yet there is an undiscovered gem that i would like to recommend our song by jim mckay is about three girls in the crown heights section of brooklyn who learn that their high school will be closed for asbestos removal and must decide on their future direction one that may involve going their separate ways the story is told from the point of view of a 15 year old not from an adult reminiscing about the past as in most coming of age movies avoiding the mandatory street slang and excessive use of f words it delivers an honest and loving portrait of three friends at a crossroads in their life the girls lanisha kerry washington joycelyn anna simpson and maria melissa martinez are in their sophomore year at the local high school they are active members of the jackie robinson steppers a real life marching band whose rehearsals for a labor day parade provide discipline and purpose to their lives br br similar to david gordon green's george washington but less stylized the film showcases non professional black and latino actors with kerry washington as the standout while the performances have some amateurish moments i became so involved with the story that i forgot the girls were even acting maria whose father is in jail has learned that she is pregnant by terrell a local student she wants to have the baby in spite of the fact that she is only 15 and knows that terrell is probably not going to be of much help joycelyn works in an up scale dress shop but dreams about becoming a singer in a very poignant scene in her bedroom she pretends to be talking to her fans then lies down in bed to recite one of her poems she is close to lanisha and maria at the beginning but drifts off to make friends outside of the neighborhood none of the girls receive much support at home and maria is too afraid to even tell her mother about her baby yet the single moms are not typical movie deadbeats or alcoholics they are warm and loving parents whose time with their children is limited because of the pressure of supporting the family br br lanisha's parents are divorced but she is able to visit her father a doorman in a luxury apartment building and talk about music her mother is comforting when lanisha learns that a friend in the neighborhood has committed suicide a somewhat melodramatic plot point in an otherwise realistic film as the summer winds down the girls drift apart and each decides on a different course there are no big dramatic moments however only the sad recognition of the inevitability of change though we do not have blinders on about the frustrations that may await them we identify with their hopes and dreams without dwelling on the negative our song is an emotionally satisfying film about growing up in the projects that refuses to see life in any terms other than possibility
<START> the brain that wouldn't die is one awful piece of film that stinks from the opening credits it's got all the classic signs of being bad unbelieveable plotline terrible acting low grade sets and lighting the plotline goes like this when a doctor and his fiancee get caught in an accident she gets decapitated and he picks up her head and takes her to his lab where he sets up her head in a pan with some special liquid that keeps it alive i'll bet virgnina leath who played the head in a pan had to spend a lot of uncomfortable time wearing that pan around her neck and squatting under a table anyway the doctor then tries to find her a new body and hires two strippers so she can chose one to have her new body bad all the way through so bad it was torn to pieces on mystery science theater 3000
<START> here on imdb com i read an opinion that grey owl is best character of pierce brosnan ever performed i do not know if he had better nor worse roles i'm not his fan but this one was really exceptional br br the other thing impressive hand of the movie director i give my respect the serenity the beauty and spirit of wilderness was illustrated really exlusively i never met such proximity it in any movie before br br another thing left in my mind after the film this is the movie closest to the original books and atmosphere in it br br and little bit more i pay my respect to the original grey owl
<START> in the first one it was mainly giant rats but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too this one however is just giant rats period well giant rats and one really growing little boy this one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer rats you know how it is this movie has some kills and its moments but i find it to be on par with the original i just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies well that is not true i actually like empire of the ants maybe i just do not care for giant rodents all in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre i just can't recommend this one
<START> warning possible spoilers not that you should care also sorry for the caps br br starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice that's all the more annoying for talking nonsense it goes on with nonsense and unnecessary drama that's badly but accurately put br br we know space travel is a risky enterprise there's a complicated system with a lot of potential for malfunctions radiation stress related symptoms etc and unexpected things are bound to happen in largely unknown environments they knew stuff could go wrong in fact stuff had gone wrong it's called learning granted appollo 11 wasn't safe by today's standards and there was immense political pressure but the overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressive br br assorted mistakes comments i hadn't even to look up br br 1 nixon prepared a speech in case something went wrong well duh that's what i would've done it was the apex of a propaganda war after all br br 2 nasa gives green light despite the fact that appollo 11 will probably blow up this is only implicit though yeah that's why they let people and press watch in almost real time br br 3 the capsule ejection wouldn't work like it didn't work the time a chimp was in it the one that survived it was a test launch and the rocket exploded the capsule accelerated away and landed with a parachute there's a video of it you can probably find it on youtube or at least look it up somewhere br br 4 one interviewed guy says an explosion would have wiped out a fair part of florida i can only assume it was meant as a hyperbole 'cause if not i'm just aghast how he could get it so wrong br br 5 the technology then was primitive compared to today's standards actually relatively primitive software and hardware is used even today the reason being that it must not crash it's even worse for spacecraft because their computers must be built of comparably large components that aren't that susceptible to radiation and the craft itself must be pilotable manually anyway so a complex steering system like the b2's wouldn't do what's with the fact that they were using tv screens rather than computer screens it's the same damn technology actually tv monitors were and are produced with a significantly higher definition br br 6 if that object wasn't part of the rocket it could be only one thing we see where this is going apart from the fact that the statement is wrong who says it wasn't a rocket part at least an interviewee clears up that if a thing is flying and you don't know what it is it's by definition an unidentified flying object br br 7 the voice over as well as some misquotes make it seem as though the lander's radiation foil was actually its hull which would make it thinner than a space suit br br 8 neil armstrong's near death during a practice flight is footage i can appreciate i hadn't seen it before as i said any piece of manifest technology can go wrong especially if it's not been tested sufficiently on account of being you know unprecedented br br 9 the trajectory discrepancy of the descending lander due to irregularities in the moon's density was at no time acutely life threatening neither was the fifteen seconds of fuel left which was in fact fifteen seconds of fuel left before having to abort the mission and returning to the command module br br 10 a catastrophic chain of events usually results in catastrophe i really don't know how to put it any simpler this however is a prime example of the rhetoric used br br 11 there's a short sequence of one of the astronauts walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid followed by the voice over telling us that the reason for this strange behavior can now be revealed turns out he was walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid hilarious stuff br br 12 it's mentioned that during re entry all contact was lost this is a perfectly natural phenomenon and it was as well known at the time as it's impossible to circumvent with contemporary technology again the gravity of this is implicit but very purposely so br br 13 there was never a shuttle lost in space itself while the voice over presents this fact as evidence that appollo 11 was a pile of crap appollo 13 was a near loss but the two real disasters happened during liftoff and re entry respectively in any case comparing shuttles to saturn rockets is somehow well okay just plain stupid even ignoring that the successful shuttle missions seem to not have been deemed of interest to the audience br br 14 what the hell's up with the ufo even in the context of the movie it makes no sense unless you assume it was made for entertainment purposes aimed at a specific audience which seems to include people with next to no understanding of either history science or rhetorics br br even the point of the movie is somewhat obscure catch phrases like covered up until now publically revealed here for the first time come up but the film doesn't place any blame or offer a lesson or anything which could be expected of a film so emotionally done in the good old tradition of sensationalism there are numerous interview shots and recording fragments that are often out of context or with people that we know nothing about except nasa scientist wow so the astronauts were very nervous before the endeavor fancy that what does this have to do with the point of the movie again oh yeah which point br br in summary in addition to being either willfully or incompetently inaccurate it's not even good entertainment and believe me i'm a guy who enjoys his crappy documentaries this film isn't funny witty quaint it's nothing
<START> what a relief to find out i am not imagining this programme the summary from taxman is great i too remember finding it haunting and not particularly family viewing i must have been 10 11 at the time i watched it i think for a girl that age part of attraction was lead's very blond hair and his permanently sad state the theme was played on a flute i recall although i cannot remember how it went i think the intro showed him playing it or maybe he played a flute in the programme and especially when he was sad maybe i am destined never to know how it ended or to see clip or hear the tune but at least i now know it is not just me
<START> my first fassbinder was a wonderful experience film and alternative cinema small hall with uncomfortable seats public had to wait while filmrolls were changed were perfect match br br there were many cliches used in the film but fassbinder presented them so cleverly that i found them really amusing sound was also brilliant sometimes back being louder than dialogue br br everything seemed to be in right place and i loved the way how after war time was presented real fun br br
<START> jake speed 1986 was an amusing parody of indiana jones and other adventurer films that were popular during the eighties wayne crawford stars as jake speed an adventurer who's always battling evil doers wherever he goes with his assistant desmond floyd dennis christopher they globe trot looking for some action and some decent story lines the duo meet a young woman named margaret karen kopins who's sister has been kidnapped by an evil white slaver trader john hurt can she find and convince jake and desmond to help her rescue her sibling br br a sappy and cheesy film that doesn't pretend to be something that it's not i have to give this one a recommendation that's if you enjoy movies that like to have fun and for those who don't take everything at face value br br recommended
<START> i saw this film at its new york's high falls film festival screening as well and i must say that i found it a complete and awful bore although it was funny in some places the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden especially the lovely lady and the voice of the narrator whom i have never heard of had a lot to be desired j c mac was i felt the redeeming feature of this film true action and grit and out of the cast the only real acting i am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing this could have been a half decent film let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release or if you really want a copy look in the bargain bin in lidl
<START> i don't know why some guys from us georgia or even from bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they don't understand at all for those who did not watch this movie watch it don't expect too much or don't put some frameworks just because this is kosturica watch the movie without prejudice try to understand the whole humor inside people of serbia did actually getting married while bil clinton bomb their villages gypsies in all balkans are always try to f ck you up in any way they can love is always unexpected pure and colorful and balkans are extremely creative for those who claims this is a bad movie i can see only that the american's sh t like meet dave get smart etc are much much worse than a pure frank balkan humoristic love story movie as promise me the comment should be useful and on second place should represent the personal view of the writer i think the movie is great and people watch it must give their respects to the director and story told inside it is simple but true it is brutal but gentle and makes you laugh to dead
<START> a comedy gem lots of laugh out loud moments the shop and pub scenes had me belly laughing uncontrollably the characters are recognisable and the dialogue well observed i know people like this the humour is surprisingly gentle and the film this may sound strange puts me in mind of an ealing comedy it's a quirky little film with lots of detail it certainly takes a number of viewings i've watched it a few times i've been showing all my friends and notice something new each time a bit of dialogue something visual that i hadn't picked up on before i could get really picky and find a couple of shortcomings in the film but i'm not going to because overall this is a great fun feel good film which is really worth a watch and which anyone with a sense of humour must enjoy it is a film which will find it's friends and i hope there are a lot of them out there oh and it has a great soundtrack
<START> as incredible as it may seem gojoe is an anime and hong kong inspired samurai action flick with a pacifistic message this ankle of the film is effectively portrayed through the protagonist a great acting job done by daisuke ryu a killer turned to boddhist monk benkei benkei has sworn never to kill again but he still takes up the sword to fight what he thinks is a demon invasion br br gojoe is a film difficult to rate it's visual imagery is stunningly crafted and beautiful but it uses too much trickery circling camera and high speed drives expressionistic shots leeched colors digital effects etc so the end result is somewhat tiring that said the beginning and the ending of the film are nevertheless both elegant and powerful if only the director sogo ishii would have been wise enough not to overuse his bag of tricks br br other problem with gojoe is the amount of violence for a film with such an anti violent message gojoe wastes way too much energy and screen time to depict the endless battle scenes also the way the violence is shown is always on the edge of being self indulgent in fact a blood shower against the night sky seems to be one of the films signature images luckily ishii is wise enough to show the ugly tragic side of violence as well still it seems that ishii is not sure whether he's making a traditional action film or a deeply moral allegory the audience can't be sure of this either until the very end of the film the powerful albeit cynical ending is what saves gojoe it clearly emphasizes that this film is something more than a mere gore fest
<START> spoilers classic 70's sex trash the swedish gal helga was what made this movie so great she was beautiful but what really got to me was how sexual she was she exuded massive quantities of sexuality throughout the film her best scenes were when she was er stimulating herself whenever she was on screen i became transfixed br br also the doctor julia sister of the dimwitted male focus of the film was very interesting visually although most 12 year old girls have bigger breasts than julia she knew how to use what little she had and her scenes especially the scenes with the silk blouse and black skirt also grabbed my attention unmercilessly you also got to love the major hoaky scene where the bats stripped her nekkid i don't know if i've ever seen anything more ludicrous yet sexy at the same time classic stuff
<START> i saw and liked the first two a lot really especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first and it's a story standing alone you don't have to know the first movie i liked that in the free willy movies too br br but the third here is absolutely useless i tried it with a friend of mine because we both liked the first two we decided to stop after a good half an hour the movie is okay there are funny parts in it alright but what for timon and pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies what lion king 1 1 2 is for me is a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already plus telling the story from their point of view but what for i'd really like to know you know the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one is really nice but what comes after is mostly unnecessary i guess many people liked timon and pumba and so do i really yet for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny no chance most of it wasn't funny at all at least for me btw what was the movie about anyway was it a about timon and pumba or b an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie i tend to choose option b and i'm very disappointed about it br br if you like to see stories like the story behind xy you should see rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead by tom stoppard with tim roth and gary oldman that's really funny and no try to get more out of hamlet then it has
<START> jane austen would definitely approve of this one br br gwyneth paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of emma she is funny without being excessively silly yet elegant she puts on a very convincing british accent not being british myself maybe i'm not the best judge but she fooled me she was also excellent in sliding doors i sometimes forget she's american br br also brilliant are jeremy northam and sophie thompson and phyllida law emma thompson's sister and mother as the bates women they nearly steal the show and ms law doesn't even have any lines br br highly recommended
<START> i was thrilled to watch this movie expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic private lessons which portrays the dream of any male teenager br br private lessons ii has nothing to do with the title i mention it's just a regular soft core cinemax flick that won't make a change in your life there's just one hot sex scene in a rooftop but that's it i watched this a long time ago but believe me this is just a regular boring soft core flick br br the women are hot but that's not enough to rent or buy the movie my advice is to watch this only if it airs on cable
<START> now this is what i'd call a good horror with occult supernatural undertones this nice low budget french movie caught my attention from the very first scene this proves you don't need wild fx or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie br br the plot revolves around 4 cellmates in a prison and each of these characters and their motives become gradually more interesting as the movie builds up tension to the finale most of the action we see through the eyes of carrere who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these 3 other inmates br br i won't say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen there a few flaws though the fx are not that good but they're used effectively the plot leaves some mysteries open and things get very confusing towards the end but malefique redeems itself by the time it's over br br i thought his was a very good movie 8 10
<START> there were some great moments of reality in there depicting modern day life not only in japan but everywhere it shows how stifling ones culture can be and wanting to break out of the mold its created for you br br the dancing was just a vehicle for saying do what you love even if its against the norm rather billy elliot like i would say i enjoyed that film as well br br the humour was well timed and the touching moments felt so real you could feel the awkwardness between sugiyama and his wife the tantrums in the dance hall i loved aoki him and that wig and his excessiveness on the dance floor made me simply howl br br the actors all did a wonderful job the story was well written i watched it a second time and caught some little nuances that i missed on the first viewing good entertainment
<START> ira levin's broadway smash comes to the screen with hardly any meat on its bones a mystery plot with just a few tricks and twists but nobody worth caring about frustrated writer michael caine plots to steal the work of a brilliant young man and pass it off as his own his devious plan may include murdering the talented kid which has caine's flighty spouse up in arms the first act in which everyone is introduced is excruciatingly dead with caine doing everything an actor can to keep the pacing up dyan cannon is miscast as his wife she's too smart and clever herself to be passed off as a ditz and christopher reeve in the middle portion of the film seems extremely uncomfortable in the role of the better writer these three characters and irene worth's bothersome neighbor are so undefined that what happens after the set up barely even registers until well after the second act has begun sidney lumet's direction is stagy and fuzzy the set design unconvincing and poorly lit and the finale is a total disaster the actors struggle to give the script some substance but with such thin material all we see are their laborious efforts 1 2 from
