<START> raymond burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend dick foran thanks to his affection for his friend's wife angela lansbury this was a full year before he started doing perry mason so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting br br there isn't all that much else here that's interesting though lansbury is always good but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious there's an interesting performance by lamont johnson as a painter who's also in love with the femme fatale but the burr character is pretty straightforward it's frankly bizarre to see an actor like burr doing these romantic scenes with lansbury and his halting delivery does not match his character here very well as it does in most films i've seen him in there's no mystery at all really and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that burr's character is setting up the lansbury character to implicate herself double jeopardy prevents her being tried again for the original murder presumably he does so with a very large tape recorder which she doesn't notice when she comes into the room i guess br br a few perhaps unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could have been done for tv
<START> american film makers decided to make a film they think is japanese the characters all badly represented the actors are not even japanese and the set is cheap unreal and definitely doesn't represent kyoto in early 20ties and 30ties who ever read the book understand that the script writers didn't add any extra value to differentiate the movie from the script worse they even changed the original plot line with a few goofs rob marshall is using for his two main characters two well known chinese actors who joined before in crouching tiger hidden dragon marshall probably saw one chinese movie and tho they represent japanese culture seeing those two actors together again even makes the movies more ridiculous quentine tarantino's last scene in kill bill 1 is ten times more japanese made than that of this movie
<START> good show very entertaining good marshal arts acting good story plot the entire main crew did a nice job from robert urich to chuck norris jennifer tung and especially a big hand to judson mills an especially fine tribute to robert urich in his latter days a great actor who will be truly missed
<START> didn't care for the movie the book was better does anyone know where it was filmed this was my first visit to your site just found the answer to my question so now i look like a dummy but i think i'll still submit my comments and yes british columbia is lovely or why they took it from its south carolina coastal setting this question stands the place was essential to the fabric of the book and its change was part of my disappointment with the movie oh i just read where i need to write at least ten lines here's my other main issue with the film kim bassinger was too vapid and not at all what i pictured from the book i know the book was the book and the movie well not so good i found the character in the book much more empathetic also the book evoked rustic almost primitive images of the monastery while the castle in the film was much more visually impressive it distorted the feel of the story and seemed at odds with the characters
<START> weak plot predictable violence only semi interesting characters like the writer also one of the stars was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of drugs and murder to make it hot from the predictable rap and house soundtrack to the family conflicts it's poorly acted stereotypical and ultimately terribly boring even the title has been done before imdb lists five movies with the same name released in 2007 2008 br br note saw it on showtime which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies was halfway thru before i realized no one was an undercover cop even tho another stereotype would have made it interesting if it happened
<START> i found this film to be quite an oddity from the very get go i found it extremely hard to like this movie and now after a little thinking about it i can pretty much pinpoint the reason why jean marc barr although i love him to bits i think zentropa is one of the best movies ever made is quite miscast here and although i can't figure for the life of me who would be better i am sure someone could have taken his place quite easily and make this film work everything else is fine except for the stabs at weak comedy a meet the parents joke is not really needed filmmakers and i really like richard e grant as the british major it just suffers from one thing jean marc
<START> one out of ten stars br br because if it was it gets an f holy mother mary of god was this bad i mean i gave it every reasonable accommodation considering it was a straight to video film but it let me down at every turn like so many other b movies the basic storyline was decent and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources but the execution was ridiculous it's a shame they attached the good name of halloween to this fiasco br br the basic premise surrounds some frat douche bags hosting their annual halloween haunted house fund raiser when a satanic spell book shows up out of nowhere and hurls the frat boys into a living hell well that's the idea anyway but instead most of the film is devoted to displaying these frat boy's relationship escapades abound with an outrageous lesbian subplot very little of the actual story is devoted to halloween or the mysterious spell book it actually makes me mad that the film makers thought they could get away with making such dribble br br the film is essentially about frat boy relationships this is not what the movie is billed as i'm tempted to track down the producers and at the very least threaten them with bodily harm the acting is about as bad as it gets it's atrocious the script is unintentionally funny the cinematography is just plain lazy the whole film is amateur night this movie actually makes the syfy channel movie productions look like masterpieces br br the last half hour of the film felt like the film makers realized they weren't producing a soap opera and had to throw in some sort of horror sequences the evil spell book finally comes into play and turns everyone in the haunted house into the character their dressed up as i almost feel like crying as i write this review wow i mean wow this thing was an undecipherable chopped up disaster
<START> spoilers all too in real life as well as in the movies familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun or rifle in their hands the case of young and innocent in never handling or firing a gun jimmy davis franchot tone has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men like jimmy davis are forced to take up arms for their country br br jimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the us army but was encouraged to stay by being belted in the mouth by his good friend fred p willis spencer tracy ended up on the front lines in france with jimmy's unit pinned down by a german machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen german soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple it was when jimmy gunned down the last surviving german who raised his arms in surrender that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding him br br recovering from his wounds at an army hospital jimmy fell in love with us army volunteer nurse rose duffy gladys george rose was really in love with jimmy's good friend the happy go lucky fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her it's when fred was lost during the fighting on the western front that rose thinking that he was killed fell in love and later married jimmy when fred unexpectedly showed up in the french town where jimmy now fully recovered from his wounds was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and rose who had already accepted jimmy's proposal of marriage to her br br with wwi over and jimmy marrying rose left fred who's still in love with her a bitter and resentful young man it was almost by accident that fred ran into jimmy on the streets of new york city and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and non violent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the european western front smug and sure of himself and his ability to shoot a gun jimmy had become a top mobster in new york city's underworld not only that but as fred later found out his wife rose had no idea what jimmy was really involved in with jimmy telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjuster br br jimmy's life of crime came full circle when rose after she found out about his secret life ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a valentine day like massacre with his gang members dressed as cops of his rival mobsters while on trial jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then after his three year sentence is up get his life back together br br spoiler alert hearing rumors from fellow convicts that rose and his best friend fred were having an affair behind his back jimmy broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law it's at fred's circus where he works as both manger and barker that jimmy in seeing that rose as well as fred were true to him that he like at his trial had a sudden change of heart but the thought of going back to prison with at least another ten years added on to his sentence was just too much for jimmy it was then that jimmy decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job that he himself didn't have the heart to do for him
<START> this movie is similar to darkness falls and the boogeyman 2005 but it's also much more graphic than both and not as good as either it's also slow and fairly predictable it's also got shades of deliverance and the amityville horror plus we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational inspirational sermon really this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything even though it is gory the makeup effects are not very realistic looking in fact they look kinda cheap aside from all that there is some really awful clichÃ©d dialogue and i won't say when but there is a point where a couple of the character's actions were not authentic or believable given the circumstances nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way once you watch the movie you'll know what i mean there's also some gratuitous nudity for nudity's sake it just wasn't necessary at all the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good better than this movie deserves so after carefully weighing the evidence id say this movie was passable but not good my verdict for the tooth fairy 4 10
<START> i can understand why some people like this movie and why some people don't for me though i really like it even if i noticed some good bits and not so impressive bits the animation was actually excellent like charlie's dream the characters were a mixed bag the best being anne marie voiced by the late judith barsi i was physically ill when i read what happened to her also carface is a very convincing villain especially voiced by the wonderful vic tayback i particularly loved morons i'm surrounded by morons and along with rasputin and warren t rat is probably the most memorable of all the don bluth villains charlie and itchy only just lacked the same sparkle but i loved king gator and his song some of the film is very haunting like annabelle's you can never come come back which kind of scares me still unfortunately there were some bits i didn't like so much the story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused but disney's black cauldron suffered from the same problem also there were some dark scenes that young children would find upsetting but the ending is very poignant however the biggest flaw was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung none of them in particular stick out with exception of let's make music together and love survives and burt reynolds can't sing and dom deluise has done much better singing all in all a watchable movie that could have been more but is definitely memorable and i would definitely watch it again 7 10 bethany cox
<START> ronald colman gives an electrifying performance as tony john a broadway actor who can't separate his offstage life from shakespeare's othello the character he plays on stage two important scenes illustrate tony's dilemma the first one takes place in producer max lasker's office acting is a matter of talent for the practical minded lasker but donlan tony's friend disagrees no no when you do it like tony does it it's much more the way he has of becoming someone else every night so completely no don't tell me his whole system isn't affected by it the other scene occurs in waitress pat kroll's apartment tony tells her his name is martin she thanks him then he says or paul hamlet joe and maybe othello when tony begins rehearsing othello we learn that though he's trying to keep his real life separated from his stage life the part begins to seep into your life and the battle begins reality against imagination he can't keep the two separated in his mind pat is desdemona and he's othello and he wrongly believes she has been unfaithful to him he murders her colman's bravura performance in a complex and difficult role earned him 1947's academy award for best actor oscar nominations went to ruth gordon and garson kanin for best original screenplay not to be overlooked is milton krasner's atomspheric cinematography
<START> i have to say i hated this movie i don't like to say that because gerard butler is in it about a half an hour of boring conversation sorry to all who actually care about the plot i started fast forwarding to gerry's scenes i really don't know the ending i was that bored with it if gerry wasn't in it i probably either done one of two things fell asleep or turned it off but gerry is the bright light of this movie as he is with most of his earlier movies if you're a fan of gerry's don't worry he's as adorable and precious as he always is but if you actually want to watch the movie for the plot good luck because you'll need it either that or lots of coffee or soda to keep you awake br br 4 10 and that's just because the casting director had the sense to put gerry in this movie even though they had no idea of how to spell his name
<START> when braveheart first came out i was enthralled and was admittedly one of the most rabid fans of the film when rob roy came out i was intrigued and although i enjoyed the film i did not think it was a great film however as time has gone by my appreciation for rob roy has grown and my enthusiasm for braveheart has diminished braveheart is great entertainment to be sure but there are flaws as well the most significant in my view is the unflattering portrayal of robert the bruce who was without a doubt scotland's greatest king another is the historical inaccuracy of the film which tarnishes the film in proportion to the many historical distortions i think i am also bothered by the fact that it was in this film seen only at least by me in retrospect that the beginnings of mel gibson's egomania can be seen clearly for the first time in contrast rob roy has grown on me over the years partly because it largely avoids the faults i mind most in braveheart but also because rob roy is like fine wine growing more mature and complex with each viewing
<START> this was not enjoyable to watch frank puts all his dreams on the back burner and gets a normal boring job just so his stepson can go to film school but his stepson decides that he'll make a humiliating documentary about the man instead a documentary filmmaker should point the camera and simply shoot not manipulate and comment with snide captions the bitterness and resentment of the filmmaker towards his stepfather is obvious and sad the goal seems to be to make frank appear dumb and pathetic instead he comes across as the most human of the 3 people featured br br essentially a smear campaign all dressed up as something much smarter and edgier than it really is it left me with an intense dislike for the filmmaker
<START> this film's premise is so simple and obvious that only a texas millionaire high on oil fumes and whiskey would have a problem understanding it if someone shouted it across the proverbial parking lot in summary the oil business is in cahoots with the government or gummint if you prefer the gummint is in cahoots with middle eastern despots and the cia is a singular festering pool of double dealing sons of insert word willing to toe any line that comes their way the only people that get done over are the good ones like mr clooney bob oh and terrorism is a result of the poverty which globalization creates when wicked multinationals stalk the world looking for a tasty takeover or three that really fits to the profiles of the well heeled 9 11 perpetrators br br in syriana this facile tissue of political half truths and hollywood holograms is stirred up in a repugnant vermicelli of story strands that twist turn and whirl through the gloopy circumlocutions of their own insignificance until the poor viewer is left alone with the conclusion that br br 1 the director good joke should never be let near a camera again br br 2 people like clooney and hurt might know how to act but they sure don't know how to pick a script br br 3 if you want to see a film that deals with corruption in big business and the state go and see claude chabrol's l'ivresse du pouvoir which is insightful funny and brilliantly acted br br empty doom laden sententious piffle spun out to evening ruining length
<START> okay i'll admit the casting in the film is really strange part of this is due to the plot but i still had a bit of trouble believing pierce brosnan playing this lead though he really did a pretty good job br br it's based on a true story of an englishman who went to live with the canadian indians in the early 20th century he claimed to be a mixed blood indian he was in fact so successful and well thought of that people came from all over to hear his lectures and be taken on his wilderness treks even though he was not a mixed blood indian and all his knowledge was from books or faked the movie centers on this and what occurred when the hoax was uncovered br br the acting and settings were great and i really liked the film once i suspended disbelief about brosnan it didn't get widespread distribution probably because it was pretty cerebral not a bond film nor a romance just a really odd film about a remarkable man
<START> one of the best if not the best stephen king's screenings dark as dark can be surprising non hollywood ending terrifying atmosphere amazing book adaptation outstanding cast educational don't play with afterlife in short everything an excellent horror should be br br my favorite horror movie straight 10
<START> well done ghost story that will give you the creeps and some pretty fair scares along the way the story unfolds slowly building atmosphere all the way until you're ready to see the woman in black you won't forget her once you've seen her no gore no knives no hockey masks just a well constructed story that is best viewed at night with the lights out
<START> wow what can i say first off imdb says this is in the late 60s which means carlito would be very close to going to prison he got out in 75 and said he was in for 5 years they used a bunch of nobody actors and a story that didn't even make sense they bring back only one actor guzman and hes playing a totally different guy why did it end with him and this puerto rican chick wheres gale he said he was in love with her before wheres kleinfeld he said he knew him forever you'd think he'd have been in this one and if this made sense where are rocco and the black dude in the first one it was all just stupid this is an insult to pacino and the first film
<START> i read the back of the box and it talked about mary shelley and percy shelley and lord byron i thought wonderful this will be great i was so wrong the story was all screwed up in fact i still don't get it it just seems to me that all the characters did was drink smoke opium and have sex not that those aren't good movie qualities but please where was the story i made myself finish the movie and yes it did pick up towards the end but by then the movie was almost over rent it if you really want to just don't trust the back of the box
