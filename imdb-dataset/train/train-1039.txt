<START> i am a fan of the nightmare series but this one is horrible the deaths are so trendy if you were to watch this 20 years later the whole nintendo scene is outdated i did like the flashbacks i think they should have just made a prequel about when he was still alive that would have been more interesting this is a movie you can take or leave depends on how much spare time you have
<START> it's really annoying when good movies like this one go unnoticed but i'm glad i did not miss it br br they should re release it with a lot more publicity i do not think they did anything to promote it great work paxton br br
<START> i have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest worst attempts at one a lot of the scenes work in a plug and play manner inserted strictly to conform to the romantic comedy genre usually this is okay because we're dealing with a genre but the challenge generally resides in making it original new and inventive this movie fails to do so br br there is no sense of who the characters really are apart from sylvie moreau's who is the real star of this movie not isabelle blais they fit into this one dimensional clichÃ© and they become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrative br br the pacing of the movie can become annoying rhythm lacks and the editing is filled with unnecessary close ups i should also mention the overly stylized decors making some scenes devoid of any naturally or rather making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious of course along with that you have the right on cue sappy music which unfortunately often sounds mismatched br br i can't believe that a movie who makes obvious woody allen allusions ends up being this deceptive if you expect a good light hearted romantic comedy this is not it or rather this a poor attempt at it you will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been getting such praise when cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are far superior quebecois directors making better flicks br br les aimants is a good movie for what it is but it's a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as auteur's
<START> i found it hard to like anyone in this film the central characters lindy and michael chamberlain whose daughter disappears during a night out in the australian outback are not bad people but then surely not all or even most of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better but though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the chamberlains from the start of their life's tragic disarray the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip news media crowds mobs and assumptions it's not a movie about the degenerate society of australia in particular it's merely an account of a true story that happened there society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are br br when a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigine's dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines newspapers and tv programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of one's own unaware perceptions influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround one's life the reason i appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out from the victims to the masses br br the evidence against lindy chamberlain aside suspicion was jet fueled mostly by a virtue of hers to the public eye she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter why was she able to keep her cool even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up for tv and the press how much of the downward spiral could've been prevented had she behaved more to the public's liking in the media meryl streep one of if not the greatest actress working today may not give a performance that particularly stands out and frankly neither does any other actor or department of film making but she and the screenwriters do understand lindy what is infuriating is that it's not that difficult apparently she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation br br whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as sophie's choice the devil wears prada angels in america or other such work it is a triumph it is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself she frustrates us because we don't know what she's thinking or feeling it took me awhile to feel endeared toward her but this is the movie's way of suggesting the reaction of the public's attention br br she is married to a pastor and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most initially they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to god's will kick starting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughter's death was some sort of ritual killing on their part whatever happened to the little girl her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the media's intake didn't immediately identify so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry well br br meryl streep and sam neill are constantly on screen but the australian public plays the real leads here like punctuation for each plot advance director fred schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office where the public tries lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections br br this golan globus docudrama is not particularly memorable the setting's atmosphere doesn't give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out but it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public
<START> god i am so sick of the crap that comes out of america called cartoons br br since anime became popular the usa animators either produce a cartoon with a 5 year old lazy ass style of drawing kappa mikey or some cheep japanese animation rip off usually messing up classic characters no wonder anime is beating american cartoons br br they are not even trying anymore br br oh i just heard of this last night i live in the uk and when i found out this show first came out in 2005 well i never knew the uk was so up to date with current shows
<START> why oh why won't they learn when you've got a nice juicy exploitation gimmick use it don't go messing around trying to get all deep and thoughtful you're only gonna wind up looking foolish br br christmas evil is the story of harry stadling who saw a little bit too much of mommy kissing daddy dressed as santa claus back when he was a kid so of course harry grows up obsessed with christmas and finally when his disillusionment becomes too great he flips out dresses as santa and wanders the city giving out toys to good little children and viciously killing anyone he deems naughty br br simple enough and not a bad place to start after all how many other holiday themed horror flicks use the same schtick unfortunately this film wants to be more santa portrait of a serial killer than silent night deadly night two thirds of the film are spent documenting harry's slow but inevitable breakdown when i would have been willing to buy the premise by the time the opening titles were rolling you know a slasher film is in trouble when you find yourself urging the killer to just get on with it already br br perhaps harry's descent into madness could have been compelling in the hands of a competent director but alas we've got some guy named lewis jackson apparently this is his only film and it shows the action jumps giddily from scene to scene without establishing shots or clear views of the actors to let us know where we are and who we are seeing br br even once the film gets rolling we're still treated to heaping helpings of harry's self pity insecurity and neurotic behavior more depressing than frightening christmas evil is one to avoid
<START> great fun i went with 8 friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film we came to see different one but after 10 minutes wondering what the heck we got ourselves into this time the jokes became funny and they stayed funny throughout the movie in the first part you just keep asking yourself about this 'malinski' and 'bellini' stuff there are many more examples of this lingo and because they keep repeating the same jokes with different twists they get funnier and funnier in search for this malinski all the main characters are introduced the first one even wackier than the next until half of the film was over we didn't even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing but we sure had a good time the house was loaded appr 250 people and i think about half of them didn't like it and the other half loved the film if you like weird comical movies with great dialogue you will love it apart from clooney this movie deserves a lot better than the 5 6 imdb rating it has at the time i write this but when more ppl have seen it i am sure it will go up 7 0 is reasonable i guess i would give it an 8 out of 10 10 out of 10 after a few beers br br
<START> guernsey maria kraakman belgium netherlands 2005 br br the mousy maria kraakman plays anna a woman in her thirties who finds out her husband fedja van huet is cheating on her but she doesn't dare to confront him she painfully avoids any confrontation with human beings her parents as well as her sister so we have a main character in a feature film that doesn't do much at all we barely know anything about her background or her motivations just a woman who seems to be stuck in a blind alley not just during this difficult episode of her life she obviously suffers from something but why do we in the audience have to suffer as well br br i almost gave up on cinema after seeing this unwatchable mess these were a very dull and painful 90 minutes normally i try to avoid wasting energy on bad film making i'll take the beating and roll with the punches but in this case a fair warning is in place how on earth did nanouk leopold get funding in large part from publicly financed funds for this turkey obviously there was no script to speak off it could be compensated by an ingenious filmmaker with cinematographic ideas or a cast with only a little more appeal none whatsoever just a vaguely defined concept i want to do something from a woman's point of view the result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective on life br br to make things worse there's not an interesting shot to be found in the entire film i cannot think of a cast who could have spiced this one up but johanna ter steege is a small light in the dark if possible with this dire lack of material i'm trying to imagine how leopold tried directing maria kraakman maria look at the horizon we'll film you for three minutes just express sadness a perfect cure for insomnia get a copy and watch this late at night guaranteed too put you to sleep br br camera obscura 1 10
<START> this film show peoples in the middle of the hottest 2 days in austria it shows people humiliating other peoples and being cruel to other peoples it show the inability of people to communicate or talk with others br br in the screening i have attended people were leaving in the middle because they could no longer watch the film and rightly so because the film is not and easy one to watch it has a very depressing message and there isn't any moment of mercy in the film it is a very cruel movie not for everyone's taste you can not speak of terms of enjoyment from this film it grips you in your throat and never let go and in the end you simply feels breathless because of its intensity br br i can not recommend or not recommend this film you should make your own mind based on what i have said earlier just be aware that this is not a regular film and it is not for everyone's taste
<START> i enjoyed watching cliffhanger at the beginning when that woman sarah was full of terror when she was slipping i thought that was a terrifying scene as i would think that when you see that see your nerves in your body get to you because it makes you get full of fright and your heart beats faster i did like watching cliffhanger i think silvestar stallone is a great actor and i think he'll be known as playing rambo and rocky
<START> tyson br br aspect ratio 1 33 1 br br sound format stereo br br reverent though scrupulously fair account of the life and times of champion boxer mike tyson given his conviction on a rape charge the film is careful not to portray him as hero or villain but paints a warts and all portrait of his rise to fame the pressures of success and the people who shaped his destiny for good or bad constrained by time limits the script gallops through a succession of relevant details alighting briefly on significant events culminating with tyson's temporary downfall in 1995 novices will be enlightened by the chronology while boxing fans will be entertained by director uli edel's straight arrow approach to the material he portrays tyson's life as a circus in which he was ultimately led astray by the circumstances of his own success in fact the script reserves most of its venom for tyson's ex wife robin givens characterising her as an ungrateful gold digger who took advantage of his naivety production values are uniformly solid and the cast is superb michael jai white does a fair imitation of the title character george c scott plays tyson's mentor cus d'amato through acres of gritted teeth and paul winfield was surely born to play don king
<START> br br back in his youth the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin but his family forbid it many decades later the old man has raised three children two boys and one girl and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children soon the sister is bored with brother 1 and jumps in the bed of brother 2 br br one might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island but no they are upper class europeans going to college and busy in the social world br br never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non related female and the two brothers never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non related male and the one sister all flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister br br the weakest part of gladiator was the incest thing the young emperor commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage minded girls all over him but no he only wanted his sister if movie incest is your cup of tea then sunshine will slowly thrill you to no end
<START> i had fun watching this movie mainly due to simon pegg who has quickly become a solid box office draw for comedy films br br he is hired from his dead end london publishing job by big shot nyc media mogul jeff bridges as a writer for one of his celebrity rags br br after paying his dues he makes it into the higher echelons of celebrity writing hackdom the seventh room where he gets to be a minor celebrity himself the storyline is very funny and gillian anderson puts in an impressive supporting role as a cutthroat publicity agent br br along the way to success he finds the true meaning of love etc br br the formulaic plot aside the movie was very funny mainly due to simon pegg jeff bridges and gillian anderson kirsten dunst was good as the love interest the rest of the supporting cast did its job well br br this was a good comedy well worth checking out at the theaters
<START> finally a thriller which omits the car chases explosions and other eye catching effects the movie combines a simple plot assasination of a french president with an excellent background it takes a look behind mans behavior with authorities and explains why we would obey almost every order even murder which would be given to us br br furthermore it shows us how secret services can manipulate the run of history and how hardly they can be controlled the best thing on this movie is that there is no classic hollywood end which can easily be predicted
<START> although it's most certainly politically incorrect to be entertained by a drunk there's such a charm to dudley moore's portrayal of lovable lush arthur bach one can't help but feel for this unique and wonderful character how can you not be entertained by that infectious laugh and giggle and utter silliness although i'm not really a liza minnelli fan she was really excellent as linda marolla and i couldn't picture anyone else in that role sir john gielgud was the heart of the film and deserved his oscar the rest of the cast also excellent and that great tune arthur's theme wow truly this was one of the best comedies of the 1980s great films get better with each viewing and that is the case with arthur
<START> ron howard directed this the 1966 cartoon is charming teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot in this movie howard gives us a whoville filled with greedy manipulative self centered whos jim carrey is terrible but i'm sure it's not his fault i imagine the script called for the nastiest person imaginable so carrey channeled tom green and the result is movie magic much like danny devito's penguin in batman returns carrey's grinch is so thoroughly unlikeable that any degree of comedy that might be mined from his character simply evaporates where the 1966 cartoon featured a grinch that we could all identify with carrey's grinch is that angry soulless old man that we've all seen at one time or another sitting in a parked car muttering to himself or tripping toddlers at the supermarket with his cane this grinch is thoroughly bereft of any degree of humanity humor or insight whatsoever and his redemption at the end of the movie rings false the whole movie rings false there is some stupid christmas lighting competition a failed attempt at explaining why the grinch is such a jerk by digging into his childhood and an indecipherable mystery as to why some of the whos have that weird lip extension and some of them don't contrary to the 1966 cartoon i would imagine children would find this movie tiresome irritating and filled with contradictory messages did we really need to see slutty smurf aka christine baranski as martha may whovier in addition ron howard filled the cast with his untalented relatives throw in the requisite butt jokes fart jokes sex jokes and other obligatory carreyesque low brow humor and you have a movie that is about as far from the 1966 cartoon or book that inspired it as george w bush is from rational lucid thought thumbs down on this big fat turkey
<START> i've just watch 2 films of pang brothers the eye and one take only when i watched the eye i was kind of disappointed about this two guys who i had heard good words about them before that film the eye has a really bad script especially the ending childish cliche and too coincident in my opinion but its still good in photography and experimental images so i decided to see one take only and i didn't disappointed again still great photography stunning image mtv style editing cool music and this time the story has a lot of indie spirit logical and beautiful you'll see some tiny plot holes but it doesn't cause any trouble with the storyline the only problem about this film is i get a bad dvd
<START> 1 vampires vs humans br br 2 military reject roughneck squad as first responders to dangerous unknown vampire incursions br br 3 sexy female vampire on the side of the good guys br br 4 plenty of gore and action br br there are four 4 major plot devices that may help you decide if you want to watch this movie if you want all four then the next plot device may not deter you br br 5 in outer space br br that last one almost got me too but i'm glad i watched in a pile of terrible direct to video horror that is the sci fi channel halloween marathon this movie is a breath of fresh air it will stand up against any of the other sci fi channel offerings and even against the other vampire movie natassia starred in who keeps giving uwe boll money
<START> i wandered into this movie after watching the 82 minute borat tonight and left quite disappointed i was a huge fan of wallace and gromit and routinely go to see animated films that being said i found myself nodding off and at one point nearly walked out but stayed waiting for this film to get better never happened br br the visuals are stunning and the voice work is top notch especially in my opinion that of kate winslet and ian mckellen i had to remind myself a few times the bulbous headed lizard villain was gandalf and magneto the problem with this movie for me is it's one of those animated features for the add set it registers after the fact as one zany slapstick routine after another weighed down by a treacle filled plot that pulls out every stop in an attempt to convey an important message it looks a lot like busted oscar bait for the animated category and considering the way it's scoring with critics i wouldn't be surprised if the academy gets it wrong and offers up its hardware but if you're looking for an enjoyable animated feature about rats take my advice and wait for ratatouille
<START> it's so rare to find a film that provides a plot that can't be figured out at every turn surprises throughout delighting throughout br br a couple of things i could not quite understand though is that here you have the lead female character who plays the good girl hard worker and yet in the end she ends up being an anti social risk taker that was not enough to make me not like it though but it did give me pause br br the other thing i could not get was the old man who was being hauled away by the police at the very end of the film i never did get who he was or what his issues were if anyone has any ideas i'd like to hear what they might be br br the film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing very much worth seeing
