<START> king of masks bian lian in china is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film winner of 16 awards from around the world this film based on a true story centers on wang bianlian a street performer in 1930s china who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face change opera he has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance and no one knows how he does it he has a longing desire to have a grandson as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir we then go to the streets and see that people are selling their children because they can't afford to take care of them some are even begging to take their daughters for free because daughters are not worth much in this society wang bianlian's story goes on from there br br the film was so astonishingly good the acting was amazing and the issues were so weighty and well addressed there is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place no one wants a little girl also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the living bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman and while he is famous and well respected he regards himself as something low a half woman as we go further into the film the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it the brutality and corruption of the military and police and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions br br this is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life and xu zhu the actor who plays wang bianlian presents yet another beautiful performance
<START> spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers br br there are bad movies and then there are movies which are so awful that they become affectionately comical in their ineptness such is the case with columbia pictures' 'the grudge ' this cinematic atrocity began when an otherwise well intentioned american saw a japanese made for tv film 'ju on' and was inspired to remake the movie in english this began a virtual tsunami of bad decisions which circumnavigated the globe until it washed ashore in orlando on october 21 2004 br br the premise and i use the word loosely involves a house in tokyo haunted by a skinny momma ghost who looks like a cross between margaret cho and alanis morrisette along with her ghastly sidekick a chubby rambunctious but evil second grader is there anything scarier than a creepy 8 year old japanese boy sure there is count chocula comes to mind with this whimsical bunch we must add a mysterious black cat who i have affectionately named chim chim remember speed racer as you have already guessed they were murdered in this domicile of doom and now desire to kill everyone who enters the premises you see as explained by a japanese detective when someone dies in a rage their ghost seeks revenge on everyone who steps on the property lines as defined by the county commissioner or something like that i forget br br the story begins innocently enough with acclaimed thespian bill pullman leaping to his death from a balcony my guess is bill pullman got this job because of his kids begged him for a trip to tokyo disneyland next we endure the mildly interesting saga of nurse yoko 'oh no don't go in there' screams the audience but alas she heeds not the dire warnings and is predictably snuffed out like a magic lantern about 30 minutes into the movie we finally see its american heroine sarah michelle gellar as karen sarah michelle gellar might be a competent actress but i could not help thinking of buffy the vampire slayer so much so that it was distracting it is the equivalent to having jennifer anniston star in a movie about the adventures of six friends in new york try as you may you just can't stop thinking about the other project which made her famous but i digress karen the nurse is hired as a replacement for the original care giver who disappeared at spooks r us br br she snoops around meets the ghosts coma lady dies and some other stuff happens watching the fair haired vixen searching for clues i half expected her to find the ghost and pull its mask off to reveal it was actually old man gower who owned the abandoned amusement park 'i would've gotten away with it too if it weren't for you meddling kids and that dog of yours ' br br director takashi shimizu who is vying to be the ed wood of asia made two unfortunate decisions involving sound first he choose to use a soundtrack only when someone is about to be killed this is an excellent devise for obliterating any suspense because the audience gets a two minute warning to prepare for another miserably predictable murder second he gave the ghosts a bizarre guttural noise that sounds like a gargling gopher after the movie i heard several people exiting the theatre making the sound and laughing br br sarah michelle gellar ends up being the sole survivor and of course we learn that the fire she set to burn down the house was extinguished in time for the obligatory next chapter however considering the humorous reactions of the audience they did not want a sequel but an apology 'the grudge' could be easily re edited into a comedy perhaps then it will be appreciated for its camp value baring that this will go down as the greatest cinematic thriller since 'godzilla vs megalon ' i would suggest waiting until the movie comes to your local discount theatre where it can receive the public ridicule it so richly deserves
<START> there were a lot of 50's sci fi movies they were big draws for the drive in theaters a lot of them were crappy even back then this movie and 'the day the earth stood still' stand out and both have aged well in their own way from the very beginning with its eerie theremin musical score which still sounds weird since theremins are hardly ever used forbidden planet takes you where no man has gone before speaking of star trek there's so much material in this film that got into star trek tos its like a pilot for the series from the interactive captain first mate doctor the mad scientist alien beings babe in short skirt computer intelligence it is all de rigeur now but this was the first of its kind besides it has good acting and well done artwork which even today evokes a certain awe at the imagery consider how the huge krell machine is successfully depicted with some real depth i saw this as a kid at a drive in 0 when it was a new movie and it scared me of course every movie that was even vaguely scary did back then but i remember being real worried about the invisible monster forbidden planet is a movie a sci fi fan can watch several times and find something new with each viewing
<START> i'm a fan of crash and blade runner and this movie explores some of those highway death and 80s film noir themes that i like to see so i enjoyed it br br in general though the essential stupidity of the film noir protagonist is not pulled off well by the female lead and her hero is nearly a neanderthal hence the kitch warning
<START> in a little town in montana two brothers grow up one of them is norman craig sheffer the other is paul brad pitt their father is reverend maclean and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion and the lessons of fly fishing in this movie fly fishing represents life a little br br the story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen but about the message some things do happen though norman goes to dartmouth to study after six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named jessie emily lloyd and he is invited to teach in chicago paul has become a reporter and is known as the fishing reporter he is famous and it seems he has a nice life but he drinks a little too much and gambles too much br br the movie is very well directed it has a nice score and all of the actors are good the most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography the mountains the woods and the river all look very beautiful if the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch fortunately there is more
<START> it's good to see that vintage film buff have correctly categorized their excellent dvd release as a musical for that's what this film is pure and simple like its unofficial remake murder at the windmill 1949 the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate girlie show with kitty carlisle and gertrude michael leading a cast of super decorative girls including ann sheridan lucy ball beryl wallace gwenllian gill gladys young barbara fritchie wanda perry and dorothy white carl brisson is also on hand to lend his strong voice to cocktails for two undoubtedly the movie's most popular song it is heard no less than four times however it's gertrude michael who steals the show not only with her rendition of sweet marijauna but her strong performance as the hero's rejected girlfriend as for the rest of the cast we could have done without jack oakie and victor mclaglen altogether the only good thing about oakie's role is his weak running gag with cult icon toby wing in fact to give you an idea as to how far the rest of the comedy is over indulged and over strained super dumb inspector mclaglen simply cannot put his hands on the killer even though would you believe in this instance it happens to be the person you most suspect director mitch leisen actually goes to great pains to point the killer out to even the dumbest member of the cinema audience by giving the player concerned close up after close up
<START> first of all this is a low budget movie so my expectations were incredibly low going into it i assume most people looking at the info for this movie just wanted a bloodfest and essentially that's all it is br br plot there really is none it's basically saw but in china and a whole hell of a lot worse cast there is none period special effects absolutely awful in my opinion there were cutaways and the blood was often completely unbelievable because of amounts splatter color texture etc br br i believe the purpose of this movie was supposed to be a brutal shock film now it had some great potential on a bigger budget but poor scripting poor dialogue awful acting what seemed like camcorder video shots and just plain unbelievable gore made this movie truly awful br br there are movies worth taking a chance against some reviews even b rate movies deserve some opportunities blood trails for example was the most recent i saw against reviews that was worth it but this was simply awful i hope that people considering this movie read my comment and decide against it br br i'm all for brutality and shock but the overall unrealism and truly awful acting makes for an awful experience save your time money and chance something else you won't be disappointed
<START> this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen there was absolutely nothing good to say about this movie i have seen some bad movies but this one takes it there is no plot and most of the movie you are either fast forwarding the movie to get it done faster or you are wondering what the hell is going on because you can't seriously think that someone thought of this movie and you are watching it i feel sorry for anyone who has to sit through this painful hour and a half please take my advice and do not watch this movie for i know you will think it is the biggest waste of time you have ever spent in your life
<START> this movie was my first touch with mr sica so i really didn't know what to expect but what i saw just broke all my expectations in a good way br br the storyline is not complex and shows us a life of found boy orphan and particularly his connection into the community of poor people who together built themselves a hood of simple metal plate houses this little city in another city lives own life and things are going fine but one day there is a water resource found and a rich nobles man is getting interested in the buying the place but as the title of the movie hints there is a miracle taking place our character gets a wonder dove from his dead mother what is he going to do to protect his friends and all built city as well br br it was just a masterpiece of natural comedy there is shown the behavior of poor people and how money and property can talk and play with people also many funny moments and scenes are included at the beginning with the spot where sun is shining and many more br br so according to the fact that i m not a comedy lover you should see this movie because i liked it much br br i
<START> i actually found this movie 'interesting' finally one worth my time to watch and rent it is true some scenes were over the top on emotionalism shouting etc but what movie doesn't stress its agenda genre or 'ax to grind' almost none what surprised me is that i read a review elsewhere done by a s fran reviewer on another review site but found his negative review instead a more accurate description of his own review of the movie not of the movie at all anyone that watches this movie will realize that it is great to recommend to family and friends no car chases yea being in an italian family myself i can fully relate to the environment portrayed on the screen the movie has its tear jerking parts as well it is what real life can be in such an environment nice movie
<START> we loved school of rock and jack black we couldn't wait to go and see this movie it was the only time in my life the movie was so bad i wanted to walk out my husband hated it too the only funny parts were in the trailers my husband and i wanted to stand outside the movie theater and tell people to save their money the writing was awful it had every terrible stereotype of hispanic people who should be utterly offended the movie wasn't that long but to us it seemed like an eternity the people in the theater were so restless and silent it was like watching paint dry i made my husband stay because i was sure there would maybe be some redeeming parts but there weren't save you money and your time
<START> yes i am just going to tell you about this one so don't read if you want surprises i got this one with the title christmas evil there was also another christmas horror on the dvd called silent night bloody night whereas silent night bloody night not to be confused with silent night deadly night had lots of potential and was very close to being good this one wasn't quite as good it started out interesting enough watching the villain if you can call him that watching the neighborhood kids and writing in books about who is naughty and nice but after awhile you are looking for some action and this movie doesn't deliver you need character development but this goes overboard and you are still never sure why the heck the guy snaps about an hour in he kills three of four people while a whole crowd watches in terror and the guys he kills aren't even his targets they are just making fun of him this is one of many unsuccessful attempts by the killer to knock of the naughty he then proceeds to try and kill this other guy and he tries to break into his house by squeezing himself into the fireplace he promptly gets stuck and barely manages to get out he then enters through the basement and then tries to kill the guy by smothering him in his bedroom he can't seem to kill the guy this way so he grabs a star off the tree and slits the guys throat what the heck was a tree even doing in the bedroom in the first place oh yeah the killer before this kill stopped off at a party and had some fun too well that is about it except for the town people chasing him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and that tune he wants to play what was that even about he kept talking about something that was never really explained how does it end you ask well since i have spoilers i will tell you he runs off the road in his van and proceeds to well lets just say it was lame
<START> okay this show is nothing but awesome it has a great story line and plot and great actors and actresses jeremy sumpter is so hott and he is perfect for the role he is gunna be big in hollywood he has a bright future ahead this show better last a long time because i really love this show and i hope that it has a lot of success it is so interesting i have been waiting for it to come out for about 6 or 7 months and it's finally here and it's great i tape it too i can watch it whenever i want now too bad its only on once a week though i wish it was on at least twice a week because now i wish that it was tuesday every day hope you all like this show br br ashley
<START> full marks for pacino's rendering of the speech over the dead kid's coffin shakespeare's mark antony would be put to shame br br was it paul schrader or was it ken lipper who should be complimented on the remarkable dialogues they are rich and intelligent and well worth your time if you like movies with good scripts i found the story narrative developing quite well right up to the voice over postscript br br there is little else to talk about in this film even john cusack has done better roles than this one interestingly the film is very male oriented the women are mere appendages
<START> this film by oscar petersson is unique its uniqueness doesn't lie in the story since many a half brained hollywood production has served us comparably miserable plots but rather in the thorough way that complete and utter lousiness in one aspect is joined with equal lousiness in all other aspects br br the dialog is worse than embarrassing rotten acting and abysmal direction are thrown into the mix bosnians speaking english with heavy swedish accents add an unintentional element of humor uninspired lightning and camera work are icing on the turkey film cake as a sort of surprise for the audience there are a few completely unmotivated slow motion sequences where you'd least expect any to add insult to injury the whole thing is cut by someone devoid of any sense of timing br br the bad guy henchman turns good after hearing good guy's speech scene in the church is the point at which is time to dethrone ed wood from the position as the worst director of all times move over ed wood here comes oscar petersson
<START> an excellent series masterfully acted and directed but unloved i am told by mr deighton and withdrawn by him after a single presentation it is now only viewable in private collections and via the british film institute at special request very unfortunate as ian holm's nuanced portrayal of the weary but determined bernard samson is superb one of his very best performances the supporting cast including the young amanda donohoe and hugh fraser are superb with mel martin playing the conflicted and traitorous wife and michael degen as the mercurial werner the story positively simmers with the tragic and fateful personal consequences of the great game
<START> i cannot see why filmmakers remade this movie br br the 1972 movie with mcqueen and mcgraw is almost a classic steve mcqueen was an outstanding actor and baldwin is only an inadequate actor he has no passion in his play also the action in the original getaway was fantastic but the remake has no action it is almost boring despite the fact that the film making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994 br br i don't understand the way that baldwin imprisoned from mexico i think this is a mistake in the story br br so i think that there was no need to remake it or if they decided to remake a classic they must choose an excellent actor for the first role like johnny depp or brad pitt
<START> this is the finest film ever made to deal with the subject of aids it's a documentary about two men living with and dying of this illness the film is beautiful heartbreaking funny and incredibly moving above all it is an amazing true love story be sure to have a few hankies ready before you watch this movie you will need them extraordinary
<START> seriously the only good thing about this year ceremony were the winners br br although the ceremony itself was pretty short it still was somewhat boring i think it's seriously time to look for a new director and producers for the show who can come up with something really new it's pretty obvious that they tried to make the show more 'hip' and appealing for a younger audience this year by letting beyonce perform and letting p diddy and prince present a category also letting chris rock be the presenter was an attempt to re new the ceremony and make it more appealing none of it really worked out br br sure chris rock is a funny guy but he wasn't really a good presenter i really merely saw him as a guy who just talked every now and then in between of the different categories his presence wasn't really as 'big' as for instance billy crystal's br br also the handing out of the awards was pretty dumb at times not letting everybody come to the stage but also handing out some of the awards in the middle of the theater was plain weird br br still i can't remember being any more satisfied with the award winners none of the movies really swept away the awards as the last couple of years always had been the case so does that mean it had been a good year for movies with lots of competitive contestants i don't think so i think most of the movies will be largely forgotten in 20 years from now with the exception of million dollar baby and the passion of the christ maybe sure i don't agree with every single award that was handed out this year for instance caleb deschanel should had won for best cinematography not that i don't like robert richardson's work he really did some amazing work for most of oliver stone's work but i really feel that deschanel deserved the award way more also i would had liked seeing jim miller and paul rubell win for best editing and john debney for best music but oh well there is no way the academy awards can please everybody of course i understand that there will always be people complaining about the winners br br it also was funny to see that most of the award presenters were way more nervous than the nominees and winners did prince said any of the nominees names right at once and were is sean penn's sense of humor al pacino and jeremy i hope they missed irons were the best presenters of the night br br overall a very forgettable show but with nice winners br br 4 10
<START> cq was the worst film i saw this year nearly every film i choose to see in the theater is at least entertaining or has something to say this film looked like like it was directed by a film student for his intro to filmmaking class his father makes great films his sister made a good one but brother roman no one critic had the audacity to compare this film to godard's le mÃ©pris contempt while coppola jr did take the same idea a film about film he tried too hard to make himself seem european artsy and witty when it's all really just kitsch the lead actor carries the same expression through the whole film like he's either in awe or in shock of this film being made around him schwartzman somehow manages to pull off his role as a flamboyant director depardieu is alright the one scene that has any real film spoof humor at all is surprisingly not the b movie scenes but rather one which takes place in italy a montage of shots of several various characters inside a very small car driving around picking up and dropping off random people this was the only thing that reminded me of the cinema i am guessing he was trying to spoof or rip off or both the documentary with the lead talking into the camera and filming various objects has been played out the ending was tagged on for the sake of a twist or artistic value i suppose the funniest thing about this film was the film itself and not in the way it intended no wonder this film was sent back after a festival screening to be re edited or re shot or whatever which makes me curious as to just how bad it was before i can't believe it could have been worse than this if you want to see a good parody of film check out the austin powers films any of them the opening to the third is more entertaining and more genius than this entire film lil' romy for the sake of cinema please go back to directing your cousin's music videos leave the godfathers to daddy
