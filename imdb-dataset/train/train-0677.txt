<START> impressed this is the worst srk movie and one of the worst bollywood movies i ever saw i didn't like the novel but this movie made it worse very bad music even worse actors apart from srk of course though even he doesn't manage to save the movie and not much sense the director makes it all look very confusing god knows why maybe it's because he's trying to make it all look very surrealistic and yet credible well he manages neither br br even if you've got a few hours to loose don't watch this movie please saying this for your own welfare keep searching you will find something else to watch
<START> well i have to say this movie was so bad that i would have walked out if i didn't have to review it for work and the worst part is i wanted to see it so badly that i drove all over the city paid 10 parking two times because the newspaper listings were wrong vince vaughn plays the guy he always does the only time i've seen him play someone else was in that movie with john travolta anyways the plot has potential it sounded great in the preview but it is filled with totally ridiculous predictable weak plot turn points and i was hoping that this would be one christmas movie where christmas didn t have to be saved and that santa didn't need a replacdmetn but nope the only cool part was the sleigh rides and the little bladck kid was the best character i'm sure this movie would be great for young kids but for adults it's so lame that it's chore to sit through
<START> this is one lowly film it has no real plot we never are made privy to motivations other than wealth the characters are some of the worst actors ever to be put on film the threat seems to be supernatural but then it's being controlled by these three older people why are they doing what they are doing in order to strike fear into other members of the group i don't know there is some mist from a fog machine that rolls around in the halls and everyone seems to be scared of it does it do something i don't know there's some nudity for its own sake i'm always surprised to see this in films this old things have actually settled down in this regard these days anyway the people run around like chickens ready for the ax they have no plan no resources no nothing there are about five silly climaxes in the film who are these people and is there a ghost or demon what happened to the other people i challenge anyone to tell me this with any confidence what a mess
<START> corridors of time the movie you can watch if you're looking for a sophisticated way of suicide some use guns ropes or gas but you want to ruin your brains do not wait any longer corridors of time is probably one of the biggest possible mistakes thinking christian clavier is able to act and to bring you fun i do not miss the 45 francs this poor thing cost me sometimes one has to reset its evaluation system looking at the absolute zero this film deserves a 2 10 but that's only because i like jean reno too bad for him he also stars in ronin i think i'm gonna dislike him
<START> this the finest achievement from georg wilhelm pabst's social realism period is based upon a tragedy in early 1906 that claimed the lives of nearly 1100 french miners as a coal dust explosion deep in mines at courrieres in northern france took place after a fire had smouldered for three weeks eventually releasing deadly pit gas that brought about the fatalities estimable designer erno metzner creates stark sets that simulate the tragedy providing a perception of reality augmented by matchless sound editing with the only music being produced by integral orchestras during the beginning and ending portions of a work for which aural effects possess equal importance with the eminent director's fascinating visual compositions pabst's manner of invisible editing that segues action from shot to shot through movements of players proves to be smoothly integrated within this landmark film that also showcases sublime cinematography utilizing cameras mounted upon vehicles enabling the director to shift amid scenes without having a necessity of cutting although the work's cardinal theme relates to socialist dogma the unforgettable power of this film is held in its details born of pabst's nonpareil skill at weaving numerous plot lines into a cinema tapestry that stirs one to admiration for german rescue squads of whom their fatherland is greatly proud while no less despairing of disastrous losses to the families of french victims certainly a seminal triumph fully as stimulating today to a cineaste as it was at the time of its first release
<START> this is a wonderful new crime series bringing together three old stalwarts of british television denis waterman james bolam and alun armstrong as retired detectives brought back to help clear up old cases under the leadership of younger career focused amanda redman the three quirky irritable old cops make a brilliant team applying twenty year old detection methods in a police force which has moved a long way on since then sometimes with effect at other times to the horror of their senior officers the three are portrayed sympathetically warts and all there are splendid comic scenes and some very moving ones as each of the three has to come to terms with growing old and the legacy of their pasts br br at the end of the first six part series we are promised a further series next year each of the characters had developed widower james bolam cannot come to terms with his wife's untimely death lothario denis waterman is learning to accept his role as grandfather and even obsessive alun armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past and keep taking the medication while amanda redman has to face the all too familiar conflict between having a life and a career the story lines have been interesting if rather heavily dependent on the wonders of dna testing but it is the interplay of four of britain's finest actors which has made the series unmissable
<START> rosenstrasse is a touching story of courage in adversity reichdeutch women find that their jewish husbands have been locked up pending deportation one an aristocrat disowned by her family lena fischer finds herself among the mob as does general gudarian's sister but rank and privilege merit no special consideration br br nor does service to the reich as a female detainee whose husband is on the ostfront will learn in one of the most horrifying scenes of the movie the guards take the wedding band given by her soldier husband br br lest you think this is typical german brutishness we in america today have lady bush imperiously ordering the arrest of gold star mothers mothers of us service members killed in action because their very presence is offencive little regrettably has changed in the 60 years from der fuher to der fumbler br br fortunately the eight year old daughter ruth escapes capture br br waiting in the cold on rosenstrasse lena fischer is at first reluctant to take in ruth responding in a way that we take as typically german even lena fisher's brother colonel arthur von eschenbach who is aware of and opposed to the holocost cautions lena against it but lena chooses to embrace the idea with an american rebelliousness even renaming ruth the more aryan sounding name helga lehmann br br the siege ends favourably on rosenstrasse but lena mourns what happened to ruth after the war years later ruth's daughter hannah sets out in search of her mother's past and meets 90 year old lena under the guise of writing a personal history of the war br br i did deem it interesting that hannah wanted so much to look up the family but never checked on the fate of her grandfather last known to have served on the ostfront
<START> those who only remember the late sir peter ustinov as hercule poirot or a professional raconteur would do well to seek out this charming piece of late '60s satire ustinov stars as a convicted embezzler we first see him during his last day in gaol where he is preparing the prison governor's tax return who sensing that the future is in computers poses by means of a deft piece of identity theft as a computer expert and sets out to infiltrate an american multinational br br ustinov who co wrote the script is on top form as is the delightful maggie smith here unusually cast as an accident prone cockney sparrow dolly bird bob newhart also puts in an amusing performance as a suspicious executive who has designs on maggie smith in addition karl malden is satisfyingly sleazy as ustinov and newhart's womanising boss br br what do i particularly like about this film not only is it a well thought out 'caper movie' but it's also a touching little love story ustinov and smith are very convincing as the two misfits stumbling into love the whole scene involving the deck of cards is particularly effective br br so what is there not to like well the script is no more computer literate than most films that is hardly at all even though it captures the feel of late '60s 'big iron' business computing quite well also there are a couple of small plot glitches that you're not likely to notice until the second or third viewing but i consider these to be minor niggles br br as i said this is a film which is well worth seeking out and after you've seen it once you'll want to see it again at regular intervals br br
<START> this is not a film you can really analyse separately from it's production the audience became the film makers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the american film industry we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend how is it possible to be objective this is our movie isn't it or is it there may be nothing more disingenuous than a film maker who promotes himself as the audience's friend giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them just look at that prime self publicist eli roth promising gore hounds all the viscera missing from literally gutless mainstream horror films only to churn out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like 'hostel' br br david r ellis may not have spawned the monster that was the internet response to his film but he was quite understandably quick to engage with it he took the carnival huckster school of film making to a new level getting the fans to build what they would eventually buy so many have enthused over this interactive democratic approach to film making that they seem to have missed the point that this is the most cynical form of film as marketing nothing is included that the film makers know the fans won't buy and any old suggestion that will get bums on seats is incorporated the fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to know br br isn't this just the evolution of the focus group approach individual creativity talent craft ideas all are sacrificed before the inane chatter of the masses it's a critical commonplace that focus groups and test screenings don't make for good movies why should the preemptive intervention of internet enthusiasts be any different because we happen to be film fans well thank god for us because otherwise i might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snake br br so yes i had fun at the movie a midnight showing fresh from the pub and with a bucket of ice cream but it actually had relatively little to do with the film and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere like christmas everyone seemed determined that they would have fun no matter what there was laughter but i don't know if it was with the film or at the film with a film as calculated as this one is that even a meaningful distinction there are some genuinely good aspects to the film samuel l jackson gives a well judged performance pure self parody but with a real sense of pleasure rachel blanchard and lin shaye are decent in limited roles and there are one or two inspired moments the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulate br br the stock characters are to be expected but the total lack of suspense isn't what's the point of a film that combines two great phobias if there's no creeping menace there are several snake jumps out moments but they're incredibly badly staged only the annoying british man gets a decent pulpy death scene the other killings are oddly flat the demise of the honeymoon couple for instance is shamefully botched most of the actors fail to make an impression it's a shame that a charismatic actress like julianna margulies should seem so tired when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a roller coaster she could be talking to the audience the film falls far short br br there are worse movies but there are many many better another reviewer on this site compared this film with 'lake placid' and it's as apt a contrast as any i can think of that film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent the jokes were funny the suspense sequences were scary and it wasn't devised by committee that the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus i don't need a post pub midnight showing to have a good time with that film br br this film will in time fade to become a mere footnote in film history if it sets a precedent however i'm genuinely worried about what might be crossing our screens in a couple of years time in all probability nothing much will come of it perennial popcorn favourites 'raiders of the lost ark' 'alien' 'halloween' and of course 'star wars' just aren't produced by group think br br in the mean time i'll tell you what i haven't half got a craving for some ingmar bergman
<START> the potential was there i saw creep and thought 'oooh this is getting interesting' several times yet somehow the interesting plot lines wound up unexplained or ignored like they never happened the lead character was irritating throughout the movie and at one point my fella and i both shouted that we wanted her to die there are some genuinely spooky scary moments but these are grossly overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed the hell out of me it's another one of those horror movies that crops up and intrigues you for a while but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the movie makers were trying to achieve br br the one saving grace of this movie is the bad guy but when the baddie is more likable than the lead character you know you're on to a loser
<START> that's my bush is a live action project made by south park creators trey parker and matt stone the show was cancelled after one season not because of bad reviews it actually got good reviews but because it was very expensive that's my bush is a pretty funny spoof of an average network tv sitcom it is also a political satire now this is nowhere near as good as south park but it is a very funny spoof of a sitcom and also a pretty good political satire the guy who plays in that's my bush looks a lot like him if you can find the show check it out there are plenty of laughs to be had br br 9 10
<START> pinjar by mr dwivedi is an awesome movie its definitely the greaest and finest of 2003 there are very good performances in it dwivedi knows what he can extract from mast urmila she is like u have never seen before one true great performance along with her is a fine actor manoj bajpai who has shown bollywood what he is with bhiku mhatre the movie is about a girl urmila living in pre partition pakistan she is from a punjabi family livin in a small town she is been kidnapped by a muslim guy as a part of a going on for years kinda fight with the punjabi family and then follows a series of twists and turns as urmila's arranged marriage is due in few days this movie is truly a very good movie the storyline is solid with an amazing screenplay all the performances like lillete dubey isha koppikar u wont believ but she can act as well besides jus dancin on khallas kulbhushan kharbanda and many more those sets with pre partition pakistan costumes cinematography sound background score add to the positive points from the start till the end u r stuck to u'r seat with the question whats next this movie is not jus worth watchin but deserved to be a part of your movie collection the ultimate scene is the end of the movie i would suggest all those no kabhi khushi kabhi gum and no dil to pagal hai crowd to watch this amazing flick my rating 10 10
<START> i own this movie and have watched it several times throughout the years since it was released prince doesn't stun us with his phenomenal acting style or anything he's a musician and i feel like that is what he displayed here he's just the best one to tell this story through influence most of this movie is straightforward and teenish but that is the directors writers fault still it is a great movie with even better music the principals and moral convictions in purple rain are quite strong and if more movies would rely on the basics we are taught as young children we would have a better all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art
<START> william shakespeare would be very proud of this particular version of his play not only is it the best movie version of it but it's also the only complete version of hamlet kenneth branagh's hamlet is simply genius not only because it was written by shakespeare but also because it had the guts to do the whole thing even if it went just over four hours br br we all know the story of the prince of denmark and his plot to avenge his father's death so i won't go into the details of the story i will however tell you that the best part of this hamlet version is not the breathtaking sets or the stunning photography but the actors' interpretations of each character i doubt you'll find a better polonius than richard briers' delicious portrayal plus you can't go wrong with julie christie and jack lemmon also derek jacobi a regular among shakespeare adaptations is magnificent as the antagonist to hamlet br br of course we must talk about kenneth branagh he wowed audiences when he came onto the scene with his first outing with shakespeare henry v he outdoes himself with hamlet sure olivier's presence was captivating but i think branagh's performance is wonderful when you watch him on screen it's almost as if he knew exactly how shakespeare wanted the role to be played how he wasn't nominated for an oscar is a total mystery at least the movie got a few nominations and even an odd choice for screenplay i guess they know good writing when they see it though br br all in all you'll never find a more rich and lavish production of the bard's best play to say that the technical aspects were awesome would be an understatement if you love this play and are a fan of shakespeare you definitely need to check this movie out even if you don't really care for shakespeare the visuals will keep you occupied for the duration of the film you may not think you'll be able to sit through all of it at once but you'll soon find out that pausing this movie will make you want to see it even more
<START> having read some of the other comments here i was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised reality check the original series wasn't that good i think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and daisy duke's legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted the duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks the shrunken boss hog was too cretinous to be evil and rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment it's amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series br br back to the movie if you watch this film in it's own right not as a direct comparison to however you remember the tv series then it's not bad at all the real star is of course the general lee the car chases and stunts are excellent and that's really what d o h is all about johnny knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with seann william scott as cousin bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious dumb and dumber sort of way the tv series never achieved the lovely jessica simpson is a natch as miss daisy burt reynolds makes a much improved boss hog and m c gainey makes a believably nasty rosco p coltrane the way he always should have been br br if you don't like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldn't be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect otherwise if you want an entertaining car action movie with a few good laughs that's not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind
<START> forget neo and bourne and all those half baked made up modern heroes they only look 12 year oldish to please the wide audience of geeks that want to be their heroes since they cannot be rambo or mcclane or even indiana jones hollywood allowed a bunch of fakes that have no beard and yet fulfill teenagers wishes to see something that looks very much like an action flick br br however their action set pieces are just painful to watch and any girl may challenge their masculinity without question this explains the recrudescence of oldies on our silver screens over the past few years for better rocky rambo or worse die hard 4 where john mcclane brace yourselves had no beard br br i say it is high time a new hero walked up and put their reign to an end this largo winch movie is far from perfect and perhaps too predictable at times but at least tomer sisley delivered a very promising performance as an action hero and the only one time where he was weakened is when mÃ©lanie thierry shaved his beard i rest my case br br i didn't know it when i entered the theater room but this might be the movie i've been waiting for a decade for the first time in france since belmondo can a movie be both well crafted and rooted in b genre without blushing over its performance in the meantime all we had to chew on was either a gigantic pile of dung or something too restricted to reach a wider audience in other words it was le pacte des loups or dobermann i like dobermann mind you i believe largo winch has what it takes to be both popular and quality film making br br i exited the theater room very pleased and hungry for more
<START> offbeat slow paced entertaining erotic thriller with many graphic and blasphemous scenes that will undoubtedly disturb some viewers however it'll be hard even for them not to appreciate the several imaginative sequences this film contains or to ignore krabbe's first rate performance verhoeven maintains an intriguing ambivalence throughout the film playing with the meaning of the hero's visions omens unfortunately in the last 5 minutes everything turns into a blur and the unsatisfying ending is certainly not as good as the rest of the movie
<START> i have been a fan of pushing daisies since the very beginning it is wonderfully thought up and bryan fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this show br br it is unbelievable on how much tv has been needing a creative original show like pushing daisies it is a huge relief to see a show that is unlike the rest where as if you compared it to some of the newer shows such as scrubs and house you would see the similarities and it does get tedious at moments to see shows so close in identity br br with a magnificent cast wonderful script and hilarity in every episode pushing daisies is by far one of the most remarkable shows on your television
<START> yes commitment let's say fever pitch might trick you into believing it's a baseball movie br br but no you don't have to be a baseball fan to actually enjoy this picture from the farrelly brothers but of course if you are one you will enjoy it even more with all the references pretty accurate ones i'd say to the boston red sox and its bittersweet history from the curse of the bambino and everything attributed to it including those two words you cannot pronounce in front of a boston fan bill buckner br br drew barrymore and jimmy fallon portray two people who usually might have second thoughts of going into a relationship the successful workaholic who is also affluent meeting a school teacher thing is fallon's character wins barrymore's heart by being funny caring sweet and downright perfect but her friends ask her a logical question if he's such a keeper why is he still on the market enter the boston red sox he's been so committed to his team ever since his uncle passed his sox season tickets to him he has never missed a red sox home game at fenway park in a long while br br and that delicate balance how much is the workaholic willing to give up for his guy's obsession and how much is that baseball crazed teacher willing to compromise in order to keep the other love of his life is what this movie is all about br br at first you might think that the sports obsession bits of the movie are exaggerated for comic relief well i'm sad to admit they are not myself as a die hard houston astros fan can say they are all true i would try at every way available to see every 'stros game listen to them on the radio or follow them on the internet i read the chronicle's sports section every day and yes my room looks like the shed minute maid park's gift shop with a closet full of astros gear including 5 jerseys 20 t shirts and you know the rest fallon's character even has the red sox mbna mastercard br br fallon was credible enough as the fanatical red sox faithful even though he could pull it off without becoming a cartoon thank god adam sandler wasn't in it and the plot revolved around how this couple tried to manage with each other's passions br br i'd say it'll be a classical romantic comedy not enough to be among the best movies in history but certainly breaks a mold into the genre and is appealing enough for men and women alike
<START> if this had been done earlier in the zatoichi series it could have been one of the best it is good enough as most of them are but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the series at this point the situation is unusually intriguing the farmers in the province have two champions a benevolent boss for once and a philosopher samurai who starts a sort of grange both run afoul of the usual local gangsters who want the crops to fail because it increases their gambling revenues and their chances to snap up some land their chief or powerful ally is a seeming puritan who is death on drinking and gambling but secretly indulges his own perverse appetites he also resembles dracula as the villains in the later zatoichi movies tend increasingly to do these characters have enough meaning so that they deserved to be set against zatoichi as he was drawn originally but by now he has lost many of his nuances and the changes in some of the characters such as the good boss and the angry sister of a man zatoichi has killed need more time then the movie has to give so that the story seems choppy as if some scenes were missing other than that the movie shows the virtues of most of the others in the series good acting sometimes lyrical photography the creation of a vivid believable and uniquely recognizable landscape the absence of which is obvious in the occasional episode where the director just misses it and a technical quality that of its nature disguises itself the imaginatively varied use of limited sets so their limitations seem not to exist and of course there is the keynote actor whose presence as much as his performance makes it all work this must be one of the best sustained series in movie history
