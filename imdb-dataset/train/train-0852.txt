<START> maybe i'm missing something because i've read more positive things about the man who cheated himself than i have read bad reviews and i just don't get it i like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak look and act like humphrey bogart in the big sleep or gene tierney in laura none of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it take the lead actor lee j cobb his rumpled rolled out of bed look is about as far from the dashing smooth talking noir archetype as you'll find or take jane wyatt as the femme fatale as another example this is one of the worst cases of miscasting i've seen in a while she's just not convincing in the role br br as for the plot it's tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre i could have predicted the outcome of the man who cheated himself after about five minutes and that final cat and mouse chase scene is plain old dull ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it
<START> the movie may be great i just watched it last night but feel unable to give an honest opinion of it because i read the book first the book is so much better than the movie that i was disappointed with the film if you plan to watch of human bondage don't read the book beforehand on the other hand the book is so good and contains so much more than the love affair phillip has with mildred you could still enjoy it after seeing the movie i do not make this claim lightly i average reading a book every 4 days and read such disparate authors as danielle steel ovid faulkner plato and shakespeare of human bondage gets my vote as one of the top ten novels ever written
<START> this movie is poorly conceived poorly acted and poorly written br br jon heder is terribly annoying and cannot escape the same napolean dynamite routine self obsessed and ignorant br br furthermore diane keaton plays the same manish overly obsessed mother who cares too much and yet not nearly enough about the lives of her children see because i said so br br anna faris though i generally like her plays a vapid idiot in this film as well br br jeff daniels is passable but nothing special br br please skip this film if you want to keep your soul
<START> i just want to say that this production is very one sided breaks the impartiality needed if you want to be taken seriously br br there are no credits of the persons they interviewed so you cant have an idea if they are worthy of being heard br br tells the story from just one point of view to do this is very dangerous because the next generations learns the bad idea and thats why wars keep coming i know this is not the only reason about wars but doesn't help either br br you can watch this documentary but read in the internet a lot before balcans are complex as human history is
<START> a good film with strong performances especially the two leads the film is about two american girls who are caught with 6 kilo's heroin on an airport in thailand they're both thrown in prison and one of them signs a confession bill pullman plays the lawyer who tries to get them out all they have to do is find a nick parks who put the narcotics in the bag of one of the two girls so far for the story which isn't that original it has many resemblances with the better return to paradise br br the acting and newton thomas sigel's beautiful photography make this film worth to watch a 7 out of 10
<START> having just seen this on tmc it's fresh in my mind it's obvious that while the stooges are featured stars they don't really run the show first they're broken into 2 groups moe as shorty and larry and curly as a pair of vagrants so there's not a whole lot of full team work the love story that fuels the plot is uninteresting the two ladies are the only ones with any acting ability there's another group of musical stooges that are unfunny unless you consider their attempts at being funny to be sadly buffoonish the music is tiresome they drive cars to the ranch and then depend on horses the dorky western wear is silly and there's an awful lot of the movie with no stooges on camera by the way this is obviously after curley's first stroke and his reduced energy level is clear vernon dent appears early on in an uncredited role i loved everything these guys ever did including all the non curley stuff but this little dogie is pretty lousy
<START> bizarre horror movie filled with famous faces but stolen by cristina raines later of tv's flamingo road as a pretty but somewhat unstable model with a gummy smile who is slated to pay for her attempted suicides by guarding the gateway to hell the scenes with raines modeling are very well captured the mood music is perfect deborah raffin is charming as cristina's pal but when raines moves into a creepy brooklyn heights brownstone inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor things really start cooking the neighbors including a fantastically wicked burgess meredith and kinky couple sylvia miles beverly d'angelo are a diabolical lot and eli wallach is great fun as a wily police detective the movie is nearly a cross pollination of rosemary's baby and the exorcist but what a combination based on the best seller by jeffrey konvitz the sentinel is entertainingly spooky full of shocks brought off well by director michael winner who mounts a thoughtfully downbeat ending with skill 1 2 from
<START> the last wave is never going to win over the mainstream audience it is a slow moving but fascinating film for those who are willing to go along with it an australian properties lawyer is asked to take on the case of five aborigines accused in the murder of one of their own all sorts of portents and omens soon pop up as the man's death involves a tribal issue that was not meant for white man's court and pretty soon the lawyer is having trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy it looks like the end of the world may be at hand and he and the aborigines may know this but no one else does richard chamberlain as the lawyer is at his peak here david guptil a familiar face from several other australian flicks and a decent actor is one of the five aborigines on trial the last wave is simply not for everyone anymore than is magnolia both happen to have strange things falling from the sky check it out on a slow saturday night
<START> care bears movie 2 a new generation isn't at all a bad movie in fact i like it very much yes i admit the dialogue is corny and the story is a bit poorly told at times but darkheart while very very dark is a convincing enough shape shifting villain and hadley kay did a superb job voicing him speaking of the voice acting it was great nothing wrong with it whatsoever the animation is colourful and some of the visuals particularly at the beginning were breathtaking the songs and score are lovely especially growing up and forever young the latter has always been my personal favourite of the two the care bears who i do like are adorable and the human children are well done too and the ending is a real tearjerker all in all harmless kiddie fun 8 10 bethany cox
<START> ok how's this for original this mean rich old geezer leaves his estate to his adult children all of them ungrateful losers and two creepy servants provided they spend the week in his spooky old house what happens that night will surprise only those who haven't seen a movie or television show before after a string of murders in which the victims look like they're bleeding restaurant ketchup we have a painfully obvious twist ending the cast is lead by some once respectable actors must have been desperate for their paychecks there are also a few second tier actors who were rising at the time but long forgotten now as a result the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of matlock i will give credit where it's due the closing scene is clever and amusing if you're still awake
<START> i honestly believe that anyone considering film making be subjected to this mind boggling failure like the films of edward wood jr in the '60s and '70s this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers expend so much energy rewriting scripts re editing their films and reworking their special effects until they finally look right this movie is also a decent argument for the studios' pre screening process if mr hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience perhaps he would have cut 75 or the walking running strolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable 90 minutes br br film students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is good enough can truly be every performance every line of dialog every digital effect every filter effect indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for mere mediocrity a beginning filmmaker may find himself herself tempted from time to time to think at least i accomplished something or just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself this movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn out br br critics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment the worst movie ever made br br beginning writers can learn from this film just how important rewrites are and perhaps understand the necessity for rewrites also beginning directors can learn the importance of a good screenplay and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story writers and directors who watch bad made for cable movies of the week and think i can do better than that can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really is to produce even mediocre results br br i sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers particularly those entering the craft in this current post lucas and post spielberg environment there is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects the war of the worlds illustrates clearly that not everyone can pull it off some can't even come close to it
<START> never viewed this film until recently on tcm and found this story concerning poland and a small town which had to suffer with the nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other european cities for example norway the first world war was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which war always creates alexander knox wilhelm gimm gorky park returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town he was brought up a german and was not very happy with the polish people and they in turn did not fully accept him either as the hitler party grew to power wilhelm grimm desired to become a nazi in order to return and punish this small polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind marsha hunt marja pacierkowski chloe's prayer played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with whilhelm gimm there are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the nazi destroyed people's families and their entire lives the cattle cars are shown in this picture with jewish people heading to the nazi gas chambers if you have not seen this film and like this subject matter give it some of your time this film is very down to earth for a 1944 film and a story you will not forget too quickly
<START> i watched this movie at 3'o clock in the morning a time in the day where i am usually very open when it comes to movies but still i think it wasn't good this movie wasn't good at all the reasons why are many br br the acting isn't all that good and time after time situations occurring in it reminded me of a poor 90's chevy chase comedy i mean come on like the handcuff situation and the poker situation amongst the servants this movie was so obviously based very much on the first one and thats ok but if i hadn't seen the first one before seeing this it would have sucked even worse like the ending it came very suddenly and i felt like i got no closure what so ever sebastian changed very suddenly and this this movie seems like it was made solely to explain nr 1 and like no time or effort was used on making anything else good the score is the same as in the first one and it didn't feel like a movie at all br br they should have handled the situations with more style and class but they didn't and therefore this movie turned out bad
<START> i'm glad some people liked this but i hated this film it had a very good idea for a story line but that's where it ended it was badly written badly acted and badly made br br it had some interesting plot points but they were just skipped over too fast the writers needed to realize what to keep in and expand on these bits like lying about why she was kidnapped and ditch the dross instead it was what's going on 5 seconds later they tell you br br this film had no suspense and i was bored from start to end i just wanted it to finish br br go and rent misery or best laid plans if you want suspense or twists that keep you guessing to the end
<START> back in 1985 i caught this thing i can't even call it a movie on cable i was in college and i was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging out of control i figured out early on that this was hopeless stupid script a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women bad acting with one exception and pathetic jokes the plentiful female nudity here kept my friend happy for a while but even he was bored after 30 minutes in remember this was a high school boy this was back before nudity was so easy to get to by the internet and such we kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but that never happened the funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted this film was crap one poster had a fictional review that said this is the best movie i've seen this afternoon only grant cramer in the lead showed any talent and has actually gone on to a career in the business no budget and boring t a skip it
<START> great softcore sex revealing and sexy and plenty of it ignore the ignoramus who doesn't realize that raunchy is sexy if done the right way if you erotic go watch that red shoes diary junk if you want hot and exciting softcore done properly this is the movie to watch if you like the more explicit skinemax films you'll like this one great softcore sex revealing and sexy and plenty of it ignore the ignoramus who doesn't realize that raunchy is sexy if done the right way if you erotic go watch that red shoes diary junk if you want hot and exciting softcore done properly this is the movie to watch if you like the more explicit skinemax films you'll like this one
<START> terrible movie nuff said br br these lines are just filler the movie was bad why i have to expand on that i don't know this is already a waste of my time i just wanted to warn others avoid this movie the acting sucks and the writing is just moronic bad in every way the only nice thing about the movie are deniz akkaya's breasts even that was ruined though by a terrible and unneeded rape scene the movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of garbage br br ok now i am just going to rag on imdb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text minimum first i waste my time watching this offal then feeling compelled to warn others i create an account with imdb only to discover that i have to write a friggen essay on the film just to express how bad i think it is totally unnecessary
<START> sadly it's true legiunea strÃ¤inÃ¤ exposes with absolute clarity the parameters of daneliuc's irreversible failure br br as it was already said the author lost the faculty to coalesce his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form maniacally concerned with the mechanic trick of picking at random news subjects and join them together without any legitimacy he only gathers a disordered pile of events unable to follow the least story line the script's level is similar to a cÃ¢ntarea romÃ¢niei amateur play about the glorious feats of socialist realism only turned upside down while the communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sugary festivism now daneliuc is as perniciously obsessed only with negativism and disgusting scatology the ideas content is zero and the message infantile and didactic at a kindergarten level br br unfortunately he also forgot the most elementary professional tenets he isn't able anymore to organize a dramatic situation to order it in a correct movie scene to frame it right and to edit it following the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar his level of story telling in film images is similar to phrasing something like holy sheet man it ain't nuthin right 'ere and all da people is asses what a huge distance from the impressive artist of 1976 1984 who had created unique works as cursa proba de microfon vÃ¢nÃ¤toarea de vulpi and even croaziera and glissando sic transit gloria mundi
<START> first of all as a long time student of the titanic disaster and member of several titanic clubs i feel entitled to comment on the film i don't really care how many awards and accolades the film won but to me it is still an absolutely awful film cameron had the resources to make a 'proper' semi documentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a po faced romantic mush the fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows to my mind the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love in fact most real events are anything but romantic and the titanic disaster certainly was not one i feel that it needed a better script and director with a semi documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible i almost threw up in the last sequence where the 'dead' lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who break out in applause is this an intelligent film ask yourself
<START> anyone who has said that it's better than hostel is talking complete crap believe me i'm not a fan of hostel but this is just ridiculous this is just another shot on camcorder straight to dvd low on ideas waste of your time i can't believe how many of these films there are and i'm yet to see a decent one in the 80's video nasties gore and horror movies were made with no budget but a great story and a load of new ideas and most importantly the heart and soul of the director who had something to say now they just seem to be pumped out in an attempt to trick people browsing in blockbuster to rent a copy until people stop doing this then i guess these films will keep appearing this film is so low on ideas it's just amazing how it ever got made the acting is also terrible the location completely unconvincing and the soundtrack is so annoying it beggars belief this waste of time has absolutely nothing going for it unless you're on a quest to compile a list of the worst movies of all time my best worst part of the film is when a female character is pointing a gun at someone and threatening to shoot them if they don't back off you can see that she isn't even covering the trigger with her finger just holding the grip an absolute joke
