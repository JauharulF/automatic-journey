<START> spoilers ahead but does it really matter have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions could this be it why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world why is this question never answered why was the opening text crawl incoherent why would a nun she sure seemed nice hand over 20 orphans to a madman has there always been a gold mine in downtown vancouver why does one of the gold mine's shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage why does tara reid's character suddenly show up at christian slater's apartment for sex or did i just answer my own question why would even a non archaeologist bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer why would modern computers still display green pre tron era grid outlines of objects complete with little bleeps and must all movie explosive timers have digital displays why doesn't anything in this movie make any sense
<START> terrible acting by potter and a flat plot with no tension what so ever and as for the feminist polemic it's laughable i saw this garbage when it was first released and though i found it tedious beyond belief i'm glad i did go to see it that's because i now have an immediate answer to the question 'what's the worst film you've ever seen ' plus i have the comfort of knowing that every film i see for the rest of my life will be better than the tango lesson but i have to admit i was impressed with the way potter wrote a script that would garner the maximum number of arts council grants from around the world as is revealed in the closing credits br br i only very recently saw orlando and i can see how potter learnt the wrong lessons from making that film all it took was a bunch of frilly costumes a few hard stares to camera by the leading lady and a loose plot to seduce the cinema going public so why shouldn't she think she could get away with the self indulgent nothingness that is the tango lesson
<START> a man brings his new wife to his home where his former wife died of an accident his new wife has just been released from an institution and is also very rich all of the sudden she starts hearing noises and seeing skulls all over the place is she going crazy again or is the first wife coming back from the dead br br you've probably guessed the ending so i won't spell it out i saw this many times on saturday afternoon tv as a kid back then i liked it but i was young seeing it now i realize how bad it is it's horribly acted badly written very dull even at an hour and has a huge cast of five people one being the director still it does have some good things about it br br the music is kinda creepy and the setting itself with the huge empty house and pond nearby is nicely atmospheric there also are a few scary moments i jumped a little when she saw the first skull and a somewhat effective ending all in all it's definitely not a good movie but not a total disaster either it does have a small cult following i give it a 2 br br also try to avoid the elite dvd drive in edition of it it's paired with attack of the giant leeches it's in terrible shape with jumps and scratches all over it didn't even look this bad on tv
<START> this is a great movie some will disagree with me but if you know anything about the bible you know it is i think everyone should see it i agree a new updated version like be nice but the message is still right on if you can see this movie is not a scare the hell of you movie it is truthful with the bible i think the u n will play a major role in the world government to come the last days are lining up with the bible look at what has happened with the chip for dogs and cats that now has come to light to protect on children from being kidnapped it's the size of a grain of rice this i feel is the fore runner of the mark of the beast spoken of in the bible without the mark you can't sell or buy with this chip that small in the future there is no telling how much info can be put on it
<START> i have personally seen many disney movies in my lifetime though absolutely none of them match up in any way to bedknobs and broomsticks although i personally wouldn't have crossed live action with animation it was an improvement on trying to dress people up as animation characters the movie pits three evacuees from world war two who are sent to stay with a silent and socially awkward woman in the country i would have to say that the casting was brilliant angela landsbury made a perfect miss price while david thomilson made a great desperate entertainer love interest endings always surprise me and this was no exception it was neither happy nor sad though i do not know if this was intentional the dialog wasn't great but considering it was designed to be a kid's movie that is alright overall i would give the performance nine out of ten the dialog six out of ten the casting nine out of ten and the costumes eight out of ten
<START> i'm still trying to decide if this is indeed the worst film i have ever seen a very disturbing problem with this film is that real scientists are interviewed but their footage is edited to make it look as though they support the ideas of the many bsers who populate this film the bs to signal ratio of the interviews is about ten thousand to one at the end the interviewees seem to be saying we want you to think but they themselves are too lazy to do simple research about things they assert as fact br br if you feel that you are open minded and wish to expand your consciousness please be open minded enough to read some actual books about quantum theory einstein's universe nigel calder a slim volume not a challenge the cosmic code by heinz pagels if you can't bring yourself to read a book please don't complain to reviewers about being open minded br br to recap this film is just unbelievably bad br br you know what's a really good film which questions the nature of reality thirteenth floor directed by roland emmerich with craig bierko gretchen mol vincent d'onofrio smart sexy thought provoking
<START> this film is just another distortion among many distortions on the so called 'sins of consumerism' please note that 'reverend billy' an actor bill talen is nothing more than a bureaucrat against the 'sins of consumerism' we might want to ask are questions like what does 'reverend billy' do for a living how does he make his money does he make his living off his 'tax deductible' organization how does the internal revenue justify this as a 'tax deductible' church or organization br br everyone knows that christmas is commercialized but it affords one day out of a whole year in which people have an opportunity to be charitable and allows a significant number of people to spend time with their families friends or extended families everyone is not charitable everyone does not spend time with their families friends or extended families but holidays and vacation time give people that chance and opportunity yes america does have more than its share of problems but with perseverance americans have and always make it through great difficulties and even in times of strife america has proved itself to be the greatest country in the world that happens when americans pull together and unite rather than to separate and divide yes there are problems with corporations and monopolies but it will take americans to bring back the small businesses along with the ethics to responsibly care for people living in our individual communities yes globalization has brought us its share of problems but it will take americans to bring production back to america americans and the u s government need to learn how to stay on a budget no matter how large or small it may be and we must stop our dependence on credit our over reliance on credit will make and keep us poor from the cradle to the grave it is important to buy but if we buy less we will rely less on credit and if we are able to save even a small amount of money we will have money for a rainy day not to say that as americans we will gain an equal share of wealth wealth is not guaranteed and has never been guaranteed but stratification teaches us that only a small percentage of americans hold most of america's wealth there is a good proximity that you or i can reach the level of the upper middle class and who knows what can happen from there be positive work hard and at the very least you and i will be able to reach at least some if not all of our dreams in life nothing is guaranteed but we always have that something to reach for and if you or i don't have dreams we might as well be dead in america there is always room for plenty of hopes and dreams as individuals we are a part of the pack but we always can become the leader of the pack br br it has always been my experience that churches and religion do offer nothing more than additional distortions but i pay dignity and give respect to people with other beliefs values and perspectives but as far as the distortions expressed within this film i do not have any faith in such beliefs values and perspectives i rank this film with a 1 out of 10 but in all honesty and truth this film deserves a zero this film has no integrity and i cannot recommend it
<START> dreamgirls despite its fistful of tony wins in an incredibly weak year on broadway has never been what one would call a jewel in the crown of stage musicals however that is not to say that in the right cinematic hands it could not be fleshed out and polished into something worthwhile on screen unfortunately what transfers to the screen is basically a slavishly faithful version of the stage hit with all of its inherent weaknesses intact first the score has never been one of the strong points of this production and the film does not change that factor there are lots of songs perhaps too many but few of them are especially memorable the closest any come to catchy tunes are the title song and one night only the much acclaimed and i am telling you that i am not going is less a great song than it is a dramatic set piece for the character of effie jennifer hudson the film is slick and technically well produced but the story and characters are surprisingly thin and lacking in any resonance there is some interest in the opening moments watching jamie foxx's svengali like manager manipulate his acts to the top but that takes a back seat in the latter portion of the film when the story conveniently tries to cast him as a villain despite his having been right from a business stand point for a good majority of the film beyonce knowles is lovely and sings her songs perfectly well but is stuck with a character who is basically all surface glitz anika noni rose as the third member of the dreamgirls trio literally has nothing to do for the entire film eddie murphy acquits himself well as a singer obviously based on james brown but the role is not especially meaty and ultimately has little impact foxx would seem ideal casting but he seems oddly withdrawn and bored the film's biggest selling point is surely former american idol contestant oscar winner jennifer hudson in the central role of effie white the temperamental singer who gets booted from the group and makes a triumphant closing act return for me effie has always been a big problem in both the show and the movie the film obviously wants you to feel sorry for her and rather ham handedly takes her side but i have never been sure that this character deserves that kind of devotion from the start effie conducts herself for the most part like an obnoxious egotistical self centered diva who is more interested in what everyone else can do for her rather than having much vested interest in the group of which she is a part when she is booted from the group for her unprofessionalism and bad attitude the charges are more than well founded but the stage show film seem to think effie should be cut unlimited slack simply because she has a great voice even though the film tries to soften some of effie's harder edges to make her more likable the charges still stand her story becomes more manipulative by suggesting she should have our further sympathy because she is an unwed mother struggling to raise her daughter using the implication that much like the talent card motherhood immediately makes any behavior excusable indeed the only big effort the film makes to show effie's mothering is to tell us about it and then include a scene where she barks at her daughter in the unemployment office insists that the girl has no father and then refuse to look for gainful employment to support them since singing is all she knows in the hands of a skillful actress the gaps could perhaps have been remedied with technique and charisma unfortunately hudson is not that actress she sings well but the dialog driven moments do not come naturally to her nor do high emotional moments effie's signature moment the aforementioned and i am telling you number is well sung by hudson but emotionally flat in the acting department effie is supposed to expressing her rage and desperation at her predicament but hudson comes off as a cabaret performer belting out a hot number all in all not quite the emotional highlight one expects the latter portion of the film is basically a predictable melange of events that maneuver foxx into hudson's earlier position and allow her to strut back in and lord it over everyone foxx's criminal offenses in the film are undoubtedly par for the course of many struggling record producers but the film's seeming implication that he has it coming because he helped usher in the disco era is rather ridiculous not to mention pretentious and condescending particularly coming from a film with all of the depth of a puddle the end result is a faithful rendition of the stage hit drained of emotion energy or anything that can be described as dynamic
<START> okay i absolutely love ben stiller although i am lukewarm about jennifer aniston i do not think this girl can act in the least every movie or sitcom i've seen her in is very hard to get past her fake acting it sounds like she is just standing there reading right off the script this movie only had one good thing about it and that's that ben stiller was in it this plot is so used and abused it's ridiculous how many movies have this same type of plot can we say forces of nature not only is the plot so old but the outcome is so predictable it's boring i knew everything that was going to happen before it did it was a bore but watching stiller is always a delight
<START> a couple move into their dream home unaware that it and its neighbours have been built over land formerly used as a cemetery the film is said to have been based on a true story although how much of it is supposed to be true is not disclosed the plot is hardly unique see spielberg's 'poltergeist' 1982 within a short time they experience various supernatural phenomena these range from the disturbing mysterious shadows the serious illness of the daughter to the frankly ridiculous toilets continually flushing and garage doors going out of control there is little depth to the story once it has become established that the land had been used as a cemetery we do not learn anything more the plot does not seem to develop the characters are not particularly well drawn or in any way memorable nor is the atmosphere particularly special the film could be disturbing to some viewers there is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message from it
<START> the only thing i knew about this film prior to seeing it was robby the robot my preconception was that it was another in a long line of cheesy sci fi flicks that the 1950's was noted for how wrong i was big studio big budget and big production values make this a strong contender at least visually for the best sci fi film coming out of the era i qualify with the word visually because war of the worlds is a lot darker and scarier than forbidden planet and probably fits the mold better as a foray into alien territory br br what impressed me immediately was the color rendition of the cinematography followed by the intricacy and scope of detail involved in dr morbius' walter pidgeon home and laboratory but that was only the prelude to the icing on the cake the labyrinthine underground that served as the krell stronghold it appeared that krell technology was even more advanced than say that of star wars which made me consider audiences for this movie back when it was released probably sat in the same kind of awe that theater goers experienced in 1977 with sw or in 1986 with aliens watching it on a large screen tv in my living room offered me the same effect and i'm fairly resistant to hyperbole br br it's not too much of a stretch to imagine forbidden planet as a direct antecedent of the 'star trek' tv series gene roddenberry himself stated that the movie had a great impact on his vision for the show followers of that short lived series will readily recognize plot elements used here that turned up in 'star trek' i had to do a double take when the men of united planets cruiser c57 v headed for a transporter room while the conundrum presented to robby that created an impossibility to respond was an element used at least two or three times in the st series br br where the movie definitely took a cerebral turn had to do with the whole idea of 'monsters from the id' that morbius himself was using his subconscious mind to defend altaire iv was certainly a unique concept for 1956 when every other sci fi flick of the time was dealing with martians or other grotesque space creatures the film worked it's subtle magic on this viewer by helping me understand that morbius was the protector of altaire iv some time before commander adams leslie nielsen explained it br br you know looking at the calendar the year 2200 isn't that far off this movie may be the one that actually gets it right relative to exploring and living on other planets i think though that they'll have to come up with a sleeker looking version of robby
<START> possible spoiler br br 'return to cabin by the lake' is a useless movie the acting was not good and the plot wasn't even remotely interesting br br 'cabin by the lake' is a good tv movie the sequel was not judd nelson was very good in the first film and put a whole lot more into his character than in this it seemed as if he wasn't even interested in doing the sequel his acting was good but it could have been better i really don't want to comment on the rest of the cast because in my opinion they're not even worth mentioning but i'll do it the character of alison isn't even hardly shown in the first part of the film all of a sudden she's the center of attention next to stanley caldwell the role didn't make sense and it should have been thought out a little better dahlia salem was absolutely terrible her acting was way below decent and the casting people should have looked for somebody else anybody else the director mike was a confusing character he seemed to have a purpose for being there but it didn't seem like his death was necessary the acting for this role was good nothing great but better than salem's br br the plot was real lousy if you think about it stanley who is presumed dead makes his way onto the set of 'cabin by the lake' the movie based on his script he stumbles upon the director and in a short time the director is dead and stanley is running the show yeah out of nowhere the crew is just going to let this stranger come into the picture and finish the film not knowing anything about him there's some killings not a whole lot and the one's that are shown are ridiculous one of the actresses on the set gets electrocuted while filming a scene another character gets chewed up by a motorboat and one gets tangled up in a plant before drowning these writers must have been hard up for excitement br br i just have to say that i was not impressed with the filming of the movie the way that it kept changing from looking low budget back to normal started to become irritating very fast also the new cabin by the lake was poorly created we aren't shown it but only in a few scenes and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless it worked in the first film only because we were shown the room a lot more but it didn't work in this one br br there were too many characters in this sequel all of them except for a few had no reason to be there the acting of what little is showed was really bad and they just didn't have a purpose in this movie br br all in all 'return to cabin by the lake' is a sequel picking up from where the first left off 'cabin by the lake' i can take but this was just not impressive judd nelson should have avoided this one and so should you it's nothing like the first and it went entirely too slow nothing happened in the first hour and it continued to drag on for the second not to mention that the writing was horrible put this on only if you need some help getting to sleep br br so we see that stanley defies death and is still alive and well by the way he talks it sounds like there could be a possible third installment to a movie good just by itself quit throwing in sequels and we may be alright br br did the film makers not realize that they showed us how they filmed the lake scenes from the first one they were all done in a tank never never reveal the secrets of filming br br
<START> i can't even believe that this show lasted as long as it did i guess it's all part of the dumbing down of america personally like david spade said i liked this show better when it went by its original title seinfeld what bothers me the most about this show aside from the obvious base sense of humor and general smuttiness is the pretentious way the episodes are titled truly great shows are still funny after many repeated viewings like the one where rob gets accidentally hypnotized on the dick van dyke show or the one where lucy and ethel work at the candy factory in other words it's an honor bestowed upon great programs by the viewers that the writers and producers of friends would have the unmitigated hubris to actually title the episodes themselves in such a fashion before anyone's even had a chance to even see it a second time speaks to not only the mediocrity and lack of original thinking on the part of said writers but also of the stultified minds of their viewers br br you read the comments of some of these people and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a hallmark card like neverland full of greeting card sentiment the true meaning of friendship i want to be a friend i want to live in manhattan wake up these people are supposed to be working in coffee shops and looking for work as actors but they somehow manage to live in 4000 mo apartments get real all i have to say to those amongst us that want to move to manhattan and live the idyllic new york life with your rosses and monicas good luck with all of that that new york doesn't exist for anyone making less than a serious six figure income but good luck with all of that anyway now shut up and pass the soma
<START> i am not going to lie despite looking interesting i watched the notorious bettie page because i had heard and it was fairly obvious just by looking at a synopsis or anything about the film that gretchen mol got naked in it i have never been a fan of mol but i cannot resist seeing an attractive woman taking off her clothes yes that may be perverted but its a theme and ideal central to the very core of the movie and helps to make the film a lot stronger than it probably should be br br the film chronicles bettie page's mol life from her physical and sexually abused days as a kid in high school in the south and onto her new life in new york she wants to be an actress but she has to pay bills too after taking a few seemingly innocent shots on a local beach page slowly becomes a modeling sensation and quickly jumps from suggestive photos to sexually provocative pin up photographs br br i feel the briefness of the film just over ninety minutes is both a curse and blessing for it on one hand the film never overstays its welcome you get to know page within a few short minutes and then it gets right into her modeling career and does not look back but it curses the film as well because we never really get a chance to grasp everything that is going on she just kind of jumps around between modeling shoots and the controversies that they create before jumping right into the major senate investigation that takes up much of the final act of the film you just sit there and attempt to absorb it all and more just comes right at you it feels like the filmmakers wanted to summarize too much material in too short a film it begs for longer sequences and begs more for even longer explanations it does not feel rushed it just does not feel all there br br another bit of a fumble although a bit more of a curiosity is the use of colour throughout the film the majority is in black and white but frequently splashes and sequences of colour do emerge but while this may have been done as a symbolic gesture early on it becomes a bit of a distraction as it continually pops up later on before cutting back to black and white it gets confusing and becomes more of a tedious interference than anything else as the film goes on br br while it may fumble a bit with the actions the film stays dead on with its themes page who i know little to nothing about is played off innocently and her world is exactly the same save for a few shady characters during her teenage years everyone she encounters is an innocent and everything she does has an innocence to it i never thought i would look at full frontal nudity as being something that was anything other than vulgar and depraved but here it truly is something to marvel at all at once it is beautiful and innocent even the most sexually perverted moments in the film albeit tame compared to today's standards have an innocent and angelic feeling to them there is just something about the way mol's nude body is portrayed that it just strikes at such a different chord than nude bodies in other films it just feels so natural and so wondrous that if there were any reason to watch the film it would be to see the spectacular depictions of mol's body as she plays bettie page br br the other reason is mol herself as page she exemplifies that 1950's southern belle everyone knows or can at least imagine despite her profession she is still a normal person and still looks at herself as being religious mol plays her exactly to the right amount of squeaky cleanliness needed to make this character feel authentically from the 1950's she plays her with such matter of factness that you would be hard set not to think that mol was actually bettie page herself br br unfortunately the supporting cast have very little moments to shine and are totally overshadowed by mol's wonderful performance none of them do anything particularly pleasing and none of them really have that same strength in their role as mol does this is not really the fault of the actors but more of the fact that they do not have much to work with many of them are totally recognizable such as oscar nominee david strathairn in a role a little too close to one of his better performances sarah paulson recent golden globe nominee for studio 60 on the sunset strip and character actor lili taylor but you would be hard set to really place their performance in being anything other than okay none of these characters are really developed and they really just stand as character cut outs who mol runs loops around as she picks up steam in her brilliant performance br br really this film is worthwhile for its portrayal of nudity and for gretchen mol's excellent performance of bettie page everything else is a bit too muddled and awkward than it should be had more work been done to develop supporting characters and not just blast right through the story this film would have been a much better biographical film as it stands it is just a vehicle for mol to really rise into the stratosphere of popularity as an actress br br 7 10
<START> i'll say this to begin with why oh why can't wb do what these short film directors do sandy is obviously an amazing director and deserves some credit from wb and dc but i guess they're kinda put on edge when a man with a 12 000 budget can make a super hero fan drool the world's finest is one of the best short films i've ever seen trailer or not br br i think choosing a bodybuilder mike o'hearn to play superman was a genius choice let's face it people superman is no super model he may be handsome but a gq stud he is not and i don't know what that guy a few comments above me was on but superman is actually pretty beefy have you ever actually read a superman comic i guess that fact alone just floors me it seems like such an obvious choice to get someone with some actual muscle mass to play a super hero rather than a pretty face same thing for batman bartram is in incredible shape and an excellent batman i don't know guys if given a bigger budget and his own movie i think bale and bartram would be neck and neck bottom line this is one of only a scant few of super hero movies with actors that actually look the part br br the acting is pretty nice as well i don't know what every one is talking about o'hearn isn't that bad he's damn convincing as superman and bartram well he is batman i mean come on people this movie had a 12 000 dollar budget what were you expecting everyone else is great too except two face seems a tad crazier than usual but hey we only have tommy lee jones as a reference oh lois is pretty hot too br br the sfx are flippin' sweet too i mean seeing superman lift the car up man how cool is that versus the tank scene in grayson i may have to put this one above that since mike actually looks like he's flying and with ease the flying sequences left something to be desired but once again with a bigger budget oh and he even used a batmobile it was probably a model but it looked damned convincing br br all in all this trailer's only downfall was a lack of a serious budget and wb refuses to admit that collora is a credible director and needs to be apart of some kind a project but no they'll like most of the marvel projects just keep getting these hack directors who show almost no regard for the fans and what they care about and keep churning out these gamble movies thank god superman returns was a hit or that seriously would've been the end of it world's finest is excellent and in my book counts as a superhero movie
<START> at first glance i expected this film to be crappy because i thought the plot would be so excessively feminist but i was wrong as you maybe have read in earlier published comments i agree in that the feminist part in this film does not bother i never had the idea that the main character was exaggerating her position as a woman it's like guzman is presented as somebody with a spine this in contrast to her classmates so i was surprised by the story in fact i thought it was quite good except for the predictable end maybe it would've been a better idea to give the plot a radical twist so that the viewer is somewhat more surprised br br in addition i'd like to say that rodriguez earned her respect by the way she put away her character i can't really explain why but especially in the love scenes she convinced me it just looked real i think br br i gave it a 7 out of 10 merely because of the dull last half hour
<START> uc 0079 the one year war is almost at an end a neutral colony of side 6 has been targeted by cyclops a zeon task force their target a new gundam being built exclusively for newtypes supposedly built for amuro ray from the original gundam saga inside when little boy al izuruha a fan of zeon ms encounters a zaku after battle breaks out in the colony he befriends newbie ms pilot benard bernie wiseman the two become good friends al is treated as an honorary member of the cyclops team through the show bernie acts as a father figure to al whose real father is always working and seems to be taken with federation pilot christina mckenzie but eventually they must meet in battle al soon learns that war is not child's play and bernie must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his mission br br for only 6 episodes gundam 0080 is a well done show the mobile suits are extremely well designed and the animation may look dated but really shows emotion in the characters if you liked 0083 then check this one out or if you are new to the gundam world this is a good show to start with if you look to a show for drama and character development this is the one for you it focuses more on that then mobile suit battle i would rate it more of a drama than action br br mobile suit gundam 0080 war in the pocket br br sometimes you have to lose to win
<START> i was required to watch the movie for my work so i didn't pay for it on the contrary i got paid but i still found the movie to suck far more than average the jokes were lame the two lead actresses well to use the first wives club division of women's ages in hollywood they are no longer in their hot chick age but more in their district attorney age what angered me most about the movie was the main plot line which pretty much completely plagiarized beavis butthead do america in which the boys are all jazzed up about some dude offering them money to do his wife not realizing they're expected to assassinate her all in all a bland piece of crap
<START> there may something poetically right in seeing dentists suffer suffer they do in this dreary truly dreadful film but they cause the audience to undergo pain of the non dental variety too if you ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids barfing kids sick kids lots of long long meaningful glances a deadpan wife and a concerned husband it's all here for you boring overlong it stands out as one of those examples that scream out why is there a saving grace yes there is there is a short scene from nabucco with some pretty good singing save your money or if it's on tv or cable save your time you can always read a book or make an omelette
<START> i managed to see this at the new york international film festival in november 2005 with my boyfriend we were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving it was very well directed with strong imagery the visual effects were amazing especially for a short it had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic this film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father there is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard this leans towards the gothic feel i would love to see this as a full feature film carrie
