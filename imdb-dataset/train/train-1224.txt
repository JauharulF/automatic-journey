<START> obviously made to show famous 1950s stripper misty ayers acting talents too bad she can't act br br boring little tale about sweet innocent sally down ayers being drugged and forced into white slavery prostitution then she meets likable tommy cole who instantly falls in love with her he wants to help her escape but can he you really won't care br br there's no real skin here ayers just strips down slowly to her underwear twice the rest is just a boring little tale chockful of bad acting atrocious comedy never thought prostitution was funny but what do i know and terrible post dubbed dialogue i admit there was a twist at the end i didn't see coming but that's not enough to sit through this also ayers' attempts at acting are hysterical a real bomb avoid
<START> i saw this film at the toronto international film festival not as salacious as it sounds this is a three part documentary each episode is 50 minutes featuring slovenian superstar philosopher psychoanalyst slavoj zizek zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films exploring themes of sexuality fantasy morality and mortality it was directed by sophie fiennes of the multi talented fiennes clan she's sister to actors ralph and joseph br br i enjoyed this quite a bit although i think it will be even more enjoyable on dvd since there is such a stew of ideas to be digested freudian and lacanian analysis can be pretty heavy going and seeing the whole series all at once became a bit disorienting by the end of two and a half hours it didn't help that an ill advised coffee and possession of a bladder led me to some discomfort for the last hour or so br br my only real issue with this is that zizek picked films that were quite obviously filled with freudian themes he spends quite a bit of time on the films of hitchcock and david lynch not exactly masters of subtlety i would have liked to see him try to support his theories by using a wider range of films although that's really just me saying i'd like to see part four and five and six br br zizek is very funny and part of the humour was watching him present what amounted to a lecture while inserting himself into the actual scenes from some of the films he's discussing so for instance we see him in a motorboat on his way to bodega bay from hitchcock's the birds or sitting in the basement of the bates motel from psycho which is not to say that his theories are not provocative even when i found myself disagreeing with him it definitely made me think a little more deeply about the films which is exactly what he's trying to accomplish
<START> now days most people don't watch classic movies such as this most of friends only watch movies from the '90s to present thats kinda stingy br br most old movies like this are masterpieces unique in their own way only because back when these movies were being thought of and made thats when ideas were fresh now people strain just to think of new ideas br br anyway to the movie for true fans of classic horror this is for you the movie is based with a investigator from scotland yard investigating the disappearance of an movie actor and stumbles on to three other strange occurrences with past residents of the same house br br i won't say anymore for i will ruin the movie more than i already have but it is a terrific movie for as old as it is and would never mind watching it again
<START> and yet another run of south park comes to an end this wasn't as strong an episode as i'd hoped for but night of the living homeless was a stronger finisher then stanley's cup tsst bloody mary or erection day it still can't hold a candle to woodland critter christmas and goobacks but few episodes can br br night of the living homeless is a spoof of the zombie genre done in a way only south park would think of instead of flesh eating zombies the entities are homeless that request change and seem to survive off of it br br randy and other residents are locked in the community center though this time on the roof where they can survey the scene a particularly funny moment is when one member finds out his home is gone and becomes homeless leaving randy no choice but to shoot him br br meanwhile the four boys set out to solve the problem with the whole story behind the homeless takeover trying to convey a message but being seriously uninspired south park is at it's best a lot of the times when it is being ridiculous matt and trey played it safe this week and didn't really critique the homeless problem just lampooned it br br the shock moment of the episode comes when a scientist shoots himself in an attempt to avoid the homeless this is the first time a suicide on south park goes wrong and we watch the poor man miss his brain and then attempt to shoot himself many times while he painfully dies another inspired south park moment br br overall the episode was funny but it was kept from being great by withholding any real commentary on the homeless and sticking straight with the zombie shtick the ending is somewhat funny but nothing new br br now we must wait until october for the next batch of episodes it's a long haul but south park must be applauded for it's run the show seemed to be running out of steam last season but now it's back in full form
<START> this movie has been poorly received and badly reviewed the book by rebecca west was written in 1918 soon after wwi when shell shock and trauma induced amnesia were not clichÃ©s as the reviewers call it many books and movies later it is difficult to go back in time and live as the characters lived the realities of the time the war and the horror of the experience of the first war to use lethal gas the british class system the wife thought all important the hopeless spinster and the lover from the past still seen with the eyes of love being as young and as beautiful as she was 20 years ago br br alan bates as the amnesiac soldier who will die if he isn't allowed to see margaret the girl of his youthful dreams builds on the devotion his character showed in far from the madding crowd having seen that performance it is possible to sense his strong romantic attachment to the girl who didn't live up to the family's and society's expectations margaret says we quarreled and as you rowed away you turned your face away from me so we know that the breakup was something that he instigated that it brought him shame but that he forgot the shame in his memory of his time with margaret i haven't seen all his films but in the ones i've seen he imparts a strong masculinity which shines through even in this role as the disabled soldier br br i didn't even recognize ann margaret at first and feel that her performance has been underrated not having read the book i wondered whether the child who died was the result of acting on a borderline incestuous feeling between jenny and chris though jenny does state that she is a cousin the way kitty keeps jenny in the nursery in the hair drying scene the fact that kitty says she always dries her hair in that room seems more a way for kitty to keep the coals of anger hot than the orientation of the room to the sun or sentiment about a lost child and the statement she made that she wished chris hadn't felt it necessary to preserve the room exactly as it was when the child was alive made her seem uncaring toward the memory of the child also jenny is shown as living in the house in a subservient role as high society would have done to a fallen member at the time br br having recently been the recipient of the intense fantasy of a lover non sexualin keeping with the mores of the time from 50 years ago i couldrelate to margaret's and her husband's dilemma i too was cast aside because i wasn't good enough for his family and upon his rediscovery of me via the internet i was burdened with helping him deal with his still very horrifying vietnam experiences and a marriage to a woman above his class whom he didn't believe he loved my husband like margaret's was very understanding but the strain was very real the lover was finally able to reconcile his real life situation with his fantasy of loving only me br br i thought that it was a good decision to show very little of the reliving of the war experience that was happening in chris's mind i thought of mrs dalloway with the wwi soldier who acts out very violent memories and commits suicide versus chris's joy in his fantasy of margaret in contrast the actiona of the soldier in mrs dalloway seems overwrought br br showing that the psychiatrist understood very little of what was happening to chris underlines what a major problem the whole group faced everyone seems to get their life back but was it the right choice
<START> generally i like horror movies but unfortunately this fell out of the one pound bargain bin into my friends hand we sat down to watch it ready to be scared and ended up spraying food everywhere we were laughing so much the concept isn't that bad but why they decided number ten in the series would be lucky i don't know the worst thing about the movie is the actors the camera work was poor the special effects are actually not bad if i am being generous but overall the story failed to connect on any levels because the actors were as effective as a small lump of badly charred elm they were wooden beyond measure especially a foppish young actor who was fifteen years too young to be taken seriously as any kind of government agent he looked more like a public school boy in fact there was a really amusing sex scene where he looked like he was bobbing for apples as a busty lady rode on top of him and later his nappy sized underpants were hysterical but then i remembered it wasn't supposed to be a comedy i'm desperately wracking my brain to find something positive to say about this movie apart from the occasional flash of breasts but there simply isn't let's hope ten was the lucky number and they don't do another one i'm not sure my ribs could take it
<START> hello playmates i recently watched this film for the first time ever and it is also my first experience of arthur askey i have to admit i was very impressed by this film as a fan of black and white films generally passport to pimlico the lavender hill mob and tommy trinder who is apparently a distant relative this film appealed in that it provided good old fashioned british humour i notice that there are some on here who have criticised askey's performance however in my opinion it stands the test of time as a fine example of forties comic acting and if anything adds to the picture by creating characters that are more than the mere stereotypes which seem to so dominate films now if you can get hold of this film i would recommend you get hold of it shame these films generally aren't shown on sunday afternoons anymore i am also glad to have had the opportunity to watch another piece of work by arnold ridley private godfrey in dad's army i thank you
<START> an awful film it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe they've taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition my complaint is not that they've taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine but it's simply bizarre by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwater dull script i suppose there weren't enough naked people in the factual version it's hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist's life we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they'd favored the rest of the film with same brevity
<START> this little appreciated movie is one of my favorites i can watch it over and over dreyfus and braga are masterful but raul julia steals the show a tongue in cheek menacingly humorous gomez addams with just the right tone for this irreverent spoof of this oft told story br br generally untrumpeted and unappreciated moon over parador allows you to check out of reality and join the fun going on up on the screen two thumbs up
<START> crude some times crass to me that's the summation of madhur bhandarkar's latest work page 3 he has no point of view just shallow funny digs at stereotypes what is the movie about is it about reporting a clan of people so called page 3 types who are so busy socializing and progressing their profiles in life that they have no time for anything else and you are either in it or out of it is it that there is no press at all to report everyday incidents madhur bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and page 3 is just a supplement perhaps an entertainer for checking out who's who and what's what don't mix the two and then there is power play that would happen in every walk of life so what have you told at the end of it all nothing just a few crude jokes strung together in an otherwise direction less movie
<START> and that's how the greatest comedy of tv started it has been 12 years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same spirit till the very last season because that's where friends is based on quotes extraordinary situations are taking place among six friends who will never leave from our hearts let's say a big thanks to rachel ross monica joey chandler and phoebe in our first meet we see how rachel dumps a guy in the church how understand monica's search for the perfect guy there is no perfect guy why all you women are obsessed with that and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she's a lesbian till we meet joey phoebe and chandler in the next episodes enjoy friends
<START> surprisingly not terrible and well animated for one of disney's straight to video throw away sequels like the previous sequel the lion king 2 i was glad that disney brought back most of the original voice actors which makes a big difference and they kept a good level of traditional animation the plot wanders around for a while but we are distracted by an unending string of jokes ranging from hilarious to dull to break up the detached plot and jokes they gave us some silly musical sequences which much like the jokes range from entertaining to a quick trip to the fridge for the most part the mst3k like moments are bland and full of untapped potential and really don't add a whole lot to the movie other than to act as a vehicle for an hour long flashback the new characters are at least likable and the old characters are out doing their thing so i can't fault them there overall this movie in not bad and it makes for a nice frivolous filler between the more serious lion king titles
<START> the biggest national lampoon hit remains animal house and rightly so it was funny raucous and good natured br br the exact opposite of every other national lampoon film including class reunion br br please do not be fooled by the inclusion of stephen furst flounder from animal house or by the fact that john hughes wrote this jumbled mess this reunion is about as hilarious as root canal and twice as painful br br one star and that's being generous then again i always thought most of my old classmates were demons vampires and serial killers too
<START> br br one would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role to be a funny movie this is not the case here i laughed out loud once throughout the whole movie and that wasn't even during the final comedy scene which one would also expect to be the funniest this is one you can watch when it comes to tv don't spend any other money renting it
<START> pleasant diverting and charming the best part is the swing numbers especially the rendition of my buddy partial though it may have been the acting was a bit over the top in areas but the mood set by wilder is so pleasant it is hard not to enjoy this film
<START> this movie is supposed to be taking place in and around seattle the why is porteau cove p r o v i n c i a l park shown provincial parks are in canada and not the united states the inspector uses a palm pilot complete with stylus to 'read' that someone has hacked into the computer of the bridal shop i did not know that this was possible using a database storage device a woman appears in the movie without any introduction and is never introduced we learn half way into the movie that this woman works in the district attorney's office then in the correctional center a guard actually precedes jenks through a door and keeps his back to the offender this would never happen in a real correctional setting the director really messed on this one this doesn't happen in real life the acting is adequate the plot is good the cinematography is good however the many errors found in the continuity lead to a 3 out of 10 vote
<START> studio 666 aka the possessed in the uk is another sub par slasher that has the appearance of a straight to dvd movie br br whilst many of the straight to dvd movies are fast paced or unintentionally hilarious in the so bad it's good sense studio 666 is a lamentable failure br br at the time of writing every comment on the first page includes a negative rating and a negative review every one of these people have hit the nail on the head br br the two people at the time of writing who wrote comments with a rating of 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously obviously they've seen few slasher movies and have an even more limited understanding of horror br br the only really positive point i can make about this movie is that it does fare better than the choke and one of them two extremely mediocre slasher movies that i would not wish on my worst enemy br br the plot of this movie must have been done hundreds if not thousands of times the movie only has a slight twist and one that is badly handled to the usual expectations a depressed singer commits suicide soon after her spirit returns to possess one of her surviving friends the said possessed friend goes on a killing spree the rest of the plot really is too bizarre to sum up you'll just have to see it for yourself providing your interest has not yet waned to the point of extinction of course br br the acting in the movie is very poor for the most part the actress who played dora was an exception to this her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on the screen she helps to elevate the movie above similar contemporary efforts unfortunately some of the lines she was given to say were badly written to put it mildly and thus prevent her from saving the movie br br the direction was equally poor the villains did not seem the least bit menacing every killing was totally devoid of suspense or tension atmosphere was non existent and the camera work was incredibly basic some of the special effects if you can call them that reminded me of the tv series ghost stories unfortunately for the producers of this movie ghost stories had intelligently written scripts believable performances and made superb use of camera angles maybe if the producers had watched that tv series closely they'd have picked up some more techniques that might have saved this excuse for a movie br br the music is completely unsuited to the tone of the movie it's just rock music and not the best examples of this type either don't get me started on that awful song played at the beginning br br some aspects of the movie particularly dialogue are unintentionally funny unfortunately they are not funny enough to move the movie up or should it be down to the so bad it's good level br br overall studio 666 is a mundane mediocre slasher with very little noteworthy aspects i recommend this only to those who are fans of straight to dvd movies and have a desire to see every single slasher ever made
<START> i am a great fan of martin amis on whose book this film is based unfortunately the director has been unable to translate the book to the screen the novel is thoroughly post modern and highly artificial in its wildly overblown characters and the disintegration of traditional plot line and character development it is an hilarious examination of human greed excess and emptiness by one of the most moral of contemporary british writers the director of the film has completely missed the point of the novel in his hands the film screams along at breakneck speed indulging in every known trick shot and 'odd' camera angle possible it is like ken russel on acid and suffers from that older director's self indulgence cranked up to a hundred not even the brief glimpse of gorgeous actor christian solimeno's penis was enough to save this wretched film for me abysmal
<START> this movie is really goofy i saw it as an 11 year old and even then i thought it was pretty ridiculous i would only recommend this film to kids under the age of 12 i really didn't care for it but i do think that it answers some very good questions that kids need to be aware of such as 1 does money buy happiness 2 should i lie to my parents about things i think they wouldn't approve of 3 does money buy friendships 4 is money everything 5 shouldn't i tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me granted these are very unrealistic situations but i do think that if parents discussed these issues with their children maybe they should watch this video as well in order to show scare their kids that lies have the potential to get you hurt
<START> me and my girlfriend annette watched this together and we'll both comment br br both of us really enjoyed watching this even though it took some liberties with dicken's work a lot of dicken's works are somewhat dark and dreary including oliver twist but this movie changed all that it was fun colourful both visually and musically and the characters were more lighthearted br br travis normally i don't care a lot for musical and dance movies but the tunes in this production were catchy and lively and the choreography was awesome br br annette that's really saying a lot coming from travis i can't emphasise enough how really good the dance numbers were you can tell for example that those boys really worked hard getting the routines down to perfection br br travis three actors really stood out imo nancy shani w bill sykes oliver reed and artful dodger jack wild man that oliver reed can really do a good villain that one scene where you see his eyes thru the mail slot gave me chills down the back awesome and that kid jack wild was a perfect artful dodger and nancy was fantastic man i felt bad when she got killed she can sing too kudos to the casting department on their choices there i hated the oliver twist kid tho he was just too whiny and wimpy for my taste i kept wishing bill sikes would drop him off into the mud during the chase scene and they shouldn't have had him sing either br br annette acting was truly superb in addition to the three stars travis mentioned i felt ron moody fagin did a tremendous job he was so funny and at the same time lightly sinister too the supporting actors were great too harry secombe carried his mr bumble role extremely well and he has a wonderful singing voice i saw mr secombe perform in another movie entitled davy where he played an opera singer with pleasing results the talented harry secombe should have been in a lot more movies br br travis as i mentioned earlier the story isn't quite true to the book but imo it was more robust this movie was not boring either as some musicals seem to be and the continuity kept you moving right along with the characters the tunes did not detract from the plot or put you to sleep by being too long br br annette any musical movie which travis watches completely has to be a rare find and this one is indeed a rare find it is a very easy to watch production which carries the viewer smoothly and enjoyably through to the end in a day when movies all seem to be effects combined with pretty faces this was a refreshing interlude br br our combined rating for this was 8 5 of 10 we'll round up to 9 in this case br br travis i rated this a 7 mainly because the oliver twist kid mark l irritated me and his songs were torture to my overly sensitive ears otherwise it was an outstanding movie br br annette my rating is a 10 movies don't get much better than this and you can tell everyone involved in this production really worked hard to make it what it was a masterpiece br br please don't miss this one even if you normally don't like musicals it really is a rare treat
