<START> i would highly recommend this movie and i certainly shall be personally recommending it to my friends and family here and abroad it was with excited anticipation that i have just pre ordered it online i enjoyed it so much it is not out until february march 2008 but it will be well worth the wait but first go and see it in the cinema if you can there is nothing quite like the cinema experience of a cinema made movie insist that your local cinema puts it on i went to see 'seachd the inaccessible pinacle' tonight down here in london and was really impressed it is a marvel a truly beautiful film set in the scottish highlands you will laugh you will cry you will be moved in may different ways you will be intrigued and as the story within the stories is revealed you will be amazed at that revelation br br this movie is in scottish gaelic with english subtitles but do not let that detract you if you are not a speaker of the gaelic i am just starting and my son does not nor did many people there tonight and it did not spoil it for us by any manner of means superlatives do not suffice the photography is superb there is no cgi here and the movie is all the better for that here you have true photography the script is so skilfully and subtly written the many layered plot weaves the magic art of the ancient storytellers the music is at times rousing at times haunting but always adding to the atmospheric ambiance and the acting it is to behold and the actors they the true weavers of this delightful yet profound film particularly the two main actors 'padruig the young' and 'padruig the elder' a true bard if ever there was who both carried a very heavy load and the direction well watch out richard and the producer responsible for raising funding hiring key personnel and arranging for distributors a task well done i hope that you will make sure that distribution goes out to our communities abroad and the gaelic community uill without you it could not have happened we were told that this movie was made on a low budget but you would not know it and i think it might well be because for what they might have lacked in money they more than made up for with the richness of the heart and the warmth and co operation of the local scottish gaelic community br br a heartfelt thanks to all concerned in the making and the sponsoring of 'seachd' mÃ²ran taing many thanks from the gaels to the world from the world to the gaels
<START> well i can honestly say that this is the first time that i experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it the entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course the story line was fallible and laughable the characters were one dimensional the realism was out the window and the animation was done by four year olds does that cover it i have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life i have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character but from the looks of the other reviews i am not off base with my observation br br to begin the story moved too quickly for someone new to this character and situations i needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution i have seen other anime if you could call this one an anime that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them there was nothing set aside for lady death in a few short scenes we see her train with cremator and instantly become this aggressive she beast of hell this was hard for me to swallow considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father suddenly she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years this was absurd the presentation of lady death was poor to say the least i felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind for me it just didn't work she was nothing more than eye candy for prepubescent boys wanting to ogle the mass quantities of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with cremator oh i felt sick just watching her the same goes for the character of cremator who was this random person the explanation they gave wasn't enough and instead i was left with more incoherent babbling than actual development it is a very sad day in hell when we forgo characters to show more violence and action especially in an animated feature br br next there was lucifer himself let me just say that i think i could do battle with the king of hell and survive he was weak his voice was laughable and he just didn't represent the image that i had in my mind it was as if disney was in control and wanted to make him semi pc he lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that lucifer embodies he was not the ruler of hell but instead just a lackey that had a bigger place to live speaking of living or dying how can you die again in hell that was a concept that definitely needed more explanation most of the characters were worrying about dying when they didn't even consider the option that they were already dead that is how they got to hell i think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me i didn't quite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in hell but that could just be me Â or maybe it was because there was no development in this story there was nothing built just preparing br br the battle sequences were hysterically bad the animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early 90s there was nothing impressive about the way that this film was drawn why are we america so behind on animation it is huge in asia and it is creeping in hardcore here because we keep making films like lady death that do not challenge or use any part of imagination we are cheap and this film shows it br br overall this film was bad the animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap i had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time which is hard to understand because i think i could have made this film on my credit card the production was horrendous as well as the story nothing was developed leaving huge gaping plot holes that nearly everyone fell into the strength of the characters was missing and nothing was explained i wasted my time with this one and would like to warn others so that when death does come you don't find yourself in my state and regretting the fact that you wasted 80 minutes on this piece of garbage br br blah br br grade out of
<START> trick or treat is a fine example of hollywood jumping on the backwards messages in metal music bandwagon that tipper gore and her washington wives kick started in the mid '80s other less successful entries in this mini genre include the awful black roses and silly the gate i was a sophomore in high school when trick or treat came out and couldn't wait to see it it seemed to disappear from video stores by the end of the '80s but i finally picked up a budget priced dvd copy a short while ago and it brought back many pleasant metal memories from back in the day any teenage metal nerd could relate to the trials of eddie ragman weinbauer marc price of family ties in this film as he is persecuted by the preppie beautiful people in his high school for his heavy metal fashions and musical taste eddie's favorite rock star is sammi curr who looks a lot like tommy lee of motley crue who is killed in a hotel fire early in the movie eddie is inconsolable till he receives a test pressing of sammi's final unreleased album from a radio dj gene simmons of kiss in a brief cameo eddie soon discovers that this lp when played backwards allows him to communicate with the undead spirit of sammi curr himself soon sammi is giving eddie advice on how to get even with his preppie torturers but when the messages escalate in scariness waste'em all no false metal eddie tries to destroy the album which results in sammi coming back to life via eddie's stereo speakers sammi rampages to the big dance at eddie's high school and takes the stage to rock the crowd and disintegrate a few unlucky false metallers before eddie arrives to save the day and the girl of his dreams sigh no it's not terribly scary in 2006 it wasn't even scary in 1986 but trick or treat is a movie that will bring a smile to the face of any 1980s metaller and has a kick ass soundtrack courtesy of the cult band fastway well worth seeking out if you've ever banged your head or have a taste for b grade horror movies or both like me
<START> the very first image of the movie shows a mountain ridge in early morning autumn mist and my thought was this is almost too beautiful and it goes on like this images of landscape and animals that look like a series of romantic paintings each of them perfect in every detail even the girl's room her father's car everything is nostalgic romantic beautiful this could seem outdated and escapistic but it fits a story that is itself of silent beauty happening on the border between life and fairy tale between dian fossey and le petit prince i enjoyed every minute of it the extreme parsimony of the movie having a simple slow story just one actor and hardly any special effects exerted a strong magic i therefore find it deplorable that this parsimony is given up in the last minutes when suddenly two additional actors the girl as a grown up woman and her son are introduced another shortcoming is the music which is often intrusive hollywood like and sometimes inappropriate i couldn't bring an english pop song together with french mountain glory i went to the movie together with my two small daughters but i recommend it to adults as well given that they appreciate this kind of movie obviously not everybody does
<START> this movie will kick your ass powerful acting in a story that pushes all of us to live out our dreams jake gyllenhaal will go places from here and the supporting cast was superb why would would anyone want to stay in coalville and develop black lung anyway
<START> i watched this on a whim because it was available and i'd heard the thumb movies were funny this one was not the majority of the jokes were based around geranium's physique and in turn kate winslet's i think it's really pathetic of the the thumbtanic creators to stoop so low to make jabs at a respected actress just because she heaven forbid doesn't starve herself into the model of ideal modern beauty br br my favorite part was the line that goes something like hey i have a great idea let's swim over to this makeshift raft that no one else seems to see thirty seconds of amusement out of a 26 minute movie does not redeem its value
<START> very funny film classic film funny eddie murphy of the 80s i saw when i was a child and i have a good memory the classic irony of murphy does not fail the film is funny well done murphy in the'80s made many films of action that represented for him a way to joke about everything that is dangerous the result can only be appreciated by some but ii film from 1986 up to now have changed the atmosphere for a movie of that time is good and the special effects are good for a film of the period a nice movie to see and enjoy appreciating the taste of ironic murphy an actor who has recently disappeared the final part is anthologies the likable actor who plays the part of the tibetan monk that's it
<START> busy phillips put in one hell of a performance both comedic and dramatic erika christensen was good but busy stole the show it was a nice touch after the smokers a movie starring busy which wasnt all that great if busy doesnt get a nomination of any kind for this film it would be a disaster forget mona lisa smile see home room
<START> nick millard aka nick phillips should have left well enough alone when he made criminally insane 10 years before the release of this god awful waste of time and effort the fact that the original criminally insane was less than an hour in length should have clued him into the fact that he had probably milked this storyline for all he was going to get out of it but instead he opts to use tons of footage from the original in this one as well even to the point of recycling the original opening credit sequence unfortunately bringing back the rapidly aging priscilla alden did not save this one what little bit of original footage there was in this flick looks as if it were filmed with a rented hand held camcorder if this film cost more than 100 to make i would be very surprised and i would be equally surprised if it made anything close to that amount avoid this one and watch the original instead
<START> i do miss the company vestron they sure had their finger on the pulse of unique and unusual cinema back in the 1980s this is very apparent with the astonishing paperhouse a film that touches me deeply each and every time i watch it br br the idea of a girl manipulating a dream world with her drawings thusly the dream world manipulating reality and also connecting with and affecting the life of a boy she's never actually met is fascinating and never disappoints charlotte burke at first seems quite precocious and yet you warm up to her because by being a bit of a mischievous child it makes it hard for the adults to believe what she is experiencing she becomes very self aware and strong towards the end even finding she doesn't hate boys as she so defiantly claimed at first through this we are treated to many touching moments and some immensely scary ones all visually stunning with a grand score from hans zimmer i'm quite proud to be an owner of the soundtrack on cd when it was released in the united states on rca victor at the time of this writing there is no dvd of paperhouse yet available in the u s only in europe here's hoping one of my wishes will come true as i truly cherish this beautiful film and a dvd of it would be very welcome br br it's satisfying watching the girl work out her thoughts like a puzzle game trying to make the dream world work for her and her newfound friend marc elliot spiers both charlotte burke and elliot spiers do a magnificent job throughout i find the editorial comment on amazon com about it being hammy acting quite perplexing i found every aspect of paperhouse to be exhilarating even in minor scenes of brilliance like when charlotte and the girl in the classroom are staring at each other through the glass on a door it's quite powerful br br you don't have to be an arthouse type to enjoy paperhouse just be a person that enjoys a film that stimulates and has you wanting more there is enough in this film to invite repeated viewings and i'm still in awe of the cinematography and sets for me it's never like watching the same film twice as there are so many details to absorb and savor a very emotional experience indeed br br while there are many films i adore there are only a few specific ones that strike a great emotional chord in me films like paperhouse static resurrection and donnie darko when i see so much drek out there passing as films that will easily be forgotten and in bargain bins all i have to do is watch paperhouse and my faith in wondrous storytelling is renewed
<START> i personally found this movie to be terrible first it was hardly objective and provided one side of the debate the only people who were presented as the side saying he did exist being a bunch of people coming from a billy grahm revival secondly it deviated heavily from its supposed topic did jesus yeshua exist to talking about how violent christianity is and showing scenes from mel gibsons the passion in the end it has the director con his former principal of a conservative private school into being interviewed and attempts to trap him about teaching the kids there faith oh and also the techno music just made the film harder to watch
<START> i didn't think the french could make a bad movie but i was clearly very wrong as has been said before this film essentially uses its title character as a point of departure its portrayal of her life and person have little or nothing to do with the real artemisia gentileschi br br the script is awful pretentious stilted and vapid and its rewriting of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that all too often makes its living by distorting rather than retelling history along with some fairly decent set design valentina cervi's physical charms are the primary asset of this movie and it's obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too they waste no time in contriving various erotic sequences which have far more to do with titillation than with plot or character development unfortunately the appeal of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal cannot and does not sustain this movie the acting is unremarkable and the score is all too generic despite an interesting chord or two the cinematography is ok and there are some pretty colors but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distorted lens effects more appropriate for a 1960s freakout movie than a costume drama in any event the script leaves the camera dwelling all too often on artemisia's body and all too seldom on her paintings br br all told a near complete failure it's not intelligent or tasteful enough to be a serious film and it's too slow and pretentious to work as soft core pornography so the french can fail after all
<START> i had no problem with the film which i thought was pretty good it's the actual lapd crime scene video that disturbed me i wonder if lion's gate really thought that the general viewing audience would want to see people that were brutally beaten to death and blood all over the place sorry lion's gate this was an incredibly bad idea br br getting back to the film the cast was excellent especially val kilmer as the late john holmes john holmes was a sleaze mistreats the women in his life lisa kudrow as his wife kate bosworth as his girlfriend and he is hopelessly deep into drugs his connection to eddie nash eric bogosian creates a spiral that resulted in the infamous wonderland murders exactly how much was holmes involved in the murders we may never know the entire truth to the story nash is still alive and a free man but the film does a pretty good job nonetheless
<START> the 1960's were a time of change and awakening for most people social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spoke out about their views racial tensions politics the vietnam war sexual promiscuity and drug use were all part of the daily fabric and the daily news this film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie and largely succeeded br br in this film two families are followed one white one black during the first half of the film the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles unfortunately the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family admittedly there are more characters in this family and the story lines are intermingled but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century br br on the whole the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie the movie is a work of fiction but clips of well known historical figures are used to set the time line br br i enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one sided
<START> well let me start off by saying how utterly hilarious this film is i simply couldn't keep myself from laughing at the sheer stupidity of it don't get me wrong it is well acted particularly by bassinger but the script is just well the mind boggles truly br br the premise is good and up until della actually witnesses the murder it is engaging but after that it just goes downhill half way through the film the protagonist pulls out her toolbox and of course instead of lobbing it at the guy's head she decides to pull out a screwdriver car jack and finally a flare as in for a sinking ship respectively to kill her victims br br then there is the final line that i promise if it doesn't have you in stitches then i will eat my own left foot br br i would recommend this film to those who simply want to laugh at some good old fashioned appalling film making might i also suggest you watch out for the scene in the scrap yard with the guy falling from the one foot high plank of wood gets me every time
<START> the film looks like as if the director was forced to make this movie by some gang of terrorists it should actually be called dino crap br br there is nothing good about this movie even the actors are not worth a penny don't waste your time watching this movie the director should be shot in the head for having the mentality to create such a bad movie i mean isn't he ashamed of looking at peoples faces after they have seen his movie the dinocroc looks as if it was made in power point and pretty much cut and paste stuff and its the same old story man plays god creates some creature it escapes and is happy eating people and finally a pretty girl and a guy in a sleeveless shirt has to come and kill it bla bla u will figure out the plot in the first 5 minutes of the movie
<START> wow what a wonderful film the script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by minglun wei i hope he has more stories in him br br the acting is sublime renying zhou as doggie was amazing very natural talent and xu zhu was a delight very believable as the jaded old traditionalist br br the soundtrack was very effective guiding without being overwhelming br br if only more movies like this were made whether in hollywood or hong kong a family friendly well acted well written well directed near perfect gem
<START> i still liked it though warren beatty is only fair as the comic book hero what saves this movie is the set the incredible cast and it offshoots a mediocre script i really expected something more substantial in the terms of action or plot but i got very little the main reason to watch this movie is to watch some of the biggest stars in hollywood at the time in such an unusual film br br the one person who did a terrible job and did not even belong in this film was madonna she did not belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad the movie at some points just stood still you expected something more and you got nothing al pacino plays a really bad dude and he does pretty good he and beatty do make an excellent good guy and bad guy br br it is also interesting to see dustin hoffman and warren beatty in a film other than isthar i did not see ishtar but i heard bad things the thing about this movie is it is good but it could have been so much better i liked it as a child because i thought it looked cool and visually the movie is amazing the sets are incredible the writing is only fair and with such a cast in the movie i would expect a little better anyway br br spoiler br br i especially thought the finale was not big enough it was interesting but for such a grand scale film i just thought it could have ended with a little more of a bang the reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere the movie only uses the 7 comic book colors making it all that more excellent visually anyway br br the costumes and makeup were flawless as well the facial makeup for the villains was great beatty is just not up to such a bigger than life character still this is a good movie that could have been much much more it is to me better than batman the other comic book adaptation that came out close to the same time of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross
<START> when will the hurting stop i never want to see another version of a christmas carol again they keep on making movies with the same story falling over each other in trying to make the movie better then the rest but sadly fail to do so as this is not a good story moralistic old fashioned conservative happy thinking as if people learn the numerous different versions of this film prove that we donÂ´t
<START> the story of cinderella is one of my favorites from charles perrault with sleeping beauty which was also made into a disney film in 1959 this film is a sweet enchanting masterpiece from disney br br the film has a great soundtrack that's one i like in a movie is a very good soundtrack and i love the songs too my favorite song is the romantic so this is love i love the mice from the film too they are cute my favorite scene is the scene after the narration the little birds tried to wake cinderella up in the morning i also love it when cinderella's animal friends the mice and birds fix up cinderella's birth mother's dress so she could go to the ball until drizella anastasia tore it to bits the b es
