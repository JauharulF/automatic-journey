<START> i'm sitting here nov 2006 and i still can't help rave about this movie arnold's best movies came in about a 4 5 year span running man predator and total recall 1990 all 3 are amazing the cheesy one liners by arnold in this movie will make you laugh on more than one occasion i find the acting in this movie surprisingly good as was the case in predator and totall recall they did a great job in trying to make the scenes futuristic as it is supposed to take place in 2017 but you can't help but snicker at the 80's style haircuts on the men and woman in the crowd and the normal television monitors in the running man studio which we all know here in 2006 are on the way out with the emergence of flat panel and hdtv's also the computer graphics of the the running man game show intro would not look like that in 2017 nevertheless the storyline is absolutely fantastic not once during this movie did i want to get up and not care about the ending which is something i do often with today's movie's i really think that arnold's acting is much better than he's given credit for now i would not have elected him governor but that's california for you buzzsaw dynamo fireball subzero are fantastic stalkers as well and i find the producers don't try to overkill the fight scenes when the stalker is dead he's dead it doesn't go on for 20 minutes each the stalker scenes are quick and entertaining but they don't try and overplay it i give this movie a 10 10 and that's coming from someone who doesn't enjoy a lot of movies these days if you get the right actors and the right story then the futuristic graphical displays that you'd see in 2006 are not important or necessary
<START> personally i would advise people to stay clear of this movie it's on the whole a bore to watch and the fighting is poorly choreographed slow and not very convincing if you buy the hong kong legends dvd release of this movie then the only thing worth listening to is the bey logan audio commentary br br but in any case since when has there ever been a ninja film worth watching i cannot think of one and frankly do not wish to br br overall when it comes to movies i have one golden rule avoid any films that contains the word 'ninja'
<START> when the film started the first 4 minutes seemed like a travelogue of california i was wondering if i got the tapes mixed up then i breathed a sigh of relief to see paul thomas in a scene with the lovely joanna storm and laurie smith this is being spied on by jimmy a young tom byron jimmy's aunt honey wilder is concerned about his behavior so she hires him a private teacher kay parker i could do without the animal robot role playing or the incest aspects there's one good sex scene between byron and parker but it's not good enough to save this film br br my grade d
<START> there isn't a whole lot going on in this story just two men employing very different ways of handling memories of vietnam but what it lacks in premise it more than makes up for in acting and realism it's a quiet film about the bonds of friendship and shared experience we even get romance not gratuitous just another very real piece of this story it's well worth seeing
<START> when i was chairman of our college's coffeehouse one of our jobs was to review groups and films for student activities one of the best things to come along in 1972 was groove tube the original premise was that it was being shown off off broadway in theaters where television monitors were being placed throughout the audience so everyone had a great seat the premise was that the skits would change on a regular basis ala saturday night live keeping the thing fresh they decided on making it into a film for general distribution br br i believe the developers said it was the first time chevy chase was on film watching him run naked though the woods was a howl like many of the reviews before mine it was saturday night live before such a thing existed i highly recommend this vid i've told my 13 year old son about koko the clown he can't wait to get a copy
<START> i have only managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago being made almost 30 years ago i thought the scary moments would be rather tame boy was i wrong there are some great moments that sent shivers down my spine even the acting was great jamie lee curtis was fantastic and donald pleasance was superb br br on the downside it can be rather slow to start but once it gets going there is no stopping it it makes all the copycats e g nightmare on elm street scream look very tame i can't really say it is carpenter's best because i have not seen many of his the only one i can remember of his is starman i think he made it halloween is the crowning achievement of the horror genre
<START> as a 90 minute experience it is not up to the standard of drive' as the actors clearly learnt their trade at the who am i ' academy while the action sequences are generally no better than those in the superb mark dacascos beat 'em up however those who enjoyed drive' and i thought it was wonderful will undoubtedly enjoy this too you certainly won't rewind back to the start and watch it all again but you will definitely flick back to some of the action scenes for a long time to come br br it is refreshing to see that the art of quality fight choreography is still being practiced even if not in hong kong and i would love to see what these guys could do with the budgets time and respect afforded to the likes of yuen woo ping and corey yuen kuei if you sit through the first half hour and aren't sent crazy by the atrocious dialogue then you are in for a treat bosch is magnificent and can really bust a move with some magnificent acrobatics kicks and simple acts of bravery br br if you are fortunate enough to be within 500 miles of a copy then track it down and watch it it's not shakespeare in fact it's less articulate than coolio in china strike force' but you will be impressed with both the moves on display and the pain felt by the stunt team i'm pretty sure there's no safe way to land directly on your head or be forced to head butt a wooden roof by a speeding car br br
<START> i have to be completely honest in saying first that i fell asleep somewhere in the middle so i cannot give a full opinion about the film until i see it in full basically a group of thieves including sid carter sid james and ernie bragg bernard bresslaw plan to make a fortune stealing a shipment of contraceptive pills from finisham maternity hospital this is where title character matron hattie jacques works along with staff members sir bernard cutting kenneth williams dr francis goode charles hawtrey dr prodd terry scott and nurse susan ball barbara windsor patients and their visitors are around too including pregnant mrs tidey joan sims and her nervous dad to be husband mr tidey kenneth connor also starring bill maynard as freddy and eastenders' wendy richard as miss willing this plan by the way is not working out by the way because all the staff are getting in the way that's pretty much all can say about the film until i see it again in full okay
<START> i was honestly surprised by alone in the dark it was so bad i could hardly believe what i was seeing there are no characters just a few stereotypes wandering around and getting killed the extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an occupation and that's about it there was no real plot and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation in fact many action scenes just began on their own coming from nowhere with a pounding techno track while i was watching this movie i kept asking where is this happening what's going on the acting was high school drama quality with stiff wooden delivery as though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design adr sounded like it was recorded in an open room the actors were constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks looking almost robotic in their movements so these listless automatons are whisked through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios often without even the benefit of transition scenes they were here now they're there this was happening now that's happening random scenes with little rhyme or reason i had a lot of fun watching it definitely not worth nine bucks though
<START> this is definitely the worst movie adam's ever done but at this point in his life he was just happy to have a movie there are 3 or 4 laughs in it but i used the fast forward button through some of it don't waste your time i only saw it because i wanted to see all of his movies but it sucked
<START> this sorry excuse for a film reminded me a great deal of what i heard about gigli that ben and jen flop earlier this summer the order was clearly edited to such an unconscionable degree that the scenes rather than forming a cohesive and provoking film appeared to be a collection of disconnected sequences that did little to forward any semblance of a unified plot now i'm a heath ledger fan 10 things i hate about you a knight's tale and particularly his supporting role in monster's ball but my man needs to find himself a better agent keep accepting scripts like the order and four feathers and he's going to be on the fast track to movie oblivion br br here are the problems i had with the film firstly the director tried to make up for the inadequacies of his essential plot by introducing two other plot lines that seemingly had little if anything to do with well much of anything plot skeins involving the american trying to take over the vatican and the dark pope while mildly interesting did nothing to reveal to the viewer anything about the main characters the attempts to tie these threads together were pathetic at best secondly please don't insult the intelligence of the viewer by inserting into the film scenes that are clearly obligatory we had manufactured angst manufactured love and most idiotically manufactured sex that seemed like a page right out of matrix reloaded with skull numbing techno music rather than developing character these elements seemed like the cheap devices they clearly were a half hearted attempt at putting popcorn chewing adolescents in the seats thirdly and most importantly this movie seemed to ha ve an intriguing concept we have scandal we have religion and we have supernatural forces at play why then do we learn almost nothing about anyone's background we learn a little about alex but even he gives up the passion of the priesthood to sleep with a woman after two days a woman who tried to kill him during an exorcism at some point in the past and alex is the most developed if you can call it that character in the entire film br br as the cliche goes nowadays if you're going to see one movie this year make sure it's not this one there's about ten interesting minutes out of the intolerable 101 minute affair the only thing that saved me was going with a girl who i'm rather fond of br br 1 out of 10 i'm disappointed file this one firmly under had potential but blew it on over editing and bad directing heath my man go back to monster's ball like cameos they really suit you
<START> an unconventional historical drama with some fine battle scenes tobey maguire gives an excellent performance and gets some pretty good back up the script is literate and pretty original and the film is kept mercifully free of heroes that said it does drag a bit and the last reel is too much like a tv mini series still frederick elmes's camerawork keeps one interested in the dull bits and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he worked for david lynch worth seeing
<START> first off there's absolutely no flirting going on in this film with anthony or anyone else these people don't flirt they just do it your first test of endurance is to wade through more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion this wouldn't be so bad hell i like violence and perversion as much as the next reviewer but without a context to put it in it is repellent so you make it through the torture and mayhem then we meet donna and the movie turns into something all together different not better just different a road picture without heart there are lame attempts at comedy thanks to cameos broadly written and broadly played by broads like judy tenuta and mink stole and a few hookers and drag queens too they all deserve better the photography is purposely disorienting so if you get motion sickness or really any kind of sickness this flick is not for you come to think of it i'm not sure just who this flick is for except maybe gay and bi sexual s m fans who like poorly scripted poorly shot indy films about themselves
<START> the sitcom revolved around a girl who must learn to be responsible for her own actions as she had the power of magic she often used it to try to help her loved ones or herself frequently resulting in literal puns that are often disastrous and always humorous br br the program began with sabrina's adventures in high school in the fictional town of westbridge located near boston massachusetts as opposed to greendale in the comics in the series' later seasons sabrina graduated from high school and enrolled in college then moved on to her attempts to live on her own and keep a job at the local newspaper breaking further from its comic roots the show ended with sabrina's wedding although in the end she abandoned the wedding and ran off with harvey br br many episodes involve sabrina getting to meet through natural or supernatural means popular real life musical artists of the time including coolio the violent femmes the backstreet boys phantom planet davy jones of the monkees britney spears avril lavigne daniel bedingfield hanson eden's crush savage garden 'n sync and ashanti course of nature the band of melissa joan hart's then boyfriend now husband mark wilkerson appeared in an episode in 2002
<START> after just having watched the deer hunter which is a masterpiece the movie jacknife had big shoes to fill it has same themes as the deer hunter the devastating effects on a person after the vietnam war robert de niro is in this film as in the deer hunter and is very good here as is kathy baker but this movie belongs to ed harris who gives a powerful emotional and impactful performance the movie is based on a stage play and there are one or two scenes where that felt obvious to me by that i just mean that for those one or two scenes it felt like i was watching a stage play that was not that big a deal and doesn't really diminish the film i actually really liked this movie it's not an epic like the deer hunter they are about similar era and have similar themes but they are two very different films i thought the deer hunter was great and i also think this movie was great it's the acting in this one that makes it so great for me jacknife is a 10 10
<START> i probably doubled my knowledge of iran when i saw secret ballot 2001 now i know about four times as much i doubt i learned a whole heck of a lot from not without my daughter 1991 br br offside is a splendid budget iranian comedy about a group a girls working individually to attend a decisive soccer match for their country's place in the world cup women are not allowed to attend soccer matches so the nation's armed forces have been mobilized to save any women who try to enter from themselves some teen girls try to crash the party by dressing as boys but are caught the movie is mostly set at this holding pen where the girls are detained by soldiers awaiting some unspecified punishment although the girl who dressed as a soldier claims that she was one insignia away from being executed br br the movie explores the absurdity of the situation the thinking that bars women from football matches comes down to it being too raunchy an experience for the fairer sexÂa philosophy not unknown in the west less than 100 years ago this farce comes to a head when a girl needs to go to the bathroom so a soldier escorting her demands that she cover her eyes so she can't see the graffiti the conflict is not entirely about the battle of the sexes at one point some friction arises between a solider who is rural and the girls who are urban br br fortunately this movie was not too culturally esoteric that the comedy was lost on this neighbour and cultural cousin of the great satan you have to be in the mood for it but no one should avoid this movie because they think that they won't get it
<START> this is one of those awful sex driven b movies that couldn't have played anywhere near a theater women run around dressed in scantily clad bunny outfits an extremely fat woman is the brunt of many tasteless jokes and they all work at the restaurant of a dirty old man who has an oddball son jim hanks who is of course tom's brother whom the man wants to get laid hanks is actually sort of good but this movie goes nowhere and has no point one must wonder why it was even made nevertheless because of hank's performance and a few entertaining moments but no more than a few it received a stellar 2 out of 10 i think i was being nice though
<START> jerry spies tom listening to a creepy story on the radio and seizes the opportunity to scare his nemesis br br i didn't find this particular episode that funny the humour seemed rather constrained and the whole set up was kinda lame jerry is essentially the 'bad guy' in this one tormenting poor tom for no particular reason br br there is the occasional flash of inspiration such as tom's literal 'heart in mouth' experience and the moment when his nines lives are sucked out of his body but on the whole this effort lacks the frenetic pacing excellent animation and sheer wit of most of t j's other cartoons
<START> indian directors have it tough they have to compete with movies like laggan where 11 henpecked castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots devdas a hapless fedar festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any one's feelings or sentiments alas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry but to make a good movie you have to tight rope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with split skirts and dishum dishum fights preferably involving a nitwit bollywood leading actor who is marginally handsome so you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of leonine village head who in own words defending his village this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience there are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like nana patekar narasimhan nana patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him meanwhile his daughter is bathing his grandson this is as authentic a scene you can get in rural india nana patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in hindi films the violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with song dances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies won't sell a sad but true state of affairs faster this changes better for bollywood all said and done this is one good movie
<START> i finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it it actually exceeded my expectations considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and well made film the lack of finances actually helped this film in several ways especially given the plot just like the blair witch project this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film another bonus whereas most low budget horror films even the best of the best suffer from mediocre to unintentionally hysterical acting this film actually had a talented cast save one or two characters particularly the two leads the only thing missing from the film was an original storyline it borrows heavily from better known films like deliverance and wrong turn but if you're like me films of this nature never cease to be terrifying plus the director keeps things interesting throughout i'd be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and i have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out
