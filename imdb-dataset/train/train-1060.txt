<START> what a surprise two outstanding performances by the lead actresses in this film this is the best work busy phillips has ever done and the best from erika christensen since traffic this film certainly should be in oscar contention see this movie
<START> believe it or not the woodchipper massacre gave me full blown gonorrhea that's right i've got a rainbow of discharge spewing from me just because a group of kids went playing around with a camcorder and somehow made a deal with the devil and got distribution it's beyond my comprehension how anyone with moderate intelligence could tolerate this pant load of a film the only reason i managed to sit through the whole thing not without several suicide attempts along the way was because well first off i was delirious with boredom and second i guess i wanted to further explore this newly discovered type of hate i was experiencing this movie is a 'shot on video' horror comedy about three siblings who are left for the weekend in the care of their bitchy elderly aunt the youngest kid ends up stabbing the old lady accidentally with his rambo replica hunting knife they then get to dismembering auntie with various tools apparently she didn't have a single drop of blood in her body and heave her into their dad's rented wood chipper her convict son then stops by looking for his mom and the kids end up grinding that jackass too i don't recall ever seeing a cast of annoying actors that actually caused me nausea seriously that one blond chick's voice had me wincing in pain constantly all of the actors were downright atrocious literally just screaming their phony sounding dialog and cracking jokes that must've been written by a chimp that just didn't care now i can usually appreciate independent efforts but only from those who can realize that people other than their relatives might be watching this i don't need to see a 3 minute shot of a car pulling out of a drive way and a torturous painfully long lawn grooming montage with some ridiculous fluttery music playing over it plus why the hell does the box of this movie have a bloody piano on it there was a piano in one scene and no one is killed near it i'm through with reminiscing about this movie unless you like insufferable crap i would advise anyone with half a brain to avoid this trash
<START> pieced edited together from dead body parts deleted scenes from corpses anchorman the frankenstein monster wake up ron burgundy is definitely not a sight for sore eyes something you'd ever want to watch twice maybe even once for that matter br br more often than not the relativity of the scenes in wurb are made relevant by a third person narrator even more troubling is that the characters in wurb are inconsistent with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of anchorman in opening narration we're told wurb takes place shortly after the original at the end of anchorman burgundy had grown since the start of the film and embraced having a hybrid co anchorwoman lover in this film he's back to his immature antics with prank phone calls to veronica quite clearly these are the more of the same scenes from the original anchorman spliced in to wurb br br the part that makes this a movie a continually evolving story involves a bank robbing clan without a cause called the alarm clock these scenes are almost painful to sit through this part was scrapped from the original scripts for anchorman br br the majority of other scenes involving our channel 4 news team are clearly alternate deleted takes on scenes from anchorman they go to the same party as in the original the same original group bitching about having a woman on the team scene and the same cat fashion show segment that veronica had objections to reporting br br burgundy re creates their first date with the drive in spot overlooking san diego and dinner at his favorite club tinos neither character make mention that they've been to the drive in spot before and when burgundy walks into tinos with veronica he introduces it to her as though they've never been before oh and they're wearing the same clothes as on their original date br br still i have to give some credit to the filmmakers even if wurb is nothing more than a clever way of presenting deleted scenes tied together with narration between the two ron burgundy stories this is the weaker one looking back on it it's quite a feat for anchorman to have risen from the ashes of wurb you stay classy imdb thanks for stopping by
<START> as other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last 1 2 hour however before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by kate capshaw who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene she's in connery is fine as is fishbourne but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality and the ending is simply bizarre the film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have thanksgiving dinner so to compensate they added an overloud dramatic score every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration to the point where it becomes laughable if you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see otherwise skip it
<START> at first three words read the book really guys this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of esoteric matters i loved the book and was utterly disappointed of the film it was ludicrous with half a heart and the story bad explained the novel in the first place wasn't meant to focus on an adventure that's only the surroundings in the film the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat additional the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and the elucidation of the events at the end were parsimonious they screwed it up i'll never watch it again
<START> i went into this movie hoping for the best i like wartime musicals in general dick powell and lucille ball did good jobs with their roles however the writers gave them boring dialog the love interest between the two of them was not given any real growth just suddenly it was there i did not think much of the music the best number was the snippet we heard of spike jones with der fuhrer's face the one complete number that spike jones did had little of his great musical comedy pretty tame stuff even with the monkey bert lahr's comedy skits were interminable br br there were parts to enjoy lucille ball was quite a looker and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on screen
<START> i watched this movie after seeing other comments on imdb even convincing my wife that it was a unique horror movie i wanted to like this movie but was unable to br br the love story was good but the horror aspect was quite bad if the story was just about a young man who fell in love with a girl suffering from parasomnia then it would have been a better movie br br the care centre stretched credulity well past the limits in fact it was quite ridiculous the doctor happily ignors privacy laws and professionalism a nurse goes into a room for a routine feeding of a dangerous patient without security escort and drops the tray and runs out of the room screaming for no apparent reason the forensic patient and the film's villain is tied up in a standing position fully clothed apparently for years none of it makes much sense br br the movie even had some actors that i've liked in other things such as the detectives but still i can't recommend this movie
<START> don't mind the soundtrack which is played out by now br br still debra winger is always interesting and while this was an earlier role for her she is quite good as cissy girl from the wrong side of the tracks lived in trailer with bud travolta only to be replaced for a time by city slicker madolyn smith as a rival br br i agree with an earlier review regarding scott glenn he is used for plot only thrown in to the mix to create suspense the story is predictable and contrived br br also even though i am from the east many of us did not like saturday night fever while it had its moments the perpetual stereotypes are beyond criticism at this point br br worth seeing for debra winger she is still so likable and never had that hollywood persona we are subjected to by too many actresses today 7 10
<START> sam mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again if he does he should be arrested on the spot at the very least for petty larceny anybody who pays even a dime to rent any of his garbage should file a claim and be compensated this was innocently my first viewing of his work and it will my last ed wood looks awfully good to me right now br br when i return this piece of crap to the video store i will personally ask that it be taken off the shelf an active supporter of gay cinema i am incensed and angered that this warped exceedingly untalented man child be allowed to distribute and package something like this with a coltish pretty boy on the cover jamie brett gabel who thankfully has no other acting credits in imdb and an interesting synopsis on the back used as bait and then market it as a movie rental trust me this has no place being on any rack anywhere it is simply not a movie in any sense of the word offensive irresponsible junk such as this can only be detrimental to the efforts being made to promote and support gay cinema hell gay rights in general for those tempting to rent this out because of the cover you will be disappointed gabel is not as flattering to look at on film as he is on the cover and he appears once or twice without a shirt that's it instead the homely mroavich inflicts on us his own disgusting sorry looking dough boy nakedness br br this thing he assembled is a reverse vanity project for mraovich both he and his friend michael habousch who i understand puts out similar sleazy garbage are terrible in this mraovich is purposely posing as a complete no talent in all fields desperate to grab onto any loser attention he can for himself he is to be pitied
<START> when i was very young on a local tv station they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on saturdays i saw lots of kung fu movies on weekends i remember lots of them i saw great flicks like crippled masters blind fist of bruce kung fu zombie shaolin drunken monk rage of the master tattoe dragon and five deadly venoms i remember the day clearly me and my dad had just gotten lunch at burger king we were racing home to see what movie it would be this saturday we ran in the house and jumped onto the couch turned on the set and flicked it onto 56 the usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words kung fu saturday over it then under that was the title of the film it said five deadly venoms then the movie began i bit into my burger amused with the pre credit sequence i loved this movie the minute it came on my favorite character was the toad venom the plot was hard to follow at that age but that wasn't what lured me it was the fighting the fights were so amazing i moaned every time a commercial came on and soon the 2 hours of the best movie i have ever seen ended
<START> if you like star wars trek come see where they got all their ideas and cinematic devices it's my top 2 favorite movies of all times other worldly futuristic and psycho thriller the intensity of the root material shakespeare's the tempest is not overshadowed by whizbang gimmickry a la later lucas and just because it was made in 1956 don't assume you can 'see the strings' holding the flying saucer up this was the first movie where you couldn't miracle it was made at a movie scale economics and tastes at the time were stacked heavily against it and director wilcox's previous 'hit' was lassie come home until i looked him up i assumed 'fred wilcox' was a pseudonym for a director who was already or later became famous but at the time didn't want to be associated with sci fi which was strictly a b genre back then this was either a very very visionary production or a very fortuitous 'mistake' on the part of the folks who bankroll hollywood br br there are the massive scale mattes with live action almost microscopically inserted that lucas used extensively there are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotypical 'user interface' computers as they've come to be portrayed much less futuristically in later works star trek's 'transporter' is there visually almost unaltered by roddenberry 10 years later and if the trek wars technobabble turns you off fp's scientific references are not overdone and are all accurate even today the ship set is comprehensive sparklingly realistic as good as anything you've seen since and more convincing than anything 'trek' has done for tv or film we didn't get to spend as much time there as i would have liked br br if you ever wondered how movies got into space so competently watching fp will explain all that it's definitely not 'wagontrain to the stars'
<START> there's something frustrating about watching a movie like 'murder by numers' because somewhere inside that hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out however by the time the credits roll there's no saving it the whole thing is pretty much blown by the cop side of the story where sandra bullock and ben chaplin's homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on although bullock is strong in her role it's not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing ben chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgettable role he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated 'birthday girl' as well as chris penn who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him anyway the plot really isn't even a factor in this movie at all the two teen killers played by ryan gosling and michael pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well it's too bad they weren't in a much better all around film barbet schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker bottom line it's worth a rent if you're a genre fan but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it except maybe on network tv with convenient commercial breaks
<START> warning no plot spoilers ahead but movie spoilers nonetheless my significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all star cast wow very very wrong this movie is an overdone overwrought and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film 15 years after it was shot the copyright date on the box said 2005 yet during the very first flashback sequence i was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early 1960s and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80s early 90s dresses and hairdos it looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film i tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback and therefore supposed to look old but it looked wwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences yet it's a different much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks i was completely confused until i saw in the special features the short film included it was all the flashback sequences shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie it also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up and indeed acting the co worker in the 2005 scenes thus this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old re cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time the shell story shot in 2005 is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60's to his girl that they would meet on the fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005 these new scenes and plot might have been ok except the awful overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichÃ©d action that permeates the new movie don't bother there's a reason why you've never heard of this movie even though it has a well known cast it's terrible
<START> when you typically watch a short film your always afraid that the person creating the film tries to throw too much into it that's not the case with this one a great story about a young girl who's had enough and other worldly forces trying to help make things right br br eric etebari does a wonderful job of representing the spirit of twisted justice and helps to convey the complexities of the blurred line of right and wrong br br both the young girl and the father give great performances in this wonderful short film but eric's performance is definitely the show stealer in this story br br i definitely recommend this film for it's complexity performance and great over all story
<START> sorry everyone i know this is supposed to be an art film but wow they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent this story is too painful to watch the absence of a sound track was brutal the loooonnnnng shots were too long how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking especially when the dialogue is two people complaining i really had a hard time just getting through this film the performances were excellent but how much of that dark sombre uninspired stuff can you take the only thing i liked was maureen stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman and i'm no fan f his either i think anyone who says they enjoyed 1 1 2 hours of this is well lying
<START> so what's the big fuss out of making an indiana jones wannabe when you have an actor who's cast as a fictional dude from adventure storybooks who doesn't want to go out on an adventure whoever wrote the script for jake speed was probably fired but for whatever reasons possible this movie greatly lacks in excitement that doesn't mean it has no action but look on the dark side of the picture this has got to bare no resemblance to indiana jones or other action adventure thrills containing cliffhangers and narrow escapes and jake speed was promoted that way using clever propaganda to make me and several others interested in it besides i've never heard of the guy so who needs his attention
<START> i really enjoyed this film all aspects of the film were top notch including the most important for me anyway the screenplay and the acting this is definitely one of richard widmark's strongest roles he is totally convincing in his performance just out of curiosity imagine how humphrey bogart or robert mitchum might have tackled this role this is my first exposure to jean peter's work that i can remember she impressed so much here that i will definitely be on the lookout for her other work thelma ritter in an unglamourous role deserved the oscar nomination she received for playing the informant this film works on every level the black and white photography is perfectly appropriate and the story hooks the viewer right from the beginning widmark and peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance strongly recommended 9 10
<START> i thought it was a new york located movie wrong it's a little british countryside setting br br i thought it was a comedy wrong it's a drama well up to the last third because after the story becomes totally abracadabrantesque the symbolic word for a french presidential mandate it means close to nonsense even it the motives would like to bring a sincere feeling br br what do i have left maybe a good duo of actress yes i know they are 3 friends but the redhead policewoman is a bit invisible for me the tall doctoress surprises by her punch and mcdowell delivers a fine acting as usual all in delicate soft and almost mute attitude this gentleness puzzles me because as other fine artists or directors the same pattern is repeating over and over in her case it's like whatever the movie it's always the same character defined by her feelings her values who lives infinite different stories i still don't know how to set the limit or the fusion between the artists and the works br br another positive side of this movie is its feminine touch the interesting different points of view the women have each their own way of living even if they are all single it brings a lot of tolerance and learning to witness how a same and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as people br br finally the movie is quite viewable but the great final cuts the desire of a next vision
<START> i saw this film at the london premiere and i have to say i didn't expect much but i did expect something that was at least mildly entertaining br br the original basic instinct was no great film and is still something of a smut classic but it was entertaining i can recall countless times flipping through channels on tv on a late friday or saturday night having come across the movie and finding myself beginning to actually pay attention to it br br however this lame brain waaay belated sequel has nothing is sharon stone still gorgeous well let's put it this way for a 47 year old she's pretty hot is she as beautiful as she was in the original no she also has clearly had plastic surgery on her face and her haircut in this movie is somewhat unappealing she doesn't look as soft or genuine or innocent as she did in the original which is sort of the whole point of being an evil seductress and whatnot br br the rest of the performances range from bad to terrible and michael caton jones a typically safe director one who doesn't always do great work but manages to make worthwhile movies has officially delivered his first true turkey a movie so bad people were laughing at certain moments that were intended to be serious br br i hear the film went through multiple editing sessions and it's very clear from the start nothing makes much sense the whole plot is a cosmic mess and the ending oh my talk about stupid and unbelievable still predictable though i saw gigli i saw son of the mask and although i'm not looking to smear this film i can say with my own authority which you don't have to agree with at all mind you that i prefer both those films over this catastrophic failure br br by the way stone left five minutes before the movie began and people in the theater began throwing things at the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgy type nightclub br br basic instinct 2 basically it stinks too
<START> pecker proves that waters has no intention of changing his tacky ways in his old age a lot of things have changed since waters started making films in the 1960s but 40 years later he is still doing what he wants to do over the years the budget of waters' films has increased considerably this is one of his most recent productions but i was amazed to see that waters still has that trailer park touch edward furlong plays pecker a kid who is obsessed with photography he lives a quite life in baltimore md with his friends and family but pecker attracts the attention of a new york art agent the always watchable lili taylor and his life changes for the worst once again waters makes fun of art fame and heterosexuality it is not among his best films but there are some big belly laughs here memama has the best lines in the film it is consistently clever and funny and has that very queer sensibility that i have come to love in warters' movies
