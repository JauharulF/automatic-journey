<START> i have to say that this was not very exciting but talk about fashion and weird ways to solve a mystery a little too simple nancy drew emma roberts uses imdb that's fantastic i really liked about that part of the movie br br corky josh flitter is however extremely hilarious and ned nickerson max thieriot seemed really hopeless he should have been more angry with her for how she has treated him br br alright this movie is tour and fashion in disguise anyhow i recommend this movie just for summer fun encore nancy just for fun more teen spy movies by emma roberts spymate remember she's becoming good at this tricky detective work
<START> what an awful movie i love monster flicks but i couldn't watch even half of the terrible acting cardboard characters and abysmal special effects there is nothing redeeming about this movie the characters come from either an endless supply of suicidally stupid cannon fodder or else they are vacuous uninspiring sock puppets the plot is formulaic cut and paste standard science run amok drivel even the cgi is horrible you know it's bad when you can't even depend on the movie to provide some good eye candy no surprises here just same old same old this is truly one of the worst films ever made director roger corman should be hung from a lightpost so that children can use him as a pinata
<START> i just saw the movie in theater the movie has very few good points to talk about kareena's beauty and a couple of songs may be thats it the movie is a complete disappointment in all areas anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed even mumbai indians too just now chennai has made it to semi final br br but the worst i feel about the movie is the action scenes now days bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from hollywood but they forget that hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real but unfortunately bollywood directors do not have that much of time they spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie now such too stupid action scenes may work in south as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people but in bollywood this is certainly not going to work all the action scenes i wish i could have forwarded at the end even some chinese people appear from nowhere to beat akshay kumar this is height of stupidity audience is not paying to watch such stupidity i think bollywood now should forget about the action movies they cant make it the last good action i have seen was from ghatak and khiladiyon ka khialdi the current scene in bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me does these people see their movie after completion can't they figure out that the slow motion action which is done using ropes is too unrealistic and childish better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it i just want to go back to amitabh's era where movie like zanjeer and deewar were having thrilling action scenes the sound effect was not very effective in those days but visually it is much better than current era scenes br br this movie now should open the eyes of the bollywood movie directors please don't make any more action movies until you acquire the art of making it realistic

<START> about the worst movie in distribution right now i love zombie movies and saw this in the used rack so i thought why not oh my god a shame to zombie movies and fans to the genre whoever made this movie needs to put away your camcorder and go to film school there are so many gore hounds out there who have put time and effort into their films and they have something that this film doesn't dignity i know it what it takes to make films and i'm sure there was a lot of money and time spent in making meat market but none of that money and time went in to making it good you need actors a script a real camera invest in some books on how to make independent films i don't know how you got a dvd release but whoever did that is either a really good friend or banging their head on the wall in gore films it is quality not quantity the effects are weak i was so angry that this is actually in stores and that i couldn't get my money back please if you have seen this film write here and put an end to shlock i know i'm being very harsh i only had 10 lines so i'm trying to get to the point
<START> this is a movie that demonstrates that mood and music and texture aren't enough to make a good film sure the viewer is treated to numerous fine scenes of los angeles in the thirties i especially liked the view of the trolley approaching the tunnel and the tram rising up the hillside but in a sense this fine cinematography is self defeating because it creates a mood that something's going to happen and nothing does the script too keeps feinting toward some plot or action or trauma and time after time not delivering not even delivering the i assume theme of the movie the characters' essential misfit the lead actors both too pretty for their roles didn't convey any repression or agony and the script didn't expose us to any br br now donald sutherland that's another story his character was so well fashioned so perfectly played that i wanted the camera to follow him
<START> there are no reasons of taking this documentary serious and there are four reasons for that br br 1 the people who made this documentary including the director and the producer are serbs or of serbian origin therefore the criteria of neutrality fails for instance they mentioned that the diaspora croats the so called ustase played a huge part in the fall of yugoslavia but they didn't mention that there were equal serbian organizations as well cetniks for you who aren't that familiar with balkan ww2 history the serbian so called cetniks that were portrayed in the documentary as being so kind that they helped british paratroops during the war well that's only half the truth they were also a fascist monarch group who collaborated with the germans but then switched side when hitler started losing the war it's also ironic that they don't mention the cetnik leader mihajlovic in the documentary a man that is responsible for killing thousands of people and burning hundreds of villages all over bosnia and croatia but they mentioned a certain ante pavelic hm allow me to be just a little suspicious br br 2 most of the people interviewed are to me totally unknown and i've studied this war for a long time who is the old british lady she really hasn't made her homework and they are not even presented by name so they could more or less be anybody maybe someone they took from the street who knows br br 3 in the documentary they talk about kosovo and how the serbs have lived there for ages and therefore it should belong to serbia even though they are a minority well when they mention the serbian dominated part of croatia krajina suddenly the serbs are portrayed as how they have the right to live there because it has been their home for so long fine but what people don't know is that the largest city in krajina knin has great historical importance for the croatian people it was there where one of the most celebrated kings of croatian history zvonimir was crowned and therefore the city has a historical value for croatia the serbs arrived almost 800 years or so later but no the serbs should have krajina and kosovo according to the documentary is that fair to me it looks like double standards of morality from the director plus it is said in the documentary that the croatian constitution didn't have any laws about minority rights this is a lie because it was one of the first laws implemented because of the fact that croatia had a huge serbian minority br br 4 the film mentions a radical croatian paramilitarian leader called glavas or the muslim radical oric they accused them of being a huge reason for the negative development of the war yes they were radicals but if you want to talk about radicals why not also mention the serbian radical paramilitary leaders such as seselj and arkan the flaws are so many that i just presented a few of them just so that people get an overview of the documentary it looks like the people who made this documentary weren't well prepared and didn't have the guts to criticize the serbs because they were afraid that their serbian relatives would slap them or something there aren't that many documentaries out there that are of good quality but the best so far is the death of yugoslavia where all the significant participants of the war are interviewed e g milosevic jovic bulatovic tudman izetbegovic karadzic etc and where you get a whole 5 hour explanation about the fall of yugoslavia and the war br br one other thing i saw a comment on this documentary where the person was frustrated about why the us gave support to a country bosnia that had connections with bin laden during the war well first of all all the countries involved in this conflict had nationalist presidents and because the bosnian muslims didn't have an old ethnic identity previosly they were called muslim croats they had to rely on something else besides nationality to raise the spirit among the people and that was by connecting them to the only thing that they had in common their religion and they took help from the mujahedin because no one else would support them they had to fight the 4 th largest army in europe they needed all the help they could get nationalism is the best way to unite a people during war history has shown us that
<START> one of my sisters friends lent me this game and it is too damn hard it carries the appearance of a kids game but you have to learn how to do tons of intricate moves that require you to twist and turn your hands into all sorts of awkward positions and you have to search seemingly endless levels for 100 notes to improve your 'score' you also have to find these impossibly hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces that require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them and i am only up to stage three maybe if you have no life nad can stay home all the time you might get some enjoyment out of this but otherwise keep away and it is definately not recommended for kids they will pull their hair out within the hour
<START> first love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema the all encompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or worse slightly ridiculous br br lifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and delivers a moving sexy thoroughly engrossing tale of love disaster and possible redemption while tangentially touching on some of the deeper themes in human existence br br the core story is of mathieu 18 a solitary introverted boy who meets cÃ©dric brasher more outgoing but just as lonely while on holiday with his family as the summer warms on they fall in love and when the holidays end decide to live together a year later the relationship ends in catastrophe cÃ©dric cheats on mathieu who distraught tries to take his own life he survives and in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the seaside town where they first met this time cloaked in the chill of winter br br if the tale was told like this it would never have the impact it does much of it is implied all of it happens non sequentially br br the intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective fortunately the three time lines used the summer of love the post suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction are colour coded warm yellows and oranges for the summer an almost frighteningly chill blue for the hospital scenes and warming browns and blues for the winter seaside br br both main actors put in excellent performances though whilst it's a delight to see stÃ©phane rideau cÃ©dric used to his full capacity i'm more used to seeing him under stretched in gael morel's rather limp dramas jÃ©rÃ©mie elkaim mathieu has to be singled out for special mention you can feel his loneliness then his almost incredulous passion then his character crumbling behind a wall of aphasia beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever could br br the themes touched upon are almost classic in french cinema our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling our difficulty in communicating fully the shifting sands of meaningÂ the film's title presque rien almost nothing points to all of these and indeed to one of the key scenes in the film in trying to understand why mathieu attempted to kill himself a psychiatrist asks cÃ©dric if he had ever cheated on himÂ nonÂ enfin ouiÂ une fois mais ce n'Ã©tait rien noÂ well yesÂ once but it was nothing cÃ©dric still loves mathieu Â he brought him to the hospital during the suicide attempt none of which we see and tries desperately to contact him again once he leaves Â but cannot understand that he has lost him forever because something that seemed nothing to him a meaningless affair is everything to mathieu br br whilst the film is darker than the rather unfortunate pierre et gilles poster would suggest it is not without hope we get to see cÃ©dric's slow painful attempts to get back in touch with life first through a cat he adopts then through work in a local bar and finally contact with pierre who may be his next love but here the story ends a teenage passion over within the year another perhaps beginning so what was it almost nothing certainly not when you're living itÂ
<START> ever wanted to eat worms here's a 'documentary' to show you how yeah the kid eats live worms and that's about the most interesting part of the movie br br this movie has been pretty well summed up by previous reviewers as rather boring i'm totally in agreement here the movie just doesn't go anywhere unless you're fond of worm eating this is one movie it's almost impossible to write a spoiler for because nothing much happens br br now on the technical side they should have given that kid a haircut who's he trying to look like anyway bozo the clown it was almost comical i almost expected him to turn into the shaggy dog or something br br and on top of that the kid was way too chunky to ever look hungry should have kept him off the junk food for a couple of weeks before filming br br all in all this movie nearly put me to sleep and my kids could only handle about 15 minutes before they left the scene for something more interesting br br i will admit that the scenery was very impressive and had there been a decent story to go with it it might have made a hit br br it did seem safe enough for kids to watch the bear scenes and the 'oddball' eyeball were too weak to frighten most kids and the brief 'skinny dipping' scene didn't show anything br br i gave this one a very generous 3
<START> this one is tough to watch as an earlier reviewer says that is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after wwii particularly the liberation of dachau it is clear that as of the middle of the war we knew exactly what was happening to the jews the sequence that shows a transport is vivid almost as if based upon an actual newsreel the nazis liked to record their atrocities knox as the nazi is brilliant he charts the course of a nazi career that charting is particularly telling when contrasted with the reactions of other germans at first laughing at hitler then incredulous and finally helpless that contrast however permits us to believe in the conversion of one young nazi officer to an anti nazi stance that did happen as witness the several attempts against hitler most notably the staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out a strong film effectively using flashbacks accurately predicting the nuremburg trails and others that would occur once the war ended
<START> loved the movie i even liked most of the actors in it but for me ms davis' very poor attempt at an accent and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as ms davis they would be laughed off the screen br br i really think she 'phoned this one in' now if it had myrna loy or ingrid bergman playing the part of the wife i would have enjoyed it much more br br i guess i just don't 'get' bette davis i've always thought of her as an actor that 'plays herself' no matter what role she's in the possible exception is now voyager br br i'm sure many of the other reviewers will explain in careful and i hope civil detail how i am totally wrong on this but i'll continue to watch the movies she's in because i like the stories writing supporting casts but i'll always be thinking of different actresses that could have done a better job
<START> there are bad movies terrible movies even boring movies i can watch most and put up until the end not this time avoid this like the plague annoying music throughout terrible editing no comedy its tackier than a novelty mug my missus wanted to watch this thinking it would be legally blonde material or something kind of watchable but never better than average chick flick its the first time she was begging me to push the stop button br br the girls well they were not great to start with denise done ok in starship troopers and wild things but you have sank to the gravel i feel like a mug having spent 30 minutes on this pamela anderson is almost unrecognisable after much construction work to her face br br please take my advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen and brain cells ranting at the utter mince that is on your screen
<START> this is the final episode we deserved at the end of the last season things were left in a 'life goes on' mood which was hardly the wrap up that this realistic series deserved while not a happy show this series was always one that made you think a rare thing on television and this is no exception 'is death justified by reasoning ' 'are morals reflective of society or is society shaped by the morals that are selected by the few in power ' 'what is a just death and can it exist ' all of these questions and more are posed by the writers of this show every week and this is their final thesis fine acting great writing wonderful camera work brilliant editing clean direction if you have seen the series and you missed this when it first ran then get a hold on a copy somehow if you never watched the series when it ran then this will stand up on its own but it may be heavy going trying to keep up with who all the characters are and what they are alluding to in their varied pasts for those of us who were avid viewers of the series in the last two seasons this is very satisfying viewing
<START> its not sophisticated and nobody in the credits had a great career but taken as a whole because there are no famous personalities the film seems more realistic than some high budget well cast films br br a film made for a few bucks that is worthy of watching should give hope to all those would be film makers and wantabee actors br br the problem with this film is it was made in the worst possible time tv was taking over the revenues of the film industry and this film could have easily been shown on tv in 1950 all the fare on tv would qualify for a g rating the film industry began to make more adult films that could not be shown on tv during the days when tv wouldn't dare show the sex and skin of today's commercials
<START> 2002's undeservedly popular i love the 80's is an inane idiotic offensive and downright disgusting pop culture mess of a show that was the first in a long line of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of vh1 which was at one time the only real music oriented channel left on tv i used to practically live on vh1 up until the spring or winter i forget which one now of 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever out of sheer morbid curiosity i'd guess that's what you'd call it i had decided that i would go ahead and give it a look see anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete crap at least i can honestly say that i wasn't a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basement level to begin with the emphasis of this show i found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980's and what was and wasn't culturally significant or popular which is what i was expecting to see but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god awful no name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills rolls eyes more like lack thereof if you ask me it's pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at so called humor that i swear i could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid one liner they shot off one after another altogether i have no problem in saying that i love the 80's was is trash of the lowest denominator and one of the main reasons why i almost never watch vh1 anymore
<START> everybody just seems to be raving about the subject and not really noticing how the movie was made the deaf mute guy is fine the underdog wins that's good the cricket aspect is great but the movie is average overall i think it could be made much much better than it is br br the plot is too predictable for a movie that is not based on a real life event i'm sure the movie could have been made more interesting the songs are just stuffed in there and i had to literally forward the scenes where the same thing would be shown from different angles br br good acting though watchable
<START> i guess it's jack's great empathic ability that makes him the powerful performer that he is but empathy comes at a price like all things when he's surrounded by mediocrity he instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one with it he is a joke as a mafia hit man also because the part doesn't suit him one bit him being so extroverted and just grazing avoids making a fool of himself in this kathleen turner had a much tooooo long career just by being tall and blonde because her acting ability is limited to that thing she does with her eyes when she opens them wide which she's convinced is sooooo damn sexy and anjelica huston is the absolute same granted interesting in everything just like robert loggia br br the movie is a lame draft and this will be the only mention of the rag they call script of a gangster movie with a cast that was probably only interested to get to the after party faster they certainly gathered the party going elite in this what did they shoot it in 1 day cause that would be the only explanation
<START> me and my sister rented this movie because we were in the mood for something trashy and not so demanding to watch however the movie greatly exceeded my very low expectations br br it is so much more than just a representation of a century it has very real portrayals of the characters within it and most of the actors do an amazing job the different stories are baked together with actual footage from the time that gives it a very unique touch while watching it i really felt that i cared about what happened to the characters br br i would also like to give endless amounts of praise to julia stiles in her portrayal of katie she was great in a way that stood out br br i would recommend this movie to anyone
<START> a pretty memorable movie of the animals killing people variety specifically similar to willard in that it stars an aging character actor in this case a step down a bit to the level of les tremayne who puts in the only distinguished performance i've seen him give in a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and who subsequently decides to use his animal friends to exact revenge on those who have wronged him yes this is one of those movies where pretty much everybody is despicable so that you will cheer when they die and really the selection of actors locations etc couldn't be better at giving the film an atmosphere of shabby decadence br br tremayne's character is snakey bender and he is certainly the most interesting thing about the movie an aged snake collector who is obsessed with john philip souza's music when the local preacher clamps down on his practice of collecting small animals from the local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes and his friend gets married to a stripper thus upsetting his ritual wednesday night band concert he goes on the rampage in the process creating a memorable pile up of clunkers beneath the cliff where he dumps the wrecks after disposing of their unfortunate owners one amusing game you can play while watching snakes is to place bets on which cars will land the farthest down the cliff br br all in all very cheap and exploitative but will really be a lot of fun for fans of these kinds of movies
