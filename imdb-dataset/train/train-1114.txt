<START> i loved watching the original azumi with its mix of live action manga compelling storyline cool soundtrack directing kitamura rocks editing and not to mention the beautiful aya ueto who filled the part perfectly so i was really looking forward to seeing azumi 2 but after finally seeing it i felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket azumi 2 picks up where azumi left off however these are completely 2 different movies the pace is a lot slower the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development this was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the toho monster franchise if that is possible i agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity if only ryuhei kitamura continued with this installment there is however some beautiful japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off even the real bad guys get killed off too easily without too much of a fight the fight with the spider guy straight out of an episode of monkey in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene wheras in azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects azumi 2 brought us the azumi cape cam azumi's rampage at the end was unconvincing but aya still does an okay job she looks great in the cape but where did she get it from i don't think i will be watching this one over and over again what a pity
<START> i had the pleasure of seeing this film at the rhode island international film festival and was very impressed tess nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and i would love to see more of her films if she could do what she did with the budget of this film i'm very anxious to see what she can do with a major picture kudos to the cast for their terrific performances that little girl was gold and to whoever composed the music the warped row your boat blew me away very creative film all around i really hope to see it come out on video or dvd because i'd buy it in a second if you get the chance you should definitely see this film
<START> i saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's better than caine believes although it's not much cop britain's greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his playing rex harrison seems even less bothered perhaps unsurprisingly as his character is very poorly written william holden is better but his screen time is fleeting and again his character is not well scripted br br beverly johnson is as beautiful a woman as i have ever seen but is given very little to do the film might have gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story ustinov steals the show but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the film's serious tone the music is poor and omar sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos his career has been based on this for decades now br br richard fleischer has to be blamed for not directing this more effectively he was an infuriatingly unpredictable film director and this is one of his weaker movies
<START> terrible use of scene cuts all continuity is lost either by awful scripting or lethargic direction that villainous robot musta been a jazz dancer also one of the worst sound tracks i've ever heard monologues usually drowned out by music and where'd they get their props that ship looks like a milk carton i did better special effects on 8mm at the age of 13 br br i'd recommend any film student should watch this flick 5 minutes at a time so as to learn how not to produce a film or was it the editors' fault br br it's really too bad because the scenario was actually a good concept just poorly executed all the way around sorry malcom you should have sent a stunt double you're too good an actor for such a stink bomb
<START> painting is seeing then remembering better than you saw so says dick heldar ronald colman the painter in the light that failed the movie is in the grand old hollywood style starring ronald colman and a bravura supporting cast that includes ida lupino in her first important role dependable character actor dudley digges who also co starred with colman in condemned and a solid performance by the wonderful actor walter huston br br the title and opening sequences of the film pretty much give away the fact that dick will lose his sight he's blinded by gun powder discharge as he and childhood sweetheart maisie muriel angelus are playing with a pistol later a wound while fighting in the sudan is the catalyst for his blindness he becomes a famous painter but he's already blinded by ambition and doesn't really reach his full potential until the point that his sight is leaving him enter bad girl bessie ida lupino and his self destruction is set in motion lupino is very powerful in this role and plays off colman very well her evil tart reminds me of bette davis in of human bondage br br well acted and well directed this is one of my favorite colman melodramas
<START> various spoilers follow br br gene kelly not georges guetary who is sometimes criticized for being too young and un french not leslie caron who is sometimes criticized for her very green performance not even oscar levant who more often than not annoys the dickens out of me br br no it would definitely be gene kelly there's something about his screen persona that's too ambitious and focused for him to be convincing as a penniless artist in paris content to put off facing the critics indefinitely frolicking with little kids and old ladies and painting in the streets that's what made him so effective in singin' in the rain and other movies where he played ambitious focused characters jerry mulligan is in some ways a cousin to tommy albright in brigadoon another lerner story with kelly miscast as an american at loose ends who falls in love with a picturesque european place and an innocent female who embodies its virtues br br except that jerry isn't as likeable as even poor dazed tommy that's another galling thing about this film jerry is sometimes a cad to milo and even worse to lise when he first sees the latter at a club he pulls a dirty trick to get her to dance with him when she sits down again he pulls an even dirtier trick to get her phone number when he calls her the next day she hangs up on him which he takes as a cue to drop in at her workplace and throughout all this it's obvious she wants nothing to do with him when she starts laughing at his jokes in the perfume shop it's about as believable as milo's interest in his paintings sure he's good looking and playful but why should that sway her when she's got henri who seems like a gentleman to boot br br admittedly it comes off so distasteful partly because of the actress if a role like lise was played by say judy garland she would shower jerry with indignant insults and glares if she was played by cyd charisse one would admire his guts but when she's played by first timer leslie caron she looks and acts like a shy vulnerable teenager and as a result jerry just seems like a creep and why did they choose these other actors though personally i'd rather they'd solved things by changing the lead when the whole story hinges on the romance of these two young poor sweethearts disentangling themselves from their loveless commitments to older rich people not only is gene kelly a few years above guetary and foch he's old enough to be caron's father br br in short i think it all would have been improved by casting some young comedic relief type dancer as jerry the kind that usually turned up in musical supporting roles e g ray macdonald in good news or bobby van in small town girl maybe not them necessarily but someone like them someone who could have chased lise and made it seem harmlessly playful someone who would have appeared genuinely happy living in that chaplinesque hole in the wall someone whose humor and naivete would have contrasted better with oscar levant's sarcastic grumpiness it probably also would have made the ballet seem less ponderous and it might have provided a voice that could sing gershwin better br br all this may give the impression that i don't like gene kelly i do like him he was terrific in most of his films just not this one well and a few others i don't despise aaip itself either it has good points like the art direction and leslie caron who despite her inexperience is rather charming and really does look like she just stepped out of a painting georges guetary does a fine job and his stairway to paradise is my favorite number in the movie nina foch is beautiful and touching and should have ended up with somebody but not jerry mulligan i wouldn't wish that on her
<START> artistically speaking this is a beautiful movie the cinematography music and costumes are gorgeous in fact this movie is prettier than those directed by akira kurasawa himself in this case he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death br br so as far as the writing goes the dialog was well written and the story at times was interesting however the story was also rather depressing yet uninvolving in some ways after all it's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel it's interesting that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in japan the women still long for a better life this reminds me a lot of the movie streets of shame though streets of shame's characters are a lot less likable and more one dimensional br br so overall it gets a 7 mostly due to everything but the writing it's too bad that the weakest link in this movie is the story by the great kurasawa
<START> this really is an incredible film not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their rightful voice but it also shows the united states up for its dishonesty subterfuge and blatant disregard for human rights and self determination chavez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice these filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything witnessed before br br and in the cross hairs we see the usa once again pulling the strings and blurring all sense of reality it's heart breaking to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the subversion of democracy that we're witnessing is a tool long used by successive american governments and their seemingly blinkered citizens the footage makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of tv or generic footage but an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future truly a moving experience for anyone with a conscience these irish film makers deserve our gratitude long live chavez br br we need to enshrine the notion that each country must be allowed to choose its government and to develop in ways that the majority sees fit first phase in this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are and this documentary does a great job of doing just that
<START> make no mistake maureen o'sullivan is easily the most gorgeous jane ever and there will never be one more gorgeous she is visually stunning that aside it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film this is a great film it not only has the classic tarzan aura but also the feel of the continuing saga we become involved with the two white hunters who search for ivory one of them in love with jane the other a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie history and these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic there is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted however the africans are depicted as individuals and at the end two even become more heroic than the white hunters and stand out as such in fact the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters the finale also is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie the great lion attack has never been duplicated and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction if i left anything out it is because i do not want to soil the picture for those who haven't seen it but it is everything you could want in a movie
<START> an allegation of aggravated sexual assault along with some other unpleasant peccadilloes including improper use of a broom are made against half a dozen or so of the most popular high school jocks in glen ridge new jersey by a mildly retarded student heather matarazzo the investigation and building of the case are handed over to the da's office where ally sheedy and eric stoltz are put in charge br br rumors about the case spread through glen ridge an upper middle class suburb where the jocks are adored by everyone in the community one of their fathers is a police lieutenant nobody believes matarazzo our boys would never take a slut like that down to the basement rape her and subject her to such sexual humiliation the question is whether sheedy and stoltz will ever be able to shape a sufficiently cogent case that they can bring the jocks to trial matarazzo is not an ideal plaintiff she's desperate for love and friendship and that makes it easy for faux friends to mislead her into making false statements a slimy reporter says you can trust me but it turns out the reporter can't be trusted at all another student a very popular girl in school pulls a linda tripp on matarazzo pretending to be her bosom buddy but all the while asking her leading questions about the incident and taping the results as a consequence watching this story unfold is like being on a roller coaster at first it looks like a good case for sheedy and stoltz but then oops the community organizes against the law then it looks good again but then the reporter interferes then that obstacle is no sooner overcome than linda tripp pokes her big nose into the investigation and makes public the tapes that seem to indicate matarazzo was lying well actually she was lying but she was lying to her interrogator in order to please her then that's overcome but matarazzo objects to taking the stand because she doesn't want to be characterized as retarded eric stoltz is fine in the part of the prosecutor i say that for the simple reason that he and i lived in pago pago around the same time i hope he wasn't the kid i had that altercation with at the bar of the seaside club if he was i take back my compliment ally sheedy is a strange actress and hard to characterize she did a marvelous self restrained job in fine art but i didn't sense any particular effort being put into this role which was rather formulaic anyway i mean neither she nor stoltz nor anyone else could give a bravura performance in what's essentially a comic book story br br the producers and director had the good sense to choose heather matarazzo for the role of victim the very worst thing they could have done is cast an ethereally lovely neotenous blond instead matarazzo without being at all ugly looks rather plain and this ordinary quality is complemented by her grooming and make up nor have the writers turned her wistful and gentle she has a temper and is sometimes irritating to listen to which is all for the good br br matarazzo's character is the best drawn in the film the jocks are stereotypes pure evil they think themselves above the law barge in on some nice girl's party in east orange trash the place during a party far worse than la dolce vita's climactic orgy and leave without explanation or apology they deserve to get it in the neck and they do br br i referred to this as a comic book story and that's pretty much what it is it challenges none of our prejudices it reaffirms out belief that the world can be divided into good and evil and we don't have a moment's doubt about who's who what i'm waiting for not really that's just rhetorical is a movie almost exactly like this one and a dozen others but in which the victim is lying in order to get her name and photo in the papers and garner all those sympathy chips from right thinking folk like the rest of us br br the film is based on a true story as are so many others we've all seen and even more fictional features eg the accused some are good some are strictly routine okay fair enough now when do we get to see a film about the tawana brawley case in which the teen aged girl disappeared on a whim for a few days then had her friends strip her tie her up and smear her with dirt so she could claim she'd been abducted and raped by the police now that would be a challenge in a way this one simply is not
<START> i think that this is possibly the funniest movie i have ever seen robert harling's script is near perfect just check out the quotes section on second thought just rent the dvd since it's the delivery that really makes the lines sing br br sally field gives a comic over the top performance like you've never seen from her anywhere else and kevin kline is effortlessly hilarious robert downey jr is typically brilliant and in a very small role kathy najimy is a riot as the beleaguered costumer i was never much of a fan of elisabeth shue but she's great here as the one real person surrounded by a bevy of cartoon characters on the set of the sun also sets that rumbling you feel beneath you is hemingway rolling over in his grave either that or he's laughing really hard br br five stars funny funny funny
<START> here's what i knew about atlantis before watching it br br it's officially disney's first animated sci fi adventure i'm not sure how accurate that is i like to nitpick but it made me curious first time i heard it described br br the preview looked for the most part damn cool evidently it was also too cryptic according to some critics after the fact br br it apparently did so badly that disney said screw it let's re release 'spy kids' br br so with all that said how is the movie br br hella cool br br i'm a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway but atlantis goes all out it's a throwback to all the cgi eye candy shots in beauty and the beast and aladdin so much so that it's almost an effects animator's best of show the characters maybe aren't that memorable except perhaps for the ship's medical officer and the plot's a little dull but this isn't a movie you watch for the plot br br here's a controversy that bothers me the failure as in it only took in like five hundred million or something i know animators who'd kill to see fifteen bucks of that of this movie compared to the popularity of shrek and monsters inc has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation i don't think that's true how do you account for the south park movie what about final fantasy really the story and the artistry is everything not the method i don't know what disney's comeback movie will be like but i don't think they're out of the picture yet
<START> i'm never much for classic films movies like patton going my way how green was my valley the godfather casablanca annie hall gone with the wind lawrence of arabia and citizen kane bore me however i would much rather watch any one of those films 3 469 times while being tied up on a chair than watch an american in paris once in the most luxurious suite ever if i did the latter i'd probably be sleeping the entire time br br the color art direction and the music didn't interest me gershwin or non gershwin the dancing and the singing could help an insomniac fall to sleep the dialogue doesn't match up to singin' in the rain basically this movie is boring the only other film that i fell asleep while watching was butch cassidy and the sundance kid but you can't blame me i only slept 5 minutes the night before br br 1 star 10 too bad we can't give zeroes
<START> i recall seeing this movie as a kid i don't recall where i saw it i must have been around 14 years old i thought the movie was incredible and wished to see it again it came on the kung fu channel once but i missed it i was really bummed it is the best special effects kung fu movie that i've seen to date i highly recommend it and now that i've discovered where to get it i can enjoy it once more and for years to come i also have to check out this return of the venom movie of which some have spoken so highly
<START> when i was told of this movie i thought it would be another chick flick i was wrong this movie sends a powerful message about judging others i was deeply moved everyone i have encountered i have recommended this movie to no one has come back saying it was bad busy also did a great job with her role in this film i don't know much about her acting career but wow they way she pulled off the end of this fill was great br br at the beginning it was a little slow but after she went to the hospital wow the movie picks up again i have no idea why this movie hasn't been spoken of in the movie world my wish would be for this movie to be released again and advertised more because it sends a powerful message in a mere hour and a half
<START> this is a real eye candy a world made of floating islands and flying ancient cities huge monsters whose preferred method of attack is hurling cathedrals at their opponents who can resist that an ancient prophecy a bunch of underdog heroes and a cute princess in search of her hero sounds familiar yes we heard that song before but you will forget that while looking at the spectacular scenery br br this movie is fun to watch while it lasts but after leaving the cinema you'll be longing for a little bit more story br br what is behind the 30 years circle what drove the knight crazy who built all these fabulous monuments castles and cities and why are they falling apart and apart from that one bunch of farmers where are the people really this picture looks so intriguing but it's no lord of the rings
<START> henry a veterinarian paul rudd and his bossy fiancÃ© kate eva longoria are looking over the last minute arrangements for their reception it is the morning of their wedding and kate is in a frenzy giving the caterers an earful about her demands for food presentation but horror of horrors the angel ice sculpture ordered by kate arrives without wings in an ensuing fight with the sculptor the heavy ice maiden falls on kate and sends her to the hereafter now one year later henry's sister arranges for a psychic to tell the young vet that kate would have wanted him to starting dating other ladies and move forward yet the lovely medium ashley lake bell becomes interested in henry herself much to the chagrin of her catering partner jason biggs more importantly kate returns from the other side to create havoc for ashley as she has no intentions of letting another woman get her hands on henry can anything be done to return kate into heaven for good this is an abysmal romantic comedy one of the worst this dedicated fan has ever seen no its not the cast as they try gamely to make things work longoria is beautiful and funny as the overbearing fiancÃ© and bell has an offbeat style and humor that is likewise infectious biggs a funny thespian too is totally wasted as for rudd a very gifted performer see anchorman knocked up or clueless please he tries hardest of all and in truth is the main reason to see this clunker his charm looks and easy wit go a long way in making the film bearable but nothing can turn a mindless script and terrible direction into a winner absolutely nothing so if you are a dyed in the wool fan of romantic comedy think long and hard before you fork over any money for this one even were free tickets to fall into your lap be warned that this movie is a near death experience for those who adore love and laugh cinema
<START> whoever made this movie must have done it as a joke i mean this was the stupidest movie i think i have ever seen a killer snowman terrorizes a small town give me a break love it when he takes off driving the cop car more like a comedy than a horror movie if you want a laugh rent this if you truly want a horror movie stay the hell away from this one
<START> yet again early morning television proves an invaluable resource for films that i otherwise would never have been able to track down at four o'clock in the morning i stumbled out of bed to begin recording 'the informer 1935 ' my fourth film from prolific american director john ford and an excellent one at that set during the irish civil war in 1922 the screenplay was adapted by dudley nichols from the novel of the same name by liam o'flaherty though he was born in the united states and is most renowned for his americana pictures both of ford's parents were irish which explains the director's decision to direct the film victor mclaglen plays gypo nolan a brutish but well meaning ruffian who informs on an old friend frankie mcphillip wallace ford in order to claim the Â£20 reward for his girlfriend katie margot grahame when frankie is killed during his attempted arrest the irish republican army of which both frankie and gypo were members begins to investigate the traitor behind the incident every clue bringing them closer and closer to the real culprit br br meanwhile gypo is plagued with guilt for his friend's untimely death and descends into a bout of heavy drinking that rivals don birnam in 'the lost weekend 1945 ' in its excessiveness as gypo drowns his sorrows in copious volumes of alcohol trapped in a vicious little circle of depression his extravagant spending captures the attention of the investigating ira members for the one time in his life gypo finds himself surrounded by admirers including an amusing j m kerrigan who enthusiastically clap him on the back and christen him king gypo for his physical might however it's obvious that these people feel no affection for the man and are simple showing him attention to exploit him for money the additional Â£20 brought by frankie's death could never buy gypo an assembly of friends Â indeed in a bitter twist of irony the money was only made possible by the betrayal and loss of one of his only good companions a relatively simple fellow gypo could not possibly have fully considered the consequences of his actions and is eventually offered forgiveness on account of his not knowing what he was doing but his foolishness must not go unpunished br br criticism is occasionally levelled at ford's film for its allegedly propagandistic support of a terrorist organisation though this stance obviously depends on one's personal views i certainly don't know enough irish history to pass judgement there's no doubt that the film portrays the irish republican army as selfless dedicated and impartial a proud piece of irish patriotism if i ever saw it however the main theme of the story is that of betrayal driven by intense poverty one ordinary man betrays the confidence of his good friend and comes to deeply regret his actions the tormented gypo is played mainly for pity and victor mclaglen gives a powerful performance that betrays a lifetime of unsatisfying existence culminating in one terrible decision that condemns him to an uneasy death 'the informer' was john ford's first major oscar success winning a total of four awards from six nominations including best actor for mclaglen who snatched the statue from the three way favourites of 'mutiny on the bounty 1935 ' best director and best screenplay for dudley nichols who declined the award due to union disagreements
<START> i entered my first comment on this film almost five years ago then the ideas presented in the movie still seemed mostly fictional if indeed they could ever transpire at all not any longer now the politics society and media in the running man seem very close to home indeed br br consider the following factors which were mostly absent in 1987 the year the running man came out that are present today br br concern with as richard dawson's character damon killian puts it traditional morality check br br entertainment in the form of extreme reality including pain fear and discomfort on the part of contestants check br br cameras everywhere check br br restricted travel for citizens at the whim of the government controlled by a centralized computer system complete with barcoded passports travel passes in the movie and sanctioned under the guise of national security check br br an increased intermingling bordering on incestuous of government and media check br br computer generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real film footage such as the digital matting of ben richards' image onto the stunt double check br br jailing of conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration check br br flagging economy further widening the gulf between the wealthy and not so wealthy increasing numbers of fringe groups reacting to the tightening noose of big government civil unrest brewing just under or at the surface of nearly every sizable public event regardless of its origin or intent check check check br br then again maybe it's just a movie based on a stephen king novella but just to be safe i'm moving to switzerland
